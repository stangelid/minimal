Sun Viking could leave their KAFE open later than 2pm and sale those items.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great spot for a family looking for a moderate priced room on the beach. The rooms were VERY clean. The view was awesome! I have 2 teenage boys and a 2 year old girl and everyone had something to do. Basketball goal was a great plus for my 13 yr old! Only problem I had was that I had to leave too soon. Will definitely go back.</p></li>

It's clean, right on the ocean and the kids love the big slide. I love that it has a gym too. The kids love the snack bar :) . The staff is very friendly and when we needed extra towels they were there within 5 min. Can't wait to get away again soon:)</p></li>

Due to the age of property it wasnt surprising that the slide & elevator broke down during our stay. Would stay again with family. Not the place for a romantic getaway.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we had 3 rooms for all 11 of us in our family. 2 were on the top floor, identical with kitchens and one walked out to indoor pool, an efficiency. These rooms met our needs perfectly. The rooms are definitely dated but clean. We grilled out one night on the grills they provide. Played a lot of volleyball and shuffelboard. Had a wonderful time. Great location. Very child friendly which is what we wanted since we had 4 children under the age of 12 with us. Pools are great!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our 2nd stay with Sun Viking as last year, we found that we really like this place. The kids just love the slide into the pool, the location is nice and so is the beach. Staff is always available if needed and the view from the rooms in the tower section is awesome. We find it a bit on the pricey side but is certainly nice enough to have had us come back a 2nd time. Could use a bit of updating in the decor but this wouldn't be enough for us not to come back again.</p></li>

I and my husband are planing stay there this year again. The hotel is also nice for couples with kids. It is located in front of the beach and has two nice swimming pool (indoor and outside).

Kids agenda every day: pool, indoor pool, beach, hot tub, basketball court, repeat 100 times a day! It was so nice for me to just be able to kick back with a book and let the kids roam. And they found about 5 other kids to hang with as well. I have now promised my two and the two neighbor kids I brought that this will be a tradition. We will be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The atmosphere and pool area is geared toward kids. Great slide in the outdoor pool. This is not an upscale, expensive resort, but our room was VERYclean with new carpet and paint. The bathroom impressed me the most in regards to cleanliness. My only negative is the size of the room. It has a small kitchen but don't think this is a condo. It is really a glorified hotel room. A bit too small really. But for the price, clean and family friendly is a plus. The beds are not comfy but do the job.</p></li>

The rooms are fully equipped with all you need, it's always nice and clean and the staff is fantasticly service minded and happy. Our kids love to ride the waterslide by the outdoor pool, and for the rainy days they have the indoor pool. With just a few steps from the indoor pool area you can enjoy a fantastic trip on the beach. Sun Viking is simply one of the best places to enjoy life in Daytona.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked 2 rooms over Labor Day weekend. From our arrival on, it was a GREAT hotel. I have medical problems and did not book a ground room, the staff was so helpful and moved us to a ground room. Our children loved the slide, complimentary surf boards and sand castle building accessories. The pool attendant was very nice and when we called the front desk to ask if there was a specific restaurant close by, he went above and beyond to find it, even calling me back with directions! Fabulous Stay!!!!</p></li>

My daughter won the sand castle contest and my niece and son really enjoyed getting their faces painted. Waterslide was great fun and indoor pool was a nice retreat from the afternoon rain showers. Kids had a blast at the beach. A definite yes for the kids. The Viking Café was nice but we wish it had remained open for evening snacks.

My daughter just got a job in Florida so we went back since the drug testing facilities was pretty close to Sun Viking. In May, it was pretty empty. We enjoyed the pool and hot tub and a long walk on the beach. They say it is one of the cleanest but I noticed when I was lying in bed that the ceiling fan badly needed cleaning. I think the rooms need some updating but love the location and service at the front desk can't be beat!</p></li>

The kids loved the waterslides at the pool and I had a great time watching them and the ocean with all the dolphins swimming. Daytona is a great town with plenty to keep my children and me busy. The hotel staff was especially helpful with suggestions on the one day that it rained. The were great for helping us find restaurants that me my budget, too. Thank you Sun Viking! We'll be back... I hope soon!</p></li>

The staff is always very friendly, and helpful. Rooms are very clean, fresh towels daily, very friendly housekeeping staff. Viking Kafe has excellent food, although abit pricey ( but they do have daily specials, and they are very resonalbly priced. We would not even consider staying anywhere else while in Daytona. Loooking forward to our 10 day vacation again next year.. We think it is a great place to spent your vacation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I have stayed at Sun Viking Lodge for more than 20 years. We continue to come back because the staff is kind and the rooms are always clean. We definitely enjoyed the new mattresses, they were very comfortable. The furniture is a bit dated, but I didn't go to the beach to spend alot of time in my room! We stayed the first of October, and the hotel was very quiet. We enjoyed the daily bingo, just miss that the cafe wasn't open. The only thing this hotel lacks is a decent fitness room. This a family run hotel that is focused on family & fun.</p></li>

We are the couple who was there in 1979, and decided to come back in 2010. We ran into the same couples that were there in 2009. Had a wonderful time together. We played bingo together and had the coffee clacth together.. We adults acted like children, with getting involved in the blowing bubbles, and even the water baloon toss. We have a deposit for same time, but all of September 2011. Couldn't complain about the weather. In the low 90's, no hurricanes. It is a great family run place. MICHELE AND JOEY Blecha</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our boys, ages 10 and 9, my husband and I had the MOST wonderful experience at this family lodge. The indoor garden pool is beautiful and the outdoor pool, overlooking the ocean and beach, is magnificent. The water slide going into the outdoor pool is a kid favorite. We had a full kitchen and were able to save a lot of money by not going out to eat so much. The Sun Viking Kafe offered a breakfast hard to pass up and our boys got into a "tradition" of having their fries at lunch poolside. We only stayed 4 days and wished we could have stayed longer. I highly recommend this place for anyone with kids or even teens.</p></li>

Since we are Canadians from Québec, we stay for quite a long period of time (at least 15 nights). So we look for great places to stay. Actually, we only have good words for Sun Viking Lodge and the staff. It's a great place to stay. It's a nice family place with many convenient features (pools, free internet, animation, etc). The place is also ideal for a couple like my wife and I, so its obvious that we'll return in the future. The administration staff are nice people and they were very accomodating in our special situation on our last trip. Vacationers from Québec</p></li>

There is a nice pool outdoors, a kiddie pool, indoor pool, cool slide for the kids. There is a nice hotel grill that serves sodas, burgers, & decent breakfast items for a good price. Front desk provided menus for local take out. We stayed in the older part of the hotel, our room had two double beds and a kitchenet. The rooms could really use an update but the particular location of room 102 is excellent, the balcony is on the lower level and lets right out to the pool so while we were traveling with younger kids that was really nice! Service was good.</p></li>

We enjoyed the beautiful indoor garden pool with beautiful waterfall and lovely flowers. The outdoor pool was enjoyable, too. We had fun watching the kids (and grownups) on the waterslide. The hot tub was so relaxing after a day on the beach. Our oceanfront room was nice and clean with a wonderful view of beautiful Daytona Beach. The bed was very comfy and just as nice as our pillowtop at home. Our stay was right after Hurricane Irene and we found some nice shells that washed in. We appreciate that the facility is smoke-free and pet-free. We highly recommend Sun Viking and hope to return next year.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visited with my daughter and her boyfriend (both college students 22 yrs old) and our 3 day stay was amazing. The hotel is not the Ritz Carlton but for us, we do not want the price and the swank. Our room was perfect, very clean and great layout. From check-in and throught our stay the staff was fabulous. They were friendly, professional and helpful. If someone in you party has a birthday or other event they will put it in lights on their marquee. The pool, jacuzzi, grounds, etc. were clean and well maintained. We also really enjoyed the little cafe on the premisis. The home cooked breakfast by the ocean was yummy. We found a diamond that suprised us and we will return many times.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We checked in this hotel and were put off by the smell, uncleanliness and wear and tear of the room. We went down the street to dinner, realized we could get an oceanfront one bedroom deluxe suite at the Wyndham right by the Ocean Walk for 10 dollars more. We checked into the Wyndham and I stayed there with our kids while my husband went and checked out. We had to pay for the night we didn't stay, but it was worth it to stay in a clean, large room with a big full kitchen, washer and dryer and whirlpool tub along with multiple pools and a lazy river to enjoy. I don't know how the Sun Viking Lodge is rated so highly. I felt it was truly old and gross and was mislead by positive reviews.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We try to stay at the Sun Viking once a year. It is almost like being on vacation but still being "home." The staff has little turnover and the same familiar friendly employees are there every year. You really feel like family when you stay at the Sun Viking. The pools are both excellent and the grounds well kept. The efficiency rooms have everything you could want and if you do find anything missing, all you have to do is ask. The Sun Viking is a great place to vacation. Everytime I've tried another Daytona area hotel, I've wished I was at the Sun Viking so I've quit trying other hotels there. There are some places that may be fancier but there is no place you will be treated better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The rooms are huge! Right on the beach. We had a beautiful view and the kitchen is well stocked. It is in serious need of updating. The walls were all scraped and the doors bashed. The exterior is not the best either. The outdoor pool is nice. We had a huge cockroach crawl across the floor at bedtime which totally grossed us out. I also had bites on my ankles from something after my stay there but no one else did so who knows? It is not within walking distance to any shopping or good restaurants. There was an awful racket from something electrical from 0500 on each morning which was annoying. The breakfast is okay but you have to pay for it. We would pick somewhere else for our family.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We took our kids here just about every summer while we lived in Florida . It's a great place for family. We hadn't been there in almost 17 years, our childeren now 25 and 29. But my son and his family now make a yearly trip there as they live in Florida. We moved to North Carolina but met up with my son & family for labor day weekend there. Except for a few changes it was just as we remembered it. The staff was friendly, the rooms were clean, the pools and slide we enjoyed as we had in the past. We could view the ocean from our balcony and watch the sunrise each morning. Took walks on the beach and ate at some very nice restuarants. We all enjoyed our time together and at the Sun Viking Lodge.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a HUGE room overlooking the beach with kitchenette, two double beds and a balcony on the third floor. Although it was an older hotel, it was clean, well-maintained and had beach access as well as an indoor and and an outdoor swimming pool. All staff was friendly and helpful and the rates were definitely reasonable. Loved the Axe and Shield (across the road) for the burgers and Baby Cham on tap. Drawbacks are that there are limited restaurants in the immediate area that you can walk to and the breakfast that they offer at the lodge was expensive and mediocre. We found it best to have some breakfast food readily available in the room since there was a microwave, cookstove and refrigerator.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The staff was very friendly, they let us check in early, too! There were 3 adults and 5 kids in one room, which was a little small for us. We'd definitely need two rooms with a connecting door next time. There just wasn't enough space, but that just forced us to spend all our time at the pools and beach! The 60 foot slide was a blast for the kids and adults. We'd stay there again just for that reason alone. It's right on the beach, so the kids went back and forth all day long. There's a little snack bar with plenty of food choices and prices were good too, right there at the pool. Plenty of bathrooms. A playground for small kids that they loved. All in all, it was a wonderful experience and we will be back!!</p></li>

It's not the Ritz but then neither is my home...and it's better than my home in that the beds are comfy, we can cook our own meals (including barbecue on their gas grills),it has a heated indoor pool, a fun outdoor pool with slide and my favorite is that the suites are right on the beach. Nothing more beautiful than a sunrise over the ocean and a morning walk with on the beach with grandma and a flashlight walk on the beach at night with the kids. Excellent value and responsive staff.

Everyone who works there is very friendly! We ate lunch there everyday & the food was great! The pools were clean & beautiful. The kids loved the slide. There are lots of games for the kids, they had so much fun! We never had any problems with chairs at the pool or parking. This is a great place for familys! We all had a wonderful time & can't wait to come back! Oh and, could someone please tell Darrell (hairwrap guy) Adrianna said "GIRL'S RULE~BOY'S DROOL"!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 3 nights during Bike Week 2012. I have attended Bike Week for many years, but never stayed here. I took a shot based on TripAdvisor reviews. I had a very pleasant experience. From the moment I walked in the office to check-in, until the morning I checked out, the staff was courteous, friendly and helpful. They made you feel welcome. I had a room with a kitchenette. The room was clean and well maintained. While I didn't use the pool, the facility was quite nice. Even with the chaos of Bike Week and lots of motorcycles, the Sun Viking managed the bike parking effectively. They also seem to draw a well-behaved crowd. A lot of places don't manage this well. It was just another indication of how well this place seems to be run. I'll be back !!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I cannot begin to tell how much we love the Sun Viking Lodge. I have been a guest of the Sun Viking since the late 70s, and now I bring my children in hopes that they too will pass on the tradition. It really is a home away from home. The activities for the kids (and adults) are a lot of fun, the pools are great, the waterslide rocks (seriously, I go on it all the time), the rooms are very nice, spacious with a kitchen. The owners have done a great keeping up the place, updating the decor, adding a 2nd building, a sundeck and even adding a small restaurant, but the quaint charm of the place that I have grown to love still remains. I highly recommend the Sun Viking to anyone looking for a wonderful, family oriented Resort with all the amentities of big hotel, but the feel of a cozy inn.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Have stayed here almost every year since I was 15, 45 now!! Now have 2 children 6 and 8, who love this place!! Talk about the waterslide and plalying Bingo all year, thought about going to Myrtle beach next year, 8 yr old begging to return to Daytona and Sun Viking. Myrtle would be a 1 day drive, Daytona 2 days down and 2 back, wasting precious vacation time! Rooms very clean, safe property, friendly staff, the pool attendents remember us from year to year, by name! Actually told us they missed us this year, always go in June, but didn't go until Aug. this yr due to kids school. Pools ALWAYS clear and clean, cafe food good, a little pricey, but sometimes just way easier then going up to room to cook! Kitchen appliances and accessories better equipped then mine at home! Love it, love it!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this location based on the reviews on this site. We arrived Saturday for a night stay....living in Orlando we can go for 1 night. Thank goodness it was for one night only. It was not expecting the Ritz but this is a far cry from reasonable. Not sure how this was rated #6 in all of Daytona. The bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have ever EVER slept in. Worst night sleep ever. EVER. The other guests staying there were...interesting. And seemed to party late into the night when we are attempting sleep in the nightmare of a bed. I will give it a high score for cleanliness, as it was clean. I however, will never ever stay there ever again. Would have been more comfortable sleeping on the floor. And the pool has a 22 person capacity and was well over the limit the entire time we were there. Gross water.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Construction next door completely blocks any ocean view. However, staff was accomodating to change rooms in a separate tower that does have private balconies with good ocean front, or would have checked out. Do not stay in the 2 story building. Ask for the other tower if this is important. Rooms very clean. Pool is deceptively small from looks in brochure, disappointed to say the least, however kids love the slide, although they did not open always at the time indicated in the am. Bingo junkies will like the daily games. Indoor pool too chlorinated, hard to breathe. Next time I visit I'll try to find a better value for my money. Definitely prefer this area of Daytona if you want to avoid the more hectic areas north of there. Do appreciate the hotels policy to try to prevent teenagers from taking over the place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed for an entire week (Spring Break) and it was the first time we had been back in nearly 12 years. Checking in was very smooth and the staff was very nice and friendly (Espically Ramesh) During the week we were there, every single time we encountered a member of the maid staff we were greeted with a hello and a smile. You wont find that at many places. The Viking Kafe is great if you want to get a nice breakfeast or lunch without leaving the hotel. We had both during our stay and the food was great. The lady behind the counter who made the food was also very nice. Also was glad to see that Bingo is still going in the mornings, it is one of the things I look forward to the most while at the hotel. All in All this was a wonderful vacation for our family and we are already making plans to come back again next year.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading all the reviews we decided to stay at Sun Viking Lodge. We rented a 2 room suite with a balcony and kitchen. It feels like a motel. It does have a nice slide in the pool but NOTHING ELSE! The hotel is not as bad as a BEACH! I can say that there is no beach. There are CARs!!! driving on the beach from 9 am to 7 pm. There is no sand. There are no beach chairs on the BEACh. There is no place to put them. The sand is wet and children can't even play with a sand. I was shocked when I saw it after reading all that terrific reviews. May be people spend all day long at the pool? I don't think it is worse staying at the beach front hotel if you don't plan to use the beach. But this beach was the worst I have ever seen!!!! Don't make the same mistake as we did and go to some other place in Florida. Daytona Beach is terrible!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just found this site as we prepare for our visit next month to the Daytona Beach area. We have been staying at the Sun Viking for well over ten years, (at least once each year). We have three daughters ranging from 12-20, and having brought friends, parents, etc., with us several times as well, I can honestly say that no one has voiced one ounce of regret about the Sun Viking. It is absolutely not for folks seeking the glitz, shows, or bar scene of Vegas, for those wanting a healthy dose of sun and sand, it is perfect! In addition to the water slide, we love the Viking Cafe and the daily activities. My daughter's friend joke that they half expect so see Patrick Swayze luking around there because the activities reminded her of the movie, Dirty Dancing. It is close to put put, go carts, and of course the Cow Licks ice cream place down the street.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently stayed for the second time at Sun Viking while returning my son to college in the area. We went down several days early to enjoy the beach and the sun. Last year we stayed ocean front in the large building, which was nice, but this year we stayed on the second floor of the smaller building( trying to be frugal) , we missed the balcony but the accomadations were good. The room was very clean and good size for the three of us, the fridge and microwave came in handy and the daily newspaper is nice. It is only a very short walk to the pools and oceanfront. The little oceanfront cafe is good for a quick breakfast or lunch. The staff was very pleasent and we had no complaints. It was a great deal for an oceanfront property. They have a returning guest rate that is great. Would not hesitate to stay there again, not fancy, but great for a smaller family owned property.</p></li>

I was quite pleased with the helpfulness of the staff and their wonderful attitudes toward the children. Every staff person we encountered was very helpful and friendly. The kids absolutely LOVED the outdoor pool and slide......and boy did they sleep well at night! We had a minor medical situation while there and the manager on duty, Greg, was very attentive and handled the situation with professionalism. We were only there 2 nights but we can't wait to go back. Already starting to plan the next trip there. Just a few words of advice......this is a place that caters to families .....if you prefer not to be around children try another motel. I would not want to book a room here expecting a quiet time around the pool.........But it was exactly what we were looking for with the 4 children. Sharon</p></li>

<li>I would not want to book a room here expecting a quiet time around the pool.........But it was exactly what we were looking for with the 4 children.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a wonderful clean family resort. So relaxing. I had minimal stress for 1 week. Would definitely return. Comfy rooms and respectful staff. The pools were very clean & perfect temperature and I cannot rave enough about the SLIDE-LOVE IT! Thanks for the free gifts upon arrival. We had fun at the beach and the weather really cooperated-BEAUTIFUL! The exercise room/sauna was nice and the hottub was refreshing. Love the privacy when we escaped to the roof top deck. The view from the balcony was great - loved watching the sun rise on the waters. The free newspapers were great also. Was disappointed that my son could not shoot hoops very well due to the area being used for parking. The snack shop access was handy.Loved the fact I could check my email even though i shouldnt have. Glad to have access to the in-room safe. Looking forward to a return visit. Thanks for a great vacation :0)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had reservations in their one bedroom cottage across the street...we choose here after reading high reviews. DO NOT BELIEVE IT....False advertising at its worst!!!!! None of the pictures are accurate. We walked in the very tiny cottage, and it smelled so strong of mold. The love seat (no couch) had dirty cushions, and the roll away bed was strained and filthy. I pulled the cover and sheet back off the mattress of the bed in the room, and found a knat, a spider, and a very fast moving large bug. I refused to stay for more than 5 minutes. They gave us a refund, but the funds were held on in our account for about 5 days before being released. We spent the majority of Saturday (Memorial Day Weekend) looking for a place to stay for our family. We have been taking family vacations for over 15 yrs, and have NEVER experienced anything like this!!!! (by the way, the main "lodge" is nothing more than a run down motel)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Sun Viking Lodge during our last summer vacation. The hotel was very clean, the staff was very kind and hospitable, the pools were nice but overly crowded, the area was safe,... Don't get a poolside room-- they're insanely loud. There wasn't enough parking right by the hotel-- we had to park across the street several times. Other than that, the hotel was wonderful!! We got a free towel when we checked in. Daytona Beach was "dead" when we were there. The only things to do were go to the beach or Daytona Lagoon. I think it would be more fun if you were either an older couple or a young family. The Big Kahuna restaurant was wonderful!!! You should definitely go eat there. A town or so over is a restaurant called Aunt Catfish's. It is even better!! We went to Orlando most days because there wasn't much to do in Daytona. The chocolate factory in Daytona was nice, the lighthouse museum was cool, and the boardwalk was somewhat fun.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed at this hotel 6 times in the last few years. We love the location and the beach, but, the hotel is starting to show its age and is need of some renovations and updating. One of the windows in our room was stuck open, and when my husband tried to close it, the entire bottom part of the window fell out. He was able to fix it, but, the average person would have had trouble. The kitchen area is just run down and sad looking. The shower was a joke. It went from a nice steady stream to a trickle and back again during all of our showers. When my husband said something, he was told it was because the hotel was pretty full and most people were probably showering at the same time. We did have a problem with the bath tub draining and someone came up and fixed it right away. On a positive note, the pools are great, and the waterslide fun. I am crossing my fingers that the updating is done on this hotel before our next trip to Daytona Beach as the location and price can not be beat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When my son was 11, twenty years ago, he saw the basketball hoop at Sun Viking as we rode in our car on the beach. In Daytona, we have never stayed anywhere but Sun Viking Lodge. This past week, we visited with m son's children age 7 and 9. They enjoy Sun Viking just as much as their father did 20 years ago. We visit oonce a year and sometimes twice. We love having the peace and majestic beautiy of the balcony over looking the ocean. We love the activities: Bingo, hula hoops, basketball shootouts. Both pools (one with slide and one screened in with water fall. We love the hot top, shuffle board and of course of the beaach. The rooms are functional(full kitchen) Plan 6 has two t.v.s Second room is awesome with the sleep away couch. There is only one improvement we see: the restaurant by the pool is seasonal- we miss that very much off season. Overall, we are Sun Vikings Fans through and through. We love Daytona because we can drive our van on the beach. Sun Viking We Will Be Back Lynda Micheslon and Claire Noonan</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Another great vacation spent at the Sun Viking Lodge. As the kids get older and can roam about by themselves to the activities, it is even better. The place is safe and the people are great. Pool and waterslide never get old. There is always a staff member close by to help with what ever is needed. We stay Sun-Fri to avoid the weekends which seem to be a little more crowded. The beach was perfect this year. The water was surprisingly very chilly, but refreshing and crystal clear. There are so many places on Daytona beach and they all look great from the outside, but really we have no reason to book anywhere else and take a risk at having a bad experience. The new beds and linens and carpeting in the rooms was a nice welcoming addition as we walked in. One negative was the kitchen in our ocean front efficiency. The stove was very old and needs to be replaced. We actually had the same room this year as last year and remembered that problem. We grill most of the dinners, but the few times we used the stove was a challenge, but we made do. Can't wait until next year.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family has been going here since it's been called the old name. I'm pretty sure this is the BEST family hotel in Daytona. I been going to this hotel for about 6 years now with my family and i'm READY to be back! The rooms are so nice and are always very clean. The indoor garden pool is very relaxing just sitting by the waterfall enjoying the weather, and the outdoor pool is very nice as well , the sixty foot water slide is so fun and is a huge hit! I wish the pool wasn't so crowded! The Viking Kafe is a great addition, we always eat there at least once during our stay! The idea of the wristbands are great, because your pool is such a hit; we probably would get strangers from the beach! I love waking up in the morning and walking on the beach and then relaxing on the Sun Deck (the grassed area with lawn chairs) waiting for the pool to open. The hot tub is nice because it is shaded and it gets you away from the sun for awhile! All together this is a great hotel! And congrats on your TripAdvisor award. Thank you for such nice workers, and greaaat quality! See you in June! :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Started coming to this hotel in 1995 with my Children, now I bring my Grand-Children! We LOVE this place & wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else. Once we didn't have reservations & they only had a room with no view of the ocean. We didn't want that & chose to check out some other hotels, we went back & got the room with no view! The rooms are clean & have everything you need. The Cafe has great food! The people who work there are so friendly! They must love their jobs because, they have been there for a long time. It's like, you are so use to seeing these people if you don't, you wonder about them! Very family friendly, always something for the kids to do. Like the idea of the wrist bands at the pool, that way they know who belongs there. I have an autistic child & they are so nice to him. In the 15 years we have been staying here, we have never had a problem & LOVED our visit! We come from Virginia & stay the weekend before going on to Orlando. I would just love to spent my whole vacation at Sun Viking, but the kids just have to go to Disney! We'll be back in June, can't wait!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned home from a stay at the Sun Viking Lodge and are already talking with the rest of the family about a trip back next year. The waterslide was just as advertised. The staff was friendly and the room was as expected. We stayed 5 nights and ate in four nights. The full kitchen option is the way to go, especially for families with small children. There is a winn dixie and a publix less than a mile away. Shop for the week and leave your car parked.! The gas grills are free and there are plenty to use. The hotel cafe also is a nice break if you want something prepared for you. The prices are very reasonable there. We stayed at larger resorts in the past and found the pool areas very crowded and long waits at the elevators. The Sun Viking is smaller in comparison but still plenty going on. Our kids liked the daily activities as a nice break from the beach and heat. Of course it was July so there was a T-storm almost everyday which put a damper on the day, but never lasted more than 2 hours. Many guests we talked to were frequent visitors, perhaps we will become one as well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We traveled to Daytona Beach on some personal business. We booked four nights at the Sun Viking, looking for a decent, clean, comfy place to stay that had a kitchenette so we didn't have to eat every meal in a restaurant (for the health of our waists as well as our wallets!) I wasn't expecting luxury (thank goodness) but I was really disappointed. Our room was modestly furnished (as expected) and did have a working kitchenette. The room had a really musty smell but we thought a little "airing out" was perhaps in order so we didn't think too much of it. After our first night our eyes were watering and we were having allergy-type runny noses. They'd get better during the day and then after a night in the room they were bad again. I know the hotel is aimed at families but the pools and jacuzzi were so overrun with children that it was really unpleasant for adults. We checked out a day early (sans refund) because we couldn't take the smell, noise, and itchy eyes/runny noses anymore. I also had some type of reaction (detergent, perhaps?) to the sheets and was very itchy on my arms and legs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My children and I and another family decided to drive the short distance (we're from Orlando) to Daytona for a a couple of nights. We chose the Sun Viking principally for the reviews found here and the waterslide. Wow-we were disappointed. We found this hotel to be very dated. While the waterslide was functioning, the basketball hoop was being worked on 2 of the 3 days we were there. Upon entering our room we immediately noticed ants in the bathroom and on the dresser. The odor in the room was an odd mix between cleaning supplies and room freshener. I have never seen a bed that had wrinkled sheets and pieces of white paper in it when you pulled back the bedspread. When we checked out I commented on the way that each guest is required to wear an arm band to get near the pool and was given a very annoyed look and quite a rambling lecture on why I should be happy with their system. All in all-I knew we hadn't booked at the Ritz, but still felt we should of been able to expect a clean room with the few desirable ammenities that were promised actually functioning. I would not stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We drove down from Atlanta and decided to stay in Daytona Beach for one night before heading to a friends wedding in Ocala. My 8 year old daughter loves water so we chose this hotel due to the many positive reviews and the 60' water slide. Sure enough, she had a blast at the outdoor pool and really enjoyed the water slide. We ventured onto the beach where she was able to dig into the sand and look for shells. The only downside to our one day was that it was very windy so it made it difficult to stay warm . We're looking to come back when it's a little warmer and we can stay a longer. When we walked into our room we did notice a slightly musty/humid smell. However, I attributed that to out proximity to the beach. The bath tub also did not drain properly but I made a note on the review sheet provided by the front desk upon check-in. Hopefully, someone will address that. Again, as others have stated, this is not the Ritz, but for a great little spot on the beach, it's a great find! The kitchenette in the room was very convenient and if we were staying longer would have been a huge plus! WI-FI worked really well. Jacuzzi was nice and relaxing!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently had an opportunity to stay at the Sun Viking Lodge over the Labor Day holiday. The staff were all friendly and courteous and made us feel "at home". The rooms were decorated so nicely and we just loved the fact that we had a full kitchen adjacent to the bedroom. Not only did we like the way the room was furnished but everything was really clean and it was large. We usually had breakfast in the room and lunch at the Viking Kafe which is poolside.The food was great. The kids absolutely loved the 60 Ft. waterslide.That was one of the things they looked forward to every day we were there. They alternated between using the outdoor pool and the indoor pool. We also spent time on the Beach. The beach in front of the Sun Viking is absolutely beautiful and was not crowded as the Carolina beaches are during major holidays. The room also had a private balcony and we loved sitting there watching the sun set. The staff at the Sun Viking directed us to two restaurants we especially enjoyed, the Cancun Lagoon and Inlet Harbor Restaurant. The rates were reasonable. We walked away thinking, "what a deal!!" We can't wait to go back . In fact, we wished we lived there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I stayed at the Sun Viking for a long weekend and had a very nice time. The hotel is very clean and the staff exceptionally helpful and friendly. The pools were very clean as were the rooms. The Lodge is remniscent of more of a "motel" with outside room entrances etc. If you are looking for luxury or resort style facilities then the Sun viking isn't for you; However if you are looking for a no frills, inexpensive, clean and safe place to spend the weekend then it's perfect. the rooms are very dated but the cleanliness makes up for it. Beds were mediocre but the room size was fantastic; we are a family of four and had plenty of room without climbing all over eachother. The balcony overlooking the ocean offered breathtaking views. The Cons: Exterior of building and rooms are dated and made me think of a "Wally World" vacation as we pulled up although we were pleasantly surprised. They offer no on site restaurant or food off season; (however there is a Denny's just a short ride up the street); the pool is fairly small (although very well kept). All in all it was a good vacation; nothing really bad to say but I think I'll be looking for a new place next time we are in town.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for my graduation from a local university (I was the crazy person on the beach in my cap and gown if you saw that) I got an excellent last-minute deal and read the previous reviews here on tripadvisor to make my decision. I checked in late and received a room on the first floor of the larger building. Normally I don't like the first floor, but this was perfect for two road-weary people carrying luggage. The room was small but very cozy and clean. The bed was huge and very comfortable. The water took a while to warm up in the shower, but the pressure was good. Cleanliness is very important to me in a hotel, and this place did not disappoint. Great location right on the beach, and seemed safe with many older couples and families. I felt very comfortable there and slept well. Wi-fi worked with no issues. Daytona has a lot of older hotels with their own sort of charm-think neon signs and vintage Vegas-type kitsch. It's really fun, but if you are used to the Ritz-Carlton and Belvedere bringing you your afternoon tea, this is not for you. If you like a good value and a clean room in an excellent location, I recommend this place. I would probably stay here again if I return to Daytona.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I debated booking this hotel as it had mixed reviews regarding the age and some sightings of bugs. I decided to book it based on the family oriented value that seemed to exist. There was 4 adults and 3 children on our trip. The children are 13,6 and 4 years old. We arrived late, around 10pm. The man at the front desk was polite, not too outgoing to say the least. Check in was painless. We stayed on the 6th floor in an room with an efficiency suite directly facing the ocean. Wow! What a great view! The room was satisfactorily clean. It could have used a good cleaning as there were cob webs in the floor corners, but nothing that bothered me at all. I got the privilege of sleeping on the sofa bed. It was quite comfortable. The air conditioning worked great. Thank goodness, as it was like 95deg outside. The efficiency worked out very well. Yes the room is somewhat dated but it didn't bother us. The location and pools and water slide far out weighed the room. We stayed 2 nights. Enjoyed the Ice Cream Social! One thing, we did spot 1 cockroach on the final night. Freaked my Aunt out as she hates bugs. But, we would definitely stay again! Highly recommend this Hotel for all it has to offer for the family!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Went on the spur of the moment and still had a great time at the Sun Viking Lodge. Only stayed one night but it's one the best hotels for families. They had all kinds of activities(Easter egg hunt, balloon toss, etc.) for the kids besides the pools, play area, and the beach. The little cafe makes a quick inexpensive breakfast or lunch. It was Easter Sunday and they had a free cookout for the guests. We unfortunately missed that but they gave us a cute little basket of chocolate eggs when we got there! The kid's loved that! The pools are clean and relaxing; we really love the indoor pool with the waterfall and plantings and the boys love the 60 ft. slide at the outdoor pool. They're both heated but not overly warm. The rooms are always well maintained with plenty of clean towels. The bedding is a little worn but it's clean and comfortable. When I inquired at the desk about finding a certain bank branch, they printed out a listing for me of locations. They have always been welcoming to my family and once you stay, they give you a discount on future visits. **One warning for all Daytona hotels that are on the driving part of Daytona Beach. Be careful going down to play in the surf and sand. This year(2009) there has been a huge increase in auto vs sunbather accidents and it's only April.**</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from an awesome vacation with our three teens - 19, 17, and 15. The kids loved jumping in the waves. We loved that too. It was extremely hot but...no surprise. The Sun Viking in in a really good location on the beach, away from the very commercialized section, closer to the centre of town. We took two adjoining rooms. One had a kitchen and the other had a bar fridge and microwave. That was perfect - the teens had their own room and TV and we had our own room. Having a kitchen is a must with teens. (They also had bbqs that could be signed out. Some would wheel one close to the rooms but most were just kept in an alcove area where there are chairs set up. We ran out of propane and the owners rushed off to have the tank filled. Most would have just had us wait for another bbq to come available.) The rooms were immaculate with nice furniture. The carpets looked like new - no small feet with all the sand that must be tracked in. The desk staff was very nice and accommodating in every way. The cleaning staff was also excellent. The pools were very nice. The outdoor pool was more for kids with a super water slide. I enjoyed the indoor pool or swimming in the ocean. The hot tub was nice and plenty hot...and clean. We are frequent travellers and we will definitely go back to the Viking Lodge.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I had never been on vacation before, and we were planning and saving for this Daytona Trip for about 3 years. I had happened upon the Sun Viking's web page when we started planning the dream, and I visited it every day to check if they were posting their rates for the time of year we were planning to go. As soon as they did, I called, and I spoke to Barbara the owner. She was such a nice lady and after I explained my story she made me a VIP customer right away and gave me a discount on our room!!! When we got there, we checked right in. The room was great, beds were comfy and it was nice to have a full kitchen. Only minor problem was that the large burner was a bit cockeyed but we made it work LOL. The view was breath-taking, and we always had our room cleaned by the very friendly service ladies. The pool with the slide is a huge asset. I trolled the beaches and looked at other hotels and resorts and even the ones that are considered 5 star had no kind of family set up such as this!! And the lady who takes care of the pool, LeVonne, well she was just a doll! I loved chatting with her. She was there to make sure everybody played safe and that all the partrons were happy... Even the service men who had to come in to show me how to work the stove were friendly and chatty! Anyway I loved it and I will be back in two years!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The people of Sun Viking Lodge are doing the right things in trying to keep people wanting to come back. But Daytona Beach city fathers need to listen up. Sun Viking has everything a family would want for a vacation. Great pool area with slide. Beach was clean and the areas by the pools are clean and well appointed. Nice Kafe for breakfast and lunch but no dinner or late night. A playground for the kids and activities everyday for kids of all ages. Now lets talk about Daytona Beach. It is not what it was 20 years ago. Many of the older eating places are gone. The hotels are either gone and replaced by condos or vacant lots. The only amusements are mini golf, the go karts are gone. Half of the gift shops are closed because empty condos don't bring customers. Boardwalk at ocean walk is a joke. Fifteen dollars for 3 peolpe to ride a ferris wheel is not family friendly. I don't know why people would go to the beach to go inside to a movie but really there isn't much else to do other than eat. There is a world famous bandstand there, put on some type of entertainment nightly, even a local signer, but something to bring people in. So back to the Sun Viking. It is a wonderful place to stay, I hope it stays there for many more years. Larry at the front desk great help, and Larry at the pool, two different people ,very interesting to talk too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We're staying here now, and I have to say our whole family LOVES it. This is our first visit, and it won't be our last. When we first pulled in the parking lot, it made me smile to see "IN GOD WE TRUST" on the sign. For that, let me say, 'Thank you'. :). We are staying in the newer buliding and the first room we were given, wasn't big enough. When we asked for a bigger room, we were QUICKLY and nicely accommodated for a small upgrade fee. The gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and nice. The rooms aren't anything really fancy, but we knew that from reading the reviews here and didn't care because we weren't planning on being in our room all day, every day. lol. We've been spending most of our time on the beach and at night, we go to the pools or hot tub. The wi-fi IS a little 'spotty' and it comes and goes, but, again, we're on vacation and haven't spent a lot of time on the Internet. It would be nice if the safes were updated. We lost $1 (it's 50 cents per use) just TRYING to use it. :(. When you pull the key out, it's supposed to lock. BUT if you turn the handle quickly/firmly, it opens. So we didn't leave valuables in the safe. But, no big deal. The view is AMAZING! We can sit on the balcony at night and listen to the waves......VERY relaxing. It's just a few steps---literally---to the beach. It's not crowded at all, which we love. I don't think you'd be disappointed if you stay here. We sure love it. :). Thank you Sun Viking Lodge! The Walker Family</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in Room 102 from March 18 to March 20 for my 14 year olds Spring Break. I also have a 5 year old. We were pleasantly surprised on the location of the room. Literally 5 feet from the pool, ground floor. One of two. The room was spacious and clean and the hotel staff friendly and accomodating. Loved the young Lifeguard there and actually watched him save a child while sitting by the pool that nobody else seemed to notice. He was very good, attentive to the children and helpful. My daughter finally tried out the slide on day 3 and then we couldn't get her off of it!! The only problem we had was that our air conditioner started having issues, loud noises like it was growling. I called the front desk early in the morning of Saturday, day 3 and they said they would send someone immediately to look at it. When I got back from the beach at 5, nothing had been done and it was quite hot. I called again and they only offered for us to change rooms! OMG, we had too much stuff to change rooms! So the third night we suffered in the heat and stuffiness. Mind you it wasn't hot outside but when you cannot open a window it gets stuffy! The next day, our checkout day, we were sitting by the pool and watched while they removed the entire air conditioner unit and replaced it. Now I ask, this took about an hour, as we watched, why couldn't they do that for us on Saturday? Other than that, this hotel really is nice and clean and we will surely return, but I feel they could've been more accomadating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As I read these positive reviews, I'm sure they all paid the higher rate and stayed in an ocean front unit. They have two choices at this hotel, oceanfront or (for a nicer term) dark dreary closet with NO view located in a side unit facing the parking lot. Please plan on lugging your luggage up a flight of stairs (no help offered). A good idea would be to check the room before doing this. While visiting Daytona, I had planned on treating my mother to a few nights on the beach (she lives in Daytona) and chose this hotel for it's location. I did pick the run of the house rate, knowing that it was a slow week and felt we had a good chance of an upgrade. After seeing the room and the beds (my mother sat on one and was poked by a spring) we asked to see an ocean front. We did decide to upgrade, but after agreeing on a price over the hotel phone, we were then told it would be more once in the office. We were already paying a little over $100.00 for this dark closet. We did ask to leave and they did refund our money. They made it clear they decide where people stay with this rate (busy or not) and did not want our business. We found a lovely, clean room (OCEAN FRONT) at the Days Inn up the street. The clerk couldn't have been nicer and even offered to help with our luggage even though they had an elevatore. We stayed in an ocean front at a cost lower than what was offered for the awfull room at the Sun Viking. Days Inn is now owned by Wyndham and have wonderful beds. We had a great time. I just wish I had taken a picture of that room ( Sun Viking) to share........</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We visited the Viking Lodge April 15-22. We were scheduled to arrive on the 14th, but due to some airline problems we arrived a day late. To our suprise when we checked out we were NOT charged for the first night, 4/14. It was a nice bonus expecially since the beginning of our trip was not so great. We lost a day because our flight and when we arrived at the hotel it was 60 degrees with 30mph winds. LUCKILY the Sun Viking has and INDOOR POOL which saved us. It's one of the few places to stay in Daytona with an indoor pool. Each morning the maintinece crew worked outside cleanig the grounds and making sure it was in perfect condition before their guests came out for the day. We had four kids that ranged in age from 2 - 10 and they all loved the outside pool with the slide!! We never had a problem getting chairs around the pool or property. There were plenty to go around. There is also a snack bar that is open for breakfast and lunch. The prices are very reasonable and the food is great!! I must say that the best burger I ate on the entire vacation was from the Viking Kafe. You would never know the hotel was hit by the hurricanes last year. KUDOS to the Viking maintiance crew who did an excellent job putting everything back together in time for our stay. The rooms were clean and the decor was nice. The room with the kitchenett looks larger in the picture than it actually is, but all nine of us spent the majority of our time in there and we were comfotable. All in All we had a great stay at the Viking and I would recommend it. Do not be turned off by the exterior. It look dated, but the rooms are very nice.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am currently staying at the Sun Viking. I am used to staying at higher end hotels so my review reflects that. Given that information, I am perfectly happy at a 3 star as long as is it clean and updated. I also use Tripadvisor as a reference for almost every stay so I must admit I expected to be a little nicer based on its ranking. In Daytona I have stayed at the Homewood Suites Speedway which is new and I loved it but not on the beach. I also stayed at the Plaza for ($85 plus tax/night on priceline) and it was absolutely beautiful but only one pool..not heated and no other fun stuff for kids. Overall I think the Sun Viking is a great plae for kids. I think that for most reviewers the awesome kid experience outwieghs the room experience. I also think they have excellent customer service and are very friendly. They keep the hotel rooms clean and I appreciate that but at this this point it just needs a renovation. The room I stayed in was very outdated. The kitchen literally had plaid green wallpaper from the 70's. The beds, pillows, and sheets are old. The bedspread is the old polyester floral type and there is no blanket...just a white sheet and the polyester bedspread. I don't like to be critical and I really respect the good service and attentivenes that the hotel offers but if you are looking for an updated hotel, you will be dissapointed. If this hotel was renovated, it would probably be perfect for my needs but I must admit, I need a nice updated room to be completely happy even if the other amenities are great. If you don't mind what the actual room looks like then this place is great for a family vacation.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Another Great Vacation at the Viking!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for the fifth year in a row and had another great vacation at the beach and the resort. Some extended family came with us this time which added to the fun. The weather cooperated which makes any beach vacation that much more enjoyable. This place is not crowded at all even when at full capacity it is easy to get around, never a wait at the elevators and can always find a spot by either of the pools. Unlike other places where folks hoard all the chairs and lay their towels down early in the morning, then head back to their room. The families are all friendly and many of them are repeating quests. It is not noisy at all, except for the waterslide screams of course. The slide adds a perfect addition to the pool area. Even as my kids get older, they still love it. The beach this year (first week of August) was tremendous. Clear water, no jellyfish or seaweed. Just a great time to visit. The place is weather beaten in some areas, and is showing its age, but the staff does a great job keeping up with it. There is always staff walking around the grounds, either activities staff or maintenance. All are friendly and will assist with whatever you need. Housekeeping this year was very late in the day. That was a bummer a few times but we made do. The new beds were very comfortable, and we always stay in a room with a full kitchen to cook in, and utilize the BBQ area for grilling dinners as well. This year we went to a Daytona Cubs game for the first time. It was a great night out. The stadium was literally 5 minutes away with plenty of parking. It was a big crowd also for minor league baseball. It was a good break away from the beach for a night. Cannot wait until next summer already!</p></li>
