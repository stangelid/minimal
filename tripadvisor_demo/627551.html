We stayed for 4 nights with our 2 children and loved the hotel. It only has 16 rooms so you get a personal service. Views at breakfast are unforgettable. Definately recommend this hotel to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family of 3 kids and my wife stayed at Ada hotel for 5 days. The Manager Doran and his wife were excellent people. The breakfast was very good. One night my 4 year old had high fever and Doran was kind enough to find a pharmacy that was open at 1 am in the morning and take me in his car to the pharmacy. They make you feel at home and part of their family. I highly recommend this place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here before our cruise and were glad to find out the previous positive reviews were all accurate. Dr. Doggan Sumengen and Eva are gracious hosts and very helpful. The room was clean and very comfortable. Breakfasts were amazing and with a great view of the sea of Marmara. We walked to everything and could not have been more pleased with this stay. We definitely recommend the Ada.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It is conveniently located for all the major attractions. The breakfast on the 5th floor balcony has excellent view of the sea and food is great. It is a little bit awkward to have a jacuzzi outside the bathroom but it works fine after a day's walk in the city. Close the window for the night else it can be quite noisy. The only hotel in our 18- day Euroasia trip allows you to make free international calls.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a single traveler I stayed for one night at this very nice hotel. The room is small, but confortable, very clean, with a wonderful view to the sea. The calling to prayers at 5 AM from a nearby mosque was already expected, but it was short and did not bother at all. Breakfast is very good, served on a terrace with view to the sea. It takes a 5 min walk to get to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. I certainly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

One of the most important things for us was that they had a "house phone" in which we were encouraged to use to call home at no cost to us or to them. We just dialed the phone as if we were in the U.S. That in itself was just fantastic. We could walk to all of the attractions and restaurants. We felt very safe and secure.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Ada was a great hotel for our stay in September 2008.

The location of the hotel makes it extremely accessible for all the Istanbul sights. The only downsides were that our room was quite small and we had no view from our room.

The breakfast is absolutely amazing, serving anything you could dream of!! It's on the top floor of the hotel. The terresse overlooks the mosque and is open all day. It's lovely to watch the sunset.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My friend and I arrived in Istanbul at 2am, but even at that late hour, there was a driver waiting to pick us up and the owner of the hotel was awake to greet us and show us our room. Our room was on the second floor and had spectacular views of the Sea of Marmara. The location is excellent, only blocks from the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and the main tram that takes you all over Istanbul. We enjoyed the wonderful breakfast every morning on the roof top deck with beautiful views. Add in free wifi and free phone calls to the US and it was definitely a great place to stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed her for three nights and were pretty happy with the choice. The hotel is located close to the major sites in old Istanbul (Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, and Topkapi Palace) but also tucked away down a quiet street a few blocks from the water. The room was small but we had a nice view of the water. Breakfast was okay but the terrace provides a great view. There is a computer for guest use in the lobby and there were also several guidebooks available to guests. The owner was very accommodating in terms of helping arrange airport transfers and making dinner reservations.</p></li>

The accommodation was inexpensive and the staff at the hotel, particularly Dr Sumengen, extremely helpful, friendly and hospitable. Breakfast was great - fresh and varied, with fantastic views over the sea. Any questions or problems were immediately addressed. We were also picked up at the airport, which is a wonderful service, especially for people with children. We will be staying there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Ada Hotel for eight days in September 2008-- four at the beginning of our trip and four at the end. We were all very pleased. The location is great and the price is extremely reasonable for the area. The beds and shower are very good. Staff is warm and hospitable and very gracious. English is somewhat limited but this did not pose any problem at all. Breakfast is served on the terrace. The view is fantastic--mosque, Sea of Marmaris, ships in the harbor. We never tired of it. Breakfast includes fruit, fresh and dried; breads and cakes; cereal; meats; cheese; and delicious halvah.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Ada Hotel during the first weekend of February, 2012 and to be honest, I can only echo all of the previous comments on this site. The room (Delux Suite) is a good size and the sea view is very pleasant - it's nice just to watch the boats lining up along the Bosperous. The hotel is very well located - quiet and yet, only a short (and generally level!) walk to key sites in the Old City. Again, as per all other reviews, the staff are very accommodating and friendly and breakfast is ample. In short, I'd highly recommend the Ada Hotel as a convenient and homely base for any trip to Istanbul!</p></li>

We found this room was quite small for our standards. Even though the bed was large and comfortable one side of it was adjusting to the wall. I had to close the window in order to open the closet's door. Still the rooom was very clean, which we appreciated very much. I believe the hotel breakfast could be quite better. If you plan to stay there, it's better to book one of the suites. The staff were very friendly, helpful and polite. Ada is a good small boutique hotel but definitely not #8 in Istanbul.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Ada Hotel in September 2008 for 4 nights. It is fabulous. The room was clean and comfortable, the breakfast was excellent and served on the beautiful terrace with great views. Not all rooms have jacuzzis, however this did not bother us at all. Mr. Dogan is an extremely helpful host. When we had issues booking a bus out of Istanbul he made all the necessary phone calls and helped us. Every time we had a question, he would find out the answer for us, which was much appreciated. The Location of the hotel is amazing. Barely 5 minutes away from the Aya Sofia and the Blue Mosque. We highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Ada is so conveniently located that getting to any of the tourist sites of the sultanahmet area is just an easy walk. Dr Sumengen, the owner makes your stay absolutely pleasant and is willing to help with anything at all. The service is great because he sees to everything personally. The rooms have very comfortable matresses, clean and crisp linen ensuring a good nights sleep. The room and toilets are also very clean. The room size was a bit small and so is the hotel. Breakfast is wholesome and good but a variation on a few days would be welcome. Ada is a bit expensive on a comparison to other hotels but it is a great place to stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Ada Hotel Istanbul for 4 nights, spending long weekend there. I just wish to shortly share this fine experience, and to thank Dr. Dogan for his warm and welcoming way of managing the hotel. Istanbul is a fantastic city, and we had a lot to see. And every night, coming back to Ada- was like coming home! When the spring comes with some more warmth, it will be wonderful for the guests staying at Ada, to have their breakfast at the terrace- overlooking the moscue and the Bospore. I have already recommended Istanbul and Ada Hotel to my friends at work,so there will probably be 6 ladies coming for long weekend in a near future...</p></li>

The room was very spacious, extremely comfortable and we had a magnificent view over the Sea of Marmara. The Hotel is spotless clean, breakfast is served on the rooftop terrace overlooking the Sea of Marmara, a great way to start our day. Dr Dogan and his wife are extremely kind and helpful. We always looked forward to go back to our room after a busy time visiting Istanbul, and this does not happen very often away from home. The Hotel is also perfectly located, right in the middle of the main attractions, but in a very quite charming lane off the main traffic. We'll definitely go back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was outstanding in so many ways. The owners were very helpful and their hospitality showed in the way they welcomed us like family to their hotel and helped us with touring, directions and transportation. The breakfast was delicious and the view from the top of the hotel where breakfast was served was amazing. The location was perfect and allowed us to walk or take public transportation around the city with ease. The rooms were clean and very comfortable and perfect for a family. The call to prayer woke us up in the very early morning in the beginning of our stay but by the end of the visit it was apart of what we liked. Thank you for making our stay so great.</p></li>

Dr. Dogan will help you with EVERYTHING you may need with dedication, currency exchange, places to go, shuttle to any place, maps, directions, recommendations, etc, etc. We left at 3:00 oÂ´clock in the morning and he was awake just to say bye to us!!!.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for four nights at the Ada in a deluxe room with seaview. The room was clean and the view was very lovely, but the room was awkwardly set up and a bit small. The hotel owners are perfectly nice though not quite as friendly as many of the reviews allege, and the breakfast more than met our needs. The room was very, very loud, not because of the call to prayer (which is extremely loud but so lovely it didn't bother us at all), but just because there must not be any insulation at all. Didn't get a single decent night's sleep. Not cheap nor expensive, probably a tad more than it's worth. Free wireless internet was nice! Not a bad place to stay, but I'd imagine there are better.</p></li>

Our room was very comfortable: large double bed, little kitchen with fridge and complimentary tea and coffee, bathroom with bathtub ("bubble" bathtub). Very clean. But the best was the terrace and the gorgeous view over the minars and the sea of Marmara! It was so relaxing and charming to sit there after a day visiting the city, to listen to the Muezzin while watching the boats slowly coming back to the harbour... what a moment. The blue mosque and Haghia Sophia is a mere 10 minutes walk away. The hotel area is very quiet. And last but not least, the hotel manager was very kind and helpful, he made his best to help us out for the rest of our trip.</p></li>

I was even prepared for the morning prayer sounds ;-) The view was beautiful, location really good. What we liked best is the friendly atmosphere of this family-run hotel. The breakfast at the rooftop was great and we were welcomed in such a friendly way, with explanations of the food (of the Turkish food, but there is a lot of choice of European food too) . The day we left we had to get a taxi at 7:00 AM. The manager made sure the taxi arrived in time (he called twice when the taxi was 5 minutes late) but he also personally made sure our breakfast was ready at 6:30AM. Really good service.</p></li>

What could I say : the breakfast is great, you really can eat for the day if you want and the location on the terrasse is wonderful to eat in the morning. The hotel is 10 minutes walk from most things you can see in a week end : Topkapi, Blue Mosquee, Grand Bazaar, and Sainte Sophie and 5 minutes from tramway station. For people who wants to experiment the night life, definitely this is not the right place to stay. But if you want a relaxing stay to wake up early to start visits, then it is the right choice.</p></li>

Close to tram station. Beautiful views from breakfast terrace. Big and comfortable rooms with jaccuzi and attached kitchen to make tea. What really sets it apart is its friendly and very helpful owner . He would help us with everything like calling a cab for us, informing us about the approximate cab fare, making reservation at a nice resturant and a turkish hamam.Would definitely stay again."â€Ž One downside is that the cab drivers from other areas of istanbul could never find it. We always had to get off at the blue mosque then walk(5min) from there which is not bad. -Erum Khalid</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we just spent 5 days in Istanbul, in the ADA Hotel: what a great place!! The owner and his wife are fluent in English, very friendly and helpful: we were picked up at the airport and they arranged for trips and taxis. We had an enormous room with a splendid view of the Sea of Marmara, a jacuzzi, a little kitchen area and a very modern bathroom; also the hotel is eco-friendly in that electricity use is controlled with automatic lights and room keys. Breakfast is breathtaking: it is served on the top floor on a terrace with a ripping view of the Sea and is very generous. The hotel is right in Old Town Istanbul, steps away from the Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia and Topkapi Palace, very convenient, and what an ambiance!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was very central and very clean. The service was excellent and the staff always available and willing to help you with anything. If you wanted something it was always possible! Being a husband and wife team with delightful girls working with them gave this place a special touch. My two little girls still talk about the Ada hotel being the best experience of Istanbul with Havva (wife) playing with them on the computer and hugging and kissing them all the time. Six weeks later they pulled up a photo of her on my phone and both said "Havva" with absolute genuine love in their voices. With the best breakfast in town to top it off, it would be insane for us to go back and stay anywhere else. We will be back!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Ada Hotel for one night as the Stone Hotel, located next door, had overbooked. We stayed in one of the rooms in the basement and it was huge. The room had a massive tv, tea making facility, cutlery, crockery, fridge and even a microwave! The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. In the morning we had breakfast at the hotel and I have to say the view from the breakfast room was amazing. The terrace gave a unique view of the ruined mosque opposite the hotel and the sea. The owner was very pleasant and helpful. He told us about the supermarket (as we needed milk for our toddler) located nearby and told us of places to eat. I have to say we were a little disappointed with ourselves that we hadn't discovered The Ada before.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This 5-day break was my wife's birthday present to me. I selected the hotel from its reviews on here and elsewhere and, despite initial impressions of its location, it met or exceeded all our expectations: Welcoming hosts, immaculate rooms and facilities, good buffet breakfast etc, all as described by the hotel and in reviews. We made good use of the tea/coffee facilities, the breakfast balcony and even the room's jacuzzi. The weather was not kind and it was soooo good to come back to a warm, clean and comfortable room each day, stretch out and watch the news on TV or catch up on our emails. Its location is just a few minute walk from all the shops, cafes and historic sites you could want. If we ever return to Istanbul we would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

We stayed at Ada Istanbul and found the hotel to be perfect for a family stay. Great views from the rooms and the rooftop where a sumptuous breakfast is served. Very friendly host in Dogan who goes out of the way to make us comfortable as well as explain the sights of Istanbul, Location is just about perfect in a quiet area of the old city but yet within walking distance of the main attractions like Blue Mosque, Aya Sophia, Grand Bazaar + the tram station is just nearby. One can take the tram to get to modern city areas of Taksim or the cruise stations within 10-15 minutes. We loved the place and would highly recommend to anyone visiting Istanbul. Sachin</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A lovely small hotel in quiet residential neighborhood just around the corner from all the major sights of the old town (Blue Mosque, Bazaar, etc.). Views of the Sea of Marmara from some of the rooms. Just renovated in the last couple of years, so modern, clean and very functional, though fairly spartan in decor. The proprietor is a retired professor who seems to work 24 hours a day, always there to open the front door personally, helpful with advice, directions, further travel arrangements. The only surprise was being woken abruptly the first night at 4am by the call to prayer from the mosque situated right next (and scenically) to the hotel, so if you don't want this, sleep with your window closed. For us, just added to the atmosphere. Would stay there again in a heartbeat.</p></li>

We stayed here on 2 occasions and when we went back the second time it was like going home. The Dr and his wife and daughter could not be more helpful or hospitable and always accommodated our change of dates, rooms etc with patience and grace. The location is really convenient but quiet, except of course for the mosque but you get used to this. All the Doctor's recommendations for restaurants were excellent and we were very sad to leave. The breakfast is also delicious with different things every day and the setting for this, looking over the water, is lovely. There is also plunger Starbuck's coffee at breakfast which was much appreciated. Staying here really made our time in Istanbul and we wil certainly be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is not exactly a criticism but the hotel is somewhat more eccentric than reviews led me to believe and this might not be what everyone is looking for in a hotel. The owner's insistence on showing guests how every little thing in the room works (volume control on the TV remote, for instance) means that guests wanting to check-in or out were often left waiting a long time. Also, there was only one small plunger of coffee for all the guests which was refreshed irregularly so out of four days I only got to have coffee with my breakfast once. Finally, the daily cleaning of the room was not great and unfortunately the room was left with a strong body-odour smell. Don't get me wrong, it's a great hotel in a great location, but perhaps not as professionally run as you might expect/want.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Believe all the reviews here! This is the loveliest, friendliest and most welcoming hotel my husband and I have ever stayed in. The owners, Dr Dogan and his wife (sorry, I don't know her name) live in and run the hotel and are extremely warm and helpful. They helped us with everything, suggesting restaurants, arranging food takeout (delivered to our room from various Turkish restaurants), taxis, whatever we wanted. And lots of tips on buying carpets and so on (oh, and arranged all the shipping for us and negotiated the price). We couldn't have asked for more. The hotel is in a perfect location as well, close to all the tourist sights and many shops and the Grand Bazaar. And with a view of the sea. The breakfast was lovely, and the room was very nice too. I would recommend this hotel to anyone I know - you won't be disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In one word, "Perfect." The Ada Hotel is one of those hotels you think cannot exist anymore. It has a charming ambiance, beautiful location, sumptuous amenities, and an innkeeper and wife who are kind and sincere. Oh, did I mention location? My wife and I just completed a 23-day tour to Turkey. We began (4 days) and ended (3 days) or vacation tour at the Ada in Istanbul. As such, it was a perfect beginning and ending to our vacation. We were in very close proximity to all major sites in the Istanbul area (Sultanahmet, Serglio Point and the Bazaar Quarter) where you can easily occupy a week's time touring. We looked at other hotels in the area (by stopping in) to reassure ourselves our thinking was correct about the Ada. None compete with the Ada and its comfortable accomadations! You want to stay here during your stay in Istanbul.</p></li>

<li>We began (4 days) and ended (3 days) or vacation tour at the Ada in Istanbul.</br></br></li>
<li>As such, it was a perfect beginning and ending to our vacation.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Attached is a photo of the view from our room, which is glorious as you can see. I am staying there with my college dauther, and everything is good. The room we have is big for the standards of small hotels like this one, I mean that you can move inside the room without stumble with furniture, it has a confortable double sofa, also a jacuzzi, and the view is priceless. The hotel has been completely refurbished two years ago with taste and details. Breakfast buffet is great, with assorted fruits, cereals, salads, eggs, cheese, pastry, etc. Wifi is free in every room, which is becoming more and more important for independent travellers, there is also a laptop in the hall for those who doesn't carry one. Americans are more than happy with free calls to the States and Canada with an american direct phone. You can talk hours free of charge!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked a triple room, and were given a double with a smaller (dressing?) room which had a single bed in it. My son (12) loved this as it gave him some privacy. Neither of the rooms were spacious, however they were well-equipped and spotless. The bed was very comfortable with a super-comfy duvet. The breakfasts were varied, and the view from the rooftop was great - though Istanbul is a city of great views. Free WiFi was useful, to be able to check the weather and local exhibitions from the comfort of our room. The hotel has a friendly, family-run feel, and the owners can provide as much or as little information as you require. There are neighbourhood cafes and restaurants just around the corner, and the major sights and the tram stops are within a 10 minute walk. I'd recommend this to pretty much anyone as a good base for exploring Istanbul.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ada hotel was exceeded my expectations. The location is a 5 min walk to the Blue Mosque (and you don't need to be a mountain climber to get there, like some hotels). The views from the roof terrace, and many of the rooms,were spectacular. An almost unobstructed view of the sea of marmara (the obstruction is a beautiful Byzantine era church/mosque ruins across the street that are lovely in themselves). The service is great. The couple that owns the hotel, a retired professor and teacher, are kind and helpful and cetainly make you feel at home. The rooms were immaculate. They were clean and modern and had many modern conveniences (from large flat screen TVs to big whirlpool tubs). My wife and I were so pleased, we decided to return at the end of our travels around Turkey for a second stay. We figured that we couldn't find a better value in all Istanbul.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in late June. Everything about this hotel was perfect for us!! Upon arrival we were upgraded to a room with gorgeous view and a jacuzzi (if we go back i would definitely pay the extra for the nicer room). The rooms are super clean, spacious and bright. The hotel is in a great location- within easy walking distance to most of the historical sights, the grand bazar, the spice market and plenty of restaurants. Breakfast is served on the rooftop terrace each morning and I have to say it was one of my favourite things about this hotel. Gorgeous view accompanied by delicious food! Finally, I must mention the hotel staff. The husband and wife owners were just so good to us. Really warm and helpful and we couldnt have asked for better hospitality. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay! I would absolutely recommend this hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I travelled with my family, five in total. The hotel is unique in that the rooms are adjoining so that any number of people can travel together . If travelling with children the rooms can be side by side with adjoining doors. There are also rooms with suite so that 2 rooms can be off the living room. Neat! Dogan,the owner is also a well-known and very knowlegeable travel agent. He was very patient. We went armed with our copy of the Lonely Planet and we got him to arrange our tour to Cappodocia as well as Pamukkale at a very reasonable price. The hotel price includes breakfast which is sumptuous and sportsa terrace overlooking a historic mosque as well as a brilliant view of the Marmara Sea. We would definitely stay here again. Bravo Dugan! We are airline employees so we will recommend the hotel to our friends. Audrey, Ann, Rachael and Michele your friends in Canada</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved this place! I stayed here overnight en route to the USA from West Africa. The Ada hotel was the perfect place to enjoy Istanbul. I loved it so much, I will stay there again next week on the way back to Africa. The family was incredibly kind and helpful. The hotel itself was beautiful, cosy and clean. I loved the in-room jacuzzi tub and incredible breakfast (even though I had to dash to the airport). I look very forward to returning in a few days. I highly recommend this hotel. The location is convenient, nestled in a quiet side street. The view to the mosque next door is wonderful. There is also free access to hotel computer (they are Mac users, hooray!) and allow you to make free calls to the USA and Canada. Can't beat that. I have virtually no complaints whatsoever about the Ada Hotel and will go back every time I'm in Istanbul. Thanks again for a wonderful stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After all the great reviews we had read about Hotel Ada, we had high expectations, and we were not disappointed! From the moment we jumped out of our taxi at the hotel (with a driver demanding an outrageous off-the-meter price for a 10 minute ride), Dr. Dogan rescued us immediately by rebuking the driver in Turkish and bringing the fare down dramatically. He and his wife are delightful, soft-spoken, friendly former teachers who went out of their way to make us comfortable and happy. Our room was great, and the rooftop breakfast buffet was a real treat (eggs, cereals, toast, olives, feta cheese, dried apricots, figs, yogurt, halvah, baklava, you name it). Free phone calls to the U.S. worked just fine. The hotel's location is terrific for access to the best tourist sites and we had absolutely no complaints about our stay but for a bed that was ultra-firm. We'd love to return there some day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in Ada Hotel 4 nights in March of this year with a friend. We lived in the suite on the second floor (room 303) which was very clean, spacious, with a nice bed and an amazing view of the old city and the Bosphorus. Overall, the hotel's service was top-notch. The owner (an older gentlemen) was very helpful and flexible. The staff were also very friendly and quick. Breakfast left me wishing I could stay more - it was that good! A special mention should be given to the location - it is a walking distance from virtually everything you would want to see in the old city on your first couple of trips. A tram stop is a 5 minute walk away in case you want to go to Taksim and Pera. We did just that: went to Taksim by tram and walked all the way back to the hotel. We also arranged with the hotel for a taxi transfer from/to the airport. It cost 20EU one way. Very convenient. To sum up, a great experience worth repeating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our trip around Turkey meant we started and finished in Istanbul. On our arrival we landed at the Ada Hotel and were able to scope it out for the finish of our trip, where we would have a party of 8. This little hotel is in a great location and has a very scenic rooftop breakfast area. This was our first exposure to Istanbul and what better way to see the Marmaris Sea side of the old city from our rooftop location. It is easy walking to all the main locations and we found it quite easy to find our way around and back to the hotel. We did have a basic room on our first visit but got room 303 on our return, which was bigger and had nicer views. It is close to the mini Sophia, which means that the call to prayer is quite loud...:-) I had never heard it before but became quite used to it. Of the 5 calls, the only one that really affects you is the 6am blast but it happens all over the city, so hard to avoid. Would go back there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our first trip to Istanbul and we had a wonderful time staying at Ada Hotel for the 8 days we were there. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the daily breakfast buffet spread was homecooked and delicious, we especially loved the crepes. Not enough can be said about the location of the hotel, it is less than 5 minutes from the Hippodrome and Blue Mosque and less than 10 minutes from the Hagia Sophia. There is a tram station in the heart of Sultanahmet which is walking distance from the hotel so it is convenient if you need to travel to other parts of Istanbul. What made the stay even more pleasant was the hospitality of the owners, Dr Dogan and his wife. They made sure that all our queries were answered and they regularly asked how we were doing and whether we were enjoying our stay. Overall, it is a wonderful hotel, and it is highly recommended. We would not hesitate to return to Ada Hotel should we ever visit Istanbul again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at Ada for three nights and had a wonderful experience. The hotel has a fantastic location within very close walking distance to the major tourist sights, Blue Mosque, St. Sophia etch. When we arrived we they upgraded our room free of charge and it had a lovely view of the sea. The staff were always extremely helpful in helping us find a hammam, they bought tickets to various tours for us and were always extremely friendly. Our first morning we woke up after breakfast was finished but they insisted that they still fix us something (the rooftop where you eat is fantastic.) The only odd thing that happened was that the cost per night was in Euros and not Lira so the stay was a bit more expensive than we thought it would be. However, we noticed this in many places in Istanbul. We quickly learned to ask how whether things were priced in Euros or Lira. But again, it was a great stay in a wonderful room with wonderful service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I had the pleasure of staying at the Ada Hotel, Istanbul in early May, 2011, and I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Istanbul. The hotel is conveniently located in the Sultanahmet area and is a short walk to many sights of interest. The owners, Dr. Dogan and Hanna are gracious hosts and went out of their way to ensure that our stay was memorable. Their recommendations for restaurants, a Turkish bath/massage, shopping, sightseeing, etc.,were excellent, and the hotel seems to be their labour of love. Our good-sized room with Jacuzzi overlooked a mosque and the Bosphorous. Given the reports I had read that the Sultanahmet area was noisy, our room was surprisingly quiet (aside from the early morning call to prayer). This is a great place to serve as a base for exploring Istanbul. In addition, the owners operate a travel agency and will book tours and make arrangements to visit other parts of Turkey. We'd love to go back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This lovely hotel is a wonderful place to spend some days in beautiful Istanbul. It's situated in the very center of the old town (Sultanahmet), it's quiet (of course, there is a muezzin calling believers to pray every early morning, but this is part of Istanbul's soundscape) and the rooms are very clean and comfortable - the one we booked even had a jacuzzi with a great view on the marmara sea. Breakfast is served at the top of the house with the same amazing view! It offers an opulent selection of turkish dishes and continental breakfast components - you can easily combine your beloved MÃ¼esli with some exotic aubergine dishes, sausages or omelets. The owners and their staff are very friendly - and when I forgot my keys in the hotel safe they sent them immediately to my address and I had them again some three days later! I can really recommend to spend a weekend here - if I come to Istanbul again with my husband, we will definitely stay here again! February 2012</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our second stay at Ada. The hotel is five years old and we stayed here four years ago. We were promptly collected at the airport and checked in Saturday evening. On Monday, after the weekend guests had left, the host offered to upgrade our room at no additional charge. We could have the kitchenette in the basement with its own outside door or a seaview room. We chose the kitchenette. The breakfast room is on the roof and faces the sea. The breakfast spread is incredible and ranges from sweet to savory with various egg and salad dishes. Fruits range from fresh to dried and there are several kinds of cheese. I dare you to say you can't find anything to please your palate. The WIFI has a strong signal and while I did not use it, there is a phone at the front desk for free calls to the US. The room was cleaned thoroughly every day. We would have stayed here last year, but it was full for the week we wanted. So this year I made my reservation earlier. See you next year.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I will begin by stating how impressed I was with the kindness and conscientiousness of the proprietors, Dr. Dogan Sumengen and his wife. They went to great lengths to make us feel welcome and assist in any of our needs as tourists. My adult daughter and I were in Istanbul for one week and originally had made reservations with a hotel that did not meet our expectations. We went on Rick Steves' web page and found a recommendation to Hotel Ada and called in the morning of our second day and within 3 hours we were at Hotel Ada and checked in for the week. The hotel and room were beautiful, with our room not only overlooking the Bosphorus Strait, but with a personal jacuzzi. The breakfast, included with room, was delicious. The service was excellent. Dr. Sumergen arranged a last minute tour for us that included bus and plane transportation, hotel room, transfers and English speaking tour guides. Every detail was attended to and went off with a hitch. I highly recommend this hotel..</p></li>

Apart from this, the location of the hotel is superb, the service extremely good, everything was clean ( they cleaned the room every day) and a good breakfast-buffet is served on a terrace with a marvellous view.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Ada Hotel for 8 nights this past December. We can highly recommend the Ada for the following reasons: 1) It is small (<20 rooms), tastefully decorated, clean and cared for with pride by the owner. 2) The owner, Dr. Dogan Sumengen, works everyday and is a wonderful and helpful man. He alone will make your stay a pleasant one as he is always willing to provide helpful advise and arrange excursions and reservations. 3) The Ada is ideally located. The neighbourhood is quiet but you are less than a 10 minute walk to all major attractions. i.e the Blue Mosque is 2 blocks away 4) Our room was a suite and worth the extra cost. The windows in our room provided a spectacular view of the Marmara Sea. A jacuzzi tub was strategically located to allow you to enjoy the view after a long day of sightseeing. 5) The breakfasts had a healthy selection of choices and were served on the top floor , again with a wonderful view. In summary we enjoyed our stay at the Ada and hope to return to sample more of Dr. Dogan's hospitality.</p></li>

All that has been written is so true!The hotel is located very close, within walking distance to the main sites in Sultanahmet. We were given a suite facing the sea of Marmara. The view was perfect! Rooms very large, clean, tastefully decorated. bathrooms were equipped with modern fittings, and jacuzzi in all rooms!The owner, Dr Gohan and his beautiful wife, Eva made us feel like we were home. Breakfast in the morning was delicious.! From the rooftop, the view of Marmara sea was great , while having breakfast. Dr Gohan helped us arrange our tour, and gave us some great shopping tips. Thank you Dr!. There is a laptop that guests can use, with free internet. And also one can make free phone calls to USA and Canada, which i think was fantastic!There is really nothing to complain about this hotel. We will definitely want to stay at the Ada hotel again if we plan to visit Istanbul. Ummi Adamjee</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at this hotel because we were looking for something quiet that was close to the sights that we wanted to see. The hotel was everything that we were looking for. We had booked a standard room, which did not include a view. This was fine with us, since we were only there to sleep. And you can get a good view when you have breakfast. Because it was November, we did not need to open the windows or have the air conditioning on. Since our room only have a view of another building there wasn't any road noise. We actually stayed here twice, at the beginning of our trip and at the end of out trip. Since we were flying in and out of Istanbul to the US. We were upgraded to a view room on our second stay. The view was nice. Only slightly more noisy because of the occasional car but nothing I couldn't sleep thought. This hotel was clean, very close to all the sights in SaltanAmed and the owner of the hotel was very nice. He accomodated the requests that I had given when booking this room. This hotel was the most expensive hotel that we stayed during our trip in Turkey, but worth it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Dr. Dogan Sumengen is the gracious host of the family-run Ada Hotel Istabul. During our recent trip to Turkey, we stayed at the Ada Hotel twice for a total of seven nights. Dr. Sumengen was always available to help us with our requests, whether calling a reliable cab, making arrangements for transportation to the airport, answering our questions about the impact of the volcanic eruption on Turkish flights, or providing directions to sights in the area. We enjoyed an exceptionally clean, comfortable, and spacious room. The complimentary breakfast offered by the hotel is excellent with a variety of dishes. The hotel has the amenities you would expect, such as Wi-Fi and flat screen TVs, but it also offers an unexpected amenity--free telephone service to the United States which came in very handy when our ATM card did not initially work. The hotel is located only a few blocks from the Hippodrome and the Blue Mosque and is across the street from a beautiful 16th century mosque designed by Sinan. Its location is its one disadvantage--the morning call to prayer can easily be heard! Regardless, this hotel has our highest recommendation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from a four day stay at the Ada Hotel Istanbul, they exceeded our every expectation. Firstly, our flight was three hours late and when we finally emerged from the arrivals gate, we were overjoyed to see their representative there waiting for us. Secondly, when I paid the bill it was calculated at the current days bank exchange rate for US$. Due to the currency fluctuations this actually lowered my bill by US$13.00, not much, but in principle it's not often that you encounter such a degree of fairness in any type of transaction. Furthermore, the warmth conveyed toward the guests made us feel as if we were truly at home. The breakfast had a large variety of offerings to satisfy both kids and adults alike. The hotel accomodated our family of two adults and three teenagers very well, it was very safe, it was spotless and the view from the roof was awe inspiring. They even offered free calls to the US and Canada, unbelievable! It is also very conveniently located and within walking distances of many of the areas attractions. I would definitely stay here again and would not hesitate in recommending the hotel to anyone visiting Istanbul.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Ada hotel for three nights, and the hotel was ok but not more. We had quite high expectations after having read all the nice reviews, and though it was a quite nice hotel the value for money was not excellent. For the price we paid we would have expected something a bit more exclusive. The positive things: - Friendly and helpful staff. - The airport pickup worked out really fine. - The view from the room over the sea was nice. - The jacuzzi in front of the window (only in some rooms). - The view from the roof when eating breakfast. - Fridge and microwave in the room. - Free wireless internet (though a bit unstable at times) What we liked a bit less: - The breakfast could have been a little more varied and a bit more nourishing (this might be a cultural difference, I like to eat quite a lot in the morning :-) - The location is really good for visiting the Blue mosque and Hagia Sofia. However there are not a lot of restaurants in the area. If we go back we would probably stay in the Taksim-TÃ¼nnel area with more restaurants, and then we would go by tramway during the day to Sultanhamet to visit the touristic sites. - The bathroom was a bit plastic. - Value for money was so and so...</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at Ada Hotel for four nights and absolutely loved the little hotel run very professionally by Dr. Dogan and his wife. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the hotel that our room had been upgraded (for the same price) due to the non-arrival of a full group of guests. The room was very clean and had a very nice view of the Marmara Sea - the jacuzzi in the room was a bonus. Our room was very spacious with ample closet space and plenty of room to move around - it was also very bright as it had a big window facing the sea and the sun was shining for most of our stay. The bathroom was spacious and very clean. Breakfast at the hotel rooftop was scrumptious and it was made even better due to fabulous views of the sea and mosque - the crepes and cheeses are highly recommended. Dr. Dogan and his wife were very helpful when we were planning our day trips in the city and had great recommendations and offered useful advice/local tips. All in all, we had a great first experience of Istanbul and would definitely stay at Ada next time we visit and probably have our parents/family come with us too. Oh and Dr. Dogan and his wife gave us really cute gifts when we were departing the hotel - they were great !</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Ada is a lovely family-run hotel located minutes from the sights in Sultanahmet, including Haghia Sophia and Blue Mosque. Unfortunately, the taxi we picked up at the airport was unable to locate either the Ada, or the hotel of the random tourist with whom we were required to share the taxi. I would recommend contacting the kind and helpful proprietor of the Ada directly, even if you book through a third-party site like Venere as we did, to request transportation to be arranged. Our room was cozy and spotless, with a lovely view of the Sea and ruins of a Mosque, as well as a mosque designed by Sinan which you must visit as it is incredibly beautiful. We enjoyed listening to the call to prayer, but I would suggest not staying at the Ada if you are acutely sensitive to noise. While there are restaurants in the Sultanahmet area, it seems that the nightlife is centered around Taksim. We found it to be easy to travel to this area by tram. There is a stop within a ten minute walk of the Ada. Breakfast at the Ada was plentiful, though at peak times the room became a bit claustrophobic. The view of the Sea from the breakfast room and adjoining deck are amazing. We plan to visit Istanbul again, and will definitely stay at the Ada.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay at the ADA was to celebrate our 20 year anniversary. The hotel is beautiful and has breakfast served on a rooftop terrace with an incredible view of the Sea af Marmara. We did spring for the room with the seaview which was quite large and had a microwave and fridge in it. The location is literally a block from the Blue Mosque and the Aya Sophia. We walked to every site in the old part of town and to the ferries to get to the other parts of the city. The hotel is next to a small mosque so you will hear the call to prayers early in the morning, though this should be considered part of the charm of being in Istanbul. The hotel is on a very quite street. The cab drivers did have a little trouble finding it because it is tucked away on a quite street. There is a free direct phone line to the US and Canada, wireless access throughout the hotel and a computer in the lobby with a printer. The owner goes to great lengths to help book side trips or cultural programs. He was helpful in guiding us to use public transportation rather than use expensive taxis. He booked a great cab service for us to the airport. We had to leave at 4 am to catch an early flight and the owner got up and made sure we were safely on our way. I have never had such a pleasurable stay - ever!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We really enjoyed our stay at the ADA Hotel Nov. 1 - 3 '09. We were met at the airport as planned (stay 3 nights get free airport pickup) and brought by car to the hotel where Dr.Dogan and his wife Eva took very good care of us. We had booked a sea view room for our 10 anniversay and upon arrival the good Dr. upgaded us to a larger room on the 4th floor with a fantastic view of the Marmora Sea, a Jacuzzi tub,40" flat screen, small wet bar with refridgerator, microwave, plates glass and flatware. After the long flight and being our first trip to Istanbul, walking into these accommodations set the tone for what turned out to be a fantastic trip. The breakfast Eva provided each morning on the 5 th floor terrace was very good and one had a choice of about 30 items. Yogurt, cheeses, breads, cereal, fresh fruit, olives, baklava, cold cuts etc. The hotel location is just a short 5-7 min walk to get to the major sights in Sultanamet but just far enough away to be on a quiet street (remember you are in Turkey and you will here the call to prayer!). Another big plus was free phone calls to the US and Canada from a designated phone in the lobby and a computer for the guests to use. We look forward to our next stay at the ADA Hotel, a very clean, safe hotel (really more like a B&B) run wonderful people. J&K</p></li>

We had a triple room with Jacuzzi. There isn't much that I can add to the reviews. It is all true, the view, the location, the great service, the clean rooms. Mr. Sumengen and his family were very helpful and friendly. I read a few reviews of people who were not satisfied, and moved to a hotel uptown or to one of the major hotels. I think this is because of the star rate. You should not compare the hotels in the old city to the famous hotels. There is a difference in the star rating. In the old city are all the major tourist attractions, you won't find any hotels from the famous hotel chains. I approve of that, that's how the old city remains it's authentic character. If that's not what you are looking for, I would advice you to move to the European site, there you will find the famous hotels, the atmosphere and the appearance equal to any big city in the world. If you want to enjoy the great history of Istanbul, meet locals and save on excursions, book a room at Ada hotel. Ada hotel is in walking distance of all the major attractions (max. 5 minutes)...Blue Mosque..Grand Bazaar etc etc</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location was excellent. Our room looked out over a small mosque to the Sea of Marmara. We heard the mezzuin each morning, but to us that was part of the charm. The room, while small, was typical for the old city. If you want a huge room, maybe the Hilton would be more your style. For us, the ambience offered by the Ada was enjoyable. Rooms were clean and the shower was always hot and had lots of pressure. The bed was comfortable and so were the pillows. The breakfast, although the same each day, offered enough variety of dishes not to be boring - cereal, yoghurt, cold meats, salad, sweets, breads, juices, coffees and tea. And baklava! There was always plenty of it, too, even on those mornings we got off to a slow start. The cook was a real charmer and so friendly, despite having no English. She certainly loved people to enjoy her food. Each morning on our short walk to the tram, we passed the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. The proximity to these fabulous sights was not marred by heavy traffic noise, which I did hear other travellers staying in other hotels in the vicinity complain of. The best things about the hotel were the friendliness of the staff - even though we arrived at 5 in the morning - the quiet yet central location, and the food. The whole experience was excellent and we will certainly stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just got back from Turkey and I have to say that this hotel is the only reason I still thing Turkish people are not out to get you! Dr. Sumengen is one of the most caring and trustworthy people I have ever met in my life. I really felt that I could trust him with anything. Plus on top of everything the hotel is spotless. I have a real issue with Turkish bathrooms but our room at the Ada was soooooooo clean. The room was very cozy and modern. AC worked great. TV worked great. everything smelled great! Free internet. Free airport transfers. The breakfast is good and more than plenty on a beautiful terrace. Just wake up earlier than the others to get outside seating on the terrace. The location is absolutely wonderful. We walked everywhere to all the sites. within 5 mins we were in the middle of the tourist action (blue mosque, topkapi, etc). And the owners are so absolutely warm and really really care about you as a human being. I cannot thank him and his wife enough. I was really screwed over by my tour company and when I went to go say hello to Dr. Sumengen when I got back to Istanbul from my blue cruise...his wife and he really tried to comfort us even though we were not even guests at their hotel! Honestly, stay here if you can...it might be hard to get a room on short notice because the hotel is popular and so well priced but book NOW!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The breakfast is amazing. Toast, yogurt, fruit (great selection) adn veggies, tea, coffee, olives, cheese, hard boiled eggs, croissants, baklava. Great selection, but yes a little light on protein per the Meditereanean diet. Rooms vary greatly in size. Also saw some bargaining going on which was interesting since we had booked directly at a very affordable price (or so we thought). There was a car ready to pick us up at the airprot because we booked direct and stayed 3+ nights which was just plain nice. The hotelier was very helpful, made lots of reservations and gave us good suggestions. he did try and recommend a plethora of places from which we assume he got a kickback, but who knows. Hotel is a stones throw from a mosque but I dont know of a person who manages to escape the 6 am wakeup call. And no, earplugs don't help. A/C wasnt the greatest but sufficed. Free water was a nice perk. Balcony off the kitchen is spectacular and offers great views. hotel is a 5 min stroll to the Blue Mosque etc, great area from which to branch out. ALSO, hotel has a magijack phone so calls abroad are free. We used it almost every night to call home etc. It's in the lobby but well worth it. Theres also a pc in the lobby for you to use. We waited 1x for like 20 min in the 5 days we were there. I would stay here again if you're on a budget- its well worth the $$.</p></li>

We have, in the past, booked other hotels on other trips because of claims of incredible service and location and been disappointed. Not this time. The room was exactly as pictured on the site, was clean, huge, and the bed was so comfortable we hated to leave it behind. The location was perfect--in a quiet side street but only 5 minutes from Sultanhamet Square. The wake up call each morning from the mosque across the street's call to prayer completed the perfect setting. Breakfast was delicious and hearty. We loved having dessert with breakfast every morning (Turkish delight and baklava were always on the table). I will say that the breakfast room was very crowded; no doubt because so many people have discovered that this hotel is a gem. But, without a doubt, Dogan, the proprietor, was the highlight of the stay. He was so helpful--making restaurant reservations, arranging transport to and from the airport, making an apointment for us at a Turkish bath, and making recommendations for where to go and what to see, I, unfortunately, had a conference call back to the United States while there, and he even let me make my call from his lobby telephone--90 minutes, no charge. We aren't sure if we'll be able to squeeze in another trip to Istanbul, but we loved every minute of our stay and would love to go back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The owners, which are permanently available to you, eager to help and to assist you in any situation are very kind and warm people. The room we stayed in, was very confortable, with a big bad, a sofa, an armchair, three chairs, a table and a desk, an wardrobe containing and a safe, an iron and a ironing table. There are in also a big fridge, a chitken closet whith everything you need to make a coffe or tea, a microwave oven and surprise, a jacuzzi inside the room. The bath room is also new and nice. You get a big lcd tv set and a dvd player in the room and wireless internet acces. Everything in the room is in a excelent condition and well functioning. The breakfast is very good with a many choices and is served in a very nice view of Bosforus on the roof terase. In the entrance lobby there are an internet acces computer for the guest use. Finally the location is in the heart of old SultanAhmed district near the Istambul most important atractions. As an conclusion we had a very nice stay there, that's why we extended it for few days more and compared with condition in "ARDEN" five stars hotel in the nearby, there are a big difference in the advantage of ADA. The entrance is not impresive, is looking like a regular house entry, more than a hotel one, the entrance lobby also, but don't be fooled by this as we've been and don't judge by first impression, you'll see, will have a nice time there.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Gem of a B&B with a great owner”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at Ada Hotel in a double room with sea view June 11-14, 2009. Let me say first that without Dr. Dogan's (owner) hosting, advice, and conversations while still would have been a very good B&B, he took it to a much higher level. When we first got to the hotel (at 7 AM from an overnight flight) via a pre-arranged Taxi service from Ataturk that Dr. Dogan had set-up, we were greeted as friends and invited for the breakfast service and our room even though we were much earlier than the check-in time. When we got to our room we truly felt this was a second Honeymoon given the view from the room. The room was very tastefully furnished and immaculate. The posted pictures of the hotel do not do it justice...it is much nicer than the pictures! The hotel is in a great neighborhood and minutes (walking) to the Sultan Ahmet mosque, Hagia Sofia, Topkapi palace, Islamic museum, and a host of many restaurants. It is about 20 minutes walk to the Grand Bazaar, and a 15 minute metro ride to the night life/shopping of Taksim Sq. and Istiklal street. Breakfast is very good and is served in the Terrace with an even better view than our room (higher floor). Dr. Dogan can advise you on where to go for various places and he also runs a tour company that can arrange various sites in and out of Istanbul. They also provided a Taxi service on our trip out to the airport. The ADA Hotel is a MUST in you stay in Istanbul.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Dr. Sumengen and Mrs. Sumengen are definitely in the right business. We visited for six nights with our 4 year old daughter. The room was spotless, we went with a three person room however, we all slept together in one the large comfy bed with perfect pillows and just left our luggage in the attached room with the single. The bathroom was super clean with excellent water pressure for the shower, hot and cold water very reliable.We were given detailed and very helpful instruction about things to do while in Istanbul. The table was always full of options and delivious. What made the stay exceptional was when we woke up late one morning and thought we were going to have to skip breakfast, Dr. Sumengen called our room saying he didn't see us for breakfast and would keep everything out until we had breakfast, what more can you expect from a host? They were so kind and gentle with our daughter, it was like visiting her grandparents. Finally, on the day we departed, transport to the airport was smoothly arranged and they walked us over to the van, and so us off with such genuine affection, it felt like we were being seen of by family. The only thing they can work on is having consistent Wifi during the day, it was perfect in the evenings although, don't expect most travelers to be cooped up in their hotel room during the day. Without a doubt in my mind, I will be going back to Ada Hotel on my next trip to Istanbul, a beautiful city with warm, generous, kind people.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We (a couple) stayed ih this hotel with a friend in a standart triple room. Needless to say that not all the rooms are equiped with jacuzzi or have a view. We didn't have any view at all, except on a tiny interior yard with all of the nearby air conditional systems in it. So the room didn't have a lot of light and one could hear the noise of the air conditional systems during the whole night in spite of the closed windows. However, it didn't prevent us from falling asleep. The room appeared quite small for three of us because of the size of the beds: there were huge. The double bed was enough for four people and the single was like a double. Those left very litte space for movement. Moreover, the bathroom had a transparent door, located just in front of the single bed. Everything could be seen in detail, which was not very charming, especially for my partner, who shared the room with a friend of mine. There was a small kitchenette beside the room with tea coffee making facilities. However, when we entered the room, everything was cristall clean except the kitchen floor, literaly covered with long black hair. The other unconvenient thing was the fact that the front door was always closed and Mr Dogan had to open it everytime we were coming back late. However, the bed are great, the breakfast has a lot of choice, the view is stunning, the location is great for visiting Sultanahmet, the owners were nice and helpful. I would recomend this hotel but not the room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Dogan and Havva provide a most wonderful simple sanctuary in Istanbul. A few blocks walk from all the activity it's a quiet oasis. Comfortable, spotless and well-loved with dark wood classic furniture, turkish rugs and views. They genuinely care about each one of their guests and are pleasantly present. ~ Of no small note is the delicious breakfast - a smorgasbord of fresh Turkish and European offerings - crepes, frittata, eggplant, zucchini, lentil dishes, granola, tomatoes, cheese, fruit juices, baklava... and more! It's no secret I turned breakfast into brunch and was healthfully fortified until dinner time. The breakfast is served on a sunny tranquil rooftop with a magnificent view over mosques to the water. Traveling solo I shared breakfast several times with other Ada Hotel guests. Other days I enjoyed simply reflecting on my trip and the day ahead. ~ A great plus is that Dogan arranges tours all around the country. He set me up in small groups of five people with engaging and knowledgable English-speaking guides. Each bus and hotel were planned beautifully. Traveling solo it was the perfect way to see many of Turkey's best sites in 4 days. ~ Another bonus is they will upgrade your room if it's available. ~ It was extremely helpful to have free internet access. ~ The free ride to and from the airport at any hour is very welcoming to weary travelers. ~ I can honestly say it was one of the most enjoyable stays I've ever had. I returned to Istanbul for a second stay at the end of my trip!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the ADA Istanbul for a long weekend in June 2009. The hotel is perfectly located for the walking tourist and virtually all of Istanbul's sights are no more than a 5 minute walk away. The hotel is clean, staff is friendly, and the breakfast buffet is very good and the views from the roof top terrace make it actually quite amazing. One piece of advice would for all travelers to inquire directly about which room you will be staying in. I was not aware after speaking with the owners on the telephone or reviewing their website that they actually have two rooms in the basement. Yes, you can imagine your wife's heart sinking when the owner of the hotel directs her into the elevator on the first floor and tells her to go down. The basement rooms, while still very clean, are not recommended. The basement rooms have those little windows at the top of the walls facing the street that are subject to the loud noise of every passing car and walkerby. To think that we stayed at this hotel for the views - And then to be put into the basement to have a view of people's ankles as they walked by. VERY disappointing. The owner should be more clear in his descriptions of the rooms in talking and on the internet and then heavily discount these rooms in the basement. We asked to be relocated to another room but the hotel was full and the owner was unable to move us and since we were with our infant daughter we were not ambitous enough to move to another hotel. I would generally recommend this hotel, but warn all travels to confirm carefully what room they are reserving and ensure that it is not in the basement.</p></li>

<li>To think that we stayed at this hotel for the views - And then to be put into the basement to have a view of people's ankles as they walked by.</br></br></li>
<li>VERY disappointing.</br></br></li>
<li>The owner should be more clear in his descriptions of the rooms in talking and on the internet and then heavily discount these rooms in the basement.</br></br></li>
<li>We asked to be relocated to another room but the hotel was full and the owner was unable to move us and since we were with our infant daughter we were not ambitous enough to move to another hotel.</br></br></li>
<li>I would generally recommend this hotel, but warn all travels to confirm carefully what room they are reserving and ensure that it is not in the basement.</br></br></li>
