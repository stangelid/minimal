<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 3 nights and it is in a great location to walk to the train station to get to the city. The beds and place is very comfortable and clean. As for the airport shuttle, it's not that far to walk..It might be at the other end of the airport, but it's only a 6 minute walk. I had a nice pool.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nicely appointed, comfortable room within easy striking distance of Fiumicino airport (10 minute pay-shuttle ride). The free bus from the city center was welcome, as you'd be hard-pressed to get here via transit - it's basically in a business park off the freeway, with nothing in easy walking distance. But for an early morning flight, it's just fine.</p></li>

I was given a smoking room after asking for non-smoking; moved to a room next to an elevator shaft with no hot water; then moved to another room that FINALLY had hot water but I had to share the bed with my friend instead of the two beds that we needed. What a nightmare. The only good thing was the AWESOME breakfest!!! Nice wide selection.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great beds, clean rooms, efficient check-in staff. Restaurant dinner was ok, not really grand but not too bad. Good breakfast buffet. Hotel restaurant and bar need refurbishing though and the same is true for some of the rooms. Location is a bit off the beaten track as you can only take the taxi or shuttle bus to get to places. Overall an ok hotel but budget permitting would stay closer to the city at the Westin.</p></li>

The only downfall there are no taxis waiting at the station which made it inconvenient whilst waiting around with heavy luggage. The hotel has a nice restaurant offering a full buffet. Free Internet use for first time. The best hot chocolate too. We paid approx $150 aud per nite which was amazing price for the Sheraton.</p></li>

Good Food and great rooms, with very nice beds and the AC is cold ! It was a little out of the way from all the touist attractions, but a 8 minute walk to the train station got us into THE CENTER OF ROME IN JUST A FEW MINUTES... for the price, well worth it !

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found the Airport shuttle service convenient. They are very prompt and each way from the airport or vice versa cost 5 euro per person. The Hotel is far from the centre but the hotel has provided shuttle to the city (cost 3 euro- check with the hotel for timetable). Another option is to take the Metro (EUR Magliana) which is a 8-10 min walk from the hotel. It is not recommended if you carry heavy luggage. Our room was comfortable and clean. The Bed is very comfortable after a long journey.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">garish/tired decor, tired bathroom - difficult to clean but not too bad apart from alarming stains on floor - and a very unclean whiff in the room were the first impressions. Grubby windows did at least open (built up the biceps quite nicely: seriously some people would not be able to open them) to let in air from the motorway type junction outside. The bed was ok.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel rooms were old looking and in need of a make-over and repairs. Service staff including reception and restaurant staff and concierge were polite and efficient but certainly not very friendly. I don't remember anyone actually smiling at me during my 5-day stay, let alone greeting me. We had meetings on level 2, which were converted from 2 hotel rooms. Very convenient as my room is just down the hallway. meeting package was expensive and food was way too much for 5 people. We would have been better off ordering individual room service food</p></li>

They do not answer the phone: tried calling reception, switchboard, room service and EMERGENCY from the room and there was no reply. Then tried calling them from my mobile as if it were an outside call: NO REPLY. This happened on day 1 and on day 2 so not an isolated event. 2. Asked for a shaving kit and toothbrush. It would be brought to the room - it never arrived. 3. As a platinum member I am entitled to free internet - they still charged me for it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived on May 27. The staff was great, especially Alesandro and Said. They were just helpful from beginning to end. Although the hotel is not in the city center, the hotel shuttel definitely makes up for it. The room was spacious and service was excellent. The restaurant was surprisingly the best food we had in Rome. Definitely dont miss a meal there, especially there pizzas. If it was one thing which was a draw back, was the pool was open during limited hours, but in Rome you wont have time to use it. The hotel definitely made our stay in Rome enjoyable! Thanks guys!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from 4 nights at the Sheraton, Rome. We had a great time and enjoyed our selves immensely. The hotel is about 20 mins from the city centre and was easily accessed by the shuttle bus which was great value and ran every 90 mins. Our room was on the club floor and was worth the extra cost giving us access to a very peaceful lounge with complimentary drinks and snacks. The reastaurant and bar prices are a little expensive but the food was delicious and the service great. All the staff were pleasant and helpful and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel.</p></li>

The building either needs to be demolished or closed and totally refurbished. We had peeling wallpaper and mould on our bedroom walls. It was a club room - supposedly their best! Service was appalling. We were seen as a nuisance if we asked for help or service. The motorway runs directly opposite the hotel and at night a very loud nightclub booms out across the hotel. It is miles from Rome and costs a lot to get in and out. Never again.</p></li>

The breakfast spread is absolutely great, we loaded on breakfast before we set out for the day. Rooms are well appointed and very clean. My only complaint is that the concierge didn’t want to help us establish contact with one of our tour operators. When I told the reception of this, they promptly helped me out and made all the arrangements for us. The hotel is located in between the airport central Rome the city. It takes around 20-25 minutes to get to the centre of Rome.</p></li>

I would have given this hotel a higher score if it were not for the very rude waiter Fabrizio at the piano bar, he was really mean.

I do not understand what the complaints are about - as this was the best value in Italy. Sure - it is a 15 minute walk on a busy and unpaved sidewalk tpo the Metro stop (EUR Magliana) - but still accessible. The restaurany has a cold buffet 9part of a larger buffet) for only 13 euros - beat that in Rome. The rooms need upgrading - but the hotel is well underway in the renovations. The pricepoint and services are well worth the minor inconvenience of the location. Stay there -and enjoy their service.</p></li>

In general we have no complaints , they gave us a room by 12 PM since we reached the hotel fairly early from airport. The walk to the shuttle is a little long, can get tiring if you are lugging bags along. People were polite and all requests were promptly attended to as well. The shuttle to the city is convenient too. BUT the rooms are crying out for some renovation and upgrade. Things are either broken,torn or don't work at all. And to the staff polite is nice but smile is definitely better. Poker face look is not cool anymore!!!!!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am an SPG platinum member. I really didn't like this hotel much. They made lots of mistakes with my check in, and it was quite frustrating. The hotel and room are oldish, not much an executive lounge. But it was cheaper vs the Westin (i.e. about EUR100+ vs EUR200+ for Westin). On hindsight, I should have booked one of the better hotels in the city centre and paid the EUR200+ as I really didn't enjoy my 2 nights in Rome at Sheraton. It motivate me to leave Rome earlier to drive into Tuscany. It's location near the EUR is nice and it is not far from city, a reasonable cab ride away. I did enjoy walking around the EUR area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in the Sheraton Rome 4 nights in August. The hotel itself is very nice except for the fact it's too far from central Rome. There is nothing walking distance which forces you to either eat at the hotel restaurant which is extremely expensive and not worth the money or take the shuttle into the center of Rome and walk afterwards to find somewhere to eat. One day we decided to walk and after about a mile and a very dirty and dangerous thin sidewalk we found a McDonalds. Not my idea of the food I wanted to eat in Italy. I don't recommend staying here unless you don't mind taking the shuttle everytime you want to go out.</p></li>

<li>The <span style="background-color:#f032e6">hotel</span> itself is <span style="background-color:#f032e6">very nice</span> except for the fact it's too far from central Rome.</br></br></li>
<li>There is nothing walking distance which forces you to either eat at the hotel restaurant which is extremely expensive and not worth the money or take the shuttle into the center of Rome and walk afterwards to find somewhere to eat.</br></br></li>
<li>One day we decided to walk and after about a mile and a very dirty and dangerous thin sidewalk we found a McDonalds.</br></br></li>
<li>Not my idea of the food I wanted to eat in Italy.</br></br></li>
<li>I don't recommend staying here unless you don't mind taking the shuttle everytime you want to go out.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is in a well outside of Rome, but not particularly close to the Airports either. There is nothing at all to do or see within walking distance, and they take full advantage of this, everything other then the rooms is overpriced. The nearby entertainment venue plays music until 3AM, and it is so loud it shakes the walls. Not entirely the fault of the hotel, but not a trivial issue either. The pool is very nice and service is fine as well, but the lobby is often full with groups checking in, causing extensive delays. The rooms are smaller then what you usually get in central Rome, and very old and worn, not really good enough.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for a week. Booked it before viewing trip advisor and was disappointed by the reviews. However it was too late to cancel so we stayed anyway. Let me say that the bad reviews were not founded in truth. This hotel was clean and well laid out, with fantastically friendly and very helpful staff. The pool and sports facilities were superb. Yes, the location is a bit out of the way but the shuttle buses ran frequently and were never too busy to get a seat, and this was in june/ july. Add all this with a cheap price (which includes the best and most varied breakfast buffet I have ever experienced) and you are in for an enjoyable stay.</p></li>

Breakfast at the Sheraton Roma was quite an event not to be missed, with cooked to order eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, potatoes, fresh cut fruits and even cooked veggies, fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh baked rolls and fresh coffee. The service was flawless and even though the hotel was not in the center of Rome, the hotel shuttle and short walk to the Metro were very convenient. Their shuttle picked us up at the airport and took us to the hotel for a small fee.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A decent but an expensive hotel...a little far from all the historical sites of Rome. The hotel has a shuttle running to downtown as well as the airport for 3 and 5 euros a person respectively, so it definitely helps...but the location is not great !! it is around a km away from the train station but there is nothing around the hotel. The pool is nice, but rooms have a outdated look and could definitely need some updating. The staff was very helpful in feedback and planning our itinerary in Rome. Overall, the hotel meets the standard for a decent price and definitely recommended if you have a flight due to its proximity and services to the airport.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently stayed here for 5 nights. We got a really good price assuming because of the renovations. Can definitely relate to the comments regarding poor service. There were a few individual staff members who were friendly, however most seemed to be hating life and not interested in being at work or assisting you. Room was nice and bed comfortable. The restaurant is very expensive compared to ones outside. At least double the price so worth venturing out of the grounds. The pool area was lovely but you need to get in early as people tend to 'bags' a chair by putting their stuff on it then not use it for hours. Overall was okay but big disappointment with the service.</p></li>

Facilities are fair but the service is terrible. Also, if you have the misfortune to have to stay there for business (as we did) make sure you get your ticket for the bus to the City Centre early because it call be full and no they won't let you make reservations ahead of time. Also, if you want to work out in the gym make sure that you tell the front desk when you check in because you must sign a release form first before you can get access to the gym. Otherwise, you will have to wait in line forever to speak with the oh so friendly (not) Front Desk staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I wanted to add a positive review for Sheraton Roma as I had read several recent negative reviews, and we had an entirely positive experience. The pool was fabulous for the kids (5 and 8) - perfect after a hot day of sightseeing. We often had dinner and a drink by the pool while the kids were swimming. I found all the staff to be extremely helpful and pleasant. The courtesy buses to the city run every 1 1/2 hours and it was easy enough to plan our day to coincide with the bus schedule (certainly cheaper than taking a taxi). We also made use of the courtesy bus to the airport. The room was clean and the breakfast was excellent. Will definitely stay here on our next trip to Rome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a platinu member you can check in at the 6th floor, which gives you a welcome feeling. The rooms are ok, not very special,. sometimes a little old. The service is nice, and the surroundings are ok. PRice wise the hotel is not very expensice, but then again, the location is not an 'A' location. If you come for a weekend, you can use the bus from the Sheraton, which brings you at the rim of the city centre, and from there you can walk to the city. This is very convenient and not expensive. The rooms are quite, however sometimes the cleaning ladies don't pay attention to the ' do not disturb' signs and come just waliing into your room, which sometimes can result in awkward moments :-)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this with a name your price deal and got about what we expected. The room was reasonably priced but far from the city center. We figured we were trading a bit of convenience to save on cost-which was fine. Check-in was brutally slow. The room itself was nice and pretty spacious by Rome standards. We didn't use the pool but it looked pretty decent. The metro is about a 15 minute walk, but wouldn't recommend it for those with children or mobility issues since sidewalks are narrow and Rome drivers are very aggressive. Some more internet terminals in the lobby would be a plus since they were almost always full. Checkout was a bit smoother when leaving. Overall not bad, but room for improvement.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Typical American hotel with ample space, unlike most European hotels. The big bath tub allows a good rest after a long day of sightseeing (and walking!). While its location is a little out of the way, the frequent (free) coach rides ensures easy and quick access to the city, dropping off at Campidoglio, just 10 minutes from the Forum and Colosseum. Try to avoid the last ride which can get a little violent, based on our personal experience and the driver will not allow a single addition if the seats are filled. I had to catch a public bus ride (45mins) back to the hotel while my fiance took the last coach seat. At the hotel, try to avoid the first 2-3 levels as the music from the bar can be pretty annoying.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent hotel, very relaxing. Great service, excellent staff. A warm welcome when we arrived there. The rooms were big and very comfortable, bathrooms excellent. Cleanliness excellent. The hotel was easy to get about. Great pool and sun bathing area, nice restaurant and bar, with excellent food. Very very friendly and helpful staff, who helped with planning your day and booking trains and getting the local and national public services timetable downloaded. Regular bus service to the city and airport and not far from either. Had a excellent relaxing time, would definitely recommend a stay at this hotel, I would definitely return. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay, made the holiday experience even more enjoyable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in the hotel for 4 nights. Being regular to Sheraton hotels worldwide I have to say that this is the worst Sheraton hotel I have ever been to. It deserve maximum 2 star rating. Staff are very unfriendly, unprofessional, not attentive, from Receptionist to F&B staff. Cleanliness in the hotel public areas is very poor, toilets in the lobby were always very dirty and the whole area smelled badly of urine. TV sets in the room are acient and picture is not clean at all. I would advise everyone to stay away from this property. It's overpriced, in terms of quality and service. Property is old, neglected. The last drop was when we received during check-out inaccurate bill. Overall it's not up to Sheraton world wide standards.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the hotel for one night prior to our med cruise. We found the hotel to be clean and fine for a one night stay. We arrived early but the hotel accomodated us by checking us in early. We had a room on the first floor which was of ample size but possibly a little dated. I have heard that some of the other floors have been refurbished already. We found the gym to be updated with various pieces of equipment. It was very clean and there was a great water cooler by the entrance. The free internet in the lobby was great also. Transportation into Rome central was a little inconvenient. If staying in Rome for a few days I would recommend in town..but for one night the hotel was perfect and the pizza in the lounge was delicious!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband stayed here for a conference he attended nearby. Myself & 8 year old daughter also stayed for 1 week. The rooms are clean and neat. The breakfast is huge, fresh croissants, fruit, coffee, etc. The waiters were nice and approachable. Shuttle bus and airport bus from hotel are a great deal. 3/5 Euro. The Metro is a 10 minute walk, and busstop is right in front of the hotel. You can get everywhere on the Metro. You have to be a little travel savy and bring your map. We always felt safe by ourselves. The price is right compared to other hotels. Lounge is fun, music Friday nights & nice staff. I would recommend if you think you can get around using transport. After all, this is Rome! Once you get there, you can walk around easily.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here in Sept 2006, most of the hotel staff was really nice, the rooms were clean, and like most European hotels the rooms were smaller than in the US. The concierge was really helpful in that he recommended places to eat and they were great . The hotel is located about 5 miles outside of town and it takes you approx 20 minutes to get to the city center but the hotel does provide free shuttle service on a scheduled basis to go back and forth. I thought the buffet food was good but pricey, it is alot cheaper but less convienent to go outside of the hotel to eat. The hotel does not offer pickup service from the airport but for a fee they will take you to the airport when you are leaving. We had great weather the entire time we were there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed in this hotel recently. The hotel is about 30 minutes from the Fiumicino airport and is not near to the city centre. The good thing about the hotel is that they provide shuttle to the airport at 5 Euros and to the city centre at 3 Euros at various intervals. The rooms were big compared to other hotels in Rome. However, the front desk was not friendly, presumably due to the sheer volume of people checking in and out of the hotel. The hotel is considered big by Rome standards. The hotel provides a few computer terminals at the lobby for free internet use albeit the connection speed leaves much to be desired. We had the buffet at the main restaurant at the cost of 35 Euros per pax and did not think much of it. While service was excellent, the food was not.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay at the Sheraton Roma was a huge disappointment on this brand. I contacted the hotel asking about transportation from the airport and they advised us to take the train. Bad, bad advice, I did not appreciate our 1st impression of Rome to be on a dirty and old train. When we finally arrived at the nearest train station, we had to call them and ask for a taxi since there was not a taxi stand in that particular station. The check-in and check-out process and the room decoration were great. However, the A/C was not working (although the hotel insisted it was on high) well and we had to request a fan to avoid roasting in the room. Finally, this hotel is far from every attraction in Rome. However, they provide a free shuttle to the center of the city a couple of tmes a day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 2 nights on business and found everything to be just average. My room was clean and fault free though a little tired in places which was better than my colleagues rooms which suffered from electrical faults and broken wardrobe doors to name but two. The restaurant food was disappointing for a Sheraton and the service was, as others have mentioned, disinterested. However the service in the bar by the pool was much better and the club sandwiches there were excellent. The hotel is about 10 kilometers from the centre of Rome and in an area with no bars or restaurants within walking distance. There is however a decent hotel bus service which runs every couple of hours into the centre of Rome and costs 3 euros return. Overall it is not a place that I would choose to stay at again</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Sheraton Rome felt like an above-average American hotel plopped about 15 minutes south of Rome's city center. The location isn't great but the hotel offers a free shuttle service that runs every hour and a half until 11:30pm, so it turned out to be a relatively minor inconvenience, although paying more to be inside the city certainly has its benefits if you're a full-day type of traveler. The rooms were clean, comfortable, and well-equipped. The lobby has a bank of computers where you can use the Internet for an hour free of charge. The restaurant and bar were good, as was the service. Overall, this is a nice, clean hotel that will have everything you need for a good trip. The only downsides are the somewhat inconvenient location and the lack of an authentic Italian experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A cold and old business hotel. Personal is cranky and not willing to help with tourist information. They act like you are disturbing them with very dumb questions but the truth is they don't even understand what you are saying. Room service is overly expensive and of mediocre quality. They charge for everything, from internet to the airport shuttle. There is nothing in the neighborhood and finding a convenience store is a challenge. The best transportation is the subway, it’s about a 10 minute walk from the hotel and by far the fastest way to get to the hotspots. If you are looking for a decent bed and cold AC after a hard day of sightseeing this place is okay, otherwise look further. Make sure to check your bill, not only in this hotel but anywhere in Rome. See pictures for room service prices… and a movie is only 19 euro's.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked there for 2 nights for a conference. Shuttle service to the hotel offered opposite terminal T3 of FCO, running every hour and a half. Cost is 5euro charged on the room bill. Excellent conferencing facilities offered. Rooms - well I should say that they need some maintenance work. You'll see scratched furniture and fixings, some rust on bath, stains on carpets. They should really invest in that. Tried the restaurant. Nothing particularly fancy to write home about and somewhat overpriced. On the whole the rooms are close to 3+ star, but the conference facilities are tops. I would not recommend this hotel to a tourist. It is 30' by taxi to the center of rome, a fare which typically costs 20 euros one way + taxi call. I did not use public transport, although I know that 1 bus stop away there was the Magliana metro station.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First - Let's get the "bad" out of the way. My only complaints are the parking situation. There are two free parking areas. the one closest to the hotel tests your driving skills as the spaces are small and limited. On the other side of the hotel, you certainly feel vaulnerable as it's few feet from the street and wide open, inviting trouble. Put some type of barrier or security and problem solved. Now that's out of the way, the good stuff... We've been visiting Italy now on a yearly basis for the past ten years. We've never had a problem at this hotel, the staff is very accomodating and friendly. The Club Lounge is wonderful, very relaxing and the view on teh terrace is great. The bus schedule is convenient, although recently there has been a 3 Euro charge. Sheraton is lucky to have this staff represent them. Starting with the Supervisor, Pamela and her staff. We would not stay anywhere else in Rome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for three nights on September 1st, 2nd and 3rd. When we arrived, we ended up taking the Metro to Magliana station and went up the hill to the main road to wait for the shuttle. You do have to wave the shuttle down at this stop because there are other buses that stop here that also have to be waved down. There are two other public buses that go to the Sheraton in case you get stuck at least you know you have other options. The shuttle leave every 1.5 hours from the hotel starting at 8am to 11pm and leaves the city centre location every 1.5 hours starting at 8:30am to 11:30pm so this was very convenient for us. There is also a shuttle to / from the airport for 5 euros one way. There are a number of restaurants to choose from but we loved eating at the pool side bar for both lunch and dinner – they had amazing salads and entrees to choose from! Overall this was a good hotel and we would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Sheraton Roma Hotel is beautiful, and should be for the price. We were upgraded to a deluxe room for our honeymoon, and the room was very nice and spotlessly clean (though smaller than I expected even for Europe). The staff was extremely helpful, and they even had sparkling wine waiting in our room each night we stayed, free of charge! The hotel is not close to any of Rome's site-seeing attractions. There is however a shuttle bus that goes to the city center (near the Colosseum) every 1.5 hours with a cost of 3 Euros. There is also an airport shuttle available for just 5 Euros (great deal). The restaurant in the hotel looked very nice, though we didn't actually eat lunch or dinner there. Prices were a bit high, which is expected in hotel restaurants. The breakfast was very good, but if it is not included in your room rate it is extremely expensive. Overall, a beautiful hotel with convenient shuttle service to the city center. We were very happy with our stay!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On the advice of their staff, we decided to walk from the nearest Metro station (EUR Magliana) to the hotel (original email was an inquiry about shuttle bus -- no longer runs to Termini as mentioned by another reviewer) There is a metro station that's 500-600 meters away; but there are no paved sidewalks for most parts, and you're literally walking besides a main thoroughfare, then have to walk through a highway underpass before you reach the hotel. Check-in staff did not apologize for the wrong advice; obviously the check-in lady has never walked the 600m trip. Rooms is a typical sheraton room. If you're looking for a unique italian experience, LOOK ELSEWHERE This hotel is definitely not worth the suggested price of USD250+. We stayed at a hotel (granted, it doesnt have a pool, room service, fitness centre) in central rome for EUR 220 a night. It was directly above the Spagna metro station, and we had a view of the square besides Spanish Steps (a room for EUR 230 has windows that open onto the steps)</p></li>

<li>On the advice of their staff, we decided to walk from the nearest Metro station (EUR Magliana) to the hotel (original email was an inquiry about shuttle bus -- no longer runs to Termini as mentioned by another reviewer) There is a metro station that's 500-600 meters away; but there are no paved sidewalks for most parts, and you're literally walking besides a main thoroughfare, then have to walk through a highway underpass before you reach the hotel.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We returned to the Sheraton Roma in Aug 2011 after a previous great holiday in Aug 2009. We were not disappointed. Amazing service and attention to detail from the staff. Renovation work was being carried out which did not impact on our holiday in any negative way. Great hotel to visit Rome during the day with a Coach service for only euro s then returning to a delightful pool to relax and chill and dine with delicious food. I celebrated my 50th birthday at the Sheraton Rome and the staff arranged a surprise cake and champaign in my room. Fantastic breakfasts available and great evening meals. Fabulous location just out of Rome centre. Air conditioning wonderful in the rooms as 37c temp. The staff were very accommodating. Please do not listen to negative feedback about the Sheraton. It is a great place to relax and with close links to a fabulous city. Just get up and enjoy the adventure of a beautiful place. Thank you Sheraton Rome and your fantastic staff who made our holiday so wonderful.. Club Lounge service outstanding.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We've stayed here a few times and always had a pleasurable experience. The shuttle bus to/from the airport (5 euro) is great and far cheaper than a taxi. The hotel is about a 20-25 minute bus ride from the center of the city. We usually take the metro into the city and take the bus back to the hotel. The bus is free from the city but costs 3 euro if you take it into the city. Don't pay attention to some of the reviews on here about the metro being too far and/or a dangerous walk.....ridiculous! We've timed ourselves and it takes about 7-10 minutes depending on your energy level. It's an easy walk. The hotel location just outside of the city makes it a nice place to relax after a long day of sightseeing. It's pretty quiet and the facilities are fairly nice. Free internet in the lobby on the hotel computers. Rooms are decent...not as nice as many of the Sheraton rooms in the states but nicer than many rooms in Europe. The Starwood Preferred floors are a little nicer with upgraded furnishings. All in all, it's a pretty nice place to stay especially given that the rates are usually much cheaper relative to a city center hotel of comparable quality.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You arrive at the Sheraton via an elevated section of poorly maintained roadway, having passed numerous scrap car yards and a "gypsy" encampment . First thoughts are it’s a large tin shed, but on entry the atmosphere changes and the reception staff, who all speak excellent English, are helpful and efficient. There are plenty of elevators and the corridors are well maintained. The room was slightly smaller than most American owned sleep factories, and sadly it was showing its age. Nothing sinister, no mildew or peeling wallpaper, just tired! The bedding clean and the bed comfortable...the bathroom also well maintained and the towels new clean. The bar were very polite and helpful , bar food acceptable though as with all USA owned hotels. expensive - they know who their customers are and who actually pays the expenses!! I didn't eat formally in the hotel- I used the transport into Rome city and enjoyed marvellous restaurants and cafes; all at lower prices than say Paris or London. This hotel is for business travellers and if anyone decides to use it for any other purpose then more fool them...there are many hotels in the city for tourists and lovers.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just returned home from a two night stay at the Sheraton Roma. I was there for a conference held at the hotel itself. Unfortunately, the hotel is located quite a distance from the center of Rome. Normally, this wouldn't be an issue; you'd just grab a cab during your few hours off. This time, however, there was a taxi strike. No fault of the hotel, of course, but at moments like that you do realize you're in the middle of nowhere. There is a hotel shuttle into the center; it leaves every hour and a half. We decided not to wait and take the metro, which we were told was just a few minutes away. It wasn't. After a 20 minute walk through the rain and in the street (no sidewalks), we reached the metro. About an hour later we were at the Vatican. Additional minus points: the hotel rooms are unbearably hot and the window only opens a few inches, the tea water (both at breakfast and in the conference rooms) was barely lukewarm Plus points: friendly hotel staff, great espresso, good breakfast I would definitely not stay at this hotel for a holiday or weekend break but would head for the center. It is, however, an efficient hotel for conferences and forums.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">European Hotel rooms tend to be small, but this Sheraton hotel has fairly large rooms. The style is similar to American hotels. It is clean and the staff are helpful and courteous. They also have free Internet service at the Lobby provided by Microsoft Link. The hotel rooms are clean and the service is pretty good. We got turndown service in the evening and they even provide delicious chocolate by the bedside table. That said, the location is a little out of the way. It is not in the heart of Rome, and you need to take the Metro (Line B) to EUR Magliana and walk about 10 mins to the hotel. We got a little lost, but I am attaching a directions map for your benefit. Don't expect any nearby shops or restaurants to go to as there are none nearby. However, this forced us to explore other parts of Rome. I would not recommend this hotel to the elderly as the walk to and from the Metro station can be tiring; unless of course if you are part of a tour that picks you up at the hotel. Personally, I anticipated a lot of walking in Rome anyway, so it was not a problem for me. While I have provided a suggested route, you can also cut through the park, but I do not recommend it after dark.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 4 days before we headed to Greece. It was great! I know it's not in th hear of Rome but it was relaxing and easy to get downtown to see all the sights with the free shuttle. Our room was good with a King size bed and a fold out coach which was perfect for our 1yr old to sleep on. The shuttle took about 10 mins to get into Rome where we were able to see all the sights. Best thing to do is get a pass on the Green Hop on Hop off tourist bus it was 18euro per person for 24hrs and you could get on and off all day. They had two stops very close to where the shuttle drops you off. The tour bus has a great route to all the major sights or very close to them so you can see everything and more without spending too many hours hiking around the city. Make sure you use the green bus as the come to the stops about every 15mins. The staff at the hotel were great especially with a little one. The wait staff in the restaurant were so accomodating and helpful. We never got to use the pool but it look great. We took the shuttle to the airport on our departure and it was only 5euros compared to the 55euros we paid for a cab on arrival. We will definately stay here again when we return to Rome.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In fairness, if I were to rate the hotel only, I would probably give it an above average. This is very much a North American style hotel with nice sized well appointed rooms. The hotel amenities are also very nice with a pool, workout room, large bank of computers for guest use as well as a regular hotel lounge. That said, if you are here to see central Rome than the location is a bit of an issue. The hotel does provide a bus for a nominal fee but this ties you into a schedule which may or may not work for you. The alternative is to use the Metro which is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel-you will need to research the walking route as it isn't obvious once you leave the lobby. Though we never encountered any problems on our walks to the Metro-which we used every day for our 3 night stay. it should be noted that you will have to pass by a few deserted areas and likely will feel mildly uncomfortable especially if walking at night or alone. The upside to the hotel is the airport shuttle bus which again is for a nominal fee but is well worth it in comparison to toting your luggage to and through Termini. I would stay here again if I couldn't find any comprably priced options closer to the center of Rome.</p></li>

He should have told me if there was any room with good view available. He put me at the SPG preferred floor, but, I reckond that floor has no better than other floor. Its marketing gimmick of SPG. (?). In fact, he gave me smooking room, without asking me which room I preferred. The bath room smelled like cigarette. Surprising me, a week before, the manager send me an standard email " what kind I do for you to make your stay more enjoyable" wow... I replay my request, but, it could not be replied. The system reject the replay. Its another marketing gimmick of SPG The Location is far from "Rome". You dont feel you are in Rome. Eventhough the hotel provides shuttle services, it was still a hussle to be back and forth to and from the city centre. The concierge is not too helpful. I would not recommend this hotel to any body who demands an excellent service and wants to enjoy Rome.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we stayed for 5 nights in August 09. I had booked two double rooms; one for my wife and myself, and one for my daughter. I had paid for this online. When we arrived the hotel was overbooked and we were upgraded to the club floor level. initially we were given one proper room and a 'suite' . this turned out to be a sitting room with a poor fold out bed. we declined this and they gave us two proper rooms. the free upgrade meant we got a free breakfast every day, use of the internet and also a place to have a drink in the evenings. so quite a bonus. the pool is very good and there is a nice outdoors area which suited my daughter (18). the bus into town takes 30 minutes in the morning, but about 10 minutes returning in the evening. it does make you think of doing one trip per day, rather than a city centre hotel, where you can put your feet up in the middle of the day. but then they don't tend to have pools, or if the do, are ridiculously expensive. rooms and public rooms are of 4 star quality. the surrounding area is a bit of a dump however, with prostitutes hanging around the 'park' from the afternoon onwards. 10 minute walk from the metro, but poor walking - with narrow pavements/sidewalk and also few proper crossings. short 15 minute trip to the airport.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For future travlers, please note that the Sheraton shuttle does NOT pick up at the train station any longer. The shuttle only picks up and drops off near Pta Venetia. This is important if you are traveling by train. You will need to take a cab over to the shuttle drop. Do not wait at the train station at the place mentioned by past reviews, or you will be waiting for a long time to no avail. The shuttle pickup/drop off point in town does not have a covered area to wait, so when it rains or is cold, it can be unpleasant. The good thing about the hotel is that the rooms at the Sheraton are standard Sheraton rooms. They had the best beds of our 10 days in Italy. As others have mentioned, there are several negatives about this hotel. Food and beverages are very overpriced. This would not be a problem if the hotel was not so isolated. The 25 - 40 minute shuttle ride (depending on traffic) is not the problem. The problem is that the hotel is not near anything. You can not reasonably walk to buy water, soft drinks or snacks. If you want to go to dinner outside the hotel, it is a cab ride to anywhere. It appeared that the hotel was very understaffed. It took a very long time to check into our rooms. On the way back through Rome, we stayed in a hotel in the center. It was worth the extra money to enjoy the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Writing this review in the hotel room now after being harassed by mosquitos all night... Pro: Convenient shuttle connection to City Center and Airport; Shuttles are on time and affordable; Seems like remodeling are taking place and should be much better in the future. Nice staff that check us in early so that we can get some rest. Quick response time in delivering items requested. Cons: non-smoking room that smells like cigarettes; groups of mosquitos that will fly near your face in the middle of the night every 2 hours (killed 2, still counting...); wall paper pealing off the wall; internet price are a bit high (12 Euro for wired, 16 Euro for wireless after using the initial 3 hours); waiter tends to favor European customers, slow service to others, especially if you "look" different. Last but not least, the hotel cannot provided changes in the middle of the night yet the vending machine here only takes coins, if you are still on a jet lag, keeps this in mind. Overall, as a gold member of Starwood who have stayed at over 100+ Starwood properties, this one definitely ranks near the bottom. Imaging a typical Day's Inn or Travelodge (I'm talking about the room, not the lobby, which is fine). Exterior looks more like an outdated apartment than a hotel from a distance, but does get better once you approach the building.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just returned from our third stay in Rome at the Sheraton Roma and it was absolutely amazing! The staff are like family to us, and the hotel itself rivals any hotel in Rome (including those that are triple the price). This hotel offers very spacious, well appointed rooms, fantastic beds and showers, a wonderful fitness centre and pool area (one of the only pools in Rome) and complimentary shuttle service to downtown, a shopping mall and to and from the airport (small charge of 5 euros for airport shuttle). Unlike other higher end hotels, the food here is excellent and very reasonably priced and the service is superb. Perhaps the most wonderful perk of staying here is the Club Lounge, which is open from 6:30am until 11pm. It resembles the First Class lounge at an airport, only much better. The breakfast is more than you'll need to start your day, and snacks are offered after 11am as well as fine Italian wines in the evening. Said, the lounge manager and his fabulous team will also make you the "world's best cappuccino" upon request. The only drawback for some people may be the location, but the shuttle is only 15 minutes from downtown, and travels on the hour all day long. The wonderful staff, food and many other extras make it more than worthwhile to be a bit off the beaten path. We rate this hotel a perfect 10/10. Doug and Wendi Varley</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for about a week for a conference. The hotel itself is very nice and clean. The room was also nicely appointed. We could not control air conditioning however and the rooms were very hot! There is a restaurant on site that is decent and this is helpful because this hotel is far from the center of Rome. From the point of view of a business traveler: you cannot iron your clothes inside your room. Instead of dedicating a room for this activity as in other European hotels, this hotel offers the service at a ridiculous fee. So you either pay 6.50 Euro to get a shirt ironed (in a 24-hour delay!) or be prepared to walk in wrinkled clothes! The internet access was problematic the entire time we were there and I never got access from my room. I had to use the lobby computers to get internet access. Very inconvenient when the hotel is hosting a conference and has about 400 business travelers! From the point of view of a tourist: this hotel is simply too far from the attractions of Rome. You have to take a shuttle or the metro. The walk to the metro and the metro station itself are sketchy - I would avoid it if alone at night. It is not worth staying here if you plan to visit Rome - at the same rate that this Sheraton charges, you can surely find a fabulous hotel in the center of Rome. I strongly recommend visiting Rome but don't stay at this hotel to do it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights The hotel itself is nice, rooms are very outdated bathrooms dirty and the housekeeping service bad. TVs are horrible , there are no free English channels offering programs or movies like Sky movies or sky sport. They want you to buy the pay-per-view package at a high rate. The front desk staff is unfriendly ,un professional, not attentive,. They seem to be bored all the time and the concierge was rude and, information offered by him was vague and unwillingly. There are no restaurants or shops nearby and this hotel is far from in Rome's city center. The hotel offer a shuttle service, 3 euros each round trip , living the hotel lobby each 90 minutes to downtown , There is also an Airport Shuttle just to drop-of 5 Euros each The pool is very nice , fitness center is very well equipped and free of charge. The closest metro station is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel -be aware: the road's is littered with broken glass bottles, trash, no sidewalk no signs, in fact it is dangerous . If you plan to take a taxi from the hotel, I recommend you telephone one by calling 168 on your cell phone…The prices are more than 3 times that amount to start the meter. If you decide go till there, you will need to research the walking route as it isn't obvious once you leave the lobby. If you go to Rome, try to get a good deal on one of the better hotel downtown…</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We generally book most if not all of our family vacation accommodations with either Sheraton or the Westin and are more often than not very pleased with the properties we've visited. However, our visit to the Sheraton Rome was extremely disappointing. Starting with the non-existent hotel shuttle that was not available to pick up our party from the airport forcing us to pay taxi fare of 15 euros per person. Once arrived we discovered that the hotel was completing construction of the lobby (we weren't made aware of is prior to our arrival) we had to wait 30 minutes to check-in because the front desk staff consisted of just two people. We were further disappointed when we exited the elevator on our floor and found the smell of stale cigarette smoke that also filtered onto our non-smoking rooms. The disappointment continued when we entered the rooms to find that rooms were extremely outdated with old, worn carpet, bedspreads and televisions. The bathrooms showed excessive wear, cracks in the floors, outdated inefficient sink and shower fixtures and mold in the tub. Service from the housekeeping staff was far below standard, when we asked for extra towels we were told the hotel was OUT! During the 5 nights we had Internet access for only two nights because the hotel continually lost their service. Don't look for any concierge to assist you with directions, tours or transportation ideas because this person was never present during our entire visit.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Travelling solo, I used the starwood copay for 2 nights and it ended up 45$/night which was pretty great for rome. But glad I didn't stay there the whole time however. Pluses: 5 Euro airport shuttle, Free shuttle to Plaza Venezia, good business center for interent connection 3 euros of 30 minutes. I was in room 2117 and it was very quiet. Close to airport. Nice washcloths and towels, sheets. Felt fresh and updated. Didn't see any gypsies, which others have noted on this site. Minuses: A lot of large tour groups book this place. Far from city center. Metro stop not really walkable or practical for couples or families--don't plan on using it. I did but I travelled solo with a backpack. (you will see iItalian streetwalkers if you walk to the metro at night which, I suppose, could be a plus if you are into that kind of thing) When I left this hotel, I stayed in the noisy city center and did not sleep much but experienced italy and it was great living in the old city where the good food/good shopping is..... Bottom line: This is a great comfortable place to crash if you have a late flight coming in or an early flight going out -- or if you need to count every penny and are travelling alone. Or if you are there on business. Otherwise, why stay at a Sheraton in Italy? I used this site to get a sense of where to stay so and was happy with my choices. For tourists/couples -- I would stay at the San Carlo at the spanish steps. I will write my impression of that place as well.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a 4 day/night break in Rome staying at the Sheraton Roma. The hotel itself is of a decent standard, the bar is a pleasant place to spend an hour or two, the restaurant offers up a decent selection of dishes, and the reception area was a hive of activity (offering up free internet use). There was also a pool which looked very nice but we didn't try to use it and a wealth of other activities we never had chance to sample. We stayed in the cheapest room type after booking for a very reasonable rate online and the room size was very good, with a large queen size bed, and seperate sofa. The room was clean the air con was good and the maids turned down the room whenever we turned the do not disturb light off, can't ask for more. All the staff we encountered were polite and helpful. The shuttle bus service to the city was useful, and also to the airport. I'd recommend this hotel if you don't mind having to travel into the city proper on a daily basis and want a decent quality hotel for your money. Quick tip : the shuttle buses back from the city were full every time we caught them so when you are waiting try to stand close to where you think the doors will end up and get on first or you'll be left waiting for the next one! Food and drink is very very expensive in this hotel and all of Rome it seems, try the wine in the Piano bar for €6.40 you get a huge glass full (equiv to at least a 'large' glass in UK) and it's lovely. Compare this to ~€8 beer, €4.50 for a CAN of coke, or €10 for a vodka(!)</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is not located in Rome's city center, but in the district of EUR. Therefore, you either have to take the hotel's shuttle, which runs every 90 minutes to downtown (at a cost of 3 Euros per person) or the metro. The closest metro station is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel (be aware: the road's condition is very poor!). There is also an Airport Shuttle for 5 Euros per person. The hotel itself is ok. Rooms are very outdated and by any means not in the best condition (even though better than most other hotels in Rome!). TVs are horrible! The floor is dirty and there are stains everywhere in the bathroom. The pool is very nice and quiet, so you can relax and enjoy the sun after a long day in the city. The fitness center is very well equipped and free of charge. There are no restaurants or shops nearby, so you have to go to the city center for essentially everything! Housekeeping was very unreliable and the front desk staff is extremely unfriendly. They seem to be annoyed by everything and are not helpful at all (couldn't even provide us with stamps or band aid after I stepped onto a bee). I didn't even get an apology for billing me the room upon check out (it was prepaid) and was signed up to their loyalty program without any notice. If you don't decline, you will also be charged 1 Euro to donate to some charity organization, so be careful when checking your bill. If you go to Rome, try to get a good deal on one of the better hotel downtown. For the price they charge for a room, this hotel is fine however.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Clean rooms, comfortable beds, friendly staff, reasonably priced”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Sheraton Roma for about 5 days for a conference last month, and found it to be a reasonable choice for Rome--the rooms were decently sized, meticulously cleaned each day (particularly the bathrooms), and comfortable, and the price was quite reasonable. The maids replaced the toiletries daily, even when they weren't completely consumed, and the quality of the toiletries was quite good--they even provided conditioner, which is often not the case for most hotels. The staff was universally quite friendly and helpful. They even included daily breakfast in the rate, and there was a fairly large selection of food, with a variety of cooked meats and eggs, pastries, yogurts, fruits, and juices. They have free internet in the lobby (I believe an hour per day per guest), which was convenient for printing boarding passes, etc. I also got the wifi service for my laptop--it was a standard Rome telecom service, and found some slowness with connecting at times, but no problems once connected to the network. The location is a bit far from most tourist sites, as the hotel lies on the southern outskirts of Rome, but the metro is not far away, and it takes about 10-15 minutes to get into the center of the city. The hotel also has a shuttle bus service to the city and to the airport--they run only at specifically scheduled times, and we ended up taking the metro or a taxi much of the time because this schedule was not convenient for us. Overall, a reasonably good hotel for conferences; if I was traveling for leisure, I might stay closer to the center of town.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from an 8-night stay (and two rooms) at the Sheraton Roma hotel in Rome Italy. I have never been so disappointed in a Starwood hotel before. Here is a partial list of the problems we encountered: 1. The wallpaper in our room was peeling and there were cracks in the walls. 2. There was a loud dance/music complex next to the hotel that plays music until 3 AM. It was so loud that we couldn’t sleep without earplugs until the music stopped. 3. Although we purchased the club lounge upgrade that supposedly provided snacks and drinks until 11:00 PM, the staff would put everything away and setup for breakfast by 10:30 PM. 4. Although the hotels website and email clearly said that Internet access in our room was included in the club lounge upgrade, they still added a charge for internet access at checkout and we had to argue until a manager finally removed the charge. 5. The ATM never had any cash in it. 6. Although the staff kept saying that we could buy Roma Passes at the front desk, they never showed up. One time I went down to the front desk at 6:45 AM, they said they said the passes would be there at 7:30 AM. Even though I sat in front of the desk for 45 minutes, when I asked about them at 7:30 AM, they said they were all gone. 7. We tried to eat dinner at the restaurant one night but the waiter only brought two out of four meals. After that, he kept bringing random meals and asked us if that was what we ordered. We noticed the same problem was happening at several other tables. Finally, after complaining to the manager, they didn’t charge us for any meals.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good stay and yes there are Renovations”</li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just finished a three day stay. And we have had a fine time. We stay in hotels more than 50 days a year and we often stay in Stawood properties. There are lots of unfavourable reviews but read before you go and you know what you are getting. We got our rate right from the Sheraton site and it was 33% off when we booked last spring- We payed less than 100 Euro a night and our rate included a full American breakfast buffet. And this is Rome, It is at the high point of the tourist time and this is a bargain. This hotel in not in the Centre of Rome in fact it is not easy to walk anywhere but there is a public bus stop at the end of the driveway. But the hotel provides a bus that takes you right into town. The ride takes 20 to 30 minutes and is 3 Euro. Can not beat that. Hint You must get your bus tickets at the front desk with the concierge before you get on the bus. The bus takes 53 people and law does not permit standing. The bus picks you up from the same place and the ride back is no charge. We found it easy and convenient. Right on the Starwood site it says the hotel is undergoing renovations. So if you are a platinum member you will not right now be getting a club room. But we have been here three days. We are on the fourth floor and we have not heard any construction sounds. There is no dust in the air. The hotel is dated and they are doing something about it. The staff have been very helpful, in the dining room at the breakfast buffet, at the desk and in the Club lounge. In fact I have a food intollerance and they provided me with safe alternatives. We will come back.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Needs Renovating; Not close to Public Transport; Disappointing”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Putting aside that the building seems like it is right out of the 1970s or early 1980s, this is not a hotel I would have chosen to stay at on my own (I was here for a conference that was held here). In hindsight, I would have booked a nice hotel in the central part of Rome and taken the metro out to the closest station (EUR Magliana) which is about a kilometer away by walking on back streets to the hotel. The rooms are more on the traditional side, and they could use some updating/modernization. They still have old style bulky TVs - not flat ones. Come on guys, in this day an age even cheaper hotels have flat LCD TVs. Bathrooms are tiny. I was on the Club Level - nothing better in terms of amenities that I could tell. Cheap thin towels in the bath. No Air conditioning at this time of year - the hotel turns off the central AC system and does not start it up until Summer, even though it was warm and humid here in April. Club Level lounge had an ok breakfast and evening food assortment. Fitness center is fairly well stocked as well. PROS: decent light food and drinks in Club Level lounge. Good fitness center. WiFi is 12 Euro a day which is cheaper than other hotels (although it should also be free). CONS: Inconvenient public transport. Small bathrooms. No Air Conditioning except in summer. Outdated building and room style. Outdated TVs. SMALL in room safe - cannot fit small laptops even. I think there are better options for your stay in Rome - especially if you are here for a vacation. For a conference at this hotel, I would still recommend you commute from a downtown nicer hotel. This was a disappointment.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Worst Hotel Ever!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This has to be the worst hotel experience I have ever had. First off I was staying as a starwood hotel employee. On arrival we were treated well and let into our room early, thats where our luck ended. The room was circa 1973 with hanging exposed power sockets shabby bathroom and that overall stale feel, its only bonus was the bed. Feeling tired after a over night train trip, I confined myself to my room and ordered room service. I ordered a cheese and tomato pizza and a side salad. What arrived was a burnt pizza base with just cheese, a bowl of chopped iceburg lettece ( no dressing) and dry stale bread. After complaining to a guest service agent I was confronted by a rude little man who pretended he knew little english. He told me because I was not itallian I did not know that a Tomato and cheese pizza came with no tomato! he left slamming the door and cursing me. The next night we tried the lounge bar, even more of a disgrace, it seemed because we were not wearing dead animal fur that we were not important enough to be served, we had to go and find a waiter for any attention. My club sandwich was okay but the pre used ketchup pottle with an old french fry in it was so revolting. After feeling very much uninvited we left happy to be leaving the next day. On check out we asked to talk to a manager, we meet with the duty manager that was on at the time, she basically said because I worked for starwood hotels I should not expect as good a service as regular guests she basically told us to get lost! in a very typical itallian way. My advice is do not even bother with this place I do not know how it servives.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I know prices in rome are on the high side, but this place is monopolising on the fact that they are next door to the EUR business district. Central Rome, yes, suburbia, no. A beer in the bar will cost 7EUR, whereas in central rome, at places the locals will visit, you will pay 4EUR. The place generally looks run down and my room was very tired. Not very attractive although I have stayed in worse. It did seem to be clean, but as some of the rooms are smoking, I could still smell the smell of cigarettes in my non-smoking room. There was one bottle of water in the minibar, nothing else. Fine, but I could not find anywhere if it was free or to be paid for. My colleagues told me it was to be paid for which I thought was mean given that you can't drink the tap water. The gym is ok, but the pool was closed. Why? Not everyone finds a 15degC temp too cold. My room seemed to be above a function suite and at 0230 every monrning I awoke to a resounding solo vocal guitarist. Very good, but not at that time. My complaint was dismissed with a sorry, but nothing else. I would not stay at this place again. If you think that because it is a sheraton, it will be ok, then think again. I've stayed at Sheraton all over, but this was the worst given that it is supposed to be 4 or 5 star. Poor show Sheraton. Oh and the wi-fi is expensive. I've stayed in many places these days with free wi-fi - you got to pay at least 15EUR a day for it. Not even a free PC in the reception to just check for emails. And it is not even registered with iPass so you got to pay. Poor show Sheraton - obviously trying to liberate as many EURs from my pocket as possible, unashamedly</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Clean, american style hotel. Plan for time getting into the city center”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros - Staying on the club floor, which included breakfast, snacks, and drinks in the evening made this hotel worth the drawback of the distance from everything. With the exchange rate being awful and the cost of things in Italy it was a plus to have breakfast everyday in the club lounge and on those evenings were we got in late - a snack or drink and bed made life easier. The staff in the club lounge were very friendly and helpful, especially Said and Mara. We had turn down service in our room, my daughter especially loved the chocolates. One night we came home to find fresh fruit, another a bottle of Chianti. The shuttle from the airport for 5 euros per person is a great deal. The shuttle into the city for 3 euros also a great deal - although it could have run more often. There are 3 city buses that pick up right in front of the hotel - when the timing of the shuttle didn't work well. All and all, the location was not great but the options for getting into the city work well. Cons - It's on a freeway ramp. We were there in the in between season, heat off, AC not on so the rooms were warm and when we opened windows - noise from the freeway. The staff at the front desk - not so helpful. We found they gave us incorrect information or just did not know the answers to many things. Getting into the city was pretty easy but plan for more time than you think you'll need - it takes a while to get everywhere. Traffic is horrendous so factor that in. Free Internet if on a club floor - very handy. Overall, a good choice for seeing Rome if you are on a budget and are not daunted by the thought of trying out the public transit systems. Rooms are roomy and clean, staying on the club floors (SPG) a must. Nice bar and good food in the restaurant.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A very pleaset stay, Cant wait to go back!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Arrival I would recommend booking a taxi to find the hotel as the Sheraton is quite a trek from Fumicino Airport. On arrival we were greeted with a very pleasent receptionist, who spoke very good English (all staff were helpful, kind and pleasent). The Hotel offered a Bed and Breakfast deal which was very good, however, we booked a club room on the 5th Floor, this meant we were able to access the Club Lounge (Located on the 6th Floor), we were treated with complimentary Wine, soft drinks, snacks, coffee, tea etc from 6am - 11pm. The hotel resturant was very good, offered some lovely meals, however, a little pricey. Pizza's around 10 Euros, Pasta around 13 Euros. Hotel room was extremely clean and tidy with T.V/ mini bar (Quite pricey, however very useful if desperate) telephone and wi-fi (Wi-fi was 12 Euro's per 24hours, altough a deal was offered for your stay). The Hotel is situated in the EUR district, which is about 20mins from the city centre (by bus). The hotel offers a coach service into the centre several times a day (always on time). If you'd rather, the metro train station is about a 5-10 mintue walk from the hotel). Again, Staff were more than willing to help direct you to the station. Surrounding Area Walking distance to several churches/monuments. A lovely pool and decking area - the pool was unfortunately closed during our stay as a flim crew was using it for a couple of their shots, however, the decking area was open almost 24hours a day. The hotel also has a shop (situated in the lobby) which sells, mints, chewing gums, chocolate, cigerettes, magazines and other 'gift shop' items such as magnets, keyrings, book marks, T-Shirts etc. The shop does not sell drinks.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for a total of 3 nights in June and overall it was a very comfortable and enjoyable stay. Our first night was included as the last night of a tour and we had separately booked a further 2 nights ourselves via the website. We had sent an email to the hotel explaining, but were a little apprehensive about possible stuff-ups - but no, on arrival they had us booked for the same room for the 3 nights. Price for the extra 2 nights was very reasonable by Rome standards. Our room (1081) was large and very comfortable, although a long hike from the lobby. The standard of fit-out was fine. The bed was a bit soft for my liking as were the pillows, but they provided extras of those. There was a safe provided and an old-style TV. Minibar was locked. The room was very dim - we never did figure out how to turn on the standard lamp. The shower was in the bath - used a curtain. 1 hour Internet for free (per day) was available in the lobby on their PCs - this was very slow. The hotel is situated roughly halfway between the city & the airport so is a fair way from anything - we were a little worried about being a captive audience, but we were pleasantly surprised to find the buffet dinner to be good and reasonable value. Wine prices were not outrageous either and coffees were very reasonably priced. Breakfast was very good and included with a good range - even bread for toast! (Something of a novelty for us after 2 weeks in Italy.) They provide a regular shuttle bus to/from the city for 3 Euro each which was good value however we discovered the shuttle doesn't run Saturdays - and presumably Sundays either. (This wasn't anywhere on the brochure provided by reception.) When it came time to go to the airport at 5.30am, there was no problem with getting a taxi - several were outside at all times. Maybe we were lucky, but based on our experience we wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is a long way from downtown Rome and all the sights. You can take a 30 minute complimentary shuttle from the hotel, but it does not run that frequently and drops you off at a somewhat inconvenient location. In addition, during busy times they do not guarantee you a spot on the bus, ie. it is first come, first serve. The rooms were nice and large with comfortable beds and a big bathroom. The staff were the RUDEST staff I have encountered at any hotel I have ever stayed at, including some awful American chains back in the day. On the surface they were polite, but the moment you needed anything they became impolite. For example, one night I called down for a wake up call (since there are no clocks in the room). The phone rang at the front desk for 10 minutes without anyone answering. Assuming they were busy, my wife went downstairs only to find the two front desk clerks sitting down doing nothing, while the phone was ringing right next to them. They also programmed our keys for only one night and so we were temporarily locked out of our room the second night. They made us wait to get the key changed and were not all apologetic. We asked the concierge to book us a meal at an authentic restaurant, and when we went it was one of the more touristy places in rome. They had only 3 different menu touristicos that you could order. Also, beware that they often tell you breakfast is included when you check in. However, this is only for preferred Starwoods members. We went to eat and luckily asked before sitting down, because breakfast is 25 euros per person. They were very rude when we asked about the complimentary breakfast and again made us wait and were unhelpful. We ran into another couple who had this same problem. It is now clear to me why this Sheraton has such great rates- it is an awful hotel. The rooms cannot make up for the horrendous staff, long waits and poor location. Stay at your own risk!</p></li>
