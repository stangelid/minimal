<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a fantastic city break in this hotel. It is very convinient located - just a few minutes from the Spanish stairs and via Condotti. It is a very charming and historic Grand Hotel. The staff is exceptionally friendly, the room was very clean. I already had better breakfasts in other hotels, but the view from the top floor is breath-taking. There was piano player and a live singer in the evening in the bar.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a luxury hotel, with excellent location, in the posh via Veneto area, walking distance from the Spanish steps. It is expensive, but it allows you to have breakfast in the magnificent Terrazza dell'Eden which probably enjoys the best views of Rome. The decor is classic, with marbles and statues. The rooms are small but very well equipped (Penhaligon's toiletries) and the bathrooms are new. Rooms are made twice a day.</p></li>

It was extremely loud due to the noise underneath and woke me up on a regular basis. The hotel itself is lovely, the staff is impecible and the location can't be beat. I will certainly return to the hotel but I will try not to stay on the 1st floor again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed for 3 nights at the end of March. There is no doubt that this hotel leaves one's wallet much lighter by the end of the visit. I found the service to be very good and the rooms were well-appointed and comfortable. But there is nothing that is "value" in this hotel, down to the EUR 6 for the small bottle of water in the mini-bar. The hotel's location can't be beat, but there are definitely places to go for better value and equivalent amenities. But despite the prices, a drink in La Terrasse (sp?) bar on the 6th floor at sunset is a MUST.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived in Rome after 3 days in Venice. After the train ride and the long line for a taxi, we just wanted a place to re-group before heading to Spain. What we got was beyond our expectations. We were given an upgrade - which turned out to be a lovely suite! The location is great: about a 5 minute walk to the top of the Spanish steps. The staff is courteous and helpful. There is also a business center with 2 computers and printers - no additional charge. Whatever you do, don't miss breakfast. The view from the sixth floor dining room is fantastic!</p></li>

The concierge desk was especially helpful, my Mother-In-Law has to have a Gluten Free diet and they were so accommodating with great suggestions and handling our dinner reservations requests.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very expensive hotel with terrific views and location, tucked off a discreet street corner. Elegant styling with fine antiques. Tiny elevators. Room boasted high ceilings, bold mouldings, dramatic draperies and chandelier. Large marble bath with poor wattage vintage lighting and narrow vintage tub that was an uncomfortable shower for two. Equally expensive restaurant (95 Euros for wine and appetizer) but uncompromised views of Rome. Staff were refined and attentive. There are many lovely and less pricey accomodations in Rome with a hotel, church and gelateria at nearly every block.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel in March for a business trip, but brought my husband and toddler with me. The hotel was very nice, especially for Rome. The room was a bit on the small side, but had everything one would need/want. The only problem we had was that there was virtually no water pressure, leading to very little (if at all) water for a shower. When there was water, it was very difficult to control its temperature, leading to some scalding moments. The staff were very nice. The hotel states that it is near the Spanish Steps...they are quite a hike away. However, the hotel is in a nice, quiet area.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Eden March 4 - 11, 2012. Everyone at the hotel, particularly the desk staff and the concierge, is friendly and quite helpful. The location is fantastic -- just below the Borghese Gardens, and a short walk to either the Spanish Steps or the Via Veneto. And, as others have commented, the views from the top floor restaurant are delightful. We were staying at the hotel using Starwood points, but from the moment we arrived until our departure, we felt like honored guests. Our room, a "deluxe double," had two terraces and a walk-in closet and was very quiet and comfortable. Very highly recommended.</p></li>

We enjoyed starting the morning with breakfast overlooking Rome and St. Peter's. Everything was up to expectations except for two areas: The sheets on the bed were extremely rough and scratchy, my husband had a hard time sleeping because of it. The breakfast is ridiculously expensive, even for the most basic things like oatmeal, coffee and water. Other than that, it was a great stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading a number of negative reviews of the Hotel Eden, we were somewhat reluctant to stay here. I had accumulated many Starwood Points to get a suite for 3 nights. We were pleasantly surprised by the location, the hotel ammeneties, the friendliness of the staff and our beautiful and spacious suite. It is located in a residential neighborhood, a 10 minute walk to the Spanish Steps. Because of this location we did take many taxis. We only had a light lunch in the restaurant when we arrived. The prices in the restaurant were absolutely outragous. Therefore, we chose to eat all of our other meals outside of the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose Hotel Eden to be our escape from the bustle of Rome, but found instead a kind of snobby hotel that is still a little noisy and the AC not so good. We used Starwood points, and usually are upgraded. Not so here. We got ground level rooms, and the first room the AC did not work. I felt we were kind of shoved aside and forgotten. Generally, at a hotel of this caliber, I am followed up with to find out if everything is satisfactory. Not so here. The staff was reasonably helpful and the hotel is nice in a historical sort of way, but there is no pool and the food is terribly expensive: $70 pp breakfast! I would not return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved this hotel. We knew we had a week off for vacation but we could not decide where to go - next thing I know - my husband finds two business class tickets for Rome with points. With only a day and a half notice, American Express suggested this hotel among others. We are so glad we went with this choice for a number of reasons. I loved the location and how easy it was to get everywhere. We walked to Bernini plaza, Trevi Fountain, Spanish steps the gardens. . . everywhere. Most of all, the concierge helped us with private tours, train tickets, dinner and each time a welcoming attitude. Be sure to have an evening cocktail overlooking Rome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband took me to rome for a romantic weekend. A wonderful city. We stayed at the Hotel Eden. It is fairly central and we found it very easy to walk from there to any of the famous sites throughout the city. The hotel itself was beautiful. Quite luxurious, with excellent service. The only downside was the price!! We looked at the dinner menu and found it not only way beyond reasonable, but also a rather limited selection and nothing to our taste! We enjoyed finding little restaurants throughout the streest of Rome and have to say that we found some real beauties. The staff were helpful and the rooms clean and spacious. An ideal place to spend a romantic weekend.</p></li>

The room was lovely and spacious, the bathroom luxurious, and the staff extremely friendly.We asked the concierge desk for help and info on a couple of occasions and they tried to be helpful. Unfortunately they gave us slightly incorrect info, but it was not a problem.We used points to pay for most of the stay, so only actually paid (50%) 1 night.The hotel is very expensive if you are paying full price. It's location near the Via Veneto and the Borghese Gallery was a real plus,but it is far away from a lot of Rome, and taxis are very(!) expensive. The metro is a 10 minute walk.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here at the end of our trip and it was lovely to experience such luxury. Really. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. It was almost overwhelming to stay at this hotel. In a good way (I think). The room we had was comfortable and it was the only place we stayed at that had a bathtub which was lovely after walking around Rome all day!! We used points to stay at this hotel and I can safely say that otherwise it would have been out of our chosen price range. I did, at times, felt "underdressed" as I tend towards sporty/sporty casual. The location was amazing! Near the Spanish steps and the subway as well as numerous great places to eat at a reasonable price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 nights in May of 09. First stop after a trans-atlantic. Actually got a pretty sweet deal after a price match - ~ 250 EUR a night (spg.com will price match any other site). Ok.. keep in mind this is Rome. The front desk was friendly, we were escorted to our room, I had requested a room with a view (I suppose everyone does), but we got a great view of the old city outside our balcony - and the attendant pointed out that she had noted the request in the reservation. Didn't have an opportunity to try out the restaurant. Room size was fine by European standards. All the cabs knew the hotel. Bell staff was friendly. Had one of the upper floors - was very quiet.</p></li>

Our friends stayed in a standard room, which was absolutely nothing special, and quite dated. We had plumbing issues; when water was drained out of the tub it came back in through a drain in the floor and flooded the bathroom. They fixed it, but it was really kind of gross, and we had to clean up the mess afterwards. The location is a bit over-hyped. It is across the street from a lovely park, but you can't go directly across into the park. Instead you have to walk down about three blocks before crossing into the park. Also, the park can't be seen from the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at this hotel during our honeymoon and we had a wonderful experience. We arrived to find that we were upgraded to a larger room which was beautifully decorated and was a nice size (which surprised me as I heard the hotel was in need of a renovation before we arrived - so perhaps we got a newer room). The hotel has a gym, steam room, and business center (which was invaluable to use as we didn't do much planning before we arrived!). My only complaints are that the bed was not very comfortable, the sheets were extremely scratchy, and the staff other than reception were not the most friendly people.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was once a great hotel but has fallen to disrepair over the past few years. Its more expensive than many of the surrounding hotels and does not offer much more than the others. I have stayed here a few times before but will not likely stay here again unless they renovate. The best part of the rooms are the bathrooms, otherwise its much like the others. The hotel is quite expensive and the breakfast alone costs $75 per person, although the view is prob one of the best in Rome. My friends stayed at the Hotel Lancelot for about half the price and enjoyed their stay. Others stayed around Via Veneto and enjoyed their stay as well for less. Overall its an ok hotel in a good location that will cost you big bucks.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Eden Hotel is a jewel in the Dolce Vita area of Rome. When we arrived we were greeted by the most welcoming people, there was a smile on everyones face, and an offer to help with restaurant recommendations and any of our needs while we were guests in the hotel. The rooms were lovely and the attention to detail exceptional. The hotel is in walking distance of the Borghese Gardens and the area was quiet and peaceful after a day of sightseeing. There is a beautiful restaurant on the rooftop with a panoramic view of Rome. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, it is elegant and lovely and we would go back as soon as we can repack our suitcases. A special thank you to Fabio & the Bernardo's you are all fantastic !!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiance and I stayed here in May 2011. Check in was fast and friendly. We actually arrived early in the morning and they had our room ready early for us which was lovely. Our room was very very spacious. There was a little hall area which led into a very luxurious appointed bedroom with a small lounge area and a separate walk in wardrobe and huge marble bathroom. There were only a few little things which were not so great, the sheets felt like a rough stiff tablecloth. Bed was comfortable though. The hotel was very very loud. There were constant loud bangs from doors being slammed by other guests which echoed through the hall ways. If there was better sound proofing, this hotel would be up there with one of my favourites.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visited Rome with friends in October which i believe is one of the best month to travel in Ethernal city. We have chosed the Eden for its history, location, service tradition and the fine restaurant. Coming back home we can say, with our happiness, that we did the right choice! The Eden is one of the few classic luxury Hotel that is still keeping the secret for how to treat guests, taking care of them anytime. The staff is always there to help you, from the doormen, to the front office team ending with the bar and restaurant people. Furthermore, We had the most cleaned rooms ever had in any other hotel in the past. Finally we thank tripadvisor! Everybody now can share his personal experience with others...this is fantastic!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are searching for Paradise and you arrive in Rome, there is one way for your dream to become true: Eden Hotel. Rome is a city of history and miracle and this hotel has them both. A history, since 1889, and a miracle, given by it's location (very close to Spanish Steps), it's class, it's rooms, it's services and it's food. Bref, Eden is in the middle of Rome, so you are close to the city center. Rooms are fantastic: spacious, high, with fantastic furniture and very well equipped. Service is perfect: you will be pamperized and, bonus, you will receive a bottle of red wine with compliments from the manager. Food - up to 6th floor, where Rome will be at your feet with a sensational panorama. Is not cheap, but it worths every euro.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Eden for one night using travel points and prior to starting a cruise. The hotel is gorgeous and has rightly earned all of the acclaim. the location is great, just above the Spanish Steps, not far from Embassy Row, and near the Borghese Gallery. The staff are preposterously snooty. We tend to travel very lightly, so we do not take much and we most certainly leave anything expensive at home. The staff interpreted our choices as being lower class and treated us with a rudeness that was quite blatant. It was worth putting up with since everything else was terrific. In fact, it was rather amusing, so we started playing up to it just for laughs. Oh, and they give you a give of local honey. What a stupid gift for travelers!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There are more expensive hotels in Rome, but I don't know what you would be paying for. The location of Hotel Eden is great. The side rooms have great views, overlooking Villa Medici. Very quite and close to Spanish Steps and other sites. Concierge was very helpful in restaurant recommendations and arranging tours ahead of time. The rooms were great and nicely decorated. The twin rooms are slightly larger. The restaurant has a phenominal view, but very expensive. The workout room was small, but had very nice/new equipment with water bottles on hand. I booked this hotel based on other recommendations on this website and was not disappointed. Had considered a number of other hotels that were more expensive and was really glad I did not spend the additional dollars.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Eden in Rome is a lovely Hotel in a beautiful location but we certainly did not feel that it was worth what they charge. We were glad that we used Starpoints for the room. We did, however, have dinner in the 6th floor restaurant and brunch in the adjoining bar. We had read wonderful reviews about the hotel and restaurant but perhaps the chef has changed since the review was written? Our dining experience was a major disappointment. The presentation of the food, the selection on the menu, and the prices were very disappointing. We did enjoy the wine and the small pastries. We had 2 drinks and shared a fruit platter (very good) for brunch (a little more than $80). The room was beautiful and comfortable - a welcome retreat from the heat of Rome. The staff was friendly, the concierge was very helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I traveled to Rome for business with some time for sightseeing, and stayed at the Hotel Eden. I found the location to be incredible. It is literally a short walk away from the spanish steps, the trevi foundation and multiple metro stops. I found the concierge to be incredibly helpful and friendly. They really went out of their way to be honest about meals, transportation and tours. The room was plush and a decent size. The bathroom was very clean with lots of extra towels. The only drawbacks to this hotel...very noisy. I heard every door banging, every person in the hallway and our neighbors. Also, I was able to get a government rate, but if I had to pay the full rate, I would not have thought it was worth it. If you're willing to pay a little more for location and helpful staff, this is the right hotel for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I agree with the previous review in terms of location and the stunning views across Rome from the 6th floor restaurant and bar ,but the rest of the hotel leaves a little to be desired small basic rooms lacking facilities and most of all hugely inflated prices even by 5 star standards 300 + euro ( depending on wine ) for dinner in la teresa ,even though it has 1 michelan star it is not in the class of top London eateries in anything but price.28 euros for a jack daniels and coke and it goes on . In summary underwelming and overpriced.If your thinking about staying at the Eden my advise would be choose 1 of the other many luxury hotels in the via veneto area and visit the Edens outdoor restaurant which has the same view as la teresa is served from the same kitchen in my opinion has better ambiance and is certainly better value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A stay at Hotel Eden can set you back a fortune and I am still wondering was it worth it. We really noticed the small discreet additional things like every time you left your room, maids would rush in and tidy up, or leave chocolates on your pillows, change towels again, hang your clothes up. We never saw them, only sensed them which is the sign of a good hotel. The bar/restaurant at the top of the hotel has very nice views although most tables and chairs face inwards so it was difficult to make full use of this advantage. The breakfast must be the most expensive in the world - Euros 53 per person! We never actually braved such expense. Rooms were huge, very quiet, airy, lovely bathrooms with bath, all of which are unusual in Rome which was why we chose it. So def. worth it on this score. The concierge was very helpful and provide great unbiased recommendations.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a recent stay at the Hotel Eden. Also stayed at the Westin Excelsior during the same week. Must say that while the Westin is much larger and seems to have received a more recent update, the intimacy, and attention that you receive at the Hotel Eden make this the better choice in Rome. From the moment we checked in we were given the utmost attention from the staff, and as a Starwood Platinum member I was immediately given an upgraded room. The rooms have more character than the Westin, along with some great views of the Villa Borghese next door. While drinks at the hotel bar might be expensive there isn't a better view of St. Peter's Basilica at night. If I had to find one fault with this hotel it would be in the recommendation given for dinner on a Sunday night in Rome. The recommendation wasn't great, but again this is the only fault I found.</p></li>

The service is really good and all the staff are really nice, they're always happy to help. The hotel is very close to the spanish steps, if you need any help with directions then just as someone at reception and they will all be happy to help (and they also give you a map). Our room was great, we always had the room warm and it was cleaned quite regularly, the only small problem were the sheets and covers of the bed, I felt they were really rough on the skin but apart from that everything was great. There are many cool cafe's just outside and shops too so I recommend having break fast and lunch over there because the hotel restaurant is not cheap, although i advise you it once because the food is good and the view from the window is even better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staff very friendly, helpful and courteous in all areas of the hotel. Always helps to contribute to an enjoyable visit. I stayed 8 nights. Outstanding panoramic views across the whole of Rome from the restaurant/bar area on the top floor. Good breakfasts and restaurant food.Excellent friendly and discreet bar staff. Attractive bathroom and walk-in wadrobe area. I was probably in a mid-range room. It was comfortable overlooking the front second/third floor. Nice prints on the walls. 6/7 mins to the nearest underground and similar to Spanish steps. Can reach all areas of Rome fairly easily and all the trendy shopping areas nearby. As in all hotels would like access to my own small fridge and tea/coffee making facilities. But I realize they rely on room service as do the Eden. Its an expensive hotel but still retains some charm and character and is relatively quiet and low key. I will visit again</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What really stood out was the excellent service and professionalism of all staff from check in to check out. The concierge service was incredibly useful and they made some excellent recomendations. We had a deluxe room which was very nice and clean although the furniture was dated and the tv was rather small. The old furniture does add charater but is not very functional. For example drawers were stiff and did not align. The bed was very comfortable and we were given a fruit bowl which was replenished daily. The location is good. Walking distance from the Spanish Steps, Via Condotti (shopping street) and Borghese park. We had the breakfast once as it was not included with our room and I don't think the breakfast is worth the price charged considering there are quite a few authentic cafes within walking distance of the hotel offering much cheaper breakfasts. All in all it was a very good stay and lived up to our expectations.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Paid 600 euros a night for a double deluxe room. I would never stay at this hotel again. Granted I have heard that most Hotels in Rome are a bit dated and the rooms are small but this hotel is supposed to be one of the best hotels in all of Rome. The bathroom was so small that my girlfriend and I could not stand in there at the same time. The sheets were so rough that we slept in our bathrobes all three nights. We had to fight with the front desk three times until they gave us our complimentary drinks that were included in our room rate. Rediculous! One positive was the bar and breakfast staff. They were very helpful and accommodating. And yes the view is very nice. However make sure your breakfast is included in the room rate because it costs between 35-50 Euros per person. At 600 Euros a night you can find much better. The only positive was that I received a ton of Starwood points in exchange for getting ripped off. Stay away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I reviewed the Eden Hotel last 18 October 2011 after our stay last 3-7 October 2011. My review was very favorable as we had a fantastic time at the Eden with the luxurious accommodations and very attentive staff. However I only discovered recently that one of my friends lost her mobile phone at the hotel. She had left it charging in her room when she went to meet us for breakfast at La Terrazza and when she returned, it was gone. She felt that it wasn't worth mentioning at the time because it was only a very cheap back-up mobile phone and the loss would have ruined our vacation. It was her husband, who wasn't with us on the trip, who let the story slip. I personally feel so disappointed because I really enjoyed staying at the Eden, and the level of service given by the staff (from the concierges, to the restaurants, to the front desk, to housekeeping and the door men) were exceptional. I had thought to return to Eden this June but my friend's experience has changed my mind.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed two days and one night in Rome before flying home after traveling for a week in Umbria. I used some of our Starwood points and booked the Hotel Eden. It is a beautiful property at the top of a hill near the Borghese Gardens, away from much of the rush of Rome. We were able to park our rental car right in front of the hotel since we were only staying for one night. Our bags were stored securely the first morning while we waited for our room to be ready and we walked the city, and also after we checked out and until we left for the Rome airport the next afternoon. As a Hospitality Instructor, I have toured many wonderful properties, but it was a real pleasure to stay in one that lived up to it's reputation. The front desk employees couldn't have been more attentive, and the handwritten note from our room attendant was a sweet surprise. Delicious chocolates and a lovely up-to-date bathroom with attractive ammenities added to our stay. I just wish we could have stayed longer!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Eden in October during a trip to Rome to celebrate my 40th birthday. We had just come from the Four Seasons in Florence which was spectacular. Sadly it was a let-down to arrive at the Eden. The staff was nice upon our arrival but not overly friendly. The room we booked was very small and the bathroom was absolutely tiny. The decor was dated and the bed was not comfortable. I will say the rooftop bar and restaurant have extraordinary views of the city. But that's the only nice thing I can think of about this hotel. We also didn't like the location -- I felt like we were staying in the business district which was not at all charming. We stayed before at the Hotel Minerva which we think is in a much better location (very near the Pantheon), has a much nicer and friendlier staff and bigger rooms -- all for 200 euros less a night. If you are looking for a luxury hotel during your stay in Rome -- this hotel is not it! Next time we will stay at the Minerva again or maybe try the Hassler.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed 5 nights recently. The Eden is a very stylish boutique hotel that is very well located -5 mins walk to the Spanish Steps and the main shopping area, but far enough away to be quiet. Our room was disappointing - beautifully furnished but very small and over-looked the " courtyard", which as other reviewers have rightly pointed out, is very small which means that you are pracically looking into another bedroom. Service was good. Sampled drinks and food in the Piano Bar - very expensive eg expresso €13, Long Island iced tea €22. Concierge was very helpful and recommended some good restaurants which were not as expensive as the hotel. I have no experience of other hotels in Rome - though I did have a look at the Russie - very modern, stylish and larger hotel. On balance I think I preferred the Eden but as a boutique hotel it lacks a spa and pool etc. Overall it was a very nice hotel but very expensive - this might be just Rome. I have stayed in better hotels in Hong Kong (eg Island Shangri-La or Manhattan eg the Pierre).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location was right next to the Spanish Steps and 2 blocks from the Via Veneto. The Via Veneto was mainly eating and not much shopping. You have to walk up the Spanish Steps to get to the hotel after shopping. Not easy. The hotel was very stuffy and the staff not very helpful. After asking if a certain restaurant was in a safe area they allowed 2 single women to get in a cab with a driver who spoke no English. He drove us out of the heart of Rome onto dark empty streets and couldn't find the restaurant, then started yelling at us until we could finally convey to him we wanted to go back to our hotel. Very scary! When we told the conciege we hardly got an apology. The concieges were not what I would have expected at a 5 star hotel. Our room was located right next to the elevators and definitely a disapointment. Make sure you know what room you are getting before you have you luggage delivered!!! They had great rooms, we just did not get one. Wish we had stayed at the Westin Excelsior. Would never stay at the Hotel Eden again while in Rome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Eden is in a great location -- easy walking distance from the Spanish Steps and other local attractions, such as Trevi Fountain. It's also a short walk from the hop-on/hop-off bus that takes you around the city. We checked in early in the morning and were immediately given a room which was a huge plus. While probably large for European hotels, the room was small by US standards. Nonetheless, the bath was modern and nice. Bed was OK. TV was modern. The hotel is on a somewhat major road, so you may hear some noise. Highly recommend the rooftof restaurant. Not cheap at all, but it has a fantastic view of Rome and both the food and service are spectacular. Make reservations early so that you get a window table. You will NOT be disappointed. Overall, the service is good, rooms are ok, but the price will shock you. Look at the location and the price and decide if this is for you. It's a modern, comfortable hotel located near a number of tourist destinations. Service was fne. Again, defintiely recommend the restaurant for an unforgettable dinner!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Eden is very stuffy and very proud of themselves to the point that I am not sure if anyone is really good enough for the staff. We are Plat. Starwood members and had to go through three rooms and threaten to check out ,before we were given a real room that you did not have to leave just to change your mind. The food and drink prices are very very high and the service and food were not great. Three glass's of wine and a cheese plate was $130.00 Two small pots of coffee and three stale rolls where over $90.00 american. When I saw the bill I challenged the poor waiter that there must have been some mistake. I called the room service manager and he told me that was the right price but would be happy to take a few dollars off if that would make me happy. Internet was $35.00 per day. If you just want to say you stayed at the Eden go for it but take lots of cash and drop your standards. I don't mind spending money but I hate being taken! There was one great young blonde lad y behind the desk and a couple of nice doormen. After that, forget it!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location is everything about this hotel, a short walk from the Spanish Steps and not far from the Borghese Gardens. The reception staff were courteous and formal. The concierge is charming and efficient. Ask for recommendations, and you'll be well guided. The atmosphere is slightly more 'international hotel', and less old-style Rome than we had hoped. Rooms are clean, generous and well fitted, though we asked for a quieter room and so found ourselves looking into the light well. If you want views, you risk the noise, but we would do that then next time. The great plus here is that fabulous roof restaurant and terrace. You have views over a Rome that dreams are made of, past the grand villas and on towards the Forum, the Vatican...everything. None of this comes cheap, but it is worth the cash for the luxurious location with a glass of champagne at cocktail hour; or a pot of coffee at breakfast - to plan your day with the guide book and look up to chart your route. A great base for a long weekend stay, but not necessarily a hotel to hang out in.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was elegant and serviceable. It was pricey, but I was looking for something a bit more 'standard' as my husband and I had brought his mother along with us for her very first international trip. The rooms were small but quiet and the location was great. The truth of Rome is that you just really ought to take a taxi to most places ... The rooftop breakfasts were divine and we had a lovely dinner up there one night as well. The staff were helpful but not obsequious which was nice and the concierge was very helpful. I would recommend this to Americans traveling abroad that are inexperienced or have little tolerance for deviation from American ways, but I would not pick this hotel again for just my husband and I ... not because anything was lacking ... just because I'd prefer a more 'hip' atmosphere. I stayed at Hotel Lungarno in Florence which is part of a mini-chain started by Ferragamo ... and they have a hotel in Rome that I would probably try on my next visit. I would like to say one more time, however, that the rooftop restaurant for breakfast, dinner and drinks was FANTASTIC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I came to Rome for the weekend while I was in Frankfurt for business. This was my first trip to The Eternal City. I lucked out with the Eden Hotel -- from the moment I walked in the door, the staff was perfectly charming and gracious. The hotel is on a small, quiet side street overlooking the park that surrounds the Villa Borghese. I had booked a Jr. Suite, and they upgraded me to the Villa Medici Suite which -- to be perfectly honest -- probably accounts somewhat for my very positive review. I had come to Rome to do a little sightseeing -- just where I could walk easily -- a little shopping and a lot of eating and hanging out. The restaurant on the top floor of the hotel is very, very good -- and very, very expensive (dinner will come to about 100 euros per person, without alcohol). I asked the concierge to make some spa appointments for me, and dinner reservations for the second night I was there, and I was very happy with his recommendations. The hotel itself is beautiful, very well-maintained and luxurious (linen sheets, for example -- not sure if this is just in the suites). I could not have asked for a better introduction to Rome.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Eden for three nights as part of a sojourn throughout Italy. It was our first stop and we were looking for something within walking distance of major sites and activities, but also quite and comfortable--a place to relax after a long flight. The Eden fit this bill exactly. Service was gracious and formal, but not stuffy. We made use of many services, including dry cleaning, and everything was prompt and perfect. The hotel was nearly full, but we rarely saw or heard another guest outside of La Terraza, the rooftop restaurant. The food and view were exceptional, as was the cost--one of the most expensive meals I've ever purchased. The room was luxurious and had all the amenities expected of a 5 star property, but it was on the small side. This was not unexpected for Rome. Hotel Eden, however, is not cheap, and while I recommend it highly, I think comparable experiences might be found at bed and breakfasts and other lodging for less money. In fact, we alternated between 5 star hotels and B&Bs throughout Italy and found many B&Bs that, while lacking some cache, matched the hotels in amenities and comfort for much less money.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Classy Hotel with Great Service- Restaurant is overly expensive”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is beautiful, perched on a high street, within walking distance to the Spanish Steps. The service was great and the mood was elegant. The concierge was always available and helpful. Rooms are on the small side, but nicely furnished and comfortable. The bed could be more comfortable, but I was able to sleep well. The bathrooms are tiny, but very elegant and clean. Excellent maid service, always coming twice daily. My main complaint lies with the cost of the restaurant. The quality of the food is very good, and the service was also friendly and efficient with a breathtaking view of Rome. However, I have travelled the world, and I have never seen such ridiculous prices for both breakfast and lunch. It is a wonder how anyone shows up there. A buffet breakfast for one person is listed on the menu at 55 Euros. A small lunch for four cost me around 250 euros. Very few people seem to attend breakfast and lunch, and the ones who do typically have it included with their room. I would ask the hotel, would it not help to lower prices? Then, more people would attend and less food would be wasted on a daily basis.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The ambiance that this hotel strives to reach seems to be-- peace and tranquility amongst the bustle of the busy city. The lobby has a small upscale boutique feel and the views from the restaurant on the 6th floor are amazing! (The breakfast buffet/service is also TOP NOTCH!) The front desk staff, concierge and bell/doormen are all very polite and helpful. Upon checkin we were personally walked up to our room. The 1st room we were given was on the 5th floor. It was very large w/a separate parlor and entry area. The window opened to an odd triangular shaped garden/shaft. I prefer to look out and around at the city so the front desk staff was gracious enough to move us to a smaller room with a window that faced outside the building. Our second room was clean and nice (large bathroom!) but definetly not overwhelming or outstanding.The view was sub-par to say the least. Being on the third floor our room overlooked the sometimes noisy street, parking garage with a view of the large tree and apartments nearby. My husband is a very frequent traveler w/SPG and 99.9% of the time we are upgraded to excellent rooms. My high expectations were dashed for this hotel stay. It is now day three of our six night stay and I find that I love walking into the hotel but am disappointed once in my room.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Five Star Hotel Lives Up to Its Rating”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 5 nights. The room we had, which was upgraded, was probably the nicest hotel room in which I've ever stayed. This is a 5 star hotel, so you get the 5 star elegance, glamour and prices. The check in desk attendant showed us to our room personally. Our room had two watercolors on the wall by a world famous 19th century English painter of masterpieces. The room was absolutely lovely, overlooking a nearby private villa/park area. It was large, with a spacious bathroom outfitted in marble floors, walls and counters. The hotel lavishes amenities on its guests. The hotel is near the Spanish Steps, a convenient walk. American Embassy is in walking distance, as is the Trevi Fountain and Veneto shopping area. I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The concierges were most helpful. There is free internet/computer access in the business center. We went up to the highly acclaimed rooftop bar and had wonderful cocktails and appetizers. The bartender knows his stuff and mixed perfect martinis, daquiris and whiskey sours. My compliments to him! The bar provides complimentary small h'ors d'oeuvres. We ordered a large appetizer or two to share, and we were so full, we didn't eat dinner! So consider having drinks/appetizers in the bar. The drink prices are high, but it's worth the experience and million dollar view of Rome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here from March 20 to 24. We decided to take the Leonardo Express to get to the hotel. The cost for both of us was 24euro from the airport. I regret taking the train because the train was slow and after we got off the train, we had a hard time finding the hotel. We got off at Barberini station and it was about 5-7mins walk (a little bit uphill and streets were narrow). I believe the Spagna station has a little bit oh uphill too. With all of the hassles that we went thru, we should have went with the $40euro private taxi. The checkin was fast and easy. We got a room at the first floor near the corner. When we open the window, the dumpster was right there. Of course, it had a bad smell. We reserved a double room and that room had a fullsize bed which i thought it was small for both of us but the bathroom was nice and spacious. The second day our bathroom broke. It wouldnt flush. They wouldnt switch the room because they said it was all booked. This problem continued for the next 2 days. They tried to fix it but couldnt. So we were stuck with the broken toilet. Until the last day, they moved us to 4th floor with balcony. This room was better with queen size bed. The rooftop restaurant was nice, had a nice view but expensive. The checkout was quick. This time we took the private taxi to Termini station. It was $10euro.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We decided to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversry by staying at the Eden for three nights.We chose it because it seemed to excel in its offer, has a strong history, with many famous people having stayed there, and although now part of a larger group (Le Meriden part of the Starwood empire) actually appears small and boutique-like From reading other reviews on Tripadviosr I contacted the hotel in advance and requested a room with a balcony. We were delighted by the reception we received on arrival, spontaneously congratulating us. Our room was delightful, situated on the 5th floor and with marvellous views of the Vatican area, and other famous areas. As requested our room had a balcony. A bottle of champagne on ice was soon brought to the room with a red rose and a welcoing hand written note from the manager! Such a lovely touch. We were very impressed with the overall quality of service, which was impeccable. You are made to feel like royalty! Concirege and reception were most helpful in giving advice on where to eat / visit. Nothing was too much for them. The restaurant was fantastic with stunning panoramic views over the city, and the food was very good indeed. On our last evening, we decided to have dinner in the restaurant La Terrazza dell'Eden and chose the Gourmet menu. It made for a memorable conclusion to a wonderfully romantic stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Eden is charming...from the lobby and it has a good location, true. These two things alone however are not enough to justify its expensive price. In its day I'm sure the Eden was a great place to stay, but it is sorely in need of a sprucing up. The room we were first given was awful. It in no way shape or form justified its €400 per night price tag. We had no hot water on our arrival and a lumpy bed (you could feel the springs when you sat). The sheets were terrible (I was told they were supposed to be fine linen, I just found them abrasive). We complained. Housekeeping staff came up and put a board underneath my side of the mattress to try and firm it up and changed the bed clothes to cotton. Unfortunately, my husband's side of the bed was worse than mine (those pesty springs again) and still, no hot water. Knowing the quality of other hotels we have stayed in in Europe and Rome in this price range we knew this was not acceptable. I complained again. This time we were upgraded to a suite, which was better. We appreciated the upgrade and the service provided, after all they didn't have to do this. I can't help but wonder though about other clients who may not complain loud enough, or unknowing Americans who think this is a normal room for the price in Rome. There are other hotels in Rome in this same price range that are actually worth it, this one isn't.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Lovely Hotel - A Bit Of A Problem with The Restaurant”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Eden Hotel was wonderful. The staff was very professional, etc. It's in a great location, i,e, by the park, but close enough to walk to the sites. No issues with the hotel actually. The problem I had was with restaurant at the top of the hotel: The restaurant has a fantastic view of Rome. I called the concierge to make a reservation for 2 at 8:00 pm by the window - so I had the view while eating. The concierge said that they had 7:00 pm available - but I had to be out by 8:30 pm. Or I could opt for 9:30 pm with no restrictions and I could have a window table. I opted for the 9:30 pm reservation. When I arrived, the host wanted to sit me in the back of the restaurant with no view. I explained that the concierge reserved a window table, and that I waited for the 9:30 reservation with that intention. The host said "that isn't possible", because those tables were already reserved. Two tables with a window view were open. I pressed, and the host finally sat me at a table per my reservation. Later that night, only one other group was seated after us - that was a couple who just ordered dessert. In retrospect I don't understand what the drama was about. Given the reputation of the chef and the price range of the menu, I would have expected something more professional with less haggling. The best restaurants stick to their commitment and make you feel welcome from beginning thru end.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">my wife and i have just some back from a 5 night break over new year to the eden hotel in rome. overall, we had a lovely experience in rome and the eden is a classically luxurious hotel, boasting a grand history of hosting celebrities such as Tom Cruise, politicians etc. Overall here are a list of positives and negatives POSITIVES great location- 5 min walk to spanish steps and via veneto Nice rooms- very warm given the january cold and nicely furnished lovely breakfast in top floor restaurant- great views over rome good concierge- esp guy with brown hair, others a bit mixed New yr's eve in the bar- views of fireworks all over rome for 20 miles- amazing! NEGATIVES very expensive for drinks and restaurant obscenely expensive, even for a 2star rest 850 euros per person for new years eve- indeed all of rome a rip off charge of internet use- already paying top dollar for staying there not much there apart from rooms, no sauna etc some concierge recommendations a bit dodgy Bar very expensive Overall visited other 5 stars for drinks- westin did not seem that great- felt too big, more expensive and not worth it, prefered eden. Hassler bar was very old and needed facelift but even better location than eden. The eden is the grand dame of hotels iin rome so great to stay there- just dont expect it to be the best ever hotel you have stayed in although it has been voted best hotel in europe 2007!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Loved this hotel and it's location”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The staff at this hotel is absolutely wonderful. After arriving from a 4 night stay at the snooty Le Sirenuse in Positano, we were overjoyed with our stay at the Eden. From the moment we walked into our room (That was upgraded through our Leading Hotels reservation), we knew we found a hotel we would enjoy. The room was beautifully decorated with various Rome artwork. We had some friends staying in a different room, completely decorated in a different, modern fashion, that made us want to see further room designs. The rooftop is a great place for lunch or just to grab a drink. When we ordered an espresso martini, Walter the bartender came over to our table to ask how we liked it and what improvements he could make, as he had never made one before. We recommended that he shake all of the ingredients together to make the "froth". 10 minutes later he arrived at our table with two incredibly frothy martinis. It is nice to see someone take pride in their work. The business center is incredibly easy to use, no codes or passwords like other hotels. The exercise room is small, but open 24 hours. There are individual televisions on each treadmill, so bring your ear buds. The hotel is a few minute walk to the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, high end shops and many restaurants. I would recommend a taxi for trips to the Coliseum and the Vatican. Our next trip to Rome will be sure to include the Eden</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is beautiful hotel and is very comfortable. Two things sincerely rubbed me the wrong way. One was the value of the restaurant. It was way overpriced! The stuffed zucchini flowers were amazing, but I payed 40 euro for an OK pasta dish, and 28 euro for a tiramisu parfait that had clearly been prepared in advance, and was still frozen. The breakfast buffet was also more expensive than the St. Regis, with less variety. We were missing a hairdryer in our room, and we had noticed the sign in the bathroom noting that it was in the desk drawer. After checking every drawer, I decided to call guest services. Before I could finish telling the woman we didn't have a hairdryer, she interrupted me with a grunt and an attitude saying "YES YOU DO, SIR! It is in the drawer." I then insisted that we do not ,and that I was aware it should have been in the drawer. She sighed and said she would send someone up. When the woman arrived, she did not have a hair dryer, and double checked to see if it was there. I felt like they assumed I was lying or was stupid and did not read the directions. It was really insulting, and by the time we received the hairdryer, we were running late for dinner. The correct response when I called down should have been "Did you check the drawer sir?" "It's not there? We'll send one up, I do apologize" When I had brought concerns to the desk upon check-out, there was an unsympathetic "I'm sorry." and nothing was done.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Hotel Eden - I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else!!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've been staying at The Eden for more than a decade, for both for business and pleasure. Each time I leave makes me want to return even more. The size of the hotel is perfect: smaller than a little boutique, but nowehere near large enough to feel like a big hotel. The location is nothing short of perfect as well. A five minute walk to the Spanish Steps, the Via Veneto, or Piazza Barberini. and it is extremely tastefully decorated. It's like staying in a private villa. Very elegant, yet very comfortable. What makes the hotel very special however, is the staff. Starting with the hotel general manager, Marcel Levy, and right on down, they are the top of the list as far as service and giving attention. We have a nearly four year old (this was his second visit to the Eden), and the staff in the hotel, in particular the breakfast room, made him feel like The Principe during our entire stay. Their personal attention, enthusatically offered, is why I keep going back. Same with the bar staff in the elegant roof top lounge -- offering one of the best views in Rome. They are all superb. There are always little things that could be better -- for instance having to ask for a room upgrade as a Platinum member when the hotel was pretty empty pre-Christmas. No need for that really, especially since I was paying a pretty good rate, not staying on points. But I chalk that up to the exception to the rule. This is a first class hotel run by incredibly professional, welcoming people. I doubt I'll ever stay anywhere else.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just back from a lovely long weekend in Rome, where we stayed at the gorgeous Hotel Eden which is located at the top of the Spanish Steps in a quieter portion of town, yet still in the middle of the city. The friendly and helpful staff showed us to our lovely King sized room looking out onto the street. The room had large opening windows, which I always love to see in a hotel - great to get some fresh air. The room had all that you would expect from a 5* hotel, including gorgeous Penhaligons Quercus bathroom products. They also provide lovely dark coloured monogramed slippers to slide into after your day sightseeing around Rome (which, of course, came home with me!). There was wifi for a charge in the room, but free wifi in the luxurious lobby - great to sit on the plush sofas and check your email. There was a seriously gorgeous roof terrace on the 6th floor, with amazing views out to all of Rome. Nothing is allowed to be built higher than the cross on the Vatican, so there are no sky-scrapers to spoil the view. We splurged on a cocktail on the roof terrace and were provided with silver dishes of chips, olives and nibbles - very nice. If I'm looking for a negative it would only be minor, the marble bathroom has the obligatory huge shower head, but no real water pressure - it took a while to wash the shampoo out of my hair. And, just for laughs, they have the most expensive breakfast I've ever seen in a hotel anywhere in the world, E53 for a basic hot breakfast for one person! Of course, we didn't order it!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has about 130 rooms but we rarely saw more than two or three other small groups of guests. The location is superb - near shopping and dining on Via Venetto as well as sightseeing (The Spanish Steps and Villa Borghese are both very close by). The restaurant has a solid breakfast buffet (though at 54 EUR it's not for everyone!); we had dinner there one evening; the food was superb and priced comparably to the breakfast (read: expensive). We were there at a very hot time (36C/95+F) and the air conditioning struggled against the high ceiling of our room - the temperature never seemed to get below about 78F. This was true in both rooms held by my group. Hardly a major issue, but in a hotel rooms that start at 400 EUR it's noteworthy. The small fitness center had excellent equipment, including dumbells, elliptical machines, treadmills, stationary bicycles, and Nautilus machines (leg press and chest press, as I recall). There is also a Turkish steam room and an aromatherapy shower; I used neither of those. Towels and water were provided. The concierge desk was friendly and helpful at all times and with several different people. The front desk staff and bell staff were as well. I checked the "elegant" box as part of this review. The hotel's guests were not necessarily elegant - ourselves included - as there seemed to be many Europeans and Americans on vacation in shorts and t-shirts. The decor of the hotel, though, was very elegant - lots of classical art pieces, marble everywhere, plants and flowers... all very tasteful and appropriate for the space.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great location, wonderful service, classic property”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A lovely, classic property perched on the hill between the Via Veneto and the Spanish Steps without the hustle and bustle of those attractions and 1 block from the Villa Borghese park. Being in a quiet neighborhood is a real advantage in busy Rome. At $380 Euros, this is not cheap but it is quiet and refined with outstanding concierge and front desk help. Everyone speaks English and is as helpful as they can be, including delivering boarding passes that I emailed to the front desk at 1:00 on a Saturday night. The concierge suggested a great neighborhood restaurant in its own secluded small piazza (complete with fountain) called Antica Osteria in the antique section of old Rome and it was very, very good. The chambermaids were prompt and thorough and the manager did me a personal favor by allowing me to use Starwood points for one night's stay despite not booking this option online ahead of time which is required. My room was spacious (by Rome standards) and had adequate air conditiiong which was important, as it was 98 degrees and humid. The room shutters keep out all noise. The bathroom was tile and marble with plenty of hot water and space. If you walk around the neighborhood you can find nice local places to eat and drink without dealing with the craziness of the Spanish Steps, Piazza Navonna, etc. There are also super small leather and fashion stores tucked away on the side streets here. The bar and restaurant on the roof is very good but pricey. Highly recommended and will return, especially using Starwood points. Be aware that this is a 20,000 points a night property though.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “4.5 Stars, Near Excellent Experience”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and i went for a belated honeymoon, This was the last 4 days of a two week Sicily and Rome vacation. Truly amazing property and stunning location, and a great way to end our trip. Our room was not a suite but it was relatively large and on the carpeted side of the building (so no noise problems like a couple of the other reviewers described). Also, we had a nice view over the gardens of Villa Ludovisi. The concierge was helpful and friendly but to be honest nothing out of the ordinary. Overall, it is really close to a full five star hotel but service was a little erratic, and for any extras you are going to pay dearly. They messed up on a wake up call, we almost missed a tour, and we got a bottle of prosecco and plate of fruits on the house, and they replaced the fruits every day we were there! Nice gesture for sure, but shouldn't the (inexpensive) bottle of prosecco have been in our room upon check-in anyway? I got an internet nonrefundable rate and to their credit, even if they did not treat us like visiting royalty they certainly treated us like regular guests most of the time (save the lack of any gift upon check in, esp. considering this was our honeymoon, see last sentence). It seems like between special rates, leading hotels and Amex vacations everyone there is on upgrade, so look for the deal, but it is definitely a worthy treasure and certainly great on a business account too. Of course, the restaurant was incredible and worth every penny. I must say it was some of the most attentive, yet comfortable service (and most incredible risotto) I have ever had at a restaurant.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I began our two week Italian vacation with 2 nights/days at the St. Regis Grand Hotel and ended with three nights/days at the Eden Hotel in Rome. We used our Starwood points to pay for one of the nights at the Eden. Upon checking in, the two desk women were disinterested in our arrival and appeared inconvenienced (it was 2 PM so maybe we interupted their afternoon break). We asked about internet service and were told it was available for 15 euro a day. As a Starwood preferred guest I asked if we were entitled to free internet service (the room was very expensive as well) and I was told no, nothing they can do. We were then led to a VERY small room, with a bottle of champagne, in a bucket of melted ice and a wilted rose in a vase along with a note addressed to another person. I said this must be the wrong room but was told this was indeed the room for us and the woman left, leaving the champagne, note card and rose behind. The next day we were having lunch near the Parliment building and a young American couple was seated next to us. As it happens they too were staying at the Eden and also thought the staff was rude and indifferent during their checkin process. The Hotel Splendide is around the corner and they fell over each other to greet us when we arrived to have cocktails at their rooftop bar called Mirabella. Basically, you have many hotel options withing a few blocks of the Eden and I would suggest you look at those choices because YOU ARE THE CUSTOMER and deserve excellent service. The only sour note in what was a wonderful vacation. We love Italy and look forward to returning soon!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My new husband and I spent three nights at the Hotel Eden at the tail end of a longer trip to several other locations in Italy. We found it to be a really wonderful, relaxing experience, mostly because of the personal and expert service. Some examples: - When we arrived a bit before the usual check-in time, we were greeted warmly and offered complimentary cocktails in the lovely rooftop bar as we waited. - Turn-down service was nicely done, and housekeeping seemed to have tidied up the room at least twice a day, including fresh towels. - We had a minor problem with the plumbing. When I called for service, it was offered immediately. The repair was completed within 20 minutes of my call. - I lost an earring in a taxi... The hotel doorman dug around under the seats of the taxi with the driver until they found it. Neither would accept a tip. - The concierge was very helpful. We were happy with our dinner recommendations, and one restaurant was really outstanding. - The rooftop bar was a great place to relax. Drinks come with a selection of various snacks, one of which was pistachio nuts. My husband loves them, and ate them all on our first visit to the bar. After that, every time we stopped for a drink, they brought him a big bowl of pistachios. They remembered he likes them. Yeah... I read all the other comments from people who found the Hotel Eden to be a bit expensive. It is pricey, but I wanted to share our experience, which explains the kind of treatment we got at this lovely hotel. For us, we wanted a respite from all the touristy crowds in Roma, and the Eden was a great place to be treated as a valued guest, rather than just another tourist.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked the Eden for a two night stay in September as part of my wifes 30th birthday celebrations. I cannot fault the service, location or rooms - we had a fantastic 5th floor corner room (504 I think) with a balcony, entrance lobby, walk in wardrobe and splendid views over Rome. As with other reviewers, having arrived before our room was ready we were escorted to the roof top terrace for complimentary drinks - Vintage Krug champagne went down rather well as a start to our break. The head concierge, a vital part of a well run establishment, was courteous, charming and efficient and recommended two superb restaurants during our stay, one tucked away in a back street for a light lunch which was exactly what I had requested. We dined in the Eden restaurant on the first night and had a splendid meal; having had an early start to the day we had crashed out in the room at 5pm and were woken by a call from reception at 7pm gently "reminding" us of our dinner reservation, my wife thinks she vaguely remembers housekeeping trying to come in for turn down and we are sure that they told reception that we might need a little nudge awake!. As part of our first visit to Rome, I wanted to walk around the city with a guide to show us the sights and the hotel organised this as requested - I would recommend this to anyone (guide was called John and made the trip for us). Yes the hotel is expensive - Rome in general is expensive, I paid €40 for a beer, two coffees and a sandwich, but was in a cafe overlooking the Colosseum at the time. I would most definitely recommend the Hotel Eden for anyone looking for a special place to stay in Rome, and would urge you to visit Rome if you have not already done so</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Hotel Eden for five nights and had chosen it in large part due to Tripadvisor reviews. It is rather pricey, but we got it as part of a package with our flights from Expedia so we received a significantly reduced rate from the hotel only rates. Our room was a double-deluxe with queen bed. It was very roomy and the bathroom was large and well appointed. Although everything was not bright, shiny and new, it was clean and comfortable. The sheets were crisp linen which I thought was unusual and would be uncomfortable, but we slept just fine. I was worried that since we were on the first floor that traffic noise would be a problem, but the drivers only seemed to love their horns during daylight hours. I would have liked to stay on a higher floor for the views, but there was not one available for our stay. We walked all over Rome and rarely used the public transportation. Hotel Eden has a great central location. It is on a hill so when you walk away it's always downhill and when you return it's always uphill. That makes the views more enjoyable, but when you are tired at the end of the day the climb seems steeper. We didn't eat in the restaurant on the top floor. It is very expensive (minimum 110 euros apiece plus wine), but we did go up there before dinner guests were seated and allowed to look around and take lots of pictures. I would agree with the reviewers who have said it has one of the most spectacular views of Rome. The staff was very helpful with any request we had. They were fluent in English and always friendly and gracious. Unlike some reviewers, I found them to be responsive eager to help. I would recommend Hotel Eden and stay there again if I am fortunate enough to return to Rome.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Honey Moon Experience”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Being a Young travelers on our Honeymoon we weren't expecting a fairy tale experience. We were right we found the hotel staff to be extremely rude and unhelpful except for the concierge. The other hotel staff acted like they were doing us a favor by just talking to us. They do not know how to properly greet their guests or even smile. Not sure if it was because we were young but this was our honeymoon and I am Starwood Gold member. We were put directly underneath a room that was having construction being done to it. We were woken up at 7 am to pounding and hammering for the first two day we were there. After complaint to hotel management Mr. Pietro his first remark was this hotel is open 24 hours a day and we cannot close it for repairs. I had to educate this highly ranked manager of a category 6 Starwood hotel that you don't need to close your hotel just do not people directly underneath it especially if they plan on hammering away at 7 in the morning. I had to complain to starwood corporate for the manager to even acknowledge my complaints. We then decided to cancel the rest of our stay and move to the Hassler hotel. Them Knowing this was going to be our last night there because of our horrible room location they finally decided to move our room. Our room would not have been changed if I didn't call Starwood corporate numerous times to complain about Mr. Pietro's Arrogance. Also the hotel bed sheets felt like sand paper , the room was very loud and noisy due to it being located in front of tour bus stops and having single pained windows , the restaurant had great views but the food was just average. Would strongly recommend the Hotel Hassler which is actually on the Spanish steps not three blocks from it.</p></li>

<li>After complaint to hotel management Mr. Pietro his first remark was this hotel is open 24 hours a day and we cannot close it for repairs.</br>
<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 0.548&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp<span style="background-color:#fabebe">SERVICE</span>: 0.330&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>I had to educate this highly ranked manager of a category 6 Starwood hotel that you don't need to close your hotel just do not people directly underneath it especially if they plan on hammering away at 7 in the morning.</br>
<span style="background-color:#f032e6">OTHER</span>: 0.538&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp<span style="background-color:#fabebe">SERVICE</span>: 0.151&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 0.146&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>I had to complain to starwood corporate for the manager to even acknowledge my complaints.</br>
<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 0.653&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp<span style="background-color:#fabebe">SERVICE</span>: 0.347&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>We then decided to cancel the rest of our stay and move to the Hassler hotel.</br>
<span style="background-color:#f032e6">OTHER</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Them Knowing this was going to be our last night there because of our horrible room location they finally decided to move our room.</br>
<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 0.877&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Our room would not have been changed if I didn't call Starwood corporate numerous times to complain about Mr. Pietro's Arrogance.</br>

<li>Also the hotel bed sheets felt like sand paper , the room was very loud and noisy due to it being located in front of tour bus stops and having single pained windows , the restaurant had great views but the food was just average.</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 0.941&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Would strongly recommend the Hotel Hassler which is actually on the Spanish steps not three blocks from it.</br>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great hotel with a great staff! It is walking distance to everything! Literally 1 block away from the Spanish Steps, which was great as we relaxed there almost each night. Right across the street of Villa Borghese. Walking distance to the Piazza del Popolo (7 min), Trevi Fountain (15 min), Colosseum (25-30 min), Pantheon and Piazza Navona (20 min), Piazza della Repubblica (25 min) and Vatican (was 1 hour and would not recommend it). We checked into the hotel the lobby is truly old world...marble throughout the lobby, the finest wood and silks used for furniture, this hotel has a lot of class. Even the elevators had the old world charm as they were smaller and could only accommodate about 4 people comfortably. We were escorted up to our room on the top floor where we had small terrace with magnificent view of the tops of the Trinità dei Monti, with Basilica di San Pietro in the background...it made for some of the most amazing sunsets. The restaurant at the top of the hotel, La Terrazza, easily has the best views of the city! The price for dinner is expensive so we opted to have drinks and watch the sunset up their one night, one of our most memorable evenings. The staff was very courteous, professional and was more than willing to take our photographs multiple times. Overall, this is a great hotel and yes is it expensive as it is a Luxury Hotel, but is worth the price for the charm, staff, views and location. The Concierge was by far the most knowledgeable that we had on any of our trips and was very helpful. Departing Roma we needed to take the train to Napoli and he helped organize everything for our trip. He could have easily charges us to do it himself, instead he took the time to tell me what I needed to do and printed all the train time tables.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed for two nights while touring Italy. We wanted to stay at top hotels as we were willing to splurge and really celebrate on this trip. The concierge was friendly, informative and attentive. The lobby impressive and clean. Restaurant/bar/garden on top floor was elegant with beautiful views of the city. However, the size of our deluxe room very disappointing ... quoted at @ 344 feet, it felt like a box with no extra sitting area/space. We expected a bigger bedroom/living space for this very pricy, deluxe room that was advertised as spacious. The balcony had french windows that opened up to a large window ... not a true balcony to sit out on, which we had hoped for. The bathroom and closet area was roomy and that must have made up much of the square footage. Additionally, the room faced the street and both mornings at @ 6 a.m. you could hear the garbage and recycling trucks across the street doing their thing for about 15-20 minutes, which really annoyed us since we wanted to sleep in a bit. Aside from that, great location. We had some odd encounters too ... like upon arrival they could not accommodate an early check in as requested (@10:30 a.m.) and were told to come back around 2 pm. Upon our return, we were very excited to shower since it had been a long trip. Unfortunately, a water pipe had burst at that moment and we could not use water for about two hours. When we checked out a false fire alarm went off and we had to evacuate our room to the panic of alarms and announcements. All in all it did not feel like a 5-star hotel because of the room size and the price attached to this box-of-a-deluxe room. We felt it did not match the room description on the hotel website accurately. You can probably get more for your money at other 4-5 star hotels.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Grand Dame Hotel Needs More Updating”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently stayed here during the Christmas holidays. Location is great - within short walking distance of the Spanish Steps, Villa Borghese Gardens, Fountain of Trevi and much more! Closest subway stop is on the A Line at the Barberini stop (which is the foot of the Via Veneto). Hotel recently underwent some renovations to the rooms from what I can tell. I am a platinum with Starwood and since this is a Starwood property (part of the Meridien Hotel group) I am entitled to a room upgrade if available. Beware - i was given an "upgrade" to a shabby room, not much larger, had not been one of the renovated rooms... and the hotel acted like it was a nicer room. I called and had us moved to a room with more light, two windows, and a renovated room. Although it was in my original room class (deluxe) it was FAR better than the "upgraded" studio room. Pls make sure you get a renovated room if you check in here. The hotel is a bit "old" feeling for my taste and I would probably not stay there again. The doormen and bell staff didnt seem very attentive or helpful - they were rarely there to even open the heavy doors... Also beware that wi-fi service here costs 23 Euros for 24 hours - that is way higher than most hotels. One other note - the hot water pipe broke on one morning and there was no hot water for showers for many hours... not good on a cold winter morning. No letter or announcement was sent around to guest rooms until late in the day after it had been resolved - seems backwards in my book in terms of being proactive on service quality -- as soon as there is a problem like this, the hotel should have notified all guests by short note under the door immediately. On a bright note, the rooftop terrace bar was amazing in terms of views and service. the public lobby areas were also nice, including the fireplace sitting room.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed on our honeymoon trip. Overall, the hotel was a great place to stay with all the conveniences you would expect. Rooms -- Spacious room - we stayed in #511 on the 5th floor (side note - do NOT stay in #511 - it is right under the restaurant kitchen and we could not sleep a wink - noise until 2am and then again at 530am) -- more on this later. We got moved to #505 which was wonderful - spacious, clean, comfortable, great views and very quiet! Staff -- The staff is absolutely incredible. Every request was honored. When we had difficulty sleeping in room #511, Consuela, the front desk manager, promptly moved our room to #505, made sure that we did not pay for the one night that was noisy and even sent up a nice bottle of Champagne (in addition to the free bottle of wine they had already put in our room upon arrival). She performed all of this with an extremely understanding and positive attitude. The efforts they put forth to rectify the issue were much appreciated. You can be sure that you will get what you are expecting, or else the staff at the Eden will make it right. Location -- We took cabs nearly everywhere from here for convenience. It was never more than about 10 Euros to any location. The staff was very good at calling the cab so that it would be there by the time we got downstairs, every single time. Business services -- The have wireless internet throughout that works great. It is 15 Euros for 24 consecutive hours. Restaurant/bar - Nice location on the rooftop. Drinks were expensive at 19 Euros for average martinis. But that's the price to pay for the view and location. Live pianist did a nice job at night. Gym - Available and clean. Overall, a historic hotel, tons of history. Very classy decor throughout and spacious, comfortable rooms. Staff is outstanding. Would definitely stay here again!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “The Hotel Eden is an elegant smaller hotel with excellent service”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Eden is a really elegant hotel. It is located on a hill above the Spanish Steps. It is within easy walking distance to the Borghese park. I stayed in room 518 with my mother and teenage daughter. The room was large and beautifully decorated. There were two balconies, one in the bedroom and one in the bathroom. Both blaconies overlooked tranquil gardens and the buildings atop the Spanish Steps. The service was impeccable. The upstairs terrace is a relaxing place to have a cool drink after a day of busy Rome. The hotel is immaculate. The housekeeping is both excellent and inconspicuous. The bathroom was incredible! It was large, entirely faced in marble, and included every amenity. The doorman, concierge, and front desk were friendly, helpful, and full of Italian charm. The hotel and surrounding neighborhood feel safe and upscale. I was traveling with a senior and a teen and the Hotel Eden provided a safe and comfortable place to stay. We were in Rome in June and the city was hot. The lobby of the hotel was always cool and we could control the air conditioning fan in our room - not always the case, especially in Italy. The Hotel Eden is superb. I would highly recommend it. Helpful hints: There is a bank machine across from the hotel entrance where you can get cash. The hotel has an airport limo but it is just as easy, and half the price, to get your own taxi by waiting in the designated line at the airport. The concierge can book rail transport or there is an American Express office in the Piazza di Spagna that can help with travel reservations. One last note: Because the hotel is situated up a hill, it can be tiring returning home after a day of sightseeing. We took a lot of taxis. However, even though most of European travel is expensive due to the current exchange rate, taxis in Rome are comparatively inexpensive.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Eden restored my faith in the values of excellent customer service and 5 Star Plus quality in every hotel rating category. From the morning we arrived after several hours delay dealing with luggage left behind in Heathrow, we felt like well cared for guests in someone's private home at this lovely boutique hotel. Because of our Starwood Gold & Platinun status the hotel upgraded us, my husband and I and my daughter and neice respectively. Our room though small but normal by European standards, had a To Die For view of St. Peter's and the city. My daughter was given a lst floor corner room of huge proportions with an equally gigantic beautifully marbeled bathroom fit for a queen! During our 6 day stay everyone we encountered whether in the hallways, elevators, terrace lounge or dining room had a friendly greeting for us. The superb concierge staff and front desk staff at The Eden are the most helpful and gracious I have ever encountered in a European Hotel. But then, The Eden is less like a hotel and more like a home away from home. If you want to feel like royalty choose The Eden. The Eden once served some of the royalty of Europe in its early years, as I learned from reading a lovely little book in my room which told the history of this special gem of a hotel. I have to say a few more words about the concierge staff all of whom showed us genuine hospitality in looking after every detail of our stay whether they were planning our a visit to the Galleria Borghese or suggesting an excellent restaurant or trattoria known better to locals than tourists. The front desk staff and Mr. Levy the general manager, impressed us even further by remembering my husband's birthday with a delicious bottle of wine which we enjoyed from our balcony overlooking gorgeous Rome in the early evening. Rome is now a place I feel at home and almost intimate with, all because of The Eden.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved our 5-night stay at The Eden. This is truly a superb luxury hotel. Our room was one of the larger rooms, and was very spacious and elegant. The marble bathroom was huge and very nice, with luxurious towels, robes, linens and amenities. Everything was absolutely top-notch. Had we been on a higher floor (we were on the 2nd floor), we would have had great views over gardens, to church domes and other sights of Rome. As it was, we could see palm trees and other greenery, and the twin towers of the Trinita dei Monte at the top of Spanish Steps. (Be sure to reserve an exterior-view room. The interior view is not so appealing.) The hotel's location beside gardens and in a quiet area of beautiful, elegant buildings and greenery was excellent, and was a welcome respite from the traffic and concrete of the city. Most mornings, we walked about 2 blocks down the tree-lined and relatively quiet street to a small bar for coffee and chocolate-filled croissants for breakfast. This elegant and peaceful setting in such a bustling city really made a difference in our stay. Yet we were less than a 10-minute walk to the top of the Spanish Steps, and within easy walking distance to the Borghese Galleries and the Trevi Fountain. The service was outstanding, from everyone we encountered. After only one day, the doormen recognized us, and consistently greeted us warmly. The concierge's restaurant recommendations were very good, and in line with the price range of other restaurants we inquired about. We were made to feel like welcome guests each time we entered the hotel. The hotel had a smaller, more intimate feel than most large luxury hotels, which enhanced our stay. We enjoyed cocktails on the rooftop terrace at sunset one night, with a wonderful view of Rome, including the dome of St. Peters. This was my third trip to Rome, each time staying in one of the top-ranked hotels, and the Eden was by far the best! We would be delighted to return to the Eden.</p></li>
