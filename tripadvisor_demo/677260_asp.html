Everyone I encountered was helpful and friendly. I really enjoyed the history of the place. Be prepared, the bathrooms are kind of dark - but very well appointed.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When I think DoubleTree I don't automatically think it's going to be all that nice. I booked the room purely based upon the other trip-advisor reviews and the great deal I got for paying in advance. However, I was pleasantly surprised when we arrived and saw the hotel. It was extremely clean, very beautiful with old moldings etc and, given how old the building was, the room was very large and had a great bathroom. The only thing I'd change is the lighting in the bathroom. It was very dark and hard to put on makeup.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Polar Bar, on the other hand, is one of the best bars we've encountered in a long while. I believe most of this (if not all of it) is due to Viktor the bartender. Viktor is attentive, friendly, helpful, and a wealth of knowledge relating to the Arctic Club hotel. His drinks are delicious and well served. If you like Absynthe, Viktor will put on a show! Don't forget to view the Ballroom ceiling on the 3rd floor! We look forward to returning to Seattle and to our new favorite hotel, the Arctic Club and favorite bar and bartender!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for three nights and found this to be a good value, well located hotel. Room was comfortable, and service friendly. Lovely "Club" style bar & lounge which is good for a nightcap. Bus is just outside the door, and there is a good selection of restaurants and bars just down the street. Only downside was difficulty in getting a taxi one morning. The front desk had booked one for us and called again after 15 mins, but none appeared so we ended up just catching a bus! Staff mentioned that many taxi drivers don't know the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Arctic Club is a quirky ex-gentlemans club which is now a Hilton/Doubletree property. Wonderful charm to the common areas, great bar (and barman - Hi Viktor), great staff, good location - no real minus points for the business traveller who is looking for something a little different from the usual chain experience. Visited 5 or 6 times now - consistently comfy and no complaints. Wouldn't go there with kids - would feel out of place and the access has steep stairs which could be difficult for little ones. Otherwise - 2 enthusiastic thumbs up.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nothing negative to report. Staff was nothing less than professional and helpful (and friendly!). The hotel is beautifully restored. Ask for the sheet of paper that gives the history of the building, and explore. Great marble staircases, but they are hidden behind stairwell doors so few people probably ever see them! The location is good too -- close to some local government offices, pioneer square, easy walk to pike market, plus the free downtown buses stop right outside the hotel. All in all, I give high marks to this hotel. See pics of my room...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We really enjoyed our stay at the Arctic Club in Seattle. First, the location is top notch, netled right between two big attractions - Pioneer Square and Pike's market. Pike's market is approx 8 blocks away, but an easy walk. Pioneer square is approx 2 block away. The service was great. Although this is a Hilton family hotel (and you'll get your Hilton Points), you would never know it was a chain hotel. The interior is decorated with pictures of old Arctic Club members, the rooms feel like you are about to take an expedition to Alaska. Really a fun stay!</p></li>

The hotel is within walking distance of Pioneer Square, the art museum, the waterfront and aquarium, and the Pike Street Market. Every one of the staff, from housekeeping to the front desk and doormen, were absolutely wonderful. We will stay here again if we are ever in Seattle.

The location is good in the midst of Seattle. We had a town car pick us up at the airport from the hotel and would recommend this. I love the fact that there is history nestled right within the walls of the building of that hotel. Our room was large and comfortable however, I did notice much smaller rooms as I walked down the hall --assumably more economical rooms. Cleanliness was A-plus.

I picked the Artic Club in a somewhat random fashion and was glad I did. It's a really neat, classy hotel and definitely worth the money. The hotel was an old Gentelmen's Club (not that kind) that was later taken over by the City due to unpaid taxes. Purchased and rennovated in 2006 it really is a fun and charming place to stay. The lobby bar alone is worth the trip and the hotel staff is really friendly and pleasant. If you stay there, take a peek at the 2nd floor ballroom. The stainglass dome is worth the effort.</p></li>

The lobby and room were both styled as one would expect from a 100 year old hotel. A fireplace in the lobby with wooden accents, detailed molding in the room and a beautifully decorated bathrom contributed to an old world feel. Service was great and of course the warm Doubletree cookie upon arrival is a wonderful bonus. The hotel was a block from the Metropolitan Grill and about 1/2 mile from Pike's Market in one direction and less than that to the Amtrak Station in the other.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Arctic Club combines the charm of a renovated century-old building, warm service and very comfortable rooms into an appealing, somewhat quirky hotel. The valet and front desk staff greeted us warmly and the check-in and check-out processes were quick and efficient. Rooms are elegant, with high ceilings, moldings and great bathrooms. A real plus is the Polar Bar, where the bartender makes a perfect martini. It's a quick walk to McCormick's Fish House, a fine seafood restaurant. This end of downtown is a bit deserted at night, but it's very convenient to Safeco Field and light rail transit to the airport.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The feeling when you step into the lobby of this gorgeous hotel, is one of bygone luxury and elegance. The atmosphere is subdued and dark, but in keeping with the era, and the appointments are rich and lavish. We were warmly greeted. My sole complaint is that the room was a little over the top in price per night even given the amenities. The lobby is graced with a fireplace, reading retreats, a free pool table, a beautiful wood bar and an efficient bartender who creates great concoctions from the past and present. The rooms were elegantly appointed but the baths were dated, and there were no fans to clear steam.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in early august. Initial thoughts were that it was unusual but my teenage son thought it was cute. very clean, staff at reception were brilliant and very helpful. When we visit a city , we usually like a clean , handy , fairly well located hotel as we tend to spend very little time in the hotel. So a reasonably priced hotel is what we look for. Doubletree fits our criteria and i have no difficulty in recommending it. If we are ever back in Seattle from Ireland we will staying in the Doubletree. One lovely young tall girl at reception , never got her name, but she was so helpful to us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I really can't say enough about the beds. That may have been the most comfortable bed I've slept in. The hotel itself is gorgeous and sends you back to early 20th century. The renovations were done spectaculary, loosing none of it's charm. The staff were all expetionally friendly and helpful. I was a bit concerned by the most recent review before mine indicating a problem with bed bugs and so I thoroughly inspected our room before settling in and the only thing I found was an incredibly clean room. Honestly I tore up the bed, checking everywhere for the tell tale signs and found nothing. We slept wonderfully and had no bites anywhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just checked out of this hotel this morning. I really enjoyed my stay here. The room was large and well appointed. Beds were very comfortable. There is good security at this hotel; you must scan your card to get to your floor and in your room. I felt very secure. Staff was very friendly; offered me a cookie when I checked in. There was a robe and umbrella provided in the room. Location is great; lots of cafes around and easy walking distance to shopping and harbor. Internet is $9.95 per 24 hours. i stayed on the 9th floor where it is very quiet (for the city location). Thank you to DoubleTree for making my first trip to Seattle a good one!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great historic hotel. Completely restored. We had a hard time knowing where to park since we weren't from here. The bellman saw us circling and got our attention and told us about the free parking as an option to the valet parking the hotel offered. We had two queen beds and the rooms were quite large with a small sitting area and large desk area. There is a French press and coffee and tea. The bathrooms were also quite large with early 1900 feel. Lots of wide crown molding and beams throughout the room. If you want atmosphere, this place has plenty. The beds have nice mattresses, down comforters and pillows. Very plush. There is also a flat screen tv.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A beautiful hotel in downtown Seattle. Reasonable. $ Large rooms with historic architecture and modern amenities. Walk back in time in the former Men's club lobby and receive a warm cookie. Have a drink by the fireplace in the bar or play a game of billiards. Loved the ambiance of the entire hotel; staff, the grandeur of the dome room where my daughter was married and the 10th floor balcony rooms! We walked to Pikes Market & downtown shops. The only concern was the valet parking. While I new it was $32/day, I was not told about all the taxes adding another $9/day to the cost. Plenty of other secure parking nearby during the week, just not secure on weekends.</p></li>

The hotel was very cozy with helpful staff. My room was very comfortable corner room and a nice comfy king bed and nice bathroom. Others have commented on the hotel being noisy but even with windows overlooking the street and a huge gala going on in the hotel during my stay, I never heard anything the entire stay. The rooms were a tad small, lots of bumping into one another for two people in the room but that is typically the case in older, historic hotels. Great walking distance to everything -- Pioneer Square, Market, the stadiums....will definitely return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Artsy, Cozy, Romantic, Historic Hotel, wonderfully comfy beds and linens. Cool bar with great martinis--Ask for the "Gonzo", while you are playing pool or surf the net in the lobby level. Nice touches throughout, loved the leather club chairs, fireplace, walrus toy in room and warm cookies at check-in and at other times. Location is better for someone needing access to the business distric then for the shopping area. However very short walk to ferry terminal and bus stop right at 3rd Ave entrance. If you want to be nitpicky, only "downs" dim lightning throughout hotel, no swimming pool or spa and thin windows.Otherwise staff is super nice and helpful. Looking forward to my next stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived in Seattle around ten in the morning - just off the Amtrak train from Chicago.The reception staff were efficient and friendly - checked us in straight away with no hassle and a warm cookie. I was feeling really grubby and desperate for a shower before we set off exploring the city. Our room was lovely - and although it was looking over a busy street we heard no noise. I thought the room was very spacious and well decorated like the rest of the hotel. We ate a meal in the restaurant in the evening and the food was good.I would definately recommnend this hotel to others and would stay again if I went back to Seattle. I loved the idea that the hotel had an interesting history.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located on Pioneer Square, steps from the light rail station, this is a wonderful hotel in a beautifully restored building. The hotel tries to catch the ambiance of early twentieth century Seattle without sacrificing modern convenience. The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed. The staff is well trained, considerate and professional. Take a moment to visit the dome room with its leaded glass ceiling or just wander around the lobby looking at the souvenirs from Seattle's past. Connections to the airport through the light rail line are convenient and the hotel is in easy walking distance of museums and the public library. The famous fish market is a bit longer walk but is still easily done.</p></li>

Video on demand for a couple of nights in watching a movie. We stayed 13 nights... Restaurant on the ground floor a bit pricey for what it was, but there's plenty of better places to eat in Seattle. Would we stay again? Heck yes!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The staff was great. The room was very comfortable. The staff was very, very helpful and attentive. I enjoyed the Polar Bar and its very professional bartender, Viktor. It was a great hotel experience and a great historical experience as well. I felt like I had stepped back in time to a more elegant era. This wasn't like most Doubletrees I've stayed at (which have been just fine), this was a real "experience." The location in downtown Seattle was unbeatable. You can walk to anywhere; the train station is just a few blocks away, and light-rail to Sea-Tac airport just a block away. The waterfront is three blocks away, there are two Irish bars close by, shopping is five blocks away, and Pike Street Market a nice walk.</p></li>

The rooms are lovely. It you want the biggest, blandest, coldest, most ultra-modern room decor, don't go here. But if you want charm and elegance, this is a great place. But I mostly wanted to write a review because the service was so truly exceptional. I was in the room while my room was being made up and watched the care with which the bed was being made.

We found the hotel to be very quiet also which allowed for great sleeping. It was a bit cramped for the four of us, but we survived. The hotel was undergoing some renovation while we were there and great care seemed to be taken so as not to inconvenience guests. We enjoyed the convenient downtown location of this hotel making many attractions within a nice walking distance for us. The staff was very accommodating as well.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was a great choice for us. It is literally 2 minutes from the station for the train to the airport, which was very handy. It is not far out of town but I did not enjoy the number of homeless people heading away from town - so make sure you head towards the city centre and not towards the international district if you are walking around. Its very handy for Pioneer Square and the Underground tour though. The rooms are nice and big and you get a chocolate chip cookie when you arrive - which i appreciated as it was 8 am and my room was ready - hurray! The bathrooms are not very big but they are very nicely decorated. Most channels on the tv don't seem to work but there is a dvd player and a cd player with ipod dock.</p></li>

It is in a good central location..close to the waterfront and close to the stadiums. We were greeted and had our car parked and at noon, our room was ready. So we were able to get settled before heading down to the waterfront for lunch and some sightseeing. The place has an older smell, but was clean and comfortable. The Polar bar was a nice spot to have a couple of drinks after dinner. It has some good drinks options and very professional bartender. The hotel allowed us to keep our car parked in their valet lot until the game was over at 4:30 pm. Overall, we very much our stay at the Arctic club and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again on a return trip to Seattle</p></li>

The people make the visible difference, but you know that the room didn't get clean and the hotel wasn't spotless by itself. There must be a whole back-stage crew who you never see that make all that stuff happen. The front desk crew and housekeeping are the visible ones, and there wasn't anything that anyone seemed the slightest annoyed about our requests. They were completely gracious, warm and sincere in their demeanor, not a hint of resentment or arrogance. These guys are absolutely the best, cream of the crop.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Arctic Club Hotel is rare find in the numbing sameness of chain hotels. This delightful gem is located in the heart of downtown Seattle and walking distance to many of the night spots, sports stadiums, shopping, etc. I chose a corner, jetted-tub room. Extremely well appointed complete with stereo, flat-panel HD TV, wireless, and most importantly Starbucks in-room coffer w/french press! Staff is friendly, room service was delicious and prompt, and the Juno restaurant is a convenient stop for breakfast on the way out. I will be adding this to my list of favorite hotels. Can be a bit noisy if you are sensitive to street noise so be sure to request a higher floor room. Planning a nice event? Check out the Dome Room as a possible venue, it is really beautiful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a wonderful stay at the Arctic Club over the Labor Day weekend. It has the charm of an older hotel, but up to date in all the room and bath facilities. We had a room on the six floor which was comfortable and quiet. The bed was great. A/C kicked in and out a lot, but once I figured out how to have the fan stay on low it was better. The front desk staff were great with directions and any help needed and always offered up more of those tasty cookies! Housekeepers were great. Forgot our coffee a couple times, but were there immediately when called. Hotel is great for catching any of the mass transit vehicles and also a nice walk to the Market. Check out the ballroom even if you don't have an event there. We have no regrets and would stay again when we are in the area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is my new favourite hotel in Seattle! I have been wanting to stay at the Arctic Club since it opened last year, but the prices were too high. Since the hotel has been sold to Doubletree the prices have come way down, but you are still getting all the luxury add-ons - high thread count sheets, great mattress, nice fixtures in bathroom, and of course the great lobby and bar. The service was great - cookies upon arrival, and always greeted warmly by the front staff as we went in and out. We also ate at Juno (hotel restaurant) for breakfast - the french toast is excellent! The only negative was that during the day/early evening the traffic noise outside (we were facing the street) was quite loud. It died down at night and was no problem on the weekend though. I LOVE THIS PLACE!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've now stayed here several times on business trips. Doubletree (Hilton) bought and renovated this century-old "explorers' club" in downtown Seattle, and it is truly beautiful. The lobby, lobby bar, restaurant, elevators and rooms all have their original dark wood paneling and "Pacific Northwest" decor and ambience. My rooms have alrways been surprisingly large and very comfortable. The hotel itself is very quiet, though you may get some minor street noise if you have a west-facing room. The food in the hotel restaurant (Juno) is very good, and the restaurant itself has a nice, relaxed atmosphere. The hotel staff has always been very helpful and pleasant. An added bonus - the Pioneer Square light rail station is across the street - $2.50 from hotel to airport (vs $35-40 for a cab).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is one unusual place, festooned with carvings of walrus heads around the building and walrus heads above the room numbers beside the doors. They have successfully updated the 100-year old hotel and it is now in the Doubletree/Hilton chain, but the most unusual of them all, would be my guess. It's got a great lobby bar that was apparently stolen in the middle of the night by the drunken Klondike millionaires who formed the club in another hotel and were asked to vacate the premises. The rooms are very big and decorated in a modern version of that period. It's quiet, the beds are first-rate, it's within walking distance of both the ballparks and the downtown places like Pike Place Market. It's so nice to be in a hotel with some personality and there's nothing like this place anywhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Unbelievable charming remodeled historic hotel in the heart of downtown. Feels like you are stepping back in time to the early 20th century, yet the hotels has all the modern conveniences of today (hard to even tell is part of the Hilton chain). Accommodating staff, comfortable rooms (some may think they are a little on the small side compared to chain hotels but they are plenty big enough). Nice upscale bar (Polar Bar) in back of lobby the serves small bites, and just about any drink you can imagine. June restaurant is attached to hotel, did not eat there but looked amazing. Great downtown location, can walk to just about anywhere. Would be great hotel for romantic getaway, special occasion, etc. When you have a choice to stay at someplace like this among all of the other cookie cutter chains, why not? Will definitely be back to this place!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at the Arctic Club Hotel a little before check-in time and were greeted with a smile. One of the two rooms was not ready so we left the luggage in the other room and went out to explore the town. The front desk was nice enough to call us when the second room was ready. We loved the little details at the hotel like the walrus room numbers, the absolutely beautiful ballroom, the explorer decorations, the free internet and printing, and the warm cookies. We couldn't resist lounging in the bar area and partaking in the fancy-schmancy drink of the day. Our bartender made a champagne, vodka, chambord concoction that was delicious! A week after our stay, when we came back from our Alaskan cruise, we wanted to walk around Seattle, and the hotel staff were nice enough to let us keep our luggage in the hotel until we had to leave for the airport.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The light rail from the airport drops you across the street from the Doubltree so this was perfect as we didn't rent a car. This location to the terminal was also perfect for getting around Seattle. We stayed a week and were treated very well be the friendly staff. The lounge was large and comfortable with an old time feeling with lots of wood accents and a large fireplace. The corner room with the king bed was large and very light due to the 5 windows. The refrigerator was well stocked but we had to ask to get it re-stocked. The whirlpool tub was large, clean and relaxing. We ate several times at the attached Juno restaurant and found the food very good, although slightly over priced. The location of the hotel is within walking distance of most all the attractions Seattle has to offer. I would definetly stay here again and recommend it to my friends.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 3 nights over Memorial weekend. Used HHonors points and was upgraded to top floor, really a great room. Location was tops, at most 100 yards from light rail stop (Pioneer Square stop). Took rail from airport, so simple. Location next to old Seattle area and many restaurants. Walkable to most downtown areas, or take light rail further north to reduce walking. Parking is expensive. We rented a car for one day from Enterprise to drive up to the islands, they picked us up at hotel and would have dropped us back off there is we had returned by 7. Wireless free for Hilton Honors members. Free to join, so everyone should have a HHoners card.... Desk and bell guys were really nice and helpful. HHoners gave each of us $12 credit towards breakfast, choices were OK and well made. Ate outside for all other meals. Still get those deadly Doubletree cookies....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wow. This place is a hidden gem! I hate staying at the conference hotels when I go to conferences b/c it seems like they raise their prices knwoing everyone is on a stipend. I was lucky enough to book the Arctic Club for four nights for a conference in March. We had a great stylish room and a huge bathroom with great amenities. Our room looked out onto a construction site but if we looked up from the construction we could see the beautiful buildings surrounding us. This place had a wonderful attention to detail. My favorite thing by far was the room numbers decked out with walruses. It seemed a little off the beaten path, but that made the lush lobby all the better. We snuck around and looked at the domed ceiling ball room that was cozy and grand at the same time. The great thing was that the free downtown Seattle bus stopped right outside and I could get to conference for free!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had the opportunity to stay here during a weekend getaway, and were very pleased with the accomodations. This is a great old historic Seattle building that has been wonderfully restored and in a very convenient location close to Pioneer Square and an easy walk to the ball stadiums and Pike Place Market. The staff were all friendly and helpful and the room amenities were great....french press Starbucks coffee with enough for several cups, comfortable bedding, plush robes, flat screen t.v., and quality toiletries. Other than a little bit of street noise, it was very quiet at night. There's a very nice old high ceilinged lobby with the Polar Bar adjacent. It made us feel like we had stepped back in time. The Polar Bar was a real bar with a bartender who was a true mixicologist. The Arctic Club is a quality hotel, conveniently located, and reasonably priced. We'll definitely be coming back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Front desk told me they had a beautiful QUIET room for me. I guess I should know that when they say that they mean sorry we dont have an upgrade for you and this is all we have. Room w/ sofabed was very small and historic quality only vaguely quaint. Unfortunalty, it was so noisy (I could hear the conversations from the parking lot and I was on the 5th floor) I thought a window was open, but not the case. So, I had to move to a smaller room (as i said, nothing else available even for a diamond HHonors member) and paid the same amount for the cheaper room which also was not acceptable. So, my 4 night stay turned into a 1 night stay. The restaurant for breakfast was good allowing ordering from general menu with good service. Also, I wound up finding this hotel really out of the way if you'll be spending your time in downtown and near Pike's market. And, the fringe location did not result in a quieter location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at Arctic Club due to the convenient location and the reviews of the rooms and the Polar Bar. Loved: - Light rail and bus access with a stop right across the street. This made the trip to and from the airport a real bargain. - Easy walking distance to Safeco Field, Ferry Terminal, Pike Place Market and many other Seattle attractions. - General look and feel of the common areas and rooms Didn't Love: - The traffic noise. We reserved well in advance for a three night stay in a corner room and requested a high floor. Called again a couple days in advance to confirm high floor request. Went to check in early and were given 4th floor and told the hotel was sold out. After complaining a nice front desk person did switch us to the 5th floor but we were told that was the best they could do for our stay. - Rather indifferent service and only OK drinks in the Polar Bar. - Charging $9.95 for w-fi even in the common areas.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We will absolutely return to this hotel when in Seattle! The rate was very reasonable, especially compared to the surrounding hotels and given that it was labour day weekend. We checked into our room after having our car valet parked and bags brought in, and each recieved a warm cookie at the front desk by the friendly staff! We then were ushered to our stunning room, located on the first floor in what used to be an old Tea Room. The entire building is gorgeous, and used to be a former Men's Club during the Gold Rush days. They have kept much of the original architecture including the crown moldings and vaulted ceilings. Our room was beautiful with a jetted tub and king size bed (with great bedding!). We mentioned we were on our honeymoon and were sent a complimentary bottle of champagne. We also order room service which came fast with friendly service. The room was spacious, quiet and just what we were looking for! Can't wait to return!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I had our honeymoon in Seattle and decided to stay at the Arctic Club for the week because of location and very nice price when packaged with airfare. Service was excellent from start to finish and everyone was friendly and helpful from the doormen to the cleaning staff. The beds were extremely comfy and the sheets were changed every day. On the 5th floor facing south, thenoise from the street was definitley always there, but was never to the point of keeping us awake. The Polar lounge in the lobby was fun to hang out in, and the restaurant downstairs was good, but a bit spendy. Location is prime for those who are going to baseball or football games, or need to get anywhere in the metro as the St James bus station exits right to the front door of the hotel. Overall, I would highly recommend the Arctic Club for a couple or single traveler, it was a great experience, price and I will definitely stay there again in future visits.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Meh. No one was around to get our car at the valet (it was only 4:30pm) Room was very cavelike and small. The furniture and bath were however nice. The view from the window was a God awful black, huge thingamajig. The bed on the other hand was very comfortable. Juno's food was OK but the restaurant was dead on a Friday night. No wonder the person at the hotel desk was very surprised we wanted to make a reservation. Oh well. Now we know. The bar service was slow and rude in the evening. In the morning, room service took four calls before anyone answered. After repeating my order three times, they still managed to get it wrong. They forgot cups for the coffee pot, two items we ordered never made it either- and my eggs Benedict had eggshells in it. On a better note the French toast was very tasty. :) I don't think we will go back. We bought this room at an auction so we grossly overpaid. There are many other hotels in Seattle that are historical but much better.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We decided on this hotel for our one night pre-cruise stay and were totally pleased. The lobby area isn't anything special so as we checked in, I was a bit worried how the room would be. Not to worry!! It was absolutely delightful. The decoration and the furnishings were a pleasant change from the standard hotels we're used to. The bed was wonderful and the french press coffee pot was special. We used the light rail from the airport. You get off just a few steps from the lower entrance to the hotel. That's a deal too ....75 cents for seniors. The free buses stop in front of the hotel and we took every advantage of that. The desk clerks were very helpful mapping out the places we wanted to go and how to get there. They arranged a town car to get 4 of us with luggage to Pier 91 for $25. A taxi is probably a little bit cheaper. If you're looking for something a little different with the same amenities as the other upscale hotels, you'll definitely want to consider this one.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Retired and budget minded we are Holiday Inn travelers, but upon our return from the Alaskan cruise we had selected the Doubletree Arctic Club as our 1 night layover before catching our flight back to Philadelphia the next day. I can not say enough about the staff, the accomodations, the location, or the ambiance. A great bar, a magnificent bathroom, just a super place. Turns out you can ride the limo to the airport ($40) or better yet the airport express bus leaves from across the street (as seniors the cost was something like $.50 cents). The staff suggested it and even had a schedule. It is located within the "free transportation zone" of downtown Seattle and adjacent to the Pioneer Square area. Settled in 1852 and burned to the ground in 1889, Seattleâ€™s historic Pioneer Square District features 88 acres of beautifully restored architectural masterpieces, including buildings designed in the Second Renaissance-Revival, Beaux-Arts Classical, and Richardsonian-Romanesque styles... one of the largest collections of unique architecture in the United States.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Awesome rooms - unfortunately had a fire alarm malfunction”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked 2 rooms via Hotwire, and then phoned Doubletree to arrange specific room types. The staff was very pleasant and efficient, and arranged exactly what I needed with adjoining rooms. Check in was easy â€“ although the one way streets of downtown meant we missed the valet parking on our first pass. The lobby/lounge is very stylish and clean, but seemed a bit too dark for me. The rooms are awesome, and quite large and very clean â€“ except we found an empty water bottle from the previous guests under the window. Location is very handy to restaurants, subway, and a short walk to Pikes Market, Pioneer Square. Unfortunately, the fire alarm malfunctioned at 7:30am â€“ which made us start our day a little earlier than we'd planned on. But the front desk was so understanding, she cleared our valet parking charge for the inconvenience. The front desk clerk even asked the bellhop to show us the Dome Room, to help brighten our 'early' morning. It did the trick. One of the most awesome function rooms I've even seen in a hotel. All in all, and great stay. Highly recommend.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a beautiful hotel. it is a restored gentleman's club and they've managed to capture that vintage feel in the hotel and in the rooms as well. Beautiful architectural details throughout the building, the dome room on the 3rd floor was especially impressive. We stayed on the 3rd floor in a corner room. check in was a breeze, we arrived early from Vancouver on Amtrak and our room was ready. The room had 10 foot ceilings, lot of windows, beautiful bathroom, the only complaint I had about the room itself is it's too dim. I know it's in keeping with the atmosphere of the hotel, but I prefer a well lit room. Now to the street noise. Our room faced 3rd Ave on one side where buses ran all hours of the day and night, the bus stop was right under our window. we heard garbage trucks, recycling trucks, which all seemed to collect after 11pm at night. On our last night we were woken up about 4-5 times during the night from street noise. so although the beds and the room were very comfortable, our sleep was always interrupted. If you do stay here, ask for a room away from 3rd ave.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the second I walked into the hotel I was greeted with warm smiles and a friendly "hello." My fiance and I were staying in Seattle for just one night for the annual Seattle Firefighter Stair Climb and we were trying to find a nice hotel that was somewhat affordable for downtown. This hotel was not cheap by any means but it was reasonable compared to the other hotels in the area. The room was small but very clean and quaint. We were given warm chocolate chip cookies upon arrival which I absolutely loved! I really liked the look of the hotel and the old fashioned style. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were a little too soft. Also, the traffic from outside was loud and kept me up all night. Suggestion...bring ear plugs. Our mini fridge was also making a buzzing noise all night long, which didn't help with our sleep either. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room or at the hotel but the time we spent was pleasant. Always someone opening the door for you and asking if we needed any help or had any questions. We will for sure be staying at this same hotel next year.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived in Seattle via Amtrak and went to our hotel around 11 a.m. (About a six block walk from King Street Station). Our room was not ready yet, but they took my phone number and said they would call when our room was ready and would store our bags. Well, at around 12:15, they called and said we could check in. Our check-in procedure was very smooth and pleasant. The chocolate chip cookies hit the spot since we had not had lunch yet. Our bags were then delivered to our room. Since we did not have a car, the hotel was very convenient to Pioneer Square (about 3 blocks), the water front (about 6 blocks) and the transit tunnel (across the street). With the transit tunnel and the monorail, the Seattle Center (Space Needle area) was very convenient also. The room was a little smaller than I thought it would be, but was very quiet and the bed slept great. The overall service from all the employees we encountered was very professional and friendly. Definitely a very pleasant and relaxing stay. By the way, don't miss the view from the Columbia Tower (1 block from the hotel). Twice as high as the Space Needle and much, much cheaper.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First the down side. It's located several blocks off the beaten path in downtown and close to what is a changing area somewhat fraught with urban challenges. Get used to frequent police sirens and ambulences sent to pick up stabbing victims a few blocks away. Most of the crime is related to homelessness, poverty and alcohol and drug use and not aimed at tourists or residents. Seattle has always had a plethora of Native America, African-American and other street people. The economy isn't helping. So, with that out of the way, let me state that this is a lovely, well-maintained property. The building's history is fascinating, as are some of the decor items used throughout that were part of the original property. Front desk, valet and room service staff were, for the most part, professional, warm and responsive. Rooms are varied in layout, but well appointed and extremely comfortable. Nice big bathrooms make up for somewhat smaller rooms, but it makes for a very nice stay. The main part of downtown is a pleasant 10 minute walk away, along with Pikes Place and other tourist areas. Seattle is a great walking city so take advantage of it. Your body will thank you!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved it! I found it VERY convenient to get from airport to hotel and back from the light link rail. Pioneer stop is right across the street! $2.75/person and about 40 min. Nice and easy scenic ride. It was an easy walk from the hotel to the market and the monorail to get to the Space Needle. Hotel itself was quiet, clean, attractive and has a great staff. Our room was really nice. Very interesting hotel decor. Only negative - there was a "gift basket" on a coffee table filled w. snacks and a stuffed animal. Had a young child entered the room, he/she would assume it's free...we didn't have this problem, but I could see it happening to others. We had to leave our luggage with the bell staff coming and going due to our flight schedules--both young men were very helpful. We'd left something in our room at checkout. Hours later, they had it for us when we picked up our luggage. Their lobby has a bar and pool table, and best of all, a place to print boarding passes for free. The on-site restaurant was pretty good for breakfast. The in-room coffee set up is the best I've ever seen in a hotel. Again, great staff. Yes, I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone.</p></li>

As others have posted the building dates back to 1917 where it was once a Gentleman's Club. The decor throughout is of the 1930's/40's with the original crown moldings. The rooms have a masculine feel to them and are impeccably stylish. The connecting restaurant is Juno's where they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner, they also have a very nice well stocked bar however the Lobby Bar is the gem of the place. Viktor the bartender was great and full of information regarding the hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel and am looking forward to returning again. I was on the 8th floor and heard no street traffic at all, the beds were spotless and so was the room and bathroom. Upon reading some of the other reviews regarding the Arctic Club it seemed they were speaking of another hotel. I found no negativity whatsoever in this hotel nor the restaurant. Most complaining on here possibly didn't express their concerns for a quiet room, more lighting, larger room, etc. prior to checking in but I'm sure if they would have made that known their request would have been taken care of.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If arriving by airplane the hotel is conveniently located across the road from the Pioneer Square Skytrain stop. Costs a lot less than taxi or shuttle. Worth considering depending on the amount of luggage you have. The steep hill makes carrying bags to the front door on Cherry St a problem, but there is an alternate entrance on 3rd Avenue. Seattle is a hilly city. The location of the hotel was several blocks away from the main tourist areas, such as Pike Markets and the waterfront. This meant a bit of walking but it was pleasant nevertheless. A free city bus is also available. Bell hop and concierge service varied depending on who was on duty at the time. Overall they were OK. They assisted us with instructions about getting around Seattle and had good local knowledge. The warm cookies on arrival were a nice treat. Check-in was friendly and efficient. The room, like the hotel public areas, were themed to look and feel like a Gentleman Explorer's club. It was well done. The room was large, with a separate room for a desk. It was beautifully maintained and the fittings were good quality. The bed very comfortable and the room was very quiet. Breakfast was nice in the hotel's restaurant.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic hotel which was quite individual when you consider it is part of the huge Doubletree Hilton organisation. They have managed to not completely loose the identity of the hotel and blend it into a brand quite successfully. A very memorable hotel. I had a lovely breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. The service was fantastic, friendly but also professional. Mind you, all the staff that I encountered there from reception to concierege were. I experienced no problems with valet parking, assistance with luggage or getting advice and tips for the local area. Room was atmospheric, lovely, large and comfortable room. From the room during working hours you could look directly into the adjacent offices and see staff working which was a bit disconcerting. However, there are layers of different curtains for privacy. Also there are two entrances, one of which is unmanned and requires that you get an elevator/lift to reception. The location and area is great for exploring Seattle which is a wonderful place. However, I did see quite a few homeless people not to far away from the Artic Hotel. Mind you there were quite a few around the market and in several areas of the city. I would certainly go back. The hotel offers great value & experience when compared to other Seattle hotels.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here overnight before catching a cruise out of Seattle bound for Alaska. This hotel was formerly the historic Arctic Men's Club from the early 1900's and they've refurbished it, preserving the warmth and history. Has the feel of a elite club with warm, comfortable common areas, never having the feel of a large, impersonal hotel. The room, 9th floor, seemed new (1 year old), perfectly decorated, and well appointed according to the hotel theme. The staff was very friendly and helpful in recommending local hotels and public transportation/taxis. Their in-house restaurant (JUNO) had a great breakfast, an excellent ambiance, and was surprisingly reasonable. The hotel is also right off 3rd Ave, which is where you can catch fee bus rides throughout the downtown area (if you don't want to walk a few blocks) which is great if you're tired from walking around downtown and want a quick ride back to the hotel. All this and it's conveniently located in the Pioneer Square area - walking distance to Pike's Market as well. Also, the underground bus system just opened and the hotel is 1/2 block from this as well (cheap travel to airport if needed). We've lived in Seattle before, and this is a perfect hotel from which to explore Seattle... Book online early and save a bundle on the room...</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Classy with a slightly creepy lobby”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I never quite got over the lobby walls plastered with early 20th Century black and white photographs of the solemn members of the social club that the building once housed (presumably the Arctic Club). Check in was a breeze and we were given delicious chocolate chip cookies and room keys that didn't quite work, but they noticed the mistake and delivered the correct keys before we had even turned around. Our room was on the lobby level and featured a huge loft space occupied by a bunch of duct work and such. The decor is classy, eclectic vaguely nautical reminiscent of the mens club the building once housed. The furnishings are mostly deco or revival style. I was very impressed with the ipod dock stereo system... possibly the most high tech hotel room I have encountered. The lobby bar has a pool table, although it's a bit difficult to play on. The location is excellent if you want to go to Pioneer Square but a little bit further South than most comparable hotels. We were less than thrilled with the miniature jacuzzi tub... but then I guess that's why it only cost $10 more for the upgrade! The mini bar isn't the weighted sensor kind, which is nice, and it has an actual physical key. The TVs are very nice and they offer relatively high quality (albeit pricey: $39.00 for noon to noon access) adult programming.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Arctic Club Hotel for three nights after a cruise. Immediately upon entering the hotel, we felt as though we could have been entering a gentleman's city club. The architecture, both inside and out, was a joy to view in contrast to today's bland buildings. Just past the reception and front desk area, where mens' starched collars and top hats were displayed in glass cases, was a large lobby containing numerous club chairs, ottomans, and sofas flanking an large wood paneled fireplace. A long, illuminated bar with fixed stools reminiscent of an elegant bygone era, was a centerpiece in the room. Our quiet, corner room didn't offer much of a view, other than the Columbia Tower building and the top of the hotel's glass ballroom dome, however the very comfortable couch and bed more than made up for the lack of scenery. The bathroom was very large for hotel standards, and after 26 days of cruise ship showers, I luxuriated in a tub once again. We found the hotel staff to be friendly and accommodating. The concierge took his time to make sure our interests in the city were pointed out and marked on a map he provided to us. As always, with Hilton hotels, internet is an additional cost, which I find very disappointing. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to enjoy a taste of old time charm.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Juno Restaurant is over priced and the food is terrible.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When checking in we were encouraged to try Juno, the restaurant associated with the hotel. Our initial plan was to try a local seafood restaurant because of Seattle's reputation for great seafood. Since the restaurant was recommended to us we thought we would give it a try, big mistake. The restaurant is conveniently located next to the hotel but that was all it had going for it. After glancing at the menu we realized the restaurant was going to be an expensive proposition for the 4 of us. A full meal was in the $30 to $40 range per person, which is a reasonable price for a good seafood restaurant. Unfortunately the appetizers were disappointing (ceasar salad dripping with bad Kraft like dressing) and the seafood plates we ordered were over cooked and salty. When a restaurant charges the prices Juno does a customer should expect a level of service and food commensurate with the price. Unfortunately Juno failed to deliver in most respects. After a delay in our check-in our room in the hotel was large and very nice. The room was on the 1st floor with large picture windows. The decor was very pleasant and the Starbucks coffee was appreciated in the mornings. We did find the room noisy late at night when the party goers returned too the hotel after a late night of drinking. Otherwise our stay was pleasant and enjoyable.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Really cool renovated historic hotel - perfect for business or leisure”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got back from 4 nights here for a work/pleasure trip. This place has a really cool history - built in early 1900's as an exclusive men's club (photos of the members adorn the walls) and renovated in 2008 into a AAA 4-diamond hotel. The staff was all very helpful and friendly. It is literally 1/2 block from the light rail station (exit Pioneer Square station on the 3rd Ave/James St) and you can take the rail from the airport to the hotel (about 30 minute ride.) We were welcomed very warmly upon arriving and had a fun, impromptu history lesson on the way to the elevator given by one of the front desk staff. The room (we had a standard king room) was decorated very nicely, yet uniquely. You could tell the decorator really cared about the history of the hotel when he/she appointed the rooms. Our bathroom was HUGE for a Doubletree. And, it had a cool door. Bed was very comfortable, nice flat screen TV, minibar, etc...the room was nicer than any Doubletree or Hilton I've ever stayed in before. Hotel was very convenient to a lot of cool places - Pike Place Market (5 min.) Light Rail (.5 block) good restaurants (all around) coffee shops (all around) bars/late nite options (2 blocks) etc... All in all - it was great and we would highly recommend it! It did help that work was paying for it (rate was $155/nite) but it was reasonable, and definitely worth the price.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 3 nights for a long weekend and enjoyed just about every minute of it. Had read some reviews complaining about street noise... never had to deal with that in part because... Lisa at check-in was extremely helpful and really dedicated to quality service. She had already put us in a high floor room facing and set back from 4th Avenue which was about as quiet both internally and externally as any hotel room I've stayed in. The room was well appointed with practical and attractive vintage items rather than beautiful decorative pieces which are difficult or impractical to use. The television had several HD channels and was on a full swivel which made it pleasant to watch both in bed and in the armchair adjacent to the desk. The bathroom was large with a nice shower head and good sink/counter space. My only complaint about my stay would have been that it was a little dark in the shower even with all available bathroom lights turned on! I mentioned this to the front desk upon checking out of the hotel and was told they are looking into upgrading the bathroom lighting throughout the hotel and would send up the engineer to make sure it wasn't a structural problem specific to the room I had stayed in. Seattle's a great city and this is a wonderful hotel to stay in while you're there whether for business or pleasure. If you're inclined to have a cocktail you wont find a better bartender (Viktor) or happy hour than in the hotel's lobby (called Polar Bar).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had the opportunity to stay at the Arctic Club Doubletree before and after an Alaskan cruise. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Seattle. Staff: All of the staff members--front desk, bell staff, restaurant workersâ€”were extremely friendly and service-oriented. They all express great concern about customer satisfaction and take steps to ensure that guests are having a wonderful time. Facilities: The hotel is beautiful. It was re-done in 2008. The Polar Bar in the lobby exudes warmth and comfort. The grand ball room is stunning. The rooms are warmly furnished with comfortable beds, overstuffed chairs, flat screen tvs and wonderful pillows. The style is so warm and inviting that I felt at home right away. I had a corner room on the 8th floor and another corner room on the 5th floor; noise was not a problem. The tilework in the bathroom was so neat, I want to use it in my own home. I canâ€™t say enough about how much I liked the style of this place. Highlights: The dÃ©cor is stunning. Be sure to check out the relief walruses on the outside of the building. Areas for improvement: The elevators were a little slow, but otherwise, I cannot imagine any improvement. Overall impression: Wonderful staff who know what they are doing in a beautifully restored facility make this place a â€œmust stayâ€� in Seattle. Nearby transportation: Downtown transportation tunnel is across the street. Buses run right down Third Avenue. A short walk to the Monorail, or take the transportation tunnel. 20 minutes to airport, 15 minutes to cruise terminals.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just left The Arctic Club after a weekend stay. I am giving this hotel a "very good" rating. The hotel has a great masculine vibe from the lobby all the way up to the rooms. The property is in a good location within walking distance to the Pike Place Market, the Seattle Art Museum, and good restaurants and shops. I found all of the hotel staff to be very friendly and accommodating. As a Hilton Honors Diamond member I received free internet, but even if I were paying out of pocket, internet was only $9.95/ day. Also received a $12/ day breakfast allowance which made for a nice breakfast each morning. The hotel bed was also very comfortable. The onsite restaurant, Juno, is not bad, but is also nothing super special. I would say it is standard hotel food; no better, no worse. The front desk staff and the all of the gentlemen at the concierge desk were very helpful. I was super impressed with just how genuine everyone seemed. It was evident to me that this property really stresses customer service with their staff. For anyone concerned about hotel security, this is the place to stay. Anything above the 3rd floor requires a hotel key for entry 24/7. Staff is always present and would immediately recognize anything out of the ordinary. Lastly, as a word of caution, the hotel is on a bit of an incline, so walking to and from in the area is taxing for someone not accustomed to walking much. That is not just true of the hotel, but of basically anything above 2nd Avenue downtown. I enjoyed my weekend in Seattle and this hotel played a big part in making the weekend so fun...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel to celebrate my special lady friend's birthday. Front desk staff got things off to a great start by being friendly and attentive. (I wish I could remember her name, but she worked the afternoon of January 27) We chatted about the history of the hotel and when I mentioned it was my wife's birthday, she offered a few things that really made the stay special -without me even asking! This is an historic property with a real old hotel feel but none of the downside of an old hotel. The place was immaculately clean, dust free, warm, clean and stately. The decor was very stylish but also very comfortable. We had a room on the top floor with a sort of balcony that was on the roof with a great view of the city. The bed/linens were extremely comfortable and this place must be built for the zombie apocalypse since we heard no noises (other than some street noise.) The in-room amenities included a full set up to make french press coffee and a minibar. The bath had gorgeous tile. For some reason, they associate the DoubleTree brand with this property, which might not be the best idea, because of the unevenness of other DoubleTree hotels; I'd just leave that part out. This is an unusual hotel that makes you feel like you are living in the 30's. I felt like I might run into Nucky Thompson in the Polar Bar, which was also a great place to hang out. If you are flying in, bear in mind that this is directly across the street from the Pioneer Square Station of the Seattle light rail, so for just $2.50 you ride from the airport to the hotel. The neighborhood has some good restaurants and is close to Pioneer square.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Classic Men's Club Now A Posh Doubletree Hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Arctic Club Hotel in September 2009 when I overnighted in Seattle in order to make the connection between my train from California which arrived in the evening and my flight back east to go home. I had originally chosen the hotel because it was a reasonably priced older hotel that was relatively close (about six or eight blocks) to the Amtrak station. The hotel itself is classic men's club that has been converted into a stylish hotel while maintaining (or, more likely, recreating) the ambience of such a club. A lot of effort went into the decorating and it was worth it. The furniture in my room had a vaguely art deco feel to it. The bed was extra comfortable. The bathroom was spacious and very attractive (they had, once again, gone to considerable effort to make it both very modern but esthetically keyed to the period of the club itself). I didn't try the restaurants or the bar, but the latter looked quite inviting. Some huge party was going on when I checked in but my room itself was quiet. One oddity which I am sure was just a bit of bad luck: when I arrived at my room after checking in, the door was propped open. I used my key to confirm that I wasn't going to the wrong room (I wasn't) and then I checked the room and everything was in order. I then locked and bolted the door. Still, it was a bit unsettling. While common, I note that they charged for Internet access, something I consider gratuitous and annoying (especially since more basic hotels almost always offer it for free these days). Still at $200 a night (plus taxes) for a cancelable reservation, I thought it was quite decent value given the alternatives available.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Wonderful big city hotel with turn of the century feel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved this hotel from the moment we entered the lobby. The historic details are excellent and well kept. We liked the portraits, top hats, and collars displayed near the check in desk as well as the key cards with character. The mascot Walrus is everywhere. Our corner room on the 8th floor was well equipped with a good coffee press and hot pot as well as several electronic items in addition to the television. The bathroom was large and had a jacuzzi tub. We laughed that it had the word "Bath" stenciled on it. It was pretty obvious what it was. Lighting was not the best. If we had not had a flashlight the safe in the closed would have been totally useless and I felt the reading lights were dim. It was also somewhat noisy especially early on Saturday morning when the jackhammers started. On the whole we were very happy with the facilities. The people were even better. They went out of their way to help us with directions, suggestions, and whatever else we might need. We felt the location was excellent. We took the light rail from the airport for $2.50, got off at the Pioneer Square stop, went up the escalator and walked out right across the street from the hotel. We walked a lot and some of the uphill stretches were evil. The Pioneer Square and International Districts are very convenient and both have a lot of places to eat. Public transportation is free from 6am-7pm in a large central section of the city. There are buses outside the hotel as well as in the transit tunnel where the light rail stops. Folks at the desk will give you a print out of your route or connections. We would definitely stay at this hotel again if we return to Seattle.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Classic and historic, the Arctic Club is something special”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Restored to its early 20th Century glory with a fabulous renovation in 2008, the Arctic Club Doubletree is unique, elegant and well-located. Immediately across the street is a mass transit tunnel that provides rail access to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, as well as a free service area for buses in central Seattle. The famous Pike Place Market is within walking distance or you can grab a bus and ride a couple of stops for even easier access. The immediate area provides plenty of choices for dining and a plethora of coffee shops in the most caffeinated city anywhere. Pioneer Square and the waterfront are within easy reach, too. As for the hotel itself, we especially enjoyed the historic charm and comfortable beds. Rooms are nicely finished and furnished with nice touches like in room coffee using a French press coffeemaker. We've seen some renovations in which the only thing left of the building was something on the order of a paved-over shell, but the Arctic Club celebrates its history throughout -- from historic photographs of its former members on the keycards to careful refinishing and preservation of its finest attributes. The result is 21st Century comfort with an ambiance that keeps the property's past vibrant and alive. We loved it and we think you will, too. Give the Juno dining room a try and particularly the happy hour food offerings at half price. It's a funky menu the celebrates the Pacific Northwest, but you're sure to find something you like. The bar off the lobby is open later and it's a classy atmosphere that harkens back to the hotel's roots as a social club for men who made it their money in the days of the Klondike gold rush.</p></li>
