<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Really no complaints about anything except the shower - which matters. I was on the 10th floor, it took forever for the shower to get hot and when it did the temperature fluctuated radically from luke warm to scalding. It's amazing how not being able to have a normal shower can affect my overall impression but it does.</p></li>

The meal was pricey, but well worth it. Would stay here again.</p></li>

If that doesn't appeal to you, I suggest you save your money and stay elsewhere or spend it and stay somewhere much nicer.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is very good. It's not excellent, but it is a very good Marriott. The check in staff were nice for the most part. The restaurant is not very good, so I would not eat in the restaurant unless you have to. The location is in downtown, so it's in the heart of things, but you have a fair number of homeless people and transients around. It's a little scary to walk around late night by yourself, but othewise, it's fine.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for two nights in July. Hotel was extremely clean. Bathroom was spotless and seemed very new. Had drinks and apps in restaurant/lounge...nice atmosphere overlooking courtyard. Convenient to transportation. Parking expensive but what isn't in Toronto? Easy walking to Canon Theater and to many restaurants. Excellent steakhouse two blocks away...easy to walk to...called Barberians...very expensive! There is a walk through to Eaton's.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am an avid business traveller and stop in Toronto quite often. I made the mistake of chhosing the Eatons Center location over the Bloor or Airport locations I usually stay at. For business use the hotel gets a C, it was a poor service compared to the others. The rest of my stay was great but definately need to get a new system in place for business travellers.. Id recommend Hilton Downtown or Marriott Airport Locations for Business Trips. Dean</p></li>

The hotel is wonderfully located to all metro hospitals and when some very important down time is needed the Eaton Center mall is attached so you do not have to worry about the weather or putting on a coat. The service was exceptional, the beds VERY comfortable and the room is really nice size. There is a lovely indoor pool and Jacuzzi on the roof as well. I will stay here again and highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

Reception and checkin staff are flawless and will help you with anything youay need. The bar and main restaurant is on par with other Marriotts I've been to.

Under that mall is the subway station, so you can actually get on the subway without ever going outside. There are tons of excellent restaurants close by for pretty much every taste and budget. The room I had was at the end of the hall, so it was exceptionally quiet, and the bed was great. The only slight knock I have is that the airport shuttle doesn't stop at this hotel. When I stay here, I generally take the shuttle to the Delta Chelsea, then walk the couple of blocks to this hotel (and enter off Bay).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I do not often give hotels 5 stars, but In this cars, it was not the physical structure, that is so good, but he hotel staff that shines. The Hotel itself is fine and we had no complaints about anything. The staff took care of all ours needs and requests with enthusiasm and the concierge even went so far as recommend vineyards to visit for our side trip to Niagra wine country. They arranged rental car service for us as well as airport transport.. All very reasonably priced and on time. he only down side to the hotel is that the restaurant seems to be somewhat expensive. The food quality in the restaurant was very good.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed September long weekend. Beds are to die for, so comfortable. Gym is amazing, if you are so inclined, and so is the view...from 18th floor. Had some idiot pull fire alarm at 4 am on Sunday, but was resolved within 30 minutes and not having to evacuate. Then hard to get out as Mcguinty crew in town and elevators shut down once again. I am voting NDP, horrible end for Layton. Expensive to park, $25 per day and daily rates are high. No other perks. Sign up for points card. Wanted to have a nice weekend before school, very expensive, again do not know how people manage in Toronto, perhaps they do not given the numerous homeless my daughter (age 6) began to identify.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">...for more than $300 a night. I requested a King size bed but was surprised at how small the room was. One small window that didn't open. No mini-bar. And what is it with hotels charging more than $300 a night and still nickle and diming you with a daily internet charge? I can get free internet at the airport, train station, most every coffee shop in town, but at a +$300 a night hotel I have to pay extra for it? Really? The bathroom was small and not as contemporary as I was expecting. The only positive thing I have to say would be that the exercise room was pretty good. 18th floor with big windows and a nice view. It's also connected directly to the Eaton Centre for easy access to the mall...it that's your thing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is an excellent hotel. Location, Location, Location. It is attached to the Sears store in Eaton Centre which easily accesses the subway and streetcars. In the cold weather, you don't need to go outside to reach the subway which is really nice. They have the best breakfast buffet I have ever seen at a Marriott. It is much pricier than what you will find in the U.S. but if you like breakfast it may be worth it. They even have a juicer with prepared vegetables that you can juice, cold deli meats and cheeses, omelet station, typical hot foods section, compotes,oatmeals, breads, etc. There is also an indoor fireplace area where you can sit inside by the fire and eat and read if you like. All in all- really nice stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Marriott Eaton Centre provided service at its best. Everyone on staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel's downtown location is convenient for public transportation and adjacent to the Eaton Centre Mall. The mall can be accessed through the hotel without going outside. The hotel also has a nice indoor pool and hot tub for relaxing. My wife enjoyed the gym which had new and excellent machines. The rooms seem to have been recently updated and are well kept. Only downside was at 2am someone decided to light a cigarette in a stairwell and set off the smoke alarm causing all of the hotel guests to be evacuated. One guest's inconsiderate action should not reflect upon the property. I would highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here on two seperate occasions within a two week period. Paid $200 a night the first time, and then $260 the second. I did get the internet and breakfast as part of the deal the 2nd time around, but would rather have paid the $200 without the extras, but didn't have a choice. The hotel if ideally located right in the middle of the city. Plenty of options for dinner around Dundas square. Beds are very comfortable and staff are numerous and helpful. The gym is huge and well equiped. The rooms are medium size, has a desk and a small lounge and coffee table. You are paying a premium price for being in the centre of the city and staying in a well maintained hotel, but I thought it was worth it. I'll be staying here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Marriott Eaton Centre for part of our honeymoon. We had a great time. The hotel was great. We enjoyed nearly everything about the hotel. The central location was perfect for us as tourists. We were able to walk from the hotel to the Hockey hall of Fame, the Rogers Centre, art museums, theaters, restaurants, shopping. The staff were courteous and helpful, and the sports bar on the first floor was a great place to hang out. There were only 3 minor disappointments -- the concierge lounge was full of families with kids so breakfast was a bit noisy and crowded, the rooftop pool was small and also full of kids, and food at the hotel was pricey -- we got better quality food at more reasonable prices at nearby restaurants.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in this hotel on two occasions, first in June 2007 and then again in 2010. The hotel is very clean, the rooms were a good price for the quality received, and, best of all, the location can't be beat. The hotel is located diagonally across from Nathan Phillips Square. It is also less than a block from the Eaton Centre Mall (shopping, quick bite to eat). Near the mall entrance you will find a Starbucks and the entrance to the subway where you can catch a quick ride to Union Station (CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Hockey Hall of Fame, etc.) and/or other destinations in and around Toronto. I'd highly recommend this hotel for people who plan to tour Toronto and are looking for a decent value. Found the cheapest price directly on their website.</p></li>

The hotel is marvelous, their renovations are complete and they did a wonderful job, we had a room with king bed, great tv in the room and it was a very spacious room. I have to mention that the restaurant JW's located in the hotel, was great. The service was superb, our waiter (Ralph) was very courteous and helpful and friendly also, we couldn't ask for much more. The meal itself was extremely good, it is well worth your money to have a meal there, you won't be disappointed. I give this hotel high marks and will definitely return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed at Marriott Eaton Center and had a wonderful stay. The hotel is modern and the lobby is inviting. In the lobby there is a lounge area surrounding a free standing fireplace that is enjoyable to sit around and chat. The restaurant ,Trios, has a menu with a variety of items (crabcakes, scallops, meatloaf, salmon and short ribs were amazing). Our dinner was memorable with a nice atmosphere, delicious food and the service friendly and helpful. We also had breakfast there, as when you pay for the concierge rate you eat off the buffet in the restaurant, which includes made to order eggs, etc. (great deal). Did not utilize the fitness center or pool, but looked nice and clean. Overall wonderful stay, will book again when I return to town.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed at this Marriott many times but this was our first time back since the renovation and it did not disapoint. Rooms were spotless, and big enough. The staff was great right from check-in with a "welcome back" from every employee starting with the valet. Special thanks to Danny for being so nice with the kids he was awesome! One of the best features of this hotel is its proximity to the Eaton Centre as it is connected with a walkway so you can leave your coats in your room and shop all day. It is also right beside Nathan Phillips Square, which has a skating rink all winter. The buffett breakfast which was included with our rate was good every morning and better than most hotels. The pool is small but sufficent. We can't wait to come back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pleasant stay except for the night we made the mistake of having dinner in the main restaurant. We are NOT demanding restaurant a patrons, but both the food and the service was poor. Service was very slow, even though the restaurant was not full. When my husband's Cesar salad was served with chicken instead of salmon, he had to hunt down the waiter to point out the problem, and the waiter barely seemed to care. Food presentation was fancy, but the food didn't taste very good. I had some fried rice that was much too gingery; my side dish of broccoli was overcooked; the key lime pie tasted as if it came from a mix - you get the idea. And for this we paid fancy hotel restaurant prices - ugh! Rest of the hotel - room, location, front desk staff, etc. just terrific.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed our stay at the Marriott Eaton Centre with a few minor quibbles. One is my usual complaint of charging the exhorbitant fees for internet access in the guest rooms...this drives me crazy that I can go to a Holiday Inn Express and get free wireless internet in my room but the higher end hotels charge for it. No free business center to print boarding passes, etc...pc's in business center charged almost $2 per minute!! Okay, enough on that rant. The room was decent size for Toronto and was very clean. The only negative for the guestroom was that the shower seemed to take an inordinately long time to achieve warm/hot water...literally 2-3 minutes. I wasn't in any particular hurry, but just am not used to waiting for hot water these days. All in all, a pleasant stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this hotel for its location, which is excellent, as you can walk everywhere from there. It's also right next door to Eaton Center shopping area, where you can catch the subway and all the tour busses. We stayed in a one bedroom suite with a connecting dbl / dbl (5 of us). While the beds were comfy and we had plenty of room, the guest rooms are in need of a renovation. Had all standard amenities including coffee maker and fridge and robes . The rooms were clean, but when you looked closely, you would feel it needed a deep clean.. Ie around baseboards, walls and ceiling in bath, etc. service was excellent at front desk and concierge! Only had a drink in the bar, which was average hotel lobby bar. Didn't eat there. My biggest negative would be the super thin, over starched towels.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend is partial to the Marriott chain, so when we booked to stay here we came with high expectations. We werenâ€™t disappointed. The king bed was super comfortable â€“ you literally just sink right in, it feels so delicious just lying down. I can see why they advertise and sell their own bedding. The room we had was a decent size and had a nice view. The location canâ€™t be beat, youâ€™re right in the heart of the city, right next to the Eaton Centre and steps away from the hive of Dundas Square. The valets recommended cheap indoor parking in the office building next door. We usually check out the amenities of every hotel we stay at but on this stay we had a long full day and just had time to settle in for a good nightâ€™s rest. We had no issue with noise, and we slept really well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from a weekend stay at the Marriott Eaton Centre. The hotel was nearly 100% full, but check-in went quickly and we felt like the staff was taking good care of us. Our in-room safe wasn't working properly, but that was corrected while we went out for an afternoon exploration of Toronto. Our housekeeper was excellent and expressed her appreciation for the tip we left. One of the best things about this hotel is its location. It is connected to the Eaton Centre and there is a subway station there. We purchased a Saturday day pass on the Toronto Transit system and used it extensively to get around to tour Toronto. While there is a garbage strike going on, the city was still relatively clean and everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful. We will certainly consider staying at this hotel again.</p></li>

The location is perfect in the heart of Toronto, right next door to the Eaton Center shopping mall. Because the hotel backs onto a small courtyard, you could not hear any street noise. (see photo) The breakfast buffet was a little expensive but the food and service were both very good. Parking is also expensive at $18 per day and the garage was small. It looked like we were lucky to get a parking spot. The lobby is very appealing and the front desk staff were professional and polite. There was also someone roaming around the lobby to help guests with any questions. Big baskets of apples to welcome you at the front desk when checking in! The rooms were Marriott quality with all the requisite amenities you would expect. No disappointments, location is absolutely perfect.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was amazing for the rate. Very clean, comfortable all over. The bed was just to die for - perfect sleep. Great pool (warm and clean) and hot tub (the cleaning guy let us stay late that evening - thank you!) Amazing service between the front desk, bell hops, and valet workers. I can't comment on the food or drinks offered at the hotel as we did not order anything at the restaurant or room service - it was pretty expensive. Room service breakfast was $20 for nothing too special. The hotel is connected to the Eaton center = dangerous!!! I could spend all day in a mall and just shop until I drop! There is a beautiful courtyard with cobblestones and a church between the outside of the Marriott and the Eaton center. Overall, I would definetly go back in a heartbeat and I will recommend this hotel to friends and family planning on staying downtown.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently spent the weekend at the Marriott Eaton Centre. It was very easily accessible by road. On arrival, the front door staff couldn't have been more helpful (hey, Jimmy !!) Check in was quick, easy, and again the staff were very helpful. Our room was very nice, we asked for a lower level and got it with no problem. The hotel has indoor access to the Eaton Centre, which is great - you can come back to your room for a break any time. We didn't make use of the hotel restaurant, as there are so many great restaurants in the neighbourhood - the staff are only too happy to recommend places and make reservations for you. For a Downtown hotel, I would give this a 5 star for friendly and efficient service. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great hotel in a central location for shopping/entertainment. No free internet in your room, but free in the lobby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have been meaning to post this positive review of the Eaton Centre Marriott in Toronto for a year now! My husband traveled to Toronto for business constantly for a few months this past summer and we made a vacation of a couple of weekends in the city. We loved the Eaton Centre Marriott - the lobby has a nice cocktail bar and good steak restaurant and with a modern art look. Being Marriott Rewards members, we got a lovely upgraded room with access to the concierge lounge and good views. The hotel was (obviously) part of the Eaton Centre so shopping and public transport were just steps away. If you have been to one Marriott, you know what to expect at basically all of them and that can be comforting when in a new place. This hotel was a nicer style than most and ranked up there with the downtown waterfront Seattle Marriott for style and a cool bar to chill at in the lobby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I don't agree with the majority of the rave reviews for this hotel. It's best asset is the central Toronto location and beautiful public areas. However, the rooms are very average (no safe, mini-bar for example). During my stay, the first room I was given had a locked adjoining door. The room next to mine was obviously a large suite occupied by several people. Because of the adjoining door and no soundproofing between these rooms, I could hear their group conversations as if they were sitting next to me. Finally I called at midnight to insist on another room which they gave me. However, the next day after walking around in this room for an hour in clean white socks...I noticed that the bottom of these socks were filthy with dirt, grime. Obviously this hotel very rarely shampoos the carpets. My basic perception was that the rooms had a dated, unclean vibe. I will not stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We checked out early (9am) on a Sunday morning. You would think the 4 elevators would be empty at that hour. They were slow to arrive at the lobby on Saturday afternoon, evening and the next morning. We stayed on the 5th floor of the18 floor hotel and never had a chance to get on an elevator. Six times the doors opened and closed packed to the gills. Finally, we dragged our bags down the 4 flights of stairs. The rest of the hotel was nice but a little dated. Tiled bathtub was clean as was the rest of the room. Some of the rooms can be far from the elevators. But for the deal that we received $149CN for a Saturday stay, we can't really complain. The beds were nice and we had a view of the church next door. Meal at the hotel restaurant was not bad, apple crumble with ice cream and creme brulee was pretty tasty. But there are so many hotel options for Toronto that we'll probably given another one a try next time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My friend and I stayed at this hotel in September 2011 during the TIFF weekend. The hotel lobby was very spacious, and well furnished with comfy seating for tired travellers to wait while checking-in. In addition to being spacious, the lobby was decorated in a modern fashion with booth-like check-in desk, complete with a very professional and courteous staff who checked us in promptly. The room was clean, spacious and even included a pull out couch! The bed was comfortable with lots of pillows. My only complaint would be that the room could be more sound proof. We definitely could hear some...*ahem* rhythmic knocking on the walls from next door. Aside from that, the room was great. As most people have already noted, the location is fantastic! For those looking for shopping, the Eaton Centre is literally next door. Everything needed is within walking distance, but public transportation is just as accessible. Great stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 2 nights and found the hotel to be generally very good. The location, right next to the Eaton Centre, is ideal and makes it easy to take in all of the traditional tourist sights and access the subway. Staff was friendly and helpful, and the beds were comfortable. My only quibbles were with the bathroom. The toilet did not flush properly and the shower seemed to have only 2 temperatures: scalding hot or freezing cold. I didn't bother complaining since we were only there for 2 nights. They also really need more than 1 elevator to the parking garage. The wait for an elevator to the parking garage was quite long. Getting to our room was fine as there are many elevators that access the guest room floors. I got a discounted rate because I am a Marriott rewards member which made it worth it. Overall a very good hotel to use as a base for exploring Toronto but not quite up to the Marriott standards I have come to expect.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in this Marriott for 3 nights when in Toronto on business. I appreciated the restaurant/bar which served up a good meal after a long day of travel. The room was also excellent, as I was on the end and had a view of the CN Tower. This Marriott was also within walking distance of the Toronto subway, and the walk was well-lit and safe. The reason that I couldn't give a perfect score - in typical Marriott fashion everything is nickel-and-dime. The internet costs $16 per day and it's wired only, although this also includes long distance calls to the USA. This adds up for someone who needs to be connected. Tip - the Toronto Airport Express shuttle bus is a cost-effective mode of transport from the airport to the city. The hotel staff told me to get off at the Sheraton station. However the bus driver pointed out that the U. of Toronto Residence stop (the last stop) was much closer, just a very short walk between some buildings to arrive at the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently attended an annual work conference from the 17th thru 19th and I have to say that I was very pleased with the hotel. From the concierge and front desk staff, everyone was very nice and attentive during our stay. The hotel was clean and modern and the King room was spacious, with the most comfortable bed (slept better than at home). During the conference, the food/service department did a fantastic job with meals. We never went hungry and the quality of the food was excellent. The ballrooms and meeting rooms were well kept and allowed for great meetings by day and fun parties in the evening. I did not have an opportunity to use the recreation facilities but the location of the hotel is ideal. You have easy access to everything you might want: Yonge Street, Eaton Centre, China Town, Financial District, Entertainment District etc. Parking at the hotel's underground lot was easy and efficient... No worries if you're planning a stay at this downtown Toronto hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for one night during a business trip. We arrived particularly late due to a flight delay so were checked in quickly which was appreciated. The rooms are spacious and beds very comfortable, unfortunately there was no bottled water in the room which was disappointing given the hotel standard but this is my only downside of the stay. There is however a coffee/tea making machine and the bathroom is ample sized. I wanted to order roomservice breakfast but had missed the midnight deadline for putting the order on my doorhandle however a quick call to reception and I was assured that this could still be managed. Breakfast arrived right on time and was delicious (scrambled egs, well done bacon, juice and tea...perfect!). Check out was again quick and our bags were stored by a lovely, friendly concierge. Upon returning to the hotel we were helped with our bags into a car that the hotel ordered for us and on our way. All in all a great (if very quick) stay in a hotel with a great location. Would recommend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel, with our 2 young children, at the start of April 2005. We have prevoiusly stayed at 3 or 4 other hotels in Toronto over the last year at around the same price. We were very impressed with the hotel in general. We had breakfast and lunch at the Parkside restaurant in the hotel, the food was of a very high standard, and children less than three eat free ( it costs $7.95 for children over three for the breakfast buffet). The staff in the restaurant were both friendly and efficient. Our room was large, well furnished and clean. It was a non smoking room - at all other hotels in which we have stayed in Toronto have also given us non smoking rooms but all have smelt of smoke, this was not the case with the Marriott. The pool was quite small, but suitable for the children to use. The front desk staff were also friendly and helpful with any requests. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Toronto (we have high expectations from hotels, which can sometimes cause disappointment -not so this time!)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed for three nights at the Marriott Eaton Centre, which I really enjoyed. The hotel is perfectly situated in the heart of Toronto. The major tourist attractions are within walking distance (such as the CN Tower and the Rogers Center), not to mention its close proximity to the financial district of the city. The hotel offers you the advantage of being connected through a tunnel to the Eaton Centre, a very pleasant shopping mall. Although I did not order anything up to the room, I went down to the restaurant for breakfast twice. It might have been one of the best ones I had so far with its wide selection of pretty much anything you would want for breakfast. The room was clean and spacious. The bed was comfortable. There was a safe large enough to fit my laptop in, something I always struggle with at other hotels. Al the staff were very nice and helpful. I asked for a late check out which was granted to me free of charge. Overall, I think this is a good choice if you're staying in Toronto for a few days and want to hang around the city center.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was happy to get this hotel for $159/night - though internet was slow and added $16 dollars per day (though it included all calls - or so i thought until i got my bill and they had charged me $40 worth of long distance calls - they were promptly removed). stayed for conference at the sheraton centre - which was a short walk (less than 5 minutes) away. if you wanted to you could get there via the mall and the walk undergound. hotel room was small but clean and comfortable. TV was good, bathroom was clean/marble. location very central for downtown. toronto air express bus to airport was fast - take a $10 cab to get picked up at westin then $20 to take bus - o/w will sit on bus for 40 minutes before you even leave for the airport (still better than $60 taxi). concierge was fairly helpful, front desk staff was prompt and helpful. my colleagues staying at the sheraton said their rooms were old and not maintained and in some cases dirty. i think this is a good value for the area except for the internet charges which were high for such a slow connection.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent rate of 3 nights for the price of 2 provided a huge room with ample storage facilities, Plasma TV and safe. Spoltessly clean. Bed rather soft for me. Internet connection in room rather pricey. Decent, but small 18th floor pool and gym overlooking the City. Restaurant OK but slow; nothing special. Housekeeping had a habit of knocking the door to see if all was well - morning, afternoon and early evening! Fire alarm at 5.20am and evacuation was well handled although muddled about the return to the rooms - no problems with that becuase the staff made sure you were out of the hotel and the Toronto Fire Brigade were there in an instant! Suprised a fellow traveller thought the fire alarm was a mark against the hotel! I was irritated by the fact that on the last morning, you are deemed to have checked out (so no more charges can be posted to your room) after they provide the statement of account! It means breakfast on the last day is either cash of charge card. Hotel is well placed fo shopping , Dundas square and all the tourist attractions Toronto has to offer.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We love this hotel! This was our second stay at this property and although it wasn't quite the same as our visit for New Year's Eve it will continue to be our favourite place to stay in Toronto. It is connected by a walkway to the Eaton Centre and when you park at the hotel (valet is the way for only $25) you can get just about anywhere on foot, bus, or subway. We book the Romance Package and it is well worth it. One night stay in a king size room, champagne, chocolate covered strawberries, valet parking, and the most amazing buffet breakfast are all included for $220-$250 depending on the time of year. They have other great packages including one that gives you a $25 gas coupon or gift card for the mall. The staff are incredible and don't accept tips, so if you are not from North America this is the place for you. Great service is offered without the expectation of a gratuity. In-room movies are a horrendous price, but that's not unusual at hotels. The bathroom products are stellar and each room has a coffee maker. If you are looking to do it up right this is the place for you!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had stayed in this hotel half-a-dozen times in the past and had been very impressed with it. The service has always been excellent. We often used to go on massive shopping trips and had to transport many large boxes to and from our rooms. The bell staff (usually women) would handle this for us cheerfully. I would often try to tip them, sometimes $20, but they always refused, stating that it was against hotel policy and that it was "part of the service". This happened all the time, and still did on this last trip. The location is also perfect for us: next to the Eaton Centre and walking distance to Chinatown and Queen Street. The rooms are large and the food in the dining room is decent enough. Now maybe our expectations of hotels have risen in recent years, or maybe we were just given a uniquely bad room for the first time, but our room was noisy! It was like there was no sound-proofing whatsoever. We could hear people walking and talking in the hallway and talking in the next room. This really annoys me, enough that I will not stay there again in spite of the excellent service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I are in our late 20's and stayed at Toronto Marriott Downtown Eaton Centre in early June. I have to admit that I am usually very worried about hotels and their cleanliness... but this hotel was extremely clean. The maid service was excellent and very prompt. We experienced no problems in this area -- like we usually do in other hotels. The hotel staff was very friendly and offered great service. This was our first time in Toronto, and they were very helpful in guiding us to certain places that we asked about... restaurants, shopping, bars, etc. This hotel has a great location and allowed us to walk to all places we wanted to go. The breakfast that is served at the hotel is wonderful!! It is a little expensive, but they offer a great variety. Unlike many other hotel breakfasts, this one actually has good food! One restaurant that you must visit - if you are interested in Italian food - is Terroni. The hotel staff may act like they don't know where it is... but it's on Queen St. For some reason, when we asked about it, they acted like they never heard of it - but it was packed, and they have awesome food!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel for the weekend (April 15-17, 2011). I was concerned about a recent report of bedbugs at this hotel on another website, and so I was prepared to cancel our reservation. When I called to cancel, rather than just accept my cancellation request and take the money (I prepaid a nonrefunable sum for the room), they directed me to a manager person, who immediately heard my concerns and showed me objective evidence of what measures were taken to ensure that no bedbugs were in this hotel.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location for downtown Toronto. Friday AM I had surgery. We went to the Toronto Islands on sunday and when I was there- my stiches started to leak. By the time we got back to the mainland and back to the mall adjacent to the hotel- the shoppers was closed. We went to the front desk, showed the front clerk that I was bleeding and explained my situation. asking if she had some band aids or knew of a shoppers super close by. I explained that I had just had surgery and needed assistance. The front desk girl didn't seem to understand the situation and said "oh there is a shoppers 2 blocks from here." Again i treid to explain that i didn't really want to walk- especially in my situation and if the shoppers was not open for certain. She still didn't get it- and said-"well I'll call to see if it is open". finally another employee came by and I stopped hi a dn asked if he could help me. He was sooo helpful and got my a few bandaids in less than a minute. other issues- bathroom really not that nice, concierge horrible at recommending things to do or good resutarants or giving directions. Great place to stay for the location and comfy beds- but that's about it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent location almost two blocks from the out of town bus terminal. Walking distance to most sites. It is across the streets from both old and new City Hall. The Eaton Centre is just steps away. Itâ€™s probably a 20-minute walk (rough guess and depends how fast you walk) to the Harbour Front with loads of restaurants (I ate at the Watermark Irish Pub). Lots to do here as well, check the information center. Great place to hang out on a hot afternoon, which is what I did. CN Tower is not far from here. Nice view from my room on the 15th floor. I had a huge bed, flat screen TV, comfortable chairs, coffee maker (and real cream is provided!). It was neat and clean. I just spent the night there so didnâ€™t scout for a lot of dining area. They do have a restaurant inside but of course is pricey like most hotels. Two or three blocks if you turn to your right leaving the hotel, youâ€™ll find Duke of Somerset pub. I sat outside on a beautiful warm evening. A short walk, I found a small grocery store in the underground. I bought croissants, a pastry and some fruit. The next morning I had the croissant and pastry for breakfast making my own coffee in the room. The staff are good.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was surprised, after reading the reviews on this site, and visiting the hotel the disparity that exists between the two. I must admit, the location is perfect! Right downtown, close to everything! I did however find the staff to be very indifferent, almost cold and the rooms to be on the smaller side. The worst part of the stay however was finding two LARGE insects or animals, something in the room! One was dead and under the chair in the room, and the other my husband saw scurrying across the floor. When we complained to the front desk, they didn't say sorry, they simply said they'd send someone up. Maybe this is common? Well, after 45 minutes, no one showed up so I called the desk again. They said "he" was called and must be busy. We waited another 20 minutes before anyone came. The gentleman was excessively rude, simply entered the room, removed the dead bug and looked VERY quickly over the rest of the room before saying "Looks like we got em all". I was so frustrated. At check-out we mentioned it again, but nothing was done. This time the clerk did manage a sorry, but it was forced. Stay here if you can put up with bugs and indifferent staff. The location can't be beat.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently spent 3 nights at the Marriott Eaton Centre while attending a conference. The hotel is centrally located - just a block from Junge St. and a short walk to University. Needless to say, the Eaton Centre is practically next door to the hotel. I should note that the Airport Express bus does not list the Marriott as one of its downtown stops, however one of its stops (the Metropolitan Hotel) is only a block or so from the Marriott. The lobby of the hotel is currently undergoing renovation (as noted on their website) which made for an unexciting first impression, however the room (1112) was tastefully decorated and fairly spacious for a downtown hotel room. My only negative comment about the room was the view - it looked straight into an adjacent office building. Hotel staff seemed to be competent and very pleasant, although my interactions with them were minimal. I paid a conference rate of Can$179 plus the various taxes and fees - this seemed a little high for what it was, although realistically I blame the US$ more than Marriott for this perception. Overrall, my room was a comfortable place to spend some time (I liked the large flat panel tv), while the rest of the hotel was unexciting.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place is very clean, its got THE MOST comfortable beds, and the location is great. The bathrooms were clean and the rooms have been updated. The hotel has a very modern look and feel to it. The rooms also have new big screen tvs which was nice. One of the things that make people willing to pay a lot of money for this place is because the hotel has a walkway that goes right into the eaton centre mall. It enters sears, and on your way through this hallway there is a giftshop and a cafe down the stairs. Its a pretty cool thing to be able to walk right into torontos biggest mall in just two minutes. The only downsides are is that for $250 a night, you dont really get your moneys worth. The pool area is quite small, and elevators, lobby is packed by noon, and there seem to be a lot of kids running around everytime im there, and the giftshop and cafe were very overpriced. Also a lot of the rooms face an office building, so theres not much privacy, because the curtains are very easily seen through, but overall if your willing to pay over 250 a night, your really only paying for the location and the walkway to the mall. There are 3 and 4 star hotels just down the street from this one, and half the price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is wonderful. From the moment we walked in the door we felt welcomed and comfortable. Check in literally took 2 minutes and we were on our way upstairs. Every hotel worker we encountered was friendly and helpful. At one point, we were looking for some info from the concierge, only to find that he had left for the night. The people at the front desk were more than willing to help us out with what we needed. The beds at the Marriot were SO comfortable I would have been ok with just lounging in bed all weekend and never seeing the rest of city! Not only that, but the rooms were spotlessly clean, the amenities were nice and our view was spectacular. The location couldn't have been better. There was a hallway that connected to the Eaton Centre. Of course, when you arrive at the mall, you're in the ladies lingerie dept. of a Sears store, which is a little weird...but other than that, it was handy. Lots of stores and restaurants in the area. The hop on/hop off bus stop was very close to the hotel and so was the drop off spot for the airport shuttle which was great. It was overall a wonderful experience - I'd highly recommend it to anyone. It's a nice clean, quiet hotel in a great area. I felt spoiled while I was there</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were attending a conference in the hotel so we basically had no choice when it came to picking a hotel in Toronto. Check-in : Everything went accordingly to plan. We were given our king size room which we had booked months earlier. Room : The room was just another hotel room , nothing flash but it was comfortable. The room consisted of a king size bed , small settee , coffee table and working desk with internet connection. The bathroom was on the small size with shower over the bath. Adequate toiletries were supplied. I actually like the aromatherapy orange ginger body lotion and managed to take a bottle home with me. Breakfast : A good selection with a chef cooking omelettes. Bar : We used the bar area frequently for pre dinner drinks and also returning home in the evenings. The staff were very efficient and friendly. Overall : The Marriott Hotel served a purpose and we had a comfortable stay. Our rate due to the conference was very reasonable so no complaints. The Eaton Shopping centre can be easily reached from the hotel. We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..</p></li>

<li>Overall : The Marriott Hotel served a purpose and we had a comfortable stay.</br></br></li>
<li>Our <span style="background-color:#fffac8">rate</span> due to the conference was <span style="background-color:#fffac8">very reasonable</span> so no complaints.</br></br></li>
<li>The Eaton Shopping centre can be easily reached from the hotel.</br></br></li>
<li>We also experienced a false fire alarm which was disconcerting as it took quite some time for us to get through to the receptionist to see whether we should proceed down the fire stairs or stay put..</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I cant believe that we stayed in the same hotel as the other people who have reviewed this place. It is probably the most depressing hotel I have ever stayed in. To start with the decor in the rooms is dreadful; mustard coloured walls, a mustard coloured 3D (dont ask) carpet, mustard cloured bed throws and an artexed ceiling only just over 7 feet over our heads. The effect in the small room was to feel as if the ceiling and walls were closing in on us. To compound this the air conditioning didnt work properly and we couldn't open the window. The bathroom was the highlight, fairly basic and clean but small with meagre towels and toiletries. Breakfast was reasonable but unremarkable and the service very hit and miss. The pool was pleasant enough for our daughter to play in but would be much to small for exercising in. The location is reasonable but quite a long way from the waterfront. During our recent trip we stayed in 5 hotels in Canada and this was by far the worst. I do recommend dinner at the 360 resturant in the CN tower, a wonderful experience especially as the sun set. If you have children under 8 they will love the fairground at centreville on the islands but avoid Wonderland unless you have teenage children who can go by themselves, the queues were over an hour long for many rides and it feels bleak and bland.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My spouse and I decided to spend one night at the Marriott Downtown as a pre-10 yr wedding anniversary. The hotel sure didn't dissapoint! Book-in online was quick and easy, check-in was a breeze and they even gave us a free upgrade to a bedroom suite to celebrate the occassion. What made it even more special was that they sent up to the room chocolate dipped strawberries and drinks along with a anniversary card signed by each member of thier team. Although the one bedroom suite was on the 5th floor by the elevators, the room was perfect. for us We had a living area and a very comfy king bed and amazingly comfy pillows. Although we didn't use the gym or pool located on the 18th floor we went up to visit. Wonderful views and the gym was very well equpped with the latest machines and free weights. The lobby was modern with a beautiful fireplace and a good breafast/coffee/drinks bar too. The location was perfect! We were right downtown with a 2 minute walk to Eaton Centre and Yonge and Dundas square (Toronto's version of time square). Addtionally, there were pleny of wonderful restaurants, places to shop, the subway transit system, buses and taxes within a 1-5 mile radius of the hotel making it very convenient for just about everything! This is a must stay hotel for anyone wanting to truly explore the Toronto downtown core with ease.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my second visit to this hotel (the last time was for a conference a few years ago). The location of this hotel is excellent â€“ very central and close to public transport, shopping, restaurants, etc. Of all of the Toronto Marriott properties, this is the most central. It think it may also be the most expensive of all of the Toronto Marriott hotels. The hotel was very busy during my stay with several conferences and events, but the staff maintained a good attitude. As an elite member, I had access to the ground floor concierge lounge and the complementary buffet breakfast each morning. The breakfast was top-notch including a wide variety of fresh produce. Concierge lounge nibbles in the evening were a little disappointing, but the staff were friendly (I think this area used to be the old steak house). Compared to my last stay, my room was a little disappointing. It really needed a bit of a â€œrefreshâ€�. Even the bed was not quite as comfortable (it sagged a little in the middle), as a normal Marriott bed. I did spot a few dust bunnies. And I agree with previous posters, they need new cable service for the TV. The lobby refurb looked great -- now they just need to tackle some of the older rooms. If the price was right, I would go back. I wish you could give Â½ star ratings on Tripadvisor as I felt this was 3 Â½ stars out of 5.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When we arrived at the hotel, there was nobody available to get our bags. But the parking attendants were telling us we couldn't leave our car there. We told them we were checking in. Finally, while checking in, my wife had all of the information that was given us when we made the reservation. We were to get a "cars eat free" weekend, as well as free parking. The receptionist informed us that this Marriott was not a participating member of the "promotion", even though we showed the printout of what was sent to us. After checking with the manager, they gave us one night of free parking, so we chose valet. We then called the Marriott rewards program, and they said they would give us 1,000 points for our hassle. The next day, we were talking to the concierge about places to see and where to get tickets for different attractions. He said, "I can get you all of your attractions", and quoted us prices that were much higher than what we were told they would be. We declined, and he became very indignant. As it turned out, his costs were much higher than what we paid. At checkout, we didn't have to pay for parking, as the same receptionist checked us out. She told us that they were called by Marriott to remove the parking fees. It was a nice hotel, but I would recommend staying closer to the center of activities. Don't eat at the hotel. There are much better options.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for three nights over (US) President's Day weekend-Friday to Monday. Check-in was smooth and the hotel had received my on-line request for a high floor and honored it. I chose not to pay for a concierge level room since the concierge lounge was closed most of the weekend. I got a discounted rate through the Marriott.com site and decided to take that rather than using points. The room was what most would call the "typical Marriott room." Excellent housekeeping and the usual amenities; plenty of room for one person. Bed comfortable; furniture, carpeting, drapes in good repair. Breakfast in the hotel each morning; buffet style with eggs cooked to order and nice selection of the usual breakfast items, breads, etc. The staff was absolutely wonderful both at the front desk and especially in the breakfast area. All very friendly and eager to please. Used the pool and whirlpool once; the area was clean and all the equipment in the adjacent fitness center in working order. The hotel is about one and a half blocks from the Dundas Subway stop which can be reached by indoor PATH walkway; hotel is adjacent to Eaton Centre and has an interior walkway to the Sears store next door. The front desk arranged for a private transfer to the airport on my last morning at 4:15 AM and that w ent without a hitch. Overall I was pleased with the stay and the location worked well for my planned activities.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hi, we stayed at Marriott in March with a four year old and a teenager. We were upgraded to a nicer room simply when asking if our room would be big enough for all of us. That was great. They told us they would just send up extra cots for the kids. Few hours went by, and still no cots, and the four year old was getting tired. Called down twice, still no cots, finally my husband had to go down to complain at desk, finally 20 minutes later got both of the cots. The breakfast on room service and in the hotel (buffet and menu) are both pretty pricey (around 18$ each approx). There is a small area outside the restaurant that you can purchase coffee/muffins etc. which services starbucks coffee (for us Tim Horton's drinkers...not so great!!). Nice plush chairs to relax and drink, and you can sign the drinks up to your room. You can also sit there at night and have an pricey martini or other drink. There is a roadhouse type bar on one side of hotel, went there for pitcher one night, seems alright. We didn't eat at the steak bar though. The pool didn't have a shallow end for small children, so if you have a younger child you have to hold them the whole time. Hot Tub was good. Work out room is past the pool, seems to have quite a few good machines, small room though. Pool glass enclosed walls to see city from high up floor (top?). Expensive parking. ($something like $20 a day or something, so 3 days is pretty pricey).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent four nights here in November as an add-on to a business trip. You can get to the hotel easily via the Toronto Airport Express Bus, and it's just $30CN roundtrip. It's a quick ride from the airport, and the bus lets you off at the Metropolitan Hotel about 2 short blocks away. Be aware, though--you will be the first stop on the way back and travel time will be a little over an hour. The hotel has a funny site and faces sideways--it's not too impressive when you walk up, but everything changes when you enter. It has a lovely, light lobby filled with professionals who are friendly and helpful! Every interaction I had with the staff was perfect. The property looks recently renovated, and the room was spacious and comfortable. Loved the recycling bins in the closet, due to Toronto's new recycling program. The restaurant was very good and reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant. The location couldn't be better. It's right downtown, next to Eaton Centre, the gorgeous Church of the Holy Trinity, and within walking distance to just about everything. We didn't rent a car and walked everywhere, including the Bata Shoe Museum, Royal Ontario Museum, Chinatown, Kensington Market, St. Lawrence Market, and the Brewery District. Sadly, we missed the reopening of the Art Gallery of Ontario by a week, but that's definitely within walking distance of the hotel. Kensington Market and the Brewery District were the longest shlepps and those walks might not be for all, but we really enjoyed them and had fun detouring through the nearby neighborhoods. I would stay here again in a minute--loved Toronto and the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just came back from a four night stay at the Marriott Downtown Eaton Centre, and I was completely satisfied with this hotel. I was in town on business, and chose this hotel for its location. I had to book at the last minute and was able to get an excellent internet rate over the weekend days. The room was great: quiet, roomy, comfortable beds and good ventilation. Enjoyed the spacious bathroom with lots of counter space for all the toiletries that my daughter and I had. I felt that the hotel wisely focused on things we needed, like a coffee/tea maker, black out curtains, and a daily newspaper, while eliminating the nonessentials like mini-bar and robes. The expansive fitness centre is on the top floor and features city views, as well as a small pool and patio. My only quibble would be that the business centre charged $3 for 5 minutes of computer time, but if you brought your own laptop, you could use it for free in the lobby. I have to mention the housekeeping staff who were very efficient, and cleaned up our room almost as soon as we left it. All the hotel staff were friendly and courteous. The location was an excellent one for us because our event was just across the street, but we also walked to dinner on Queen Street, had many shopping choices (itâ€™s connected to the Eaton Centre, or you can meander along funky Queen West) and itâ€™s close to the subway. While we didnâ€™t get the free breakfast others have mentioned, we ended up at a tiny place across the street called The Daily Brew. A very friendly owner and you can get three eggs, two toasts, bacon and coffee for $3.99, so we became regulars for four days. All in all, a very successful business trip by day and very comfortable nights at the Marriott.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Marriott in mid-June for one night on a business trip. It is adjacent to the Eaton Centre mall, and across the street from the Toronto city hall. This makes it an ideal location for vacationers, but a bit far if you have meetings in the main business district in the downtown core (although it's not too bad for that). I hesitate to start with a description of a not-so-good experience, but the staff response to the not-so-good experience was handled so well that in the end, I left the hotel quite impressed. The issue I had is that the phone system in some of the rooms was not functioning when I checked in. The front desk clerk told me about it, and said the hotel would pay for a calling card for me if I wished to make calls. I thought that was OK, so I accepted the room and settled in. I tried to hook up my computer to the internet in the room afterwards, but I found that this was not working either because of the phone line issue. I called the customer service person (with my cell phone!) and said that I really needed to do some work on my computer and I asked whether they could not speed up the repair on the line. The customer service person was quite apologetic and told me that she would see what she could do. A few minutes later this person came to my room and handed me a key to another room that happened to have its line fixed already for that night. I moved, and everything was then OK. I thought that the service response was great - I have never had someone come to my room to hand me another key. The room itself was up to Marriott's usual standards - well done, not over-the-top luxurious, but very nice. The bed was comfortable and I got a good night's sleep. I recommend this hotel, especially if you want to do a bit of shopping.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed from August 3rd to 5th with two friends for Caribana Weekend; booked on Expedia at the last minute so I was a bit worried, but the price was fair, so I figured I'd take what I got. Check-in was a breeze; it took about 2 minutes and the front desk let my friend check his bag before-hand while he waited for me in Eaton Centre. I was told upon booking that the double beds may not be available; this was confirmed upon check-in. The room we were given had a King Bed and pull-out sofa. This was not a problem as there were only 3 of us - 2 shared the King bed, and 1 took the sofa bed. We were assigned a room on the 15th floor, which was beautiful. The decor was tasteful, flat-screen tv, VERY soft King bed, marble counter in the bathroom...we were quite impressed. The service at the Mariott was wonderful for the duration of our stay. We had forgotten toothpaste, and went down to the front desk to ask if any was available. They had personal-size packs sent up to our room both days we were there. Room service was not over-priced and it took about half an hour for our dinner to arrive on the Saturday evening, when we were too lazy to venture out for a meal. The food was excellent. All staff that we dealt with were courteous and professional. The only problem (and the reason for my rating of 4 rather than 5) for the entire weekend was that the fire alarm went off around 6:45 on Sunday morning and continued until about 7:15. This was incredibly annoying and extremely loud in our room. I understand that for safety reasons the alarm was necessary, but did not understand why the annoucements continued every 5 minutes advising that they were looking into the matter and would provide further information later. Needless to say, it was difficult to sleep after this. Other than that one tiny mishap, our stay was WONDERFUL and I would definitely recommend this hotel to other travellers, and would stay at the Marriott again myself.</p></li>
