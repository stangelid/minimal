<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lovely hotel, upgrade to superior, lot of room and quiet. Hotel desk staff were very cooperative. Included breakfast was in a beautiful dining room, better than average for Europe, not as good as in the Orient.. Well located next to the flower marked. Short walking distance to just about everything. This was our second stay here.</p></li>

Expect a down-at-heel 3 star and you wont be disappointed. However the real low point is the italian workers in reception who are the most outrageously rude and unhelpful I have have experienced in Europe. They are pointlessly aggressive and argumentative.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a quiet hotel in a very central location. Our room was good size and had an updated bathroom. The staff members speak English and seemed nice. The mini bar does charge you when you open it (we just had them take the charges off the bill - no problem). We used the fridge for our own food. Don't eat at the first-floor restaurant. Not good and overpriced. The Caruso Restaurant is great. I wouldn't rate this as a 4-star hotel; more of a 3.</p></li>

I would recommend this hotel to anyone, it's a five minute walk to Dam Square. The room had a superking bed, loved by my six feet two inch boyfriend! Bathroom was my favourite. The room was cleaned everyday to a high standard leaving a wee sweetie on my pillow. We watched a movie while there, and for the extra charge it was worth it. really enjoyer my hotel experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked 3 nights in a deluxe room with breakfast for ?95 per night...the room itself was lovely, fab bathroom but if, like me, you are booking this hotel for the whirlpool bath, you'll be disappointed! The baths have not worked for the past 3 yrs although some websites still state that they are in every room. Also the staff were pretty rude to us, we asked for room service at 10.30pm on a sunday night and were laughed at. Not really a 4* I'd say, but you can't beat the location.</p></li>

It was also very quiet at night despite being on a tram line and with the flower market etc. Breakfast is mega-expensive, go for the cafe's down in the road in Rembrandtsplein instead. Staff are extremely helpful and polite and you can get a bus to Schipol from the hotel door if you like (Connexxion bus). Rooms were small but were clean. Rather expensive for the room but all hotels in Amsterdam seem to be around the same, even for worse locations.</p></li>

My friend chose here because they had nice photos of the bath rooms and rooms looked big and clean. Location wise it is very good but thats all. Wi fi is not free and you need to reconnect every half hr even from the loby where it is free. House keeping is bad, our bed was made every day but our pijamas were tucked in to the corners w/out being folded. Balcony was full with cigarette filters. Ä°t is expencive for all these bad services.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had booked to stay for two nights but due to Volcanic Ash etc ended up staying four. Which meant we had time to explore this beautiful city. The Hotels location could not be better, right next to the flower market and within walking distance to the main attractions. Breakfast buffet was adequate but nothing special. Rooms are again nothing to write home about. Air conditioning didn't work so had to keep the curtains closed as with it being sunny weather the room soon heated up. Hope they get it working for the summer as with the window open the noise was unbearable.</p></li>

Hotel is very clean and spacious, with courteous staff. Didn't have breakfast there as prefer to venture out to tast local treats, and i think i chose wisely. Big local presence which makes you feel like you are on holiday and not trapped in a tourist loop. best place i've stayed in amsterdam</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was very pleased with our stay at the Jolly given the mixed reviews on this site. We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights at the end of October 2005 and could not fault the service or the room. The location is fantastic to be able to walk around the city in any direction. Takes 5 mins to walk to Dam square. We were on the 6th floor at the back and had no problems with noise. The only thing that I could say to improve on was the hairdryer. If your the kind of person that relies on one in the morning then I would suggest you take your own. Great service and I would stay here again</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel staff were helpful, location excellent, rooms clean and our stay was great. We would recommend this hotel to those who want to see all of Amsterdam but still sleep comfortably at night. From the airport just hop on the train to central station (3.40 euro) then take tram 14 or 16 (1.60euro) to the tower. Right past the tower is this great hotel. Would definetly recommend getting a canal bus pass for the day (16.00euro). They're good until noon the following day and make stops close to all the major museums and historical sites (Van gogh museum, Anne Frank House,etc). What a delightful city!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Like many others, I got this hotel on a priceline bid. When we checked in, they told us that the room we had reserved wasn't available (we arrived quite late in the evening) and that they were upgrading us. That was fine; the room itself was spacious and had everything we needed. The bathroom, however, needed a good scrubbing with a mildew remover. The hallways also had seen better days - there were spots where the paint (and plaster?) was chipped off. We liked the location, and the service in the bar was good and friendly. Overall, not what I would expect. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either.</p></li>

Maybe in 1998 this situation was OK, but now it's not in compliance with a four stars hotel. Prices are very high: for two nights and 1 person (double for single use) I paid more than 310 Euro, including breakfast an in-room wi-fi (you have to pay for both these last services). The Restaurant Caruso (one of the best Italian restaurants in Northern Europe) has been closed and the launch restaurant just prepares frozen foods.The reception staff sometime is not so polite and friendly (especially the Managers).</p></li>

Even though we were not guaranteed a specific room, we sent an email two days before arrival and got exactly what we requested- without having to pay any extra.

This hotel is very central, within walking distance of Dam Square, The Palace and about 15-20 mins walk from Centraal Station. The breakfast in the hotel is fair but not worth the 19 euro per person. We had a Deluxe room which was large, good view over canal and over the flower market this was on the fifth floor and was very nice. Ann Franks House was very much worth a visit. If you get chance to go to Voldendam and Marken on an excursion then go, this was a good trip. People seem very friendly although beware if you are looking lost someone may wish to help you which is good, but for a fee!</p></li>

I had a beautiful view of the street and nicolas church, and eventhough the hotel is right in the party/clubbing district i had no problems with noise or disturbance. great location within easy walking distance of the flower market, shopping area, restaurants, rembrandtsplein and much more. the breakfast is a bit expensive (costing 20 Euro) but a great big delicious buffet with everything imaginable.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent few nights there in September 2008 together with my wife. Nothing spectacular; basic hotel, clean but not very spacious standard rooms, standard amenities: minibar, nice bed (with a neat bonus: they had few pillow types to choose from with tiny samples in the room). Breakfast was pricey (20e) but comprehensive and it was set in a nice restaurant hall, with natural morning sunlight flooding in. Location of the hotel is great: Rembrantplein just 150metres away and 10 minutes walk to the Dam, 20 to central station. Trams and taxies were quick to catch directly in front of the hotel. Basicly hassle free, safe choice. There are a lot more dodgier hotels in Amsterdam...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My son and I spent 2 nights at the Jolly Carlton and had a great time. The staff were warm, very friendly and attentive and the location was superb. We arrived early in the morning and although our room wasn't ready for us we were able to leave our case and go off on our travels. The receptionist pointed us in the right direction and advised us to go to the tourist information to buy tickets for the attractions - this way we didn't have to queue (we could walk straight in) and also we were given small discounts - a double bonus. Overall, thanks to the staff at the Jolly Carlton, we had a very enjoyable break - we will definately return and recommend it to all of our friends.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were very happy with this hotel. I was perfect location, short walk to a lot of the popular areas. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed in one of the Standard rooms and it was a good size and very comfortable. The only problem we had was the first night our room was very very hot (turns out the hotel had the central heating on). We tried to open the window but it was only the 2nd floor and right on the street so we couldnt sleep. When we told the front desk the next morning they were very apologetic and offered to swap rooms for us. The new one was much better, on the 6th floor and a lot cooler. I would definetly stay here again and recommend it to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Jolly for the weekend, so glad we picked this hotel. Location was fantastic beside the floating Flower Market. Taking the tram was easy, only about 5 mins to Central Station and to Leiseplain. Walking to the Old Side and Chinatown was a pleasant 15 minutes through the main shopping street in the City. Good choice of fast food and decent restaurants in the area. We arrived early but were allowed to check in the room. The hotel upgraded us, at no extra charge, to a lovely superior room on the top floor with a balcony and a nice view of the city. Not spacious but the room was clean, modern and I believe recently renovated in 2003. We would definitely stay again on our next trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Carlton for one night, as part of a tour. After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, I figured it was good to be there for only one night. The complaints about noise had me worried enough to purchase earplugs. Then, we arrived only to find that the Dutch team had won the Futbol (soccer) final; and there was "partying" galore!! I was dreading the night. So, I was surprised and happy to see that the hotel had invested in what appears to be fairly new double pane windows. With the low hum from the fan (it didn't work like air conditioning) and the new windows, we didn't hear any noise, and slept soundly. We really enjoyed our canal cruise-all the humpback bridges, houseboats, etc.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Gross. This place looks and smells like a US airport Sheridan built in the 1970s. We booked this hotel on Orbitz. When we first checked in the front desk the woman kept asking for a voucher. All we had was our print out from Orbitz. The exchange were she kept asking for the voucher was an unplesant experience. Then we go up to our room... There are holes in the walls in the hallways, torn wallpaper, and a horrible smell. We got in the room and sat on the bed and the nice white bedcover was punctuated with pubic hair. The room was tiny. We asked to look at a deluxe room and it was not much better. Same torn wallpaper, bad smell, but larger room and bathroom. We left immediately for another hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After booking the trip and hotel and reading the reviews on the site, I was expecting the worse and when I got there, I found it to be a really pleasant experience. The room we had was really spacious and the bathroom was large enough for 2 people (with two sink basins) and the bed could've accommodated 4 people! I found it a bit noisy at night around 4am when drunken people were shouting in the street but overall, found the hotel to be excellent. I got a good price for the trip and the hotel seemed to be a bargain. It is in a fantastic location and we walked everywhere for 3 days and I highly recommend the Indonesian restaurant around the corner next to the Flower Market. Would definitely recommend!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After a flight from Rome we arrived in the evening at our hotel. A very sweet young lady checked us in and noticed we were staying for 6 nights. "I'am going to upgrade you to a nicer room (we had booked a standard) with a GREAT VIEW." Our room was #532 and it was very nice. Looked out over the Munt square and we were serenaded by the Munt tower. The hotel's location is just fine for everything. Plenty of places for breakfast, lunch or dinner or to just sit someplace (Rembrandtplein) and enjoy a drink and people watch. One drawback; you can not use the inroom refregirator for your own articles but there is a coffeemaker that works.Even though we had typical Amsterdam weather (RAIN!!). we enjoyed our stay at the Carlton.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked on internet and stayed here for one night. I chose this hotel because the pickings were slim due to a last minute travel decision, and I seem to recall I had stayed here a few years ago and found it nice. However, I was THOROUGHLY disappointed!! The hotel looks nice, but was really dated inside. Staff was rude - I asked for change to park my car, and they were really reluctant and then finally gave me a bunch of small coins although they had plenty of others. I mean, the least they could do for their guests was to welcome us upon our arrival!! The heat wasn't working properly and I was freezing all night. I asked for a non-smoking room but got a room that smelled like an old bar PLUS it smelled heavily of insecticide. Never again!</p></li>

The hotel is clean, staff friendly (we had no problems to raise and found the staff - particualrly the two doormen- very polite and helpful), and the breakfast buffet was good though the the cafe bar is expensive and there are much nicer bars and cafes within five minutes walk.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The NH Carlton was absolutely great! It was very clean and comfortable! The staff was knowledgeable and friendly. From the hotel you can walk anywhere, 10 mins. to Heineken Brewery, 15 mins to Van Gogh Museum 2 mins to Rembrantplein ( a great place for nightlife & food!) and 5 mins to Dam Square. Its located right next to the floating flower market. Though you can walk pretty much anywhere, a tram stop is right outside the hotel! Around the hotel there are many restaurants and fast food to choose from. The main shopping area is located a block away. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in the middle of Amsterdam in a clean and comfy room. The rates are also very reasonable, June 2009 I paid 90 euros a night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked the hotel through Thomson and got an excellent rate. The hotel is clean and comfortable with friendly, professional staff. The rooms are a little outdated but certainly not grubby and come with all the facilities you'd expect including a mini-bar and tea and coffee making facilities. The breakfasts are plenty to set you up for the day and include some lovely little iced cakes. The best thing about this hotel though is the location; right next to the flower market and no more than five minutes from Rembrandt square, it's completely central and within walking distance of most of the major attractions. Obviously we visited out of season so it was bound to be quieter and cheaper but regardless of the time of year, the location is pretty much unbeatable.</p></li>

You can get just an hour a day free wifi in the lobby anywhere else will cost you. and don't forget the tourist tax too. The room was good although the grey decor and the grey hallways make it a little dark, the conference facilities good also but sometimes the service was lacking - forgetting to bring refreshments to the training room on several occassions and they seemed a little unsure what the plan was for lunch each day!! For those who paid for breakfast apparantly I didn't miss anything. By the way parking is E40 a day too. Its in a great place to explore the city although I didn't have much time for that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">With so many choices I decided after my Milano Jolly Hotel experience to do it again, but in the Dam. My first Deluxe room was small and overlooked the street. Spent 2 nights in this room and then upgraded to a quiet, larger Superior room. What a difference 50 Euros made. Ate breakfast in their Italian style restaurant- great Italian waiters- a little bit of real Italy in Amsterdam. Beyond easy to navigate around the city from this hotel. The flower market was a great way to ask for directions back to the hotel. The weather was warm for October , and the A/C had been previously shut off and heat was available. Didnt use it but it was a little warm in the room. Not the fault of the hotel. I doubt Ill be returning to Amsterdam but if I do I'll surely add the Jolly Carlton to my itinerary.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Even if it's a bit further from central railway station (about 20 minutes walk) it really worth the effort. It's in the middle of everything : museum area on one hand and classical amsterdam attractions like red light district on the other. It's clean and staff very helpful. Breakfast is also very good and is served until late in the morning. Be prepared to ask for room in the front side of the hotel though !!! Rooms (standard rooms) are rather small but ok keeping in mind what you can find in other hotels (with no windows, dirty etc.). It's only 200 meters away from Dam square. Other attractions (like icebar etc) are just 2 blocks away. It's also too close to many fast foods and other stores and restaurants. Also try their massage chairs !!! The best you can have after a long day in the streets !!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just came back from a 5 night stay at the Jolly Carlon Hotel. Excellent hotel in a great location. Room was perfect, nicely decorated, very comfy bed and huge bathtub - especially nice after spending the day walking all over town. Location is excellent, literally 10 minutes to everything. Trams stop right around the corner from the hotel and run everywhere. I only took the tram once but that's because I enjoy walking. The stroll up the main shopping street around the corner from the hotel to Dam square is so intoxicating, full of life and culture. After reading some other reviews I was somewhat skeptical, but ended up being pleasantly surprised with everything! I stayed at the Victoria last time I vistited which does not even come close in comparison to the Jolly. I would definitely stay here again and reccommend it highly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I arrived for a 4 day trip from America to see friends and to see U2 at the Amsterdam Arena. I tried to check in my room at 8am but was told it was not available. They have signs that you can upgrade for $25/night and I asked if I could upgrade for this night so I could shower and go to bed. He said he had nothing available so I checked my bag and went to Barney's for a great breakfast and morning smoke. I came back at 11am and they gave me a room on the top floor with a large balcony. Everything was positive about the experience except for having to pay for Internet serv ice but my company will reimburse me so all in all, I highly recommend this hotel. Room was clean and comfortable and bathroom was great if you do not require a tub. Service was very understated and excellent. I will stay here again if the prices are competitive.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Myself and partner have just stayed at the NH Carlton, for two nights, March 17/18 2011. We never really use hotel eating and drinking facilities, so I will ignore these in my review. Firstly check-in. We met very polite and capable staff, who allowed our security deposit to be paid in cash. No hassle here. The Room; It was the 7th floor, room 719. As others have said, the mini bar was empty. No loss to me. It worked as a fridge, and as such we could fill it with our own cheaply bought soda, fruit and water. I thought the room was fantastic because of the balcony. This more than made up for the 'worn' carpets!! Bed sheets were spotless, as was the bathroom. Old CRT tv in the room, but we go to Amsterdam to relax and have fun, not watch TV. Check-out was fast and easy. Full marks NH Carlton and thankyou for a lovely stay. See you again next month hopefully.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not a 4 star more like a 3. Our smoking room was basic with peeling and cracked wall paper/plaster. Ask for a room away from the main road otherwise you can hear the trams and cars ect until the early morning. Good location being next to the floating flower market and about 20 minutes walk to Dam Square. Literally round the corner from gay friendly bars and restaurants and coffee shops ect. Not very good choice in TV channels unless you want to spend 13 euros on watching a movie. No price list for the mini bar - a small toblerone was 4 euros i found out on check out. Make sure you have enough coffee and tea ect before housekeeping leave for the evening as although the staff are friendly didnt always have supplies Would stay there again because of the location but not because of the rooms - would first check the price of the Banks Mansion hotel first though.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for five nights on a 2-week business trip. The location was great -- on a Tram line, an easy walk to the Metro that took me to Biljmer Arena (the stop for my company's office), and right in the middle of things. My room was at the back of the hotel -- on check in, the staff did ask for my preference -- but a little too small and "tired." There was an electric kettle to make tea and a refrigerator (nice, with an Albert Heijn just around the corner), but *very* few electric outlets. I unplugged the desk lamp to make room for my lap top, and unplugged the TV so that I could use the electric kettle. The bathroom had a hair dryer, but it came apart in my hand and the sink was extremely slow to drain. Still, it had a nice electric towel bar. I think the hotel needs some refurbishing and I probably won't stay there again if I have other comparably-priced options.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in room 602 which was at the back of the hotel with a great view and very quiet. Room was spacious , warm and clean. The bathroom was spotless and large. Shower excellent. The location is faultless. 15 mins walk to Van Gogh Museum, Adjacent to Flower Market . 15 mins walk to Red Light District - don't need to use trams etc unless you have difficulty walking. Schipol Airport to Amsterdam Central is 15 mins and is 4.20 euros one way. We walked from train station to hotel in half an hour but a direct tram is available outside station. Loads of restaurants around hotel including a MacDonalds that serve a great breakfast for 6 euros - juice, croissant, coffee/tea and bacon/egg muffin. Subways are all over and many other restaurants and supermarkets nearby. If we go to Amsterdam again i will choose this hotel. We have visited over 20 capital cities and this is one of the best locations/quality hotels we have experienced.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent a lot of time trying to find a hotel with a central location, bathtub and a buffet breakfast as this were the kids requirements for the trip. As Amsterdam hotels are very expensive we also tried to find hotel for less than 200 euro pr night including breakfast and and extra bed for children, and this was not easy. However we got a de luxe room at NH Carlton for this price at the net, and the room was large (36 sq m), with a huge bed, huge bathroom with spa bath and separate shower and fantastic view. The decor was quite dull, but it was clean, and a worked great for a family. The kids loved the breakfast, but I thought the bacon was a bit cold and the cheese somewhat dry for a 4 star hotels breakfast. The location is fantastic with walking distance to all sites in Amsterdam. The smaller rooms looked a bit small, so I am not sure if I would recommend them (just looked inside when passing by), but the de luxe rooms are great for families.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel through Priceline and got a good rate. The location was pretty good and we easily walked many places from the hotel. Parking was available, but expensive and a hassle (having to be buzzed in and out). We checked in early and the desk clerk said only 2 single beds were available, but we were tired and took them. Thankfully the 2 single beds are pushed together, so it seemed like a double. The desk clerk was very very friendly and helpful also. I was surprised, however, that the desk could not change out currency. Most "4 star" hotels can do this. The hallways were narrow and older looking. Our bathroom needed major work. It wasn't super clean and unfortunately smelled a bit like urine. I tried to ignore it, but it was definitely there. Only shampoo in the bathroom - no conditioner or body lotion. The breakfast was somewhat expensive considering the scrambled eggs were clearly powdered. We were here only one night, so we dealt with it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have never seen such unfriendly, clueless, rude, and unpleasant reception staff in a hotel like at the NH Carlton. They answered every question with a sense of arrogance and a feeling of just wanting to get rid of you. They did not give us a single correct answer as far as location of attractions and transportation. It seemed like these people were tourists just like us. They're front desk staff is responsible for answering the house phone and dealing with reception guests. The phone is their #1 priority because each time it rang we would need to wait for them to finish. Listening to the answers they gave the guests on the phone was simply shocking. Raising their voice and acting completely rude to one person left us standing their thinking if we made a mistake choosing this hotel. our check-in process took 25 minutes since the phone rang about 6 times. Overall these people are completely clueless as far as customer service and hospitality are concerned.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this hotel based on its location, which was the right decision for our 5-day visit. The view from our 6th floor room with a balcony and large French doors was nothing short of wonderful. We looked directly at the Munt Plein, and when it was lighted at night and the bells were chiming, the effect was exactly what we were looking for on this visit. When the doors were closed, and room-darkening draperies drawn, this deluxe room was quiet. The room was clean and the bathroom was updated and also very clean. The staff at the front desk (as well as the doormen) was helpful and courteous to us during our entire five days. We asked a lot of questions, and also needed their help making dinner reservations for us. All this was done immediately, and in a most pleasant manner. I found NO FAULT with the staff. This is an Italian hotel chain, and love being with Italians. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a full-service hotel in a great location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel through hotelconnect.co.uk which had the best price at the time and included breakfast - a lot of the deals from other sites didn't include breakfast. The hotel is fantastic!! In a great location, right at the flower market which is great for gifts and there are shops there that you can get a strippenkaart (for the trams - the little tobacconist is great because they'll show you how to use it). Also, just along from the hotel is the Rembrantplein which is a great area for pubs and restaurants if you're wanting to avoid busy crowds but still enjoy yourself. The hotel itself was such a surprise to me. The room we were in was really big and the bathroom was lovely. The lift always works! which is great because my mum is disabled and we really needed that. The staff are probably the worst point, very snooty. The porters only help you on arrival if you look like you're a tipper, the reception staff are ok but could be a little more helpful. They can be rather frosty.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">.. because we thought it was wonderful! We stayed for 5 nights and paid Â£600 for a Deluxe Superior room. This had an ensuite marble bathroom with dual sinks, a large bedroom with separate living area, two TVs including 1 plasma LCD and although the 2 beds were pushed together (seems to be the norm) they were comfortable and large. The room's best asset was the view which looked over the flower market and canals on one side and Muntplein on the other, we could watch the world go by! The location was also good, not as noisy as Dam/Rembrantplein but location's irrelevant really given the amazing Dutch transport systems. I've seen a few comments about the unfriendly staff, we found all of the staff very welcoming and chatty and the man on the reception at 4.30am was more than happy to order us a pizza which the delivery firm dropped off 30 mins later! I would happily recommend this hotel and although I do like to try different places out, I'd be worried about other establishments not matching up.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this Hotel through Expedia, then read these reviews and panicked slightly. Stayed at the Victoria in July, and this was way better. We arrived too early to check in to our room, but the receptionist was friendly, gave us a map of Amsterdam, and a guide booklet, and the concierge kept our bags for us. When we returned a few hours later, the same receptionist remembered us. The room wasn't brilliant, but we loved it. It was exceptionally clean, nicely decorated and although not huge, there was plenty of room, and storage.We had no room safe, not the adverstised slippers, but there was an abundance of towels, shampoos etc. Also, there were tea/ coffee making facilities at no extra charge. Queries that we raised were dealt with promptly and with a nice attitude, and breakfast was good. The mini bar prices were not excessive. The room was not soundproofed to the traffic, but this was not noisy enough to be a problem. As a frequent visitor to Amsterdam, this would be on my list for hotels to visit again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good Hotel, Great Location.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our third stay in Amsterdam so we know our way around and this is as good a location as you could wish for. although centrally positioned we were pleased by how quiet our room was. OK the view was to the rear of the hotel overlooking an office complex courtyard but it meant that it was away from the busy thoroughfare to the front of the building and the consequent noise of such a vibrant little city. We cannot comment on many of the facilities as we only used it as a place to crash; late nights and early breakfasts are not for us. We took only a standard room, not intending to spend much time there, but it was clean and tidy. The bathroom only had a shower but it worked perfectly, good pressure and temperature. If you wish to smoke there is a floor of such rooms available. The staff were all very courteous and despite us arriving early allowed us to store our luggage until our room was available, on departure they again looked after our cases until we were ready to leave on our evening flight home.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice location, slightly worn down”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for a single night in late June. I must agree with my fellow reviewers and admint, that the location is very central, but the street noise might be annoying if your room doesn't face the rear of the hotel. Rooms and bathrooms could use some refurbishment. The furniture and carpets were not quite up to date and the bathooom was small and hasn't been updated for some years. That said, the cleaning standard was good - one of the better which I have experienced. The biggest issue was the A/C, which despite running on full speed, didn't contribute much to lowering the room temperature. Luckilly, as my room faced the rear of the hotel (closed courtyard) I could turn off the A/C and sleep with my window open. Another issue was a quite low water pressure in the shower. Calculate with some extra minutes for washing shampoo out of your hair. Breakfast was what you might expect from this hotel standard in Netherlands. OK, without being extraordinary. Costing 20â‚¬, you might be better off finding a nearby cafÃ©.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for four days in this hotel. Its well positioned in relation to attractions etc. However it is so overpriced. â‚¬7.50 for a small vodka from th mini bar, the hoel bar was only a euro less ans charged â‚¬7.00 for a beer. the hotel bar is soulless as is the rest of the hotel. It lacks all atmosphere and while staff are polite, friendly is not a description I would use. When we arrived we were shown to room 536. It was a nightmare even for a "standard" room. It was tiny and the view was a blank wall. We had to ask for upgrade asap couldnt spend the night in it. â‚¬25 per night to up to a superior room (533) three doors down but it was worth it. It was in no way luxurious, the carpet was even faded and patched. But at least we could walk about and had a view.Breakfast not great either you could have your eggs boiled or scrambled! So so! Poor choices. And another thing for a 4star hotel what are they doing using such cheap toilet tissue! It was dreadfull had to go and buy some! Have stayed in cheaper hotels in amsterdam and have received far better service.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Jolly Carlton - What a nice surprise !”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was very surprised with what I encountered when I walked into my room at the Jolly Hotel Carlton. I don't know why it's rated so low int this website. This other hotel, that I stayed in the beginning of my trip, rates much higher, and didn't even come close to the Jolly Hotel. I booked a double deluxe room. It was only 20 to 40 euros more than the regular room. I know that 20 to 40 euros a night can add up, but you will be still probably paying less than some of the other hotels in Amsterdam. The other hotel I stayed was more expensive and as I said didn't offer half of what Jolly did. We got a very spacious room with a very spacious bathroom (two sinks and all) facing the back ot the hotel (so it was very quiet). We had robes and slippers in the room for us to use and even chocolate/candy on our pillows every night. The only thing that wasn't included was breakfast, but I think it's pretty much like that all over Amsterdam. The hotel is very well located, between Rembrandt-Plein and Leidseplein. There are excellent restaurants all over the area and great shopping too. The perfect area to stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent 3 nights at this hotel in September. The location was good and we found we could easily walk to all the tourist attractions in Amsterdam - another plus was the tram line just outside the hotel door. All this was good - but probably not too hard to find in Amsterdam as it is fairly easy to negotiate. The staff were friendly and tried to help with directions and complaints. We got the feeling that they were frustrated by a couple of our complaints as it seemed they had heard them before and they have not been dealt with by management. The literature in our room had the wrong time displayed for breakfast times. We arrived and they were packing up - when we pointed this out to the manager she begged us to talk to hotel management because she had had many complaints and nothing had been done about it. The hotel foyer has obviously been updated - but not the rooms. The rooms and hallways are tired and in fact, a little dirty. Our bedspread was grubby and the bathroom was tired as well. It was not the worst hotel I have stayed in but I wouldn't recommend it. Not such a Jolly stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Would advise against this hotel: ugly building, unfriendly reception staff, rooms that are tired and outdated. No interest in helping customers. I was given a non smoking room that reeked of cigarettes. When I asked to change it, the receptionist said "it's not possible you are on a non smoking floor" and said she would come and check herself ! Once inside the room, she reluctantly agreed that there was an issue. I was moved to room 50. Avoid at all costs. It's actually a meeting room that they turn into a bedroom by using some kind of cupboard open folded down bed. Dark wood panels all around, stained carpet, ripped bed cover, could have been the set of a bad 70's porn movie :-) It was on the mezzanine so a gathering place for peoople. I was awoken at 6:25 by a very nousy group of American retirees. When asked at checkout if my stay was good, I said "no, terrible actually". The receptionist didn't say anything back, no discout offer not even an apology. All of this for a total of 187â‚¬ ! No wonder it was one of the few hotels left with availability that night. You can only stay there if you have no other alternatives !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I had a 5 day stay recently in Amsterdam at the NH Carlton. It's by the flower market, perfect location to get everywhere via walking or the tram/train. The rooms were small or quaint but clean and simple. We were on the 7th floor which was smaller with double bed (not two twins put together!) and a nice size balcony that overlooked the city. It was perfect for our stay and we were able to take some wonderful post-rain pictures of sundown from our balcony. My only problem which wasn't an issue was the cleaning solution they use for the hallways...smells like industry cleaner they use for public bathrooms. The hallways were like a cruise but the lobby was fine with 30min free wi-fi and the restaurant and bar was nice with good service. The concierge were helpful with detailed maps of the city and speaks English (I don't think they were even Dutch) and knew almost everywhere we asked them directions for. Nice area, clean hotel and it was pretty inexpensive for Amsterdam! Definitely good value for the buck! would recommend if you are not so picky about space and the extra luxury from real 4 or 5 star accommodations.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ive been on Holidays many times, and i always try to read some sort of review beforehand to hopefully clear up any worries. I personally believe that alot of the complaining has been, and i dont mean to cause any offence. from Americans. (this goes for nearly every hotel resort ive been to). what people complain about is so petty and meaningless. "oh the decor wasnt to my taste" etc.. or a paid 60Euros a night for a meal i didnt like..well go out to a resturant theres plenty of them in amsterdam! theres a Mcdonalds across the street. what made me more worried about my holiday was this complaining, i was so excited then listening to all these negative comments really dragged me down, i'd just spent Â£600 on this holiday as a suprise for my man, and had a made the biggest mistake?! sheer panic struck, but as soon as we arrived the panic melted away, if your expecting a big cheesy american grin and the "have a nice day!" go to america, this is europe. the girls on the front desk work hard, and probably into the early hours of the morning. basically what im trying to say is if your expecting the ritz go to the ritz. if your expecting a nice safe hotel room in a beautiful area go to the jolly.</p></li>

<li>Ive been on Holidays many times, and i always try to read some sort of review beforehand to hopefully clear up any worries.</br></br></li>
<li>I personally believe that alot of the complaining has been, and i dont mean to cause any offence.</br></br></li>
<li>from Americans.</br></br></li>
<li>(this goes for nearly every hotel resort ive been to).</br></br></li>
<li>what people complain about is so petty and <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.959">meaningless</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>"oh the <span style="background-color:#557585" title="p=0.998">decor</span> wasnt to my taste" etc.. or a paid 60Euros a night for a meal i didnt like..well go out to a resturant theres plenty of them in amsterdam!</br></br></li>
<li>theres a <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">Mcdonalds</span> across the street.</br></br></li>
<li>what made me more worried about my holiday was this complaining, i was so excited then listening to all these negative comments really dragged me down, i'd just spent Â£600 on this holiday as a suprise for my man, and had a made the biggest mistake?!</br></br></li>
<li>sheer panic struck, but as soon as we arrived the panic melted away, if your expecting a big cheesy american grin and the "have a nice day!"</br></br></li>
<li>go to america, this is europe.</br></br></li>
<li>the girls on the front desk work hard, and probably into the early hours of the morning.</br></br></li>
<li>basically what im trying to say is if your expecting the ritz go to the ritz.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On arrival one is greeted by a burly doorman who is clearly too busy chatting with a local trader to offer assistance with luggage. We had reserved two rooms non smoking (thatâ€™s another issue I will come to) The reception personnel advised that although we had requested adjoining or at least next door rooms and our children would be in there and as we always do when travelling like to have them in the next room just in case etc. With 30 minutes of discussion and my patience being pushed to the limit, we were offered rooms opposite each other as these where the only suitable NON SMOKING (remember we reserved non smoking rooms) available. The fifth floor, the non-smoking floor had the strongest tobacco aroma imaginable, we might as well have been beagles in a laboratory! The room, although clean and well maintained, was very warm, on enquiry we discovered that the hotel air conditioning is not turned on for some weeks yet, so you either have stuffy, over heated room with tobacco smells or you open the window to the noise of generators and air duct systems of the adjacent office building. The restaurants, in the hotel, which prides itself on being four stars could only be described as cancer chambers, one could not even begin to think of ordering food.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We didn't get the opportunity to stay at the NH Carlton, despite booking and paying for it 6 weeks in advance. When we arrived at the NH Carlton we were told there were no rooms left and "the whole of Amsterdam is full". We actually thought the desk clerk was joking. It turns out, no they weren't. NH Carlton policy is to overbook rooms and 5 or 6 weekends a year this means people miss out on their room. NH Carlton sent us all the way back to the NH Airport hotel. Fortunately the NH airport hotel staff are wonderful and stood up for us and argued that we needed to have a hotel in the centre of town. After one night at the airport we managed to get back into the city (but not to the NH Carlton). Several times NH Carlton lied to our faces about all the NH hotels being fully booked. When we arrived at the airport hotel, they said NH Carlton hadn't actually booked us in there, but into a hotel even further out from town. We were so luck the airport staff took pity on us and let us stay. Do NOT book the Jolly Carlton if you want to actually stay there - chances are they will send you somewhere else and will treat you terribly in the process. NH as a chain was good, and both the two other NH hotels gave us the impression that they deal with the Carlton's stuff ups, and greediness, all the time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">paid 129.00 euro per standard room per night thro the hotel website. After reading the reviews I was abit apprehensive about this hotel however I cannot fault the location. Get the conexion shuttle bus from airport to hotel- will cost you 19 euros return but handy if you dont want the hassle of hauling luggage around and trying to find your own way or want to save time or both! Check in was ok...reception guy refused to acknowlege that I sent him an email requesting a nice room with a nice view if possible but was not gonna let it ruin my midweek break- we got a standard room with no view on 6th floor, bit stuffy, could have done with better air conditioning as it was hot, the room was small but clean. Cannot fault the location as per previous reviews right beside the flower market and within walking distance to everywhere of interest. Hot Tip: come out of hotel turn right to the corner of that road and you will find a great chinese restaurant called P King-good food good value and interesting people watching!Great place just to chill! Even cheaper, wok to work, wok to go etc: great little takeaway noodle bars if your watching your pennies! Amsterdam is not that big and there are loads of budget hotels near the train station in the centre just watch out for pick pockets! Canal cruising is the way to see amsterdam-try the hop on hop off boat however start out early as they finish around 6pm cost:17 euro</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me & my partner stayed at this hotel for two nights. Upon check in, Bernadette was very helpful and showed us places to go. We arrived in our room which was tiny, old and distasteful. The room was so stuffy and the aircon didnt help one bit. To order a movie cosed 13 euros which is the biggest rip off ever. Everything comes at a price with this hotel. To add breakfast was 20 euros per person per night (which we were not willing to pay) as we were already paying 179 euros for the first night. On the last day, already disatisfied, we asked a lady who worked there what time check out was & so we left our bags in the room and went out until half an before the check out time. When we went back to our room, the key wouldnt work and so we had to get another key from reception where the lady explained checkout was earlier than we though but she said if we got our bags and came down it would be fine. So we did. Once checking out, we got a different tall blonde lady instead of the one who had been dealing with us earlier. She refused to accept we were late by mistake and charged us 30 euros late checkout fee on top of the 330 euros for 2 nights!! I usually wouldnt complain but this hotel is a scam, trying to exploit people and take their money any way they can. Rooms were horrible and the service was very unpleasant. I wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone and i certainly wont be back. Staying at this hotel ruined our holiday.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Jolly Carlton. The Hotel itself isnt bad, I give it 3 stars out of 5 . The room we got was 2 beds, the beds are not that comfortable, definetly dated. The carpet, room furniture and TV are very dated. But most importantly everything was clean, sheets and bathroom included. The bathroom is actually very nice. We stayed in room 316 , which seemed very lucky since the view was excellent, opening up to a nice little street , and it had a terrace. Internet is expensive in the hotel at .35 Euro per minute. There were about 4 English networks on the TV. Location of the Hotel was superb. Bars,Coffee shops, flower market, shopping , and nice resturants very close. Almost everything is in walking distance - Including Red Light , museums , Brewery and Central Station. The Zoo was a bit of a walk but only because I think we got lost. I would reccomend this hotel for a short, budgeted stay. But if you could afford more and need to be pampered look elsewhere. I would equate it to a Holiday Inn or Best Western in the USA. There is room service from the Italian restaurant beneath the hotel, the restaurant has excellent Brick Oven pizza, there;s also a great Chinese resturant on the corner. There's a Dutch Supermarket called Albert Heijn that is a 2 minute walk and is a great place to pick up snacks for the room. All in all the hotel was satisfactory, the sanitized bathroom is the biggest selling point.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was awesome. We were on a two-week jaunt through Europe, staying at 3 and 4 star hotels, and this was right up there at the top for our favorite hotels. PROS: * Awesome location! There was many food options right across the street. This may have been our favorite part of the hotel - we literally could walk (or bike) everywhere * Large room * Very friendly and helpful front desk. Great service. * Got a great rate on Priceline too... a great value * Free WIFI in the lobby. For WIFI in the rooms, you have to pay. I bought Economy WIFI service for 1 day (was too lazy to go to lobby) and WIFI speed was fast * Easy to print boarding passes (for free) * Great water pressure in shower * Very comfortable bed Unfortunately, unlike other 4-stars we've stayed at, this hotel didn't have a gym. One "nit" to mention: the initial room they gave us had a small queen bed (felt like what we call in the US a "full bed"); unfortunately, my wife was sick and she didn't want to give me what she had. We asked for a room with two beds, or a larger bed. Initially the person at the front desk was not able to help us. After talking to her manager, the manager was able to give us a room with two beds but it took a few minutes to go back-and-forth with her. It would have been nice if this was a little easier, but she was cool and overall it was not a big deal. In short, the staff turned what could have been a bad situation into a good one. We really appreciated it so it something I wanted to mention in the review. Based on our experience, we'd very highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just came home from Amsterdam. Spend four nights at the Jolly Carlton. This was the first trip to Amsterdam for both me and my girlfriend. The hotel got a great location, from the central station it`s approximately 7 euro with taxi. It takes about 15-20 minutes to walk to the Anne Frank house, 10 minutes walk to the red light district, and a 10 minutesâ€™ walk to the canal cruise. The hotel: As I said, this was my first trip to Holland. So I didnâ€™t know what to expect regarding hotel standard. The lobby was quite nice, and the woman we spoke to on arrival made an ok first impression. As all Dutch people they hotel staff spoke English very well. We got a room at the fifth floor. The street outside the hotel lobby is quite busy, so I was happy to see we got a room with a view the other direction. But, the street outside our window was quite noisy during the night. Not much traffic at all, but there were people going to nightclubs (and home again) all night long. If you close the window, it`s not a big problem, but then again it`s much too warm. My body temperature is quite different from my girlfriend, I thought the hotel room was a sauna, but my girlfriend found the temperature with the windows closed brilliant :) The room was quite nice, but not â€œstate of the artâ€�. The room was maybe a bit smaller then an ordinary room in Norway, but the size was no problem. The room was always very clean. I would recommend the Jolly Carlton hotel if you get a good deal. I donâ€™t know if it`s a four star hotel, because it`s hard to compare, because I have no other experience from hotels in Holland. Check out our pictures.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Jolly Carlton is a very well situated hotel as nearly everyone has mentioned. Sitting right beside the flower market its less than 10 minutes walk from both Dam Square and Leidseplein. It really couldnt be much better located and unless you're planning to spend all your time laying in the hotel then that really is the main thing. The reception staff are helpful and the lobby of the hotel is very welcoming. The room we had was clean and whilst not huge it wasnt cramped either. As with other people, the double we had ordered turned out to be two single beds with seperate sheets etc. After trying this on the first night and drifting far apart we requested a change to a double bed. Whilst not being able to accomodate us for the second night they moved us after that for the rest of the stay. Whilst the 'double' again was 2 singles at least they had joined the beds with a single sheet etc and the drifting apart was cured. The reception staff through all of this were very accomodating and moved luggage etc between rooms. I only experienced one slight problem with the water temperature when it seemed to jump up for a moment, but in 4 days of 2 people showering twice a day that was the only occasion . If you do need to take a tram then there is a stop about 50m from the front door of the hotel which is very handy for taking a tram up to Centraal Station or down to the museums area. Overall the hotel is clean, very well located and a great base for exploring Amsterdam. It really only misses out on 5 stars very narrowly and I would happily recommend it to anyone going given the very reasonable price we got (4 nights for price of 3) through lastminute[--].</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our first visit to Amsterdam for my wife's birthday, we wanted a hotel within walking distance of the major attractions and this hotel certainly delivered, being situated next to the flower market. Our room was clean,situated at the rear of the hotel and had a decent bathroom,tv,mini bar and we also found a trouser press.The room was quiet, the facilities were good and the staff were all courteous and pleasant although there was a rather unpleasant smell in the downstairs lobby area..... However...the beds were 2 singles pushed together and were hard.I think the previous owner was Fred Flintstone. My wife who suffers with her back, had to put the spare blankets on top of the mattress to soften it. We stayed for 2 nights at a cost of 307 euros room only plus the local tax. This is expensive for what is being offered in my opinion and I do not put the quality of the hotel in a 4 star catagory. A Â£19 a night Travelodge would be better. Some new and comfortable beds would help bring this hotel up to standard and a general re-fit but as Amsterdam has such a large tourist population, most Hotels can fill up and charge what they like so I think the likelyhood of any improvements being made in the near future are remote whilst the money is pouring in. I have stayed in much nicer b&b's at much cheaper rates so it was a dissapointment. On the plus side, the location is good. We were able to visit all major attractions like Anne Frank house, Dam Sq.,Red Light District, Heineken Brewery and all within a short walk. Our overall experience of Amsterdam was good. Would we return again? To Amsterdam, most certainly and we plan to return again at some point but would try to find a nicer place to stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The NH Carlton is a large, reasonable standard chain hotel that is well located for reaching all Amsterdam`s attractions, many within walking distance. Our room was fairly small but adequate, as was the bathroom which came with complimentary shampoos and shower creams. I had asked for a room with a balcony, and was pleased to get one with a good view over the locality; this turned out to be a double edged sword as it meant we got a lot of noise from the streets below. Although not in the very heart of the entertainment area, the hotel is near to Rembrandt Square which is a lively nightclub area and we stayed a week before Christmas â€“ although to be honest the main noise was sirens and car horns (not sure if rooms on the inside of the hotel suffer the same problem). Service was efficient, rooms and hotel generally spotless, and there is a pleasant seating area on the 1st floor. Buffet breakfast was very good; varied (with decent cooked option), as well as the customary European fare (croissants, cakes, cold meats, fruit etc) and there was plenty of tables in the spacious room. Slightly disappointing was, on returning, tired, on our first night, planning to have a quiet nightcap in the bar, only to find it closed â€“ it was only about 11.15pm. Decided to settle for the minibar (as advertised) only to find that it is not stocked unless you pre-order (and then you have to pay for everything regardless of what you use). Other than that, no complaints â€“ a bit pricey for an average 3-star hotel and having now seen some of the slightly cheaper independent options (our sons stayed elsewhere), would consider them next time. Overall, a safe bet - a well located average 3 star hotel offering a good breakfast.</p></li>

<li>I had asked for a room with a balcony, and was pleased to get one with a good <span style="background-color:#808080" title="p=0.999">view</span> over the locality; this turned out to be a double edged sword as it meant we got a lot of noise from the streets below.</br></br></li>
<li>Although not in the very heart of the entertainment area, the hotel is near to Rembrandt Square which is a lively nightclub area and we stayed a week before Christmas â€“ although to be honest the main <span style="background-color:#A00000" title="p=0.999">noise</span> was sirens and car horns (not sure if rooms on the inside of the hotel suffer the same problem).</br></br></li>

<li>Slightly disappointing was, on returning, tired, on our first night, planning to have a quiet nightcap in the bar, only to find it closed â€“ it was only about 11.15pm.</br></br></li>
<li>Decided to settle for the minibar (as advertised) only to find that it is not stocked unless you pre-order (and then you have to pay for everything regardless of what you use).</br></br></li>
<li>Other than that, no complaints â€“ a bit <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">pricey</span> for an average 3-star hotel and having now seen some of the slightly cheaper independent options (our sons stayed elsewhere), would consider them next time.</br></br></li>
<li>Overall, a safe <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.995">bet</span> - a well located average 3 star hotel offering a good breakfast.</li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Partner and I stayed at the Jolly Hotel Amsterdam for during the weekend 11-13 Feb 2006. Hotel was Average. Not sure if its really a 4* more of a 3*+. The staff were OK but to be honest we did not trouble them much. The room was Double. Not the biggest I have stayed in but it did the job. I was given a twin at first but had to request a change for a double, this took around 20 mins to arrange. Check in was 2pm, we got there a bit early but still had to wait for the rooms to be prepared... Not nice if you have just come in from a long flight etc... Be very careful of the showers, other reports of Hot and Cold temp are very true. Nearly burt myself as the shower temp went from nice and warm to boling hot !! .. (there are warning stickers) The hotel was clean. Room keeping did a good job. There was soom minor maintainance going on the 6th Floor ( some sort of re-wiring but not noisy at all). Did not eat or drink in the hotel. There are more then enough places to eat and drink within easy walking distance. (Studio2 opp the Flower Market do a nice Full English at half the hotel rate) and there is a McDonalds across the road for late night munchies ! The MiniBAR came with enough warnings and locks to be honest it put me right off even trying to see what was in there! The only thing that is worth writing about is the location. It very centrally located for walking. We covered most areas on foot and never felt we walked too much. We walked to Central Station too, its about 10 mins walk. Used web hotel booking service to get a discounted rate..Would stay again, if the price was better... mainly because of location. Stayed in the Marriot before which weighed slighty higher ( because of views over Leidseplien).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After spending a long time going through all the terrible reviews of hotels in Amsterdam (check they are actually hotels and not hostels as some are shared bathrooms) we chose the Carlton - on arrival the receptionist was a bit scatter brained, didnt seem to know what she was doing then told us the hotel was overbooked......but we would be upgraded to a superior suite. Which was great but it could have easily have went the other way, downgraded or moved to another hotel. Shows a lack of organisation. The rooms were spotless, very comfortable, beds were massive! The bathroom was spacious and towels cleaned whenever you needed them, great shower although we didnt have hot water at one point later on at night on one occassion. Rooms cleaned every day but were never disturbed by maids. There was hardly any street noise which was unexpected as our room looked right onto a main road. Theres trains from the airport to Dam station every few mins and you can buy your tickets at the ticket machines (which generally say no cash or coins and only accept card) or theres ticket desks - cost around 7Euro and takes around 15 mins. The hotels about a half hour walk from the station or you can get a taxi from right outside for 10-15Euro. Dam square is a 20-30 minute walk away depending how quick you walk, theres plenty of trams and taxis around aswell. We walked everywhere in the whole time we were there which was fine as theres plenty of scenery and things of interest to stop you getting bored! There's lots of small take aways close by to the hotel aswell and great restraunts, quieter than the ones nearer Dam square. Amsterdam is a great place to be, the atmosphere is buzzing everywhere you go and theres plenty to do and see - Madam Tussauds and Anne Franks house were definitely the highlights. Definitely take a boat ride along the canals - costs around 15Euro and you can buy the tickets from most little newsagents or tour shops and the boats depart from infront of central station.</p></li>
