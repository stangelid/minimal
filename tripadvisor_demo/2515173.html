Not only a short walk from the RER, 2 metros, but lots of places to eat and explore. I always feel safe in this area (Left Bank). Breakfast included in the rate was just fine.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a great hotel! The staff is helpful, the rooms are clean and the location is great. Walking distance to Notre Dame, Pantheon, Sarbonne, Latin Quarter, but still in a rather quiet area. The room was on the small side, but had a mini-fridge and was all updated. Free internet in the lobby. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. For a splurge, try the restaurant behind them (just up the hill with all the fireplaces).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Claude Bernard for 4 nights 25th - 29th October 2009. The location of this hotel is excellent - close to all the sights/underground etc. We booked a 4 night stay directly with the hotel, but were extremely dissapointed with the rooms, which were extremely small and in need of major renovation ( Rooms 41&44). We paid 450 euros per room which was obviously a budget price in order to 'fill up' the worst rooms in the hotel. Would only recommend this hotel for its location!</p></li>

However the small cute lift could take only 2 persons and a hand carry bag each time. Its a clean hotel with a helpful and pleasant staff (able to communicate in English).

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I must say I was very disappointed with the hotel after reading the many favourable reviews. The rooms were tiny, not even a bath – smaller than I have had in two star Paris hotels. The bathroom was stained and two plug sockets were hanging loose from the wall. The mini bar was empty and far from being quiet, the Hotel is on a fairly busy road although the traffic was OK at night. The location is very good but make sure you plan a visit to a good restaurant as it is surrounded by low quality tourist traps.</p></li>

Also, my husband left his satchel with everything in it (wallet, passport -- yup, everything) at the hotel when we took off to tour southern France. We called immediately (but after we had boarded the TGV) and they held it for us until our return. Also -- an amazing restaurant 2 blocks away -- Le Pre Verre.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Claude Bernard for 10 days in April 2010. Staff were very friendly and accommodating. I travelled with my husband, who is in a wheelchair and 2 kids (8yrs and 5 yrs). We had adjoining rooms and the set up was great. Lovely decor at the hotel, which is newly renovated. Any issues were sorted quickly by management in an efficient and pleasant manner. Position of hotel is fantastic and easy to walk from there to the Metro, hail a taxi, bus. I would certainly stay here on my next visit to Paris. Had a great time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Claude Bernard is in a great location. Very close to the Pantheon and Sorbonne, it also is an easy walk to Notre Dame and the Latin Quarter (a great place for cheap fun food). There is a metro station close by which also helps. The hotel itself is very spacious for a European hotel. The room "suite" we were in could easily fit 4 people, we had plenty of room for everyone to spread out (there was 3 or us in the room). There is also a room with a computer if you need internet access. I would stay there the next time I go to Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Claude Bernard Saint-Germain for 4 nights with our teenage daughters. The rooms are really nice, each one a little different. Nice size very clean very comfortable.The shower stall is a bit small but that is a minor drawback.The location of the hotel is exellent, 7 minutes walk from Notre Dam close to the Panteon, close to public transportation. The staff was very friendy and helpful. There is a tiny elevator that can carry 2 people or one person with a suitcase, but it is better by far than carrying suitcases up stairs</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary in Paris. On the recommendation of our travel agent and after reviewing reviews on this site we chose the Hotel Claude Bernard. What a wonderful stay we had. 9 nights in a quaint hotel in the center of the city within blocks of just about everything. Short walk to the Isle de City and Notre Dame. Plenty of restaurants and attractions within walking distance. Anything you would expect or need right in the neighborhood. We would highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for the quaint in the center of town.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I believe this hotel could be something special but it just needs an interior face lift. The carpets need to be replaced from the 60's. You can see that in their day they were exquisite, but 40 years later they need to be replaced. A little paint would go a long way, along with a few upgrades in beds and furniture. That being said the hotel grow on us as the trip went on. The location was great the employees were always eager to help and breakfast started the day of sightseeing perfectly. So try at your on risk it will grow on you, what can I say its Paris!</p></li>

We chose the hotel because of its great location, helpful staff and wonderful breakfast. The Hotel was updated after our last visit, making this stay even more delightful. The staff is top notch, and the concierge provided everything asked and more. You feel welcome and safe here, with a great base to explore Paris on foot, which is the best way to get a real feel for the city and all it has to offer. So much is so close, and the walk provides a great way to work off the fantastic food.</p></li>

The location is very convenient – only a short walk to the Seine and Notre Dame, and to the Metro and the RER station which has a direct connection to Gare du Nord, Charles de Gaulle, and Versailles. There are good cafes, specialist food shops, small supermarkets, and several excellent bakeries nearby. I will definitely stay there again.</p></li>

Nice clean room, very helpful staff, location walking distance to countless historic places and museums (Louvre, d'Orsay, Cluny, Notre Dame, Pantheon, Luxembourg Garden, Sorbonne, etc, etc). Easy access to Metro, RER, bus stops. This was my 6th trip to Paris, and I have to say Claude Bernard was the best place to stay. When we return, we will try to stay at this hotel again.</p></li>

The room was very clean, dry and, most importantly, it was warm.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location is excellent. Within walking distance of Notre Dame, Boulevard Saint Germain, Marais and other great places to visit. HOWEVER, the rooms are tiny (but clean) and the bathroom was the size of my shower at home. ALSO, it was VERY NOISY - our room was facing the street and no double-glazing on the windows so we could hear everything and street noises woke us up at night. For the price I would have preferred to stay at Hotel Saint Jacques next door. Much nicer! But it was a good stay. BREAKFAST is simply croissants and coffee. That's it. Nothing else. Don't expect a buffet breakfast or anything hot (other than the coffee).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a great location; easy to reach from the airport by RER and Metro and with easy access to everything in the Latin Quarter. A classic array of shops a couple of blocks away, a bakery, wine shop, cheese shop, butcher and fishmonger, oh, and brasserie on the corner. Close to the river and Notre Dame. The hotel itself is cozy (those small Paris hotel rooms), quiet, and clean, with wi-fi access and a good breakfast offering. It also has the tiniest elevator I've ever had the courage to enter. I had a great garrett room on the fifth floor with a comfortable bed and a view of the neighboring rooftops. The staff was helpful and courteous.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I loved this hotel. It's extremely clean and comfortable, in a wonderful location close to the metro. The staff were helpful and gracious and spoke fairly good English. Though not big, our room was a decent size for Paris. Everything was well maintained & worked. Lots of electrical outlets. Comfortable mattress. Quiet, no noise from street or other rooms. Good free wifi, and 2 PC's in the lobby. Breakfast was basic, but fine. Our whole stay (8 nights) was a pleasure, and for the price, this was much nicer than many other places I've stayed in Paris. To quote my boyfriend "I'd go back to that hotel 100 times again" - and we plan to!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I booked a one-night stay on-line directly with the hotel for an overnight trip from London to Paris. We chose the hotel for its location and price and it was perfect - near the intersection of three hop-on bus tour routes. We arrived early but were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a large room (for four) for the same price. The room was dated but elegant and the bathroom had a full bathtub as well as shower. The continental breakfast was adequate. We spent very little time at the hotel, but I would definitely return there for a longer trip to Paris. We did not speak French, but did not have any problem communicating with the staff.</p></li>

We had never been to Paris before, and were so glad to have chosen a hotel in this location (bordering Latin Quarter and St. Germain Du Pres). We walked everywhere, but the Metro was also super easy and extremely close to the hotel. Also TONS of great restaurants in the area (our favorite was Allard). The gentlemen who worked the front desk were alwasy very helpful with directions and reservations. The rooms are very clean (if basic) and provided us with a very pleasant stay! I woulg highly recommend this hotel for the location first and foremost, and value second.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have used the hotel Claude Bernard Saint German over the past 6 weeks to accommodate our staff whilst working on business in Paris. From our experience we have been very happy with the accommodation, i.e. clean and comfortable rooms with a friendly atmophere. The staff are extremely helpful and always go out of their way to satisfy the customer, especially Mamoun who work on reception desk who has helped me arrange all the bookings and amendments extremely quickly and efficiently without any fuss. We would not hesitate to recommend the Hotel Claude Bernard to anyone considering staying there. Thank you for a pleasant stay from all of our staff. Miss. T. Baker</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found this hotel quite by chance after our reserved hotel across the street turned out to have some problems-(elevator broken - 4th and 5th floor rooms - no offer of help...!) Thank Goodness, as we were given a very clean, pretty room with balcony, to sleep 4. We also took 3 other rooms for the rest of our family group. All had balconies and the rooms on the end were just great with balcony views up and down Rue des Ecoles and of Notre Dame. Staff was very friendly and helpful at breakfast and front desk. We were made to feel very much at home. Breakfast very good - and in a wonderful sunny room with street views. Deserves a much higher rating. We will definitely return.</p></li>

The staff were very welcoming, helpful, and nice all around. Sitting in the lobby was like sitting in a painting its very well decorated! Our room was big compared to our other classmates on the trip. The beds were very confortable and the balcony was big. The hotel is in the right location close to notre dame, the metro and even the louvre!! There is everything around from cafes to the fresh farmers market twice a week. I will always come back to this hotel!! free wifi and breakfast!! It can get noisy from the street but only at rush hour!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've just got back from my 3rd stay at the Claude Bernard - and once again had a great stay. As always the staff were warm and welcoming. There are some renovations going on. The breakfast room is now downstairs so you don't get to watch the Rue d'Ecole waking up around you while enjoying your morning cafe creme. I had a room on the sixth floor. The lift only goes to the fifth floor so if you can't do stairs - beware. The room was a nice double, overlooking the inner-courtyard, and very quiet. But, as I've said a previous post (just like everyone else who has reviewed this hotel), it's location is faultless. I'm already thinking about a trip back in the spring and will most probably be staying here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This property was situated in the Latin Quarter. Metro station was only a couple blocks away, making it convenient to access all areas of the city. It is within walking distance to the Sorbonne, Pantheon, Notre Dame, and the Place de Michel area. Lots of bars and restaurants nearby (within a few blocks). Also very near great shopping on Blvd St Germain and Blvd St Michel. We had a quad room with large windows that opened over the street. It was roomy by European standards. It was very clean with a modern bathroom. We did the breakfast package. It included pastry, cereal, coffee, and juice. Nothing fancy, but definitely cheaper than eating at a cafe. Overall, was a great stay. Great value. Would definitely stay again.</p></li>

Rooms clean and tidy, walking distance to Notre Dame, where you could find plenty of restuarants however pay a little more and eat on Rue saint Louis on the I'lle Saint Louis, set Menu option, 3 courses €29, we found the quality and price to be excellent. 2 or 3 day metro card is a great option as it gives you discount to most of the major attractions. Finally book at least 2 days in advance your shared airport shuttle, cost c €56 both ways or be adventurous and take the train from CDG a lot cheaper and quicker, the metro in Paris is quick and efficient and will stop near to your hotel if you are in the centre.</p></li>

We chose to stay here again because the hotel is reasonably priced, very clean, charming, and in a great location. The metro is a few blocks away, the Cluny, Notre Dame, and Berthillon (our fave Fench ice cream joint) are all within easy walking distance. One of our favorite features of this hotel, however, is the charming farmers market that is just a block away down the hill. There is also a wonderful boulangerie, wine store, and fromagerie a block away. We always pick up wine, cheese, charcuterie, and bread to have for snacks or dinner! As the rooms have a mini fridge it was easy to store our leftovers.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 4 nights in April 2011 and and wanted a room to sleep four (two twin beds and one double). We picked this hotel and it was very good - the location was perfect - 10 min walk to Notre Dame and across the street from the bus to the Eiffel tower and Louvre. We loved walking to the Seine (5 min walk) as well as walking through the nooks and crannies in the neighborhood. The people who worked there were nice, spoke English and tried to help us when we needed. As others have noted, the elevator is the smallest I have ever seen or could even imagine - think of a full height dumbwaiter. The sign says three people max, but I don't see how. Breakfast was included and OK - small buffet: coffee, ceral, bread, yogart) . All in all a good value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed a week at the Claude Bernard in late September. Very happy with the experience. Rooms were rather small by American standards but average for Europe. Rooms were very clean and the maid service was excellent. The front desk staff were friendly and very helpful. Computer access was available in the lobby and the decor was modern and comfortable. The continental breakfast was typical French fare, fresh croissants, bread, yogurt and more. The street was surprisingly quiet at night (except Friday, it is near the college). Many fine cafes within a short walking distance. Within walking distance of Notre Dame, the Pantheon and Luxembourg Palace to name a few. Only two blocks to the Metro and easy access to anywhere in the city. Would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a weekend in Paris with our two teenage children. We had booked a double and twin room and were given the ground floor suite (rooms 4 and 6) - very impressive, recently refurbuised to a high standard. Even though the rooms were on street level there was very little noise! The breakfast buffet was great and the staff very friendly. Front desk staff very helpful (phoned the station to make sure we could leave our luggage there). The bar was closed but there are plenty of bars and restaurants in the block. The Natural History Museum is a must, our children really enjoyed the morning there, followed by the zoo. We managed all the sights as the hotel in well situated. Wonderful city, will definately return to Hotel Claude Bernard Saint-Germain.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our second visit to the CBH - the only very minor -ve at our stay in 2009 was that the decor was a little tired but since then they have had a very nice refurb. They only -ve on this occasion (which was again is very minor) was that the people in the ajoining room snored very loudly - not the hotels fault but still a bit irritating. We would definitely be booking this hotel if we visit Paris again. I must make a separate comment about the night manager Said - he was .always very pleasent and interested in whether you were enjoying your visit. As well as beeing very knowledgeable about Paris he was up to date with current news in the UK and amazingly from our home in the North East - albiet a lot of it was about football but that didn't disappoint my husband. Thank you Said.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at Hotel Claude Bernard during a solo vacation to Paris last week. I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan on staying there again. This was my third time to Paris (it is my favorite city), but the first time I truly felt at home in a hotel and neighborhood. You are just minutes away from the metro, cafes, Notre Dame, bookstores. There are some very nice bistros right on the same street. The staff are friendly and helpful and did not make fun of my horrible French. :-) I had a single, which was perfectly fine for me and very clean, though I realize some people would have trouble with the size of the room and bathroom. I don't know how the other rooms are, but I imagine they are all fairly typical of a Paris hotel. The lift is a major plus as well. Good internet connection too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 5 nights at the Hotel Claude Bernard July 11-16. We are a family of 4....2 adults and 2 teenagers from the United States and speak very little French. The Quad room was spacious and well kept. Our room was always cleaned and prepared for the evening. We had a balcony room on the street side and enjoyed opening the windows and enjoying the sights and sounds of this wonderful district. The men who worked the front desk were very helpful and friendly....they answered all of our questions and gave very accurate directions. This hotel is in a wonderful location...easy walking to metro, Notre Dame, cafes, Luxemborg Garden, etc. Breakfast was simple and delicious! Our family loved the Hotel Claude Bernard and we will recommend to others. Wonderful stay....Wonderful Parisian Hotel!</p></li>

But I discovered it had more qualities: it's quiet, clean, staff very friendly and willing to help. Located in the Latin Quartier, very close (walking distance) to a number of great monuments and places to visit in Paris ( Sorbonne, Pantheon and Notre Dame to name the most known of them), a few meters away from metro and bus stations, very well situated if you want to discover the cultural treasures of Paris. Breakfast buffet very good, rooms confortable and clean. The small elevator gives a charm to the hotel. Staff very friendly and make you feel at home. Location in an area full with bistros and shops, so you can get all you need in the neighbourhood. I will surely choose this hotel next time in Paris and strongly recommend it to my friends.</p></li>

It's right next door to the Pantheon. Many nice little pastry shops, cafes and resturants. The staff was very friendly. They all spoke english every well and did not seem to be put off by lack of french. I do know a little, but they seemed find with helping me along. They are very knowledgeable about the area and are very happy to give directions and recommendations. I plan on going back to Paris and I will be staying there again. It is a typical small Paris hotel, so don't expect a grand suite. I only slept there so I didn't mind. I sprained my ankle while walking about and the staff was so nice to help me on the elevator, get me ice and didn't mind waiting to clean my room until I was able to hobble out.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent some days in the hotel with our two teenage children. We had reserved two two-persons rooms and at arrival we got one really very spacious room and a very small one. The hotel is very centrally located in the Quartier Latin with many nice restaurants in the neighbourhood and you can do much sightseeing there just by walking. A typical French breakfast is served with good coffee (!), while you have a view on the Parisian streetlife. There is only one very small elevator which makes it difficult to transport all your luggage upstairs. My daughter found out after arriving home that she unfortunately left her I-Pod in the hotel. After ringing to Mohammed he went out to search it (did remember our company), found it in the laundry basket and sent it home! For our next stay in Paris we would consider it visiting again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 3 days during our honeymoon in Europe. The location was great, at the heart of Latin Quarter, very near the Pantheon and 10 min from the Notre Dame (nearest metro station is Maubert Mutualite, 3min only). Their service was excellent, always helpful and pleasant. We requested for a corner room on the 5th floor. I liked the view from my room's balcony. Although the furnitures was a bit old, everything worked well for us. Their complimentary breakfast was a plus. We love the Latin Quarter neighborhood very much. It was really fun to stroll around the area on a Sunday morning. You can enjoy the best croissant at a bakery down the street. There were also many cafes for us to sit down and just people watch while we enjoy a cup of coffee. And a visit to the Pantheon was very memorable. We would love to come back!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Claude Bernard is ideally situated in the Latin Quarter just 350 yards or so from the Seine and Notre-Dame. All tourist spots are quickly and easily reached by the metro or bus. Buy yourself a 1,2 or 3 day ticket to save time and money in advance of your trip. The hotel is clean and the staff friendly and extremely helpful particularly when I was having problems accessing information on the internet the use of which is free. The breakfast which was included was simple but very welcome and the rooms (typical of older hotels in Paris) were slightly on the small side but nevertheless comfortable. The only drawback and in common with most hotels is the behaviour of fellow guests who are quite happy to let doors slam and their children misbehave. Overall though I would probably return to this hotel should I visit Paris again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have been to Paris many times and this is the 1st time we stayed in this hotel, but will definitely not be our last! The hotel location and most importantly the staff were exceptional. I was with my two adult daughters, and first of all the triple room they gave us was really small where the 3rd bed was actually like a fold up bed, but when we asked they moved us the next day to a quad room which by Parisian standards was huge. The room was well decorated, really clean and had a big bathroom with a fabulous shower. The staff could not of been more helpful at all times, and really is a home from home. Location is great you can walk just about anywhere, and did not even take us that long to walk to the Christmas market at Champs Elysees, thanks to all at Hotel Claude Bernard, we had a wonderful time and hope to see you all again soon</p></li>

However we were only allowed send our bags up in the lift and we had to walk the stairs for the 3 nights we were there. *Inside needed upgrading ( they were renovating next door and woke us up early 2 mornings). There was torn wallpaper and leak marks, a broken bathroom door with no lock. Hallway had beds, laundry and rubbish. Looks like re-furb is still very much in progress. Room was clean just physically poor condition. *Reception staff never said hello, good evening etc. until we did (poor show). Reception looks lovely. *Breakfast was decent continental style *WiFi was patchy *Location was great, same street as Sorbonne ****Go to Le Petite Perigourdine**** restaurant a couple of doors down. Better meal than any of tourist haunts closer to Quai St. Michel or Rue Severin/Huchette</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband stayed here for 4 nights in November. We lucked out with a corner room on the 4th floor that was much larger than the rooms adjacent to us. The hotel has great parisian character and the location is hard to beat. The metro station is a block away and there are tons of dining options within a 15 min walk. The Louvre is a brisk 20 min walk away. They offer complementary breakfast downstairs, but don't expect much. It includes cereal, pastries, and spreads. Taste the milk before you pour it into your coffee or cereal; it was old and sour. Wireless Internet is available in the lobby area. Our room barely picked it up. The front desk is available to answer any questions you may have about logistics or attractions. Do be advised that the elevator is tiny. You definitely dont want to be in there with a stranger. Overall this hotel is a great value for Paris- and Europe in general.</p></li>

The gentlemen who staff the front desk are there day and night to assist you with whatever you need. They very patiently explained how to use the Metro system successfully, and we were able to see so many more sights on the outskirts of Paris. Our room was on the top floor, street side, per our request. Every morning, I could look out our balcony window and see the spectacular Notre Dame, and every night I could glimpse the top of the Eiffel Tower, sparkling on the horizon. If you enjoy a reasonably priced hotel, in the heart of Paris, filled with nice, quietly friendly tourists and family groups, you would do well to try this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've just returned from a second stay at the Claude Bernard, an unpretentious but conmfortable three star hotel right in the heart of the Latin Quarter. The first time I was alone, and was given a tiny converted attic one flight above where the elevator stopped, which was fine for one and had a great bathroom. This time my husband was also along, and we were given a large and comfortable room overlooking the street on two sides, with a good bathroom for the standard of hotel. The manager, Paul, is friendly and truly helpful, there is free broadband interent in the lobby, and the breakfast includes (self-boiled) eggs and cheese, so is hearty enough for those who like something more substantial than a croissant and bread. Asd as a returning guest I was able to negotiate a complimentary breakfast for us both, which made the cost quite economical as well. I would definitely return to this hotel.</p></li>

The exterior was lovely, interior clean, breakfast very adequate, rooms normal Paris size, but I had trouble getting the triple room requested.

In addition, the hotel staff promised to confirm an airport shuttle reservation that I had previously booked. They reported that it had been done. The morning we left, two shuttles arrived from different companies. They had obviously called a second company and never cancelled the reservation I had made. Consequently, I was charged for both shuttle services. When we pulled away from the hotel in one van, the hotel manager and unhappy shuttle service employee where arguing and flailing their arms at each other. Sad ending to a nice Paris visit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very friendly and efficient servce with all reception staff. Upgraded to family room for 4 instead of 3 persons. Room was extremely clean much better than I had expected for this location and price. Just a few hundred Meters from Metro. It was a pleasent surprise to find a/c that was not limited. We last stayed in Ibis hotel near place d Italie and spent a fortune on metro travel as well as wasted time in doing so. Continental breakfast was quite adequate and the croissants were delicious - proper OJ and real good strong tasty coffee. The breakfast manager kept everthing tip top and spotless, and well deserving of the Euro tips that we and a few other people left (not all people had the decency to leave something). I wish I had asked his name but he was very pleasent. About the only -ve was that the decor in our room was a little tired but this was a very minor point. We would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a family of 7, we were able to get a triple and a quad room, both rooms located on the 5th floor. Quad room was rather large, both rooms had nice size bathrooms. Rooms have air conditioning and small balcony. The rooms were clean and the beds very comfortable. Location was close to Metro, Sorbonne University, Pantheon, Musée de Cluny, not too long of a walk to the Louvre. Front desk was friendly and accommodating. The guy in the breakfast room got annoyed with us because we wanted coffee before 8:15 a.m. (No coffee pots in rooms). Small elevator - can only hold two people at a time, you get used to it. They offer free internet on the second floor, they have 3 computers in the room. We had breakfast included in our rate, their website special. I am giving this hotel a 4 rating, not because it is exceptionally pretty, but they offer a lot of amenities included in your price. We all slept very well and had a good experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 4 days, June 16-20. We had a wonderful stay. Our room for our family of 4 was clean, good-size with air-conditioning ( did cover up street noise on Sat. night), refrigerator,and a nice bathroom. The weather was nice and we were able to pick up our Starbucks( 2 locations, 5 min. away) chai teas and sit on our balcony and enjoy. The location is perfect. A short walk to the Metro, Boul Mich', Sorbonne, Pantheon, Seine, Notre Dame...Eric Kaiser bakery and lots more. The Coupe-Chou Restaurant (fantastique for couples, we left the kids in the room) was just behind the hotel. The staff was extremely helpful. Laundromat was 1 min. away, very handy. Breakfast was plentiful and enjoyable in the breakfast room. They also had free internet in the lobby which was a treat that we did not have anywhere else in France. My 16 yr. old son was ecstatic to check his Fanstasy baseball. We would definitely go back and my family is picky.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My 3 children and I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in their family room (Aug 19 - 24). The room was not massive, but not crammed either. It had 1 double bed, 2 single beds and 1 sofa bed. The bathroom was clean and all white marble, so you could easily spot dirt. The room was cleaned daily too The hotel is just basic, but functional, so if you're looking for luxury you need to look elsewhere. No ironing board or iron in the room, so had to go downstairs to iron yourself. The TV was quite old and limited English stations. However, the hotel staff was quite friendly and the free WiFi was very good. The free breakfast was okay (fresh croissants, OJ) just continental, but adequate to get you started for the day. The Air Conditioners functioned well. Good location and easy access to lots of places and there were lots of restaurants to choose from in the neighbourhood. It's okay if you're on a strict budget and not looking for any form of luxury.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent 4 nights in the Claude Bernard Hotel in July. Being that it was our first time in Paris I was worried where I would be staying. Well it turned out the the Claude Bernard is a great 3-star hotel. Although its not fancy or the rooms might not be that big it makes up for it in other ways. The hotel was clean, the air-conditioner worked well in my room, and every morning they gave a great breakfast. The location is great, in which the bus stop is directly across the street and the Metro is 1 block down. It is also walking distance to plenty of great restaurants and shopping. Notre Dame and the Seine is within a few blocks. Also Mohammed at the front desk was extremely nice and helpful everyday. We would tell him what we would like to see and he would tell us exactly which bus or train to take and in the evening suggest a nice restaurant to eat at. So if in Paris and just looking for a reasonably priced & clean hotel I would recommend the Claude Bernard.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is one of the best situated in Paris. The area is ideal, quiet, but close to all major sights and some of the cheapest restaurants in city center. There are some nice bars in proximity too. Hotel staff were welcoming, polite and helpful. But there were also some drawbacks: First, the tiny room with the typical moldy smell of Paris hotel rooms. Worst thing was the smell of towels - it was like they were keeping them in a wet cellar for ages. The housekeeping wasn't so good either. I mean, they were cleaning the room every day, but their work wasn't so proficient. The space under the small desk remained uncleaned for the 5 days we were there. I think we paid a lot of money for a room like this. I suppose there are some better rooms in this hotel - but the one we stayed, had nothing to do with those presented on the website's photos. If you want to stay there, ask for a big room. If they don't have, then head to another hotel; there are plenty in this area.</p></li>

I know getting large rooms to accommodate more than 2 people is rare in Europe but after researching I found The Hotel Claude Bernard offered both triples and quad occupancy rooms. I checked on Trip Advisor and got very favorable comments so we booked the rooms. I reserved 2 twins, 2 triples and 2 quads for the 18 people...very reasonable rates with breakfast included daily. The location is 500 meters from Notre Dame in St Germain. My main contact was Mamoun who was wonderful to deal with. They arranged roundtrip airport transfers with a local company and all questions and requests were answered promptly and completely. I have been a travel agent for over 35 years and dealing with the Hotel Claude Bernard was an outstanding experience and highly recommend them as my go to hotel in Paris. Most importantly, I received nothing but rave reviews from my clients for the recommendation.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have just returned from a great stay at the Hotel Claude Bernard with eight friends. The location of this hotel was fantastic, right in the heart of the Latin Quarter. You could walk to Notre Dame in 10 minutes, the Lourve and the Musee D'Orsay in 20 minutes. This hotel was very central and close to a major Metro and RER line. You could be anywhere in Paris in no time at all. The room we had was a corner room, Number 56. I highly recommend you request a corner room. It was small but you are not spending anytime in your room. It had twin beds which were very comfortable. The bathroom was a nice size with a tub and hand held shower. The water pressure was great. The room was exceptionally clean. The breakfast was great every morning. Fresh croissants, baguettes, cereal, cheese, yogurt, tea, coffee, and juice. I also want to say that the staff were very friendly and went out of their way to accomodate your every request. Thank you Mamoun, Mohammed, and Pierre. I will definately be back.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was there on July 6th like always when arriving rooms are never ready. Went out to get a bite to eat in the meantime. At the front desk worked only two men morning and night shift. During the day we requested to do a private excursion and was over charged and lied to the whole time. Late at night at the front desk you have the front desk man sleeping in the lobby in a cotton bifold bed and he greets you with his sleeping slippers. Nice.... I also had to get a taxi early morning and we were six, suggested we reserve a van but it would be $50euros to take us to the Gylon Train Station 5minutes away. I called on my own and they told me $30euros. The whole time while being there I felt like it was always about making a buck from the tourist. It was an awful experience and DONT plan on ever going back. Best of luck for those that decide to stay there, although I don't recommend it. Oh. we had requested connecting rooms and of course did not happen. We were scattered the whole time in different floors.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked our stay through a travel agent as part of a 3 city Europe trip. Our visit was in March 2007. Even though we don't know exactly how much the stay cost us we were very pleased. We spent three nights at Claude Bernard. The location is superb for dining and touring. It is a few blocks from the underground but within walking distance of many sites. The area was very safe at night and even though directly on a street quiet for sleeping. One complaint was the walls are paper thin and we heard everything the people in the next room was saying. Needless to say we stayed quiet in our room so they didn't have any stories to tell on us. The rooms are small but very clean. The marble bathroom was roomy and very adequate. The breakfast was sufficient to get you through to the afternoon. The free internet is a plus in the lobby to stay in touch via email. Be prepared to walk the steps to your room unless you don't mind the elevator which only fits one person comfortably. We would definitely recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Claude Bernard Hotel the first week of August. This was our third trip to Paris and the second stay at this hotel. I must admit, when I saw postings saying the AC was out, I was a bit worried; so much so that I called the hotel directly and was assured the air conditioning was fine. In fact, it was better than fine; we slept in cool comfort every night. The rooms are a bit small, but very clean and well maintained. The elevator is very small; it supposedly holds 2 people, but we never felt comfotable enough to test it. The staff is absolutely the best; when we made a mistake in our reservations ( didn't show up the first night we had booked), instead of telling us that our reservation was gone, Mohammed at the front desk quickly found us a room and then moved us to better quarters the second night. Everyone was incredibly helpful with Metro and bus directions, restaurant reservations and general Parisian information. We told them to be ready for us in 23 months, for we will definitely be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We checked into the Claude Bernard in the morning, after 3 days at another hotel, the staff was very nice and stored our luggage for us till our room was ready. This allowed us to spend our day at the Louvre and come back and check in. We were pleasantly surprised by the spacious room on the third floor with TWO balconies and a gorgeous view of the rooftops and the City. The decor in the rooms was bright and very pretty, comfortable beds, the room had two full size beds and a twin, the bathroom was very large too, quite a treat for us after being crammed into a typical small Paris room for 3 days prior. There is a small lift to get your baggage upstairs, they serve continental breakfast in the morning. We loved the location, the next morning they set up a fantastic Farmer's market a couple of blocks away near the Metro entrance, with everything you could think of available fresh! The Sorbonne is only a couple of blocks away and everything is very convenient. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone, especially families.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of four stayed at the Claude Bernard for one night in June 2006. The location was great, right near the Metro, within easy walking distance of Notre Dame and the Louvre. Our only problem was that the portable air conditioning unit for our room had a water hose that had to go out through the door to the balcony, so if you wanted the air conditioning on (and we were on the 5th floor so it was hot) you couldn't close the doors all the way. We happened to be there on June 21, when there is a city-wide music festival that goes until 1 am. We had been up since 5 that morning flying in from Sweden, so we were exhausted, and with the doors open the room was too noisy to sleep. Even with the air conditioning shut off and the doors closed it was difficult to sleep. I would not recommend staying near the Sorbonne on June 21, unless you stay up late and like very loud music. They also charged us more for the breakfast than they initially stated, and would not adjust the rate upon checkout. I emailed them later, but never got a reply.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There were good things and bad things about this hotel. The bad: the first room we were given was about the size of a walk-in closed--seriously. There was a double bed pushed up against the wall on two sides and about two feet of space on the other two sides. A bathroom you could put in your eye! No place to put luggage. Way too small for two people. And the view--our room looked out over...a wall about 6 feet away. After discussion with the front desk, we were given a larger room (for three) which was quite large enough and had a modern bathroom--at the most inadequate wiring I've ever seen for folks who use cell phones and tablet PC's. Not worth the $500+ charge per night. If breakfast was included it was a deep-dark secret as we never saw any kind of clue as to where or when it might have been. The good: the staff was wonderful. Very cooperative and helpful. It was located in a great neighborhood. We could walk to Notre Dame, the Sorbonne, and about three dozen restaurants. Best of all--no six-legged vermin! The room was very clean although badly in need of renovation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My extended, 9 night, stay at the Hotel Claude Bernard was fantastic and a total joy. The beautifully decorated lobby is both impressive and inviting. The Manager (& part owner) Paul is there daily and has hired the friendliest staff I have experienced. Whether it's the front desk staff, the breakfast room folks, or the house-keeping crew, all were just great & made you feel welcome. They were really terrific. Rooms were nicely decorated and extremely clean and comfortable. My room was small, as I was on a solo trip, but after staying for so many days, I was able to see many of the different room types. They were all very nice: flat screen TVs, balconies, and very well decorated. Even my single room had a "larger than single" bed. The hotel is just one block from the popular Blvd. St. Germain and it's within walking distance to almost anywhere!! I have stayed at other hotels on rue des Ecoles and will never stay anywhere else now!!! --I do not work for the hotel or have affiliation with them. I did just what you are doing; .....read the reviews and I chose the Claude Bernard.....I am very glad I did!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We'd never been to Paris so we stopped by for a couple of days on the way to London -- easily done now that the Eurostar whisks you right through the Chunnel. We wanted functional and adequate lodging for this short stay at a short price, and we got it. The hotel is not fancy, but it was clean and roomy and attractive in a wood shop sort of way. They had no booking for their largest room, so they gave it to us without charging more. Within and without the hotel, the Parisians were lovely, encouraging my efforts to speak French, cheering success, switching to English easily when I ran out of words. Do book the breakfast option here! Unlike much of the Latin Quarter, restaurants for breakfast were not plentiful on this block It was nice to just go downstairs and have at the good croissants, brioches, butter and a little cheese. And as proof there is a God and she lives en France, the yogurt was plain, unsugared -- in other words -- food! Location? Formidable! Four blocks uphill: the Paris Pantheon. Four blocks downhill -- Ile de la Cite and Notre Dame! Next door? The Sorbonne! The neighborhood felt like Berkeley! One block east on the corner is a first rate Italian Trattoria, la Pestacore! Bon appetit! Bon soir! Bon nuit!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very pleasant experience at HCB. Stayed over the 1st May bank holiday weekend and was really pleased with the hotel's offering. The hotel is perfectly located in the Latin Quarter which appeals to more diverse, pretty trendy, less mainstream tourists. On a star to star basis, Paris hotel prices are typically higher than average compared to other western european cities and this no different with HCB. Service at the hotel was amazing. The trip over to Paris was a surprise for my partner and I requested a few additions on my booking sheet and the staff at the hotel was more than responsive and ensured that my requests were met. The daytime front desk man was a real pleasure to deal with as he was very courteous, helpful and kind. My only criticism was that the wall between my room and the neighbour was pretty thin, which meant that I was party to their discussion on the evolution of mankind until about 2am. However even that would not keep me from returning to Paris and staying again at Hotel Claude Bernard St Germain. Call it cliche but I proposed to her over that weekend and the experience was even better thanks to the very kind and polite front desk man. I will certainly recommend RCB to my friends and family. Thank you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There were some excellent and some awful reviews on this hotel but to be fair our stay there was pretty good but not perfect. The location is excellent, The room we were in was clean and serviced fine. The air con unit was a bit dodgy but since it was Feb and it was -6 deg this was not a problem but it would be an issue in the summer. The room size was quite spacious although we had booked a family room ...room 32., and had a double and 2 singles with a largish bathroom with a bath/shower. The fridge was antiquated and didnt work very well but was adequate. Breakfast was good and plentiful although no fresh meats/cheese but we all ejoyed it.Breakfast staff were friendly and helpful. The porter who was on reception when we arrived at approx 22.30 did not really speak any English and didnt even say hello or welcome to us to the hotel even in French ...we gave him our name and details and he just handed over a key card . We spoke to him in our best French and just about prised the time of breakfast out of him but he didnt actually offer any info himself , quite different from mostly all other hotels we've stayed in . Another porter though who was working during the day was quite helpful when asked for info and spoke pretty good English /and French(!).</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed at the CBH after much online research and were so glad we did! We wanted a moderately priced 3 star hotel with a balcony, free wi-fi and breakfast in the Latin Quarter, and this was exactly what we got!! I was in touch with Paul via email a couple of times to remind him how important a balcony was to me, and although he wouldn't guarantee it 100%, he certainly delivered. My husband and I stayed in room 26 and our sons stayed in room 62 or 63. They had a small balcony and we had a wrap around balcony!! We each had a small frig which was very handy. Our wi-fi was a bit spotty, but the boy's wi-fi worked perfectly. Very common in old buildings! The breakfast room was immaculate with hard working kitchen employees efficiently filling baskets and pitchers of wonderful croissants, fresh breads, yogurt, cereal, oj, tea and coffee! The TVs were tiny, and only offered CNN in English, but hey, who's in Paris to watch TV anyway?? There was a new flat screen TV in both the breakfast room and lobby. Unfortunately , I can't remember the name of the other gentleman behind the front desk, but he was so helpful and spoke perfect English! Hopefully we will be able to return to the CBH, but for now, we're content to dream about being out on that wonderful balcony.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We are a family of 5, so it is a challenge to find an afordable hotel in Paris that will fit us. I traveled with my wife and 3 kids (6, 5, and 3). We received a great rate on the hotel booking directly through their site. Later I was notified that we would be charged an additional 45 euros per night for the 5th guest even though they were a small child. Even with the extra charge, it was still much less than most hotels for our party size. We arrived early in the day (before 9am) because we had an early overnight flight from NY. We had small hoped to get into the room right away but weren't dissapointed when we couldn't due to the fact that they needed to prepare the room. They did expediate the turnover and we were able to get in by 11am or so. The staff on the first day and throughout the stay were pleasant and very helpful. Also, the room was large (for a hotel in Paris at a reasonable cost) and easliy fit all of us comfortably enough without having to crawl on top of each other. The location was also great. It was in easy walking distance to may restaurants, within 10 miutes (with kids) to Notre Dame and about 10 minutes or less to the nearest RER or Metro station depending on which method of rail you wanted to use (stations were Cluny - La Sorbonne and St.-Michel-Notre Dame). I deffinitely would stay here again if I go back to Paris.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For the money, you get a clean bed, small bathroom with updated fixtures and an undersized shower with curtain (turn around and you will fall out of shower), and view of back alley way or wall if you want quiet. The same price gives you a view of the street. However, one noisy motorcycle or siren will wake you so is the view worth it? Anyway, for the Left Bank, it is up the hill from Maubert-Mutualite metro stop. I toured the city using Metro. Had about 6 stations on TV. The clean up room fine. Elevator tiny. Stairs otherwise a climb. About 5 stories total. If you search harder, you might find something better for the money. One internet working in lobby. Night staff vary. They shut down around 2 am. Breakfast same thing daily so get it as a part of deal, do not pay extra. Go hear only if you can get the $99 a night for 3 night deal. You could probably find another Left Bank hotel a bit better if you have time. Very close to Parthanon and Sorbonne. About 10 min from Notre Dame. Some side streets filled with Eurotrash drinking til 3 am by Notre Dame. This neighborhood is generally quiet. Nice restaurant on corner that makes an effort locally. Another Italian place right down street with neon signage that is reasonable priced. For $50 you get a hostel with shared shower. In Paris, $100 gets you this which was acceptable but overpriced since you are tucked away a bit.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There is a great deal that is good about this hotel: • Terrific location • Very clean property, room, bedding, etc. • Very, very helpful staff at the front desk – nice, kind, friendly, and informative However, you need to be familiar with what you can expect at a 3-star hotel – which I think this hotel is very honest about. The rooms are very small – although updated, they are pretty old. The finishes (flooring, tile, etc.) are not luxury – and would be know in the US as “builder’s grade”. There was a group of students on a tour who occupied most of the rest of the hotel – they were very respectful and did not make much noise – however the fact that they ALL returned to the hotel at the same moment each day – and left in the morning at the same moment each day – depleted the property of hot water at the same moment each day. I love the location – with the farmers market, the Metro stops, the vicinity to Notre Dame and everywhere else – make the location the best asset of the property. The staff are also very professional and an asset to the property. I’m used to a bit more in creature comforts and should have probably been willing to pay more to get more. I can recommend this property to travelers who are very budget conscious – especially those in their 20’s and 30’s who will really like the left bank character of the neighborhood. You will feel safe and be very satisfied with this property.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were three generations - two grandparents, two parents, and one 1-year-old coming from the United States. The hotel was very accommodating to our needs, provided a crib at no extra expense, gave us a quart of milk one day when we needed it, arranged pick-up and transfer to the airport, immediately fixed a minor problem with the shower in one of our rooms, gave us two rooms next to each other as we had requested........all of the employees were friendly and helpful, in every way, smiling, even telling the rain to stop after the second day (and it stopped!). The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and comfortable, not super luxury, but completely fine for our needs. Wireless internet worked perfectly. Breakfast is included at no extra charge, consisting of coffee and tea, juice, milk, croissants, breads, cereals, yogurts, jam, butter, nutella, etc - more than enough selection, and very convenient instead of having to head out to find a place to eat each morning. The location is superb. The street is quiet overnight, but there are restaurants right there for you, the Latin Quarter and all its activiites are within two blocks, shopping, restaurants, Notre Dame, the Pantheon. We walked right out our door and were in the heart of Paris. In two minutes on foot you are in the Luxembourg Gardens - who could ask for anything nicer? And the price was very reasonable! We would go back in a heartbeat to Claude Bernard !</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from 4 nights in Paris at this hotel. It is a quaint hotel in a great location. We requested a room with a balcony and did receive one. The room was very small (I know that's usual in Europe). However, there could have been more than just a few plastic cups in the room. I think a few extras in the room would make all the difference. We had to ask for an extra chair and wine glasses (which they didn't have). The staff was nice but did not go out of their way to help. If they were not sure of a place we asked about, they would just say they did not know. The morning we were leaving, our luggage was stuck in the elevator. We had to send the luggage up and down by itself. The taxi was waiting for us, and the gentleman at the front desk did not even get up to come to the elevator and help us. My husband had to run up and down 2 flights of stairs to get the elevator to move. Needless to say, we kept the taxi waiting while this was going on. Continential breakfast was fine -- coffee was a disappointment. What happened to that wonderful FRENCH coffee???? I had to go across the street to the bakery to get a real cup café et lait. The lobby is cozy and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was adequate. The size was expected -- it was the lack of little extras that made for a less than great stay. Overall, a few extra touches (especially friendly service) would make this a great stay instead of an okay stay. Paris was wonderful, though!!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Fantastic stay with girlfriends.....”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had a wonderful stay at Claude Bernard for two nights (this November). We chose the hotel based upon Tripadvisor reviews, the location of the hotel and the fact that they could provide us with a triple room. Upon our arrival, we were met by a very friendly (and unbeknownst to us, comedic) gentleman at the front desk. We confirmed that we had a triple room and he said "yes". My girlfriend proceeded to ask him if we had a balcony and he replied in his lovely French accent that we didn't and that we had a very small window. The naive crew that we were, shrugged our shoulders, said "oh well" and felt just thankful we each had our own bed. Due to the fact that the elevator is the size of a tiny closet, we each had to go up by ourselves with our suitcase. And when I say small, I mean small. Like nothing you've ever seen before. But it added to the charm of the hotel and what did we care, we were without our children!! As we entered the room, not only were we met with a beautiful QUADRUPLE room we had them most fabulous balcony on the top floor of the hotel. There were no words. We just laughed and jumped up and down like a bunch of 12 year olds. Enough of that, the remainder of the review is as follows. It is not a Hyatt. It is a French boutique hotel. If you can wrap your brain around this, you will thoroughly love it. You truly feel like you're in Paris. The breakfast is perfect. Nothing hot but beautiful croissants and baguettes. It was exactly what we needed. Would highly reccommend it to anyone staying in the Latin Quarter. Enjoy!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a very good and safe area in the Latin Quarter. Easy walking distance to both metro and RER, Notre Dame and Pantheon. We emailed them ahead of our trip requesting a higher floor with balcony and good view. Check in was easy and Mamoun (front desk man) was very helpful and spoke fluent english and french. He acknowledged receiving our email and gave us keys to a 4th floor corner room with great views of the Latin Quarter (Rue des Ecoles sides). Elevator can only fit one person and 1 carry on luggage but this feature, I think, adds novelty to this quaint parisian hotel. Breakfast has nothing cooked - only croissants, baguettes, cereals and juices, tea and coffee. Wi-fi is fast in the lobby and bfast area, but very very weak in our 4th floor bedroom. Since our room is on the street side, noise can be a problem at night, thank Goodness Air France gave us earplugs. Bathroom size-ok, shower pressure-fantastic. Bed was firm and comfy. TV has only 5 channels - only in French (but who cares I didn't fly to Paris to watch TV) I would give this 3-star hotel 5 stars except that the evening shift front office men (1 Asian male, 1 African male) were disappointing. They hardly speak english so it was very hard to even start a dialogue. We needed to ask directions on 2 separate nights and they were just useless. We asked strangers on the street instead. If your business deals with international guests day in and day out, wouldn't it be great if your front office people at least tried to learn a 2nd language, english in particular?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First, I have to say that it is important to know thyself when traveling. We prefer small personal, & charming to mass produced, high lux or overly touristed. So be sure to know what you are looking for. We went for Christmas in 2011. 6 nights. This was our first trip to Paris, and it was fantastic!! The man who works during the day was extremely helpful! So much so that we bought him a thank you gift. But come to think of it I should have bought some more, because the breakfast staff was very nice (we have been on a perfect croissant search ever since) and the evening shift front desk young man was very sweet and helped me practice my french. (Merci!) I loved the feeling as soon as we walked in the door!! I loved the jazz music playing in the lobby and the Christmas tree. I loved the tiny elevator and the curving stairs. Room 26 has an amazing view of Notre Dame's towers. The room is small compaired to American rooms, but we were informed and expected that. They were certainly suitable. We had preordered tickets and sent them to the hotel and they handled that smoothly. The hotel was clean, location convienient, the computer in the lobby was helpful, surprisingly quiet, but mostly I loved the people. EXTREMELY NICE!! I had wanted to manage in french but I am so grateful that he spoke English. I would have been lost without him. If I go to Paris a 100 times, I'll stay here. In closing, to my countrymen, I'd like to request, please attempt to learn some French language and customs. It's not only helpful- it's polite. Merci Paris! J't'aime!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is located within 5 - 10 minutes from all the action in the Latin Quarter and it's only 5 minutes to the closest Metro station. It's about a 10 minute walk to Notre Dame and to the Pantheon and Jardin du Luxembourg, the most popular park in Paris. As Le Sorbonne (the University of Paris) is close eating is inexpensive and there are a ton of places to eat really well, very reasonably. The staff are quite friendly and speak English. Our room was not large, but was perfect for two people and with the new windows and doors to our balcony, quite soundproof, although you can hear the street enough to know you're in the greatest city in the world. The rooms have been renovated with new flooring and the beds were comfortable, to me at least. We also had a mini fridge and a small tv. The washroom was okay, but not exciting.

The elevator is typical in Paris in that it's tiny and basically there's room for one person with one bag. Two people dance cheek to cheek without bags. My only complaint - and this wasn't a huge deal, would be their Internet was hopeless. We couldn't get connected wirelessly in our room and it was spotty in the lobby as they were having problems with their setup. This may be worked out now as they were quite concerned about it working properly. There's free Internet down the street at McDonald's anyway. All in all it's a great place to stay. It seemed very safe and I have no problem recommending it to friends.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I lived and studied in Paris years ago, so a base in the Quartier Latin was a must. As a teacher on summer vacation (a French teacher!), value was also a big factor in my choice for a hotel for me and my sister, who would be visiting Paris for the first time. A balance of value and convenience for me and comfort for my sister was what was needed, and the Hotel Claude Bernard was perfect, in fact it turned out to be one of the best parts of the trip. No, it isn't at the foot of a major metro station, but neither is it in a noisy or bustling neighborhood. A few steps off the beaten track (and I do mean a few) was perfect. The staff couldn't have been more accommodating. I spent time in the pleasant lobby area with friends who had been made to feel comfortable awaiting me there. They honored the requests I had made by email to match us with a wonderful room with a view of Paris garrets and streets and a peek of the Notre Dame towers. The bed was good and the room serviceable if not luxurious; no shocks for my untraveled sister. Breakfast was typical and good, nothing special but nothing less than what one would expect in Paris, in the way of croissants and coffee... but the service was what stands out: very friendly and attentive. They even went out of their way to help when I needed to stay an extra, non-reserved day in the peak season. My one small complaint would be about the wireless service, which on the uppermost floors was insufficient. The computers in the lobby were slow as well. Since my trip was six months ago, I hope that upgrades have been since made as I did mention this detractor to the staff. Overall, I loved the Hotel Claude Bernard and will return there in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had previously enjoyed a pleasant stay at this hotel the previous year and so decided to book our Easter 4 night break well in advance. Our Eurostar train was seriously delayed but we phoned ahead to confirm our late arrival. We eventually arrived after 1.30am to be told 'due to a problem with hot water' our room was unavailable and we were to take our luggage across the road to the Hotel California where we would have to stay the night. No assistance was offered or indeed any further explanation. After struggling with our bags we managed to make it up to a room I can only describe as sub-standard. At this point we were so exhausted we felt there was little point in unpacking so we collapsed in to bed to try and catch up on some sleep. At 9am the following morning, the receptionist told us to return to The Claude Bernard to have breakfast. After carting our bags back to the Hotel, we were then told that our room would not be available till noon as the occupants had not yet checked out. It transpires the story of the 'hot water' was just that, a story and the reason we were 'unceremoniously' dumped across the road was due to one of their 'frequent' over-booking policies. The surly man on reception was downright rude and said if we didn't like it we could go and find somewhere else to stay! If this is the hotels policy then I don't see how anyone can risk booking in advance to then be given sub-standard accommodation at the same price and no apology! On such a short break we wasted our precious time hanging around waiting for a room. We were given a smaller twin room than our previous visit and also charged the full rate, not the discount rate we were told at the time of booking. Our 2nd but definitely our last visit!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Claude Bernard Hotel November 17, 2007 My wife and I visited Paris for 5 days in November. We booked a room at the Claude Bernard Hotel after it was recommended to us by my brother who happened to stay at the hotel after browsing in the internet and finding that the Claude Bernard Hotel fell within his price means and was located in the area he was looking for – the Latin Quarter. We arrived from London at 12:30 noon expecting that our room would be ready at 2:00 (14:00). We intended to leave our luggage there and go for a walk until the room was prepared. The attendant at the counter informed us that the room was ready to be occupied and that we could enter immediately. This was a pleasant surprise as we were in need of a rest. The moment we walked into our double room we fell in love with the place. It was one of the most spacious suites we had ever seen, with a double bed in the middle, a single bed on the side, a couch, a small round coffee table with two chairs, a desk, a small fridge, a large cupboard, a huge washroom with a bath - this was much more than we had expected: A luxurious room that literally took our breath away. The staff was amazingly helpful and gave us a feeling of warmth that made it a pleasure to return every day. The location of the hotel is another one of this hotels great advantages: in the heart of the Latin Quarter, a stones throw from the Sorbonne, a ten minute walk from Notre dam and the Louvre. In fact we found that almost everything we wanted to see was within walking distance, including some fantastic restaurants and a great Jazz club. We will definitely return to the Claude Bernard Hotel. I recommend it to any visitor who appreciates professional competence along with personal warmth that gives the feeling of a home away from home.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The positives. We arrived via Gare du Nord and the nearest metro station was just 2 stops [St Michel] away. The hotel was easy to locate and was very conveniently situated in a nice area near close to Notre Dame. The main open top bus tour stop was nearby and metro/boat trips were easily accessible. There were plenty of shops and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. Check in was quick. All staff were friendly that we encountered. Our room and bathroom were very clean. The room rate was reasonable and we booked this on the basis of the inclusive breakfast to help manage our costs. The negatives. Our room was very small. There was not much space to store our belongings. Yes, it's Europe, yes we expected the room to be small but we have stayed in many rooms and this was one of the smallest we have ever stayed in. It was literally a bed against the wall with a gap on one side to get in and out. It was a bit difficult to get ready to go out together due to the limited area to change. We did get the balcony we had requested which was nice but not particualrly functional with just one chair and no real space to move. Maybe we should have asked for a larger room but we were tired on arrival and didn't plan to spend too much time in there, so it didn't really bother us to make a fuss but it might bother some. We did glance at the room next door and it was a good 50% bigger. It was Room 55. Breakfast choice was limited. What was on offer was good, especially the bread, proper butter and cheese. It was sufficient but there was no fresh produce and we would have liked to see fruit and meats available. If we had paid 9.80 Euro each we would have been hugely disappointed with what was on offer. We enjoyed our stay overall. Would we stay here again? Definitely for the location and for the price. Would we ask for a bigger room at booking, absolutely!!</p></li>
