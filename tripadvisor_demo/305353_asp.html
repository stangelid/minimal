<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I always book this hotel or the Shamrock hotel. It is clean and a good location. 5min walk to Jordan subway station and 1 minute from kowloon park. Sometimes you can hear plumbing, ie people taking a shower in other rooms but not too noisy. Highly recommended.</p></li>

We had a room facing the HK Harbor, so we had excellent views as well!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is near two metro stations which make it very easy to travel around the city. There are many shopping areas nearby. There is 7 eleven across the street and a mcDonalds behind the hotel. I recommend cafe de coral for breakfast which is located right across the street. The bell service is very good but they make you pay a tip and you can't use the luggage cart yourself.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good location, about 20min walk from Avenue of the Stars and Star Ferry. Staff were efficient but not too friendly. Rooms and hotel in general were what you would expect from a 3 star hotel. Bed was quite hard with the pillows being a total contrast. It was like they were blown up with air. This didn't cause me a problem but for those who are a bit more 'picky' over there bed it might.</p></li>

The rooms are big and very comfortable. And the price paid was cheap considering hong kong rates. The downsides of this hotel is the reception staff which is unpleasant and the fact that is a big hotel with no character or soul at all. But if you are looking for a nice room for a good price in hong kong it is defintely a place to consider.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the quad sharing room in BP international, but the tricky part is, the quad sharing room isn't available in any website, so we got a local friend to book the hotel room for us, because it's so worth paying for it. don't expect a 5 star treatment, it's just a clean and equip room with 2 double decker beds. the location is great, just 5 mins walk to the jordan mrt station. you could also talk a walk towards the temple street, as well as the tsim tsa tsui area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had a hard time finding a reasonably priced hotel in Hong Kong, but this was definately a great option on a central location! We payed a little more for a room with a view and weren't disappointed; could see a big part of the HK Island skyline! Room is small but not cramped and very clean, with a minibar, television and a nice bathroom. No breakfast is included. On the day we left, we could leave our luggage in the lobby all day free of charge, next to the big portrait of sir Baden Powell.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As my first choice in H.K. was unavailable, I ended up at BP International hotel. I was pleasantly surprised; it was a pretty nice hotel, located close to both Jordan and Austin MTR stations. It's a short walk to bustling Nathan Road. Free bus to and from the Airport Express' Kowloon station stops next door, which is convenient. Rooms are well-equipped, though the wi-fi is a bit overpriced in my opinion. Service was friendly and efficient, so I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again in the future.</p></li>

Standard service you would find in hotel chains, quite friendly and helpful staff but no porter to bring your luggage to the room. abt 7 mins walk to train station and possible to walk to popular shopping places like tsimsashui, mongkok. Near to plenty of tea houses, cafes and local shop houses. Nothing to shout about but a pretty decent and convenient place to stay in a so congested city.</p></li>

The room is very clean, the beds are so comfortable to sleep with and the bathroom is so clean you can sleep on it. The elevator is very reliable. However, we have an irritant feeling of being unwelcome when we checked in at past midnight on May 25. The lady at the front desk seemed uncomfortable when being asked. However, this will not deter us from checking in at BP the next time we will visit Hongkong.</p></li>

It is about ten minutes to walk to the harbour and make sure you do it throug the Kowloon Park with beautiful birds and flowers. Nathan street is close and so is Shanghai street with the nightmarked.</p></li>

My husband has a lot of family in Hong Kong, so we stayed at a locals rate (still $200ish a night). The rooms had two twin beds divided by a dresser and there was a desk/area to tuck your luggage stuff towards the window. It has A/C, internet (only 1 user at a time if you sign up), and a cool view of the busy city. We barely spent any time in the rooms because we were out and about, doing what you do in HK...eat and shop!</p></li>

As for Hong Kong itself, we stayed for 4 nights and this was abit too long and we were ready for our onward journey after the 3rd day. A visit to Kowloon Park behind the hotel is very nice with lots of stuff to look at.</p></li>

To my taste, the bathroom (no bath, just a shower) is too tiny even for 1 person. Be aware: Even if you use your phonecard for outgoing calls from your room, they"ll charge you 30 HKG $ for each call. ( Local call: 4 HKG $ ).

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 2 nights to break up our journey to Melbourne. Hotel is conveniently located at the top of Kowloon Park - which is a pleasant, if fairly steep route, to the hotel. The rooms are 'boxy' but clean and adequate - we had a city view which was fine. We found the staff to be pleasant and helpful. Our deal, which was excellent at around £53 per night for the room, did not include breakfast. However, we did take breakfast here on one morning. It wasn't anything special but adequate at £6 per person. If we were in Hong Kong again, we would happily stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Whether lady luck was smiling on us, I don't know, but after my husband chatted to the staff, they gave us a bigger room, which changed the experience considerably. Travelling with a toddler, space and a bath tub are a god send. The junior suite they gave us was super, as the original room was just OK, but tired. The bathroom had been upgraded but over all small. The world and his wife stay at this hotel so the battle for the lifts can get ugly but you have got everything downstairs. Need clothes alterations / food / massage / park and swimming? MTR? Everything anyone could want it within seconds away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 4 nights in BP International during our last trip to HK. I like the location - it's situated centrally in Tsim Sha Tsui area and Jordan MTR station is a few mins walk away. We walked to Yau Ma Tei and Mongkok from the hotel, about 25 mins away on foot. There are many tourist attractions and shopping areas around the hotel. The hotel lobby was impressive for a 3 star hotel - but our room was quite small. However, it was clean and the furnitures looked new. I think the hotel was renovated recently. Wasn't very impressed with the front desk staff though - they weren't very curteous and helpful when I needed help.</p></li>

BP has been a positive confirmation of other reviews I read in this site. BP double room has a decent room for moving and placing even a big suitcase, no extra space but all we needed and confortable beds. toilet is surely small but shower provides a good size. only a few clothes can be hanged or stored in the two drawers, but Hong Kong is not north pole thus you don't need so many clothes The posititon is execellent you can walk to a third of the things you want to do or see if your are sightseeing Hong Kong</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Husband and I were her for Christmas 2010. I found it pretty basic but clean.We stayed here for 8 night and have nothing to complain about. The breakfast buffet is decent, I love the congee that I had on 2 ocassions. The room itself was quite small, yet we didn't feel cramped. Instead of a table we had something that looks and feels like a ledge. A good use of space in my opinion. There are a quite a number of restaurants in the vicinity. The night market is a short walk as is the ferry terminal. The staff were very informative when we enquired about taking a trip to Maccau and made a couple of good suggestions. I woul definately stay here if I am in Hong Kong again.</p></li>

The rooms are small, which is I think standard in Hong Kong. However, they are very clean and up to date, especially the washrooms. The showers have glass walls. Also checking in is a breeze, took only about 5 mins. Daily maintenance was SUPERB!!! It was like a new room when we came back!!! Definitely comming back to this hotel again!!! Actually, we'll only be staying in this hotel everytime we go back to Hongkong!!! It was so GOOD!!! By the way, I'm the type of person who is either impressed or not impressed, so when I say its good, i mean it!!! GOOD JOB BP INTERNATIONAL!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the BP (Baden Powell of Boy Scout fame) for 6 nights when I was on buisiness in HK. I was upgraded on check-in to a Park View room on the 22nd floor, which has a great view over TST to the Island. Wonderful at night. Room was not large, but comfortable and clean, and there is free wifi in the room. The front desk staff were very helpful. As the hotel was close to work, it was good for me, but it is also close to Nathan Road, the MTR, and the area around Temple Street. All in all a good experience, and I will stay there again. The only down side was that I think they were refurmishing their lifts, and 1 out of the 4 was not working, which made the lift service a bit slow.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at BP International in Sept 2007 after reading good reviews on tripadvisor. We weren't disappointed! We booked through asiatravel and got a pretty good deal for a harbour view room. On arrival the shuttle bus was waiting for us at the station and it took us straight to the hotel door. The room wasn't huge but very clean and nicely decorated. The view was so good we didn't even bother going down to the harbour itself to watch the light show. The location is also very good and close enough to anywhere that you would want to go on a short stay in Hong Kong. The staff were most helpful, too. We were very pleased with our decision to stay here and would recommend the hotel to others.</p></li>

It was our first time in HK, so I really can't tell much about BP International. But I'll definitely recommend this hotel, and will most likely stay here again if I go back to HK.</p></li>

We asked for non smoking floor gave us smoking floor. The rooms were small. I was with my wife and infant son. Difficulty in keeping luggage and moving at same time in room. Although it is located on Austin road, ideally close to Nathan and Canton road ( shopping streets )Close to both Jordan & Austin metro. Next to Kowloon park. This connectivity is helpful in moving in HK. Only silver lining was elaborate breakfast. I will recommend this hotel to single or couple travellers.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and my girlfriend booked a room at BP for the first six nights of our Hong Kong - Macau trip, and we loved it. The hotel is very nice and clean, we just had some trouble figuring out where it was exactly, coming out of the MTR (Hong Kong subway stations are HUGE), but it was definitely worth it. The room was tiny but very clean, as the bath; the hotel staff was friendly and cooperative, they gave us directions and useful infos, and even kept our baggage for free after we checked out. The price was a bargain, especially compared to other hotels, more pricey but less comfortable (we stayed in a 4 star hotel in HK and it wasn't nearly as good). Don't be swayed by the low price, this place is too good to be missed!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a great hotel for the location and the cost. The picture is deceiving- it is taken from Kowloon park on the other side of the hotel. Location is in Kowloon, not far from anything-but a fun walk to lots of places. MTR is easy and a station is nearby. A no frills place-food their is too expensive-never tried it. Room was small, but good-we had a great view. Staff helpful- a very busy commercial place- but who cares. Room cleaned up every day. Taxis are easy available if needed. Did use their laundry room machines- a little pricey-but great to have at the tail end or middle of a trip. Stayed at the Sheraton one night after return from Macau- much more upscale and was fun, but saved money at the BP and this was okay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here over the Christmas / New Years (2007) period for 10 days. We had a very nice room on the 22nd floor with a lovely view of Hong Kong harbour. The room, while not overly spacious, was perfectly fine for the two of us. The daily housekeeping was excellent and the room and washroom were always spotless. The hotel is very close to Nathan Rd. and the harbour (easy walking to great shopping and eating). The subway is handy for easy travel into Hong Kong and the Star Ferry is an easy walk. There was a selection of 22 chanels on the television and there was also an in-room safe (a great convenience). We have stayed here previously and can recommend this hotel as a GREAT value for the money and everyone is so kind and helpfull.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Right at the heart of Austin street arise a towering hotel built by boyscouts years ago. Location wise I like it because it's walking distance to different shopping area. And very near the MTR station. The 3 most important things I always look for in an accommodation are: first cleanliness, comfort and good breakfast. This one fits the criteria. The hotel room is very dainty even the toilet. The bed is also comfortable to sleep with. The white atmosphere and the beddings are reasons why the room looks tidy. There breakfast is not stunning but the choices are good and the best thing I like is the BACON. For the price, I think BP offers a very reasonable price for the hotel quality and service. I still recommend this to people who are going to Hong Kong for a holiday.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">OK, the rooms are on the small side, but at least there is walking room all around the bed, there's desk space with a chair, and space to store luggage out of the way. Anyway, when staying in a place like Hong Kong, there's not the need for a large room, since you're out most of the time. We paid a little extra to guarantee a high-up room facing the harbour, and I think it was money well spent, as the views were fantastic. There was an excellent view of the nightly light show from our room, and on the radio there's an FM station which transmits the music to accompany the light show. The check-in and check-out service was quick and efficient, and there was no problem in leaving bags prior to our check-in time and after our check-out time. The room was immaculately clean.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">BP international looks nicer on the pictures than it is in reality. The picture of the garden is kowloon garden but that is one heck of a photographer to make the view so nice. Firstly, we were taken through some backdoor through a shady area by the hotel shuttle (shuttle is always a good thing). The room I had was a "family room" which had 2 bunk beds. Since we have 3 ppl in one room it was a better option than cramping a double room with a third bed. My friends room with a queen bed was a bit larger. My view was pretty ugly (except at night..). The bathroom was the nicest part with walls glassed over and modern shower, faucet, toilet. The blanket was thin and rough. Kind of like a cheap used blanket. The location IS pretty good since it is walkable to harbour city and metro.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were impressed by the modern and elegant design of this hotel -- from its lobby to its hotel rooms. Staff are friendly, helpful and accommodating. The hallways and the room itself looked and smelled clean and fresh unlike other 3-star hotels that we've stayed before. Location is also good -- with Kowloon park and Parklane blvd just beside it, and the Jordan MTR stn (which will take you to anywhere you want to go in HK) just a 3-min walk. We've had no problem with our stay except that we weren't able to charge our mobile phones as their outlets are different from the Europe and U.S. plugs (be sure to buy your adaptor!).. Other than that, overall experience was great. We will definitely recommend this hotel to our relatives and friends who will visit HK -- really GOOD value for your money.Ü</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located in downtown Hong Kong, BP is ideally located. Within reach of the waterfront and other places of tourist interest, the hotel has an interesting connection with the Scout movement : hence BP ( Baden Powell, the founder of Scouts movement) The hotel is spic and span, brassware gleaming and glasswork shining. When I reached there in the midst of the swine flu scare, extra care taken by the hotel was obvious. Rooms were a bit disappointing in size, but I believe it is the norm in space starved HK. Service at the reception was abit mechanical, not really very curteous to their guests, but room service was much better. Restaurant was good, but teh breakfasts were repetitive. The foyer is impressive, especially with its winding stairs and a statue of Lord BP. Value for money, though not very customer oriented.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here June of 2006 for one week with 3 other friends and was plesently surprised. We were hesistant at first as our taxi driver called the place "garbage" and criticized it for having bunk beds (since there were four of us, our room consisted of 2 bunks...this was also a popular hotel for boy scouts). Once we got there we also ran into a problem as they could not find our reservation that we booked online through a website (this turned out to be more so the websites fault not the hotel). Luckily they had room for us for the entire week and we got an excellent rate for 4 people (About 250 canadian each for the entire week!). The room turned out to be great too. Quite cramped however, but what did you expect for the price and with four 20-somthing guys. The bathroom was very clean and the shower was amazing. Room even had a safe and good TV.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">To echo what others have said, a very basic no frills type of place. You'll pay decent prices for a HK stay in a good Kowloon location but it won't be anything fancy. A few quick points: - Across 7-11 and Wellcome Supermarkets so it's easy to stock up on water, etc - A block from the nearest starbucks - One block to the MTR Train station (Jordan Stop) - One block to Nathan Road - One block to Canton Road - About a 15-20 minute walk to the star ferry terminal - If you book with an agency, chances are they will also book you a shuttle road to and from the airport, which helps since it's about a 30 minute ride and the bus is very clean/comfortable - No gym - Laundry on site (25 hk dollars) for those travelers who pack light - Also, if you are looking for good food in the immediate area, the restaurant downstairs from the hotel is very good for dimsum and dinner.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">GREAT LOCATION, 5mins walk to Jordan MTR, 10mins walk to Star Ferry, plus all the shops & restaurants right outside the hotel. My double room comfortable suited 1person, but was a tight squeeze for 2 people, but it was clean & comfortable. The hair-dryer provided was pretty useless. But the complimentary tea, coffee & water was appreciated. Plus the free newspaper hung on your door every morning was a nice touch. Tiny wardrobe, could only hang 3 items, so had to utilise the side-board & floor. The bathroom was also very compact, but clean. The cleaning staff were always very friendly & staff on reception were helpfull. The hotel was very busy & noisy at all times & the lifts seemed to stop on every floor which was annoying. Definitely ask for a room on a higher floor & waterfront side as the view is great. Also ask for a room away from the lifts, as it can be noisy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Although this hotel is slightly dated, the location, cleanliness and value makes it a good pick for people passing through Hong Kong on business. Right by Hong Kong park with nice views over Victoria harbour, the Hong Kong Island and lower Tsim Sha Tsui your are quite well off, especially on the higher floors. The close distance to Kowloon Ferry Terminal, Tsim Sha Tsui bus station and the MTR makes it a good spot to start when you are going places. The rooms are small and the interior is old, although clean. In general the offer is nothing special, but tend to your basic needs and generally at good rates. Service is OK, breakfast decent and there is WiFi available at a charge. The hotel seems to be popular with tour groups and the lobby was occasionally packed with people and bags. The elevators were quite slow and getting to and from the room often took longer than you would expect.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed our stay at BP International. My husband and I decided to go to Hongkong for our 1st year anniversary. We don't plan a very grand vacation though. We were on a budget and BP Int'l happens to be the cheapest in the list that our travel agent gave us. We were really expecting a very ordinary room but the lobby just caught us in awe! Receptionist was very polite although no bus boy helped us bring our luggages to our room, which is really not a big deal coz we could roll our trolleys anyway. We stayed at the 14th floor and the room given to us was quite small but it didn't matter because it feels cozy and is very very clean. The bathroom was also very cute. Small but very modern. The hotel is also strategically located. It's near the MRT and the night market. Only a few steps away to Nathan Rd. It even has a park at the back where you could stroll. Hotel is definetly of good value!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I stayed at the hotel in July. The rate was great - less than 100 Canadian Dollars a night, even if the rooms were a little small. After all, it is Hong Kong and unless you are prepared to fork out USD300-500, chances are you will end up with smallish rooms. The rooms are well-equipped; there was enough storage area; the room and bathroom were clean. The hotel lobby is quite impressive. The best part of the hotel is its location. Convenient to restaurants, shopping, the ferry to HK and the subway, you cannot go wrong. Someone had commented a while ago that the hotel did not have a luggage storage room and anyone getting to the hotel before the check-in time would have to leave their luggage with the bell desk and the luggage would be left in the lobby. The situation has not changed, although for our 6 bags, they did tie them together. For the price and the quality, highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I picked this hotel based on review and prices. I didn't expect much of anything considering the relatively low rates. I was really surprised how nice the hotel was. The lobby was a real shock, huge and luxurious. The rooms are neat, well-designed and comfortable. Every little gadget and button in the room works like it should, The air conditioner was the most cooperative I have seen anywhere. These are always a problem, but not in this hotel. The bathrooms are spotless, the showers comfortable and clean. The breakfast bar was too abundant, it exceeded every expectation I ever had. Great tasting food, too. Built on a mezzanine it inherits the splendor of the interior design from the lobby below. The location is near perfect: short ride to Kowloon station, 15 minute walk to the ocean ferry. The neighborhood is filled with shops and restaraunts, much like everything esle in Hong Kong. What else can you ask for?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My first stay here was pretty much as previous reviewers had advised. The price was my favorite part and that internet was included. I found the hotel to be a bit too busy- constant coming and goings of people. More than usual from observations. Check staff was fast and nice. Hotel elevators were very slow and in fact there was statement in the room that the hotel is upgrading their elevator system over next few months. They need it! 4 slow elevators. Room was larger than I expected for the price and I was happy and I found the view to be very nice. Television was small and old- exactly what I had expected. My big gripe - no iron or ironing board and I was asked to visit self serve laundry to use a free iron there. Check out was so slow I had to leave and contact hotel later for copy of my bill as only two staff working reception. My rating would be higher if elevator was better and iron was not such a hassle.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The guest room, although small, was very clean and modern. It was very difficult for me to rest well in my room due to several reasons. First, there were a lot of children running and playing along the corridor. Second, there were a few guests who spoke very loudly for a very long time early in the morning and late at night, including weekends. Third, some guests were smoking and as the windows could not be opened, I had to sleep with the smoke the whole nights and felt terrible in the morning. Fourth, one guest actually knocked on my door at 8 am on a Sunday for no reason at all. Some others knocked on the door of their friends/family for a considerable period of time. Fifth, the mattress and pillows were awful. Six, you could hear TV noise and conversation from the room next door. The buffet was disappointing. The hotel itself is actually fine. But don't think I would stay here again. Too much noise and smoke.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you're looking for an above average, moderately priced hotel in HK, then this hotel fits your needs. It's conveniently located in Tsim Sha Tsui so there's food, shopping, and access to the public transportation. I don't know when they redid the rooms, but the rooms are nicely furnished and clean. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. As already mentioned, they're moderately priced and IMO worth it. The only con is the size of the room and especially the bathroom. If I was travelling by myself, this room will fit fine, but if you're travelling with your spouse, then you might find it small. The bathroom barely has enough room for one person. You step into the bathroom, turn once and you'll be at the sink, turn again and your facing the toilet, and the turn one more time and you'll be facing the shower. That's how small the bathroom is. Overall, I had a great experience and I'd recommend this hotel to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When you arrive in Hong Kong catch express train to Kowloon. At Kowloon walk around to Bus terminal and catch free bus to BP Int. This Hotel is a great place to stay for the family. The main entrance is amazing for a mid range hotel. I had difficulties finding a roon in Hong Kong for a family of 4. This Hotel was able to do this - 2 bunk beds which the kids loved. The room was incredibly small. And the lifts very slow. We used the fire exits - despite being on 14 floor this was still quicker. If you have an early riser - head out for a moring stroll in the park behind the Hotel. It is incredibly clean - very peaceful and lovely to watch morning Tai Chi and Flamingos being fed. There is also a fabulous swimming pool complex. The outdoor pool is only open in summer months. Being on a budget we didn't eat in the Hotel restaurant - we crossed the road for a much cheaper breakfast - and headed down to Temple St for dinner.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First impressions were that the rooms were quite small. However, the rooms were very clean. We stayed on one of the highest floors and had a great view overlooking the harbour. The hotel is in a good location, two MTR stations in easy walking distance, park lane shoppers boulevard one street away. The bathroom was better than any other hotels Ive stayed in - the shower is easy to use, good pressure, does not leak water onto the floor (has glass doors rather than shower curtains) and drains quickly. The beds are hard and pillows are not very comfortable. The broadband internet service is not reliable, we tried it twice and it only worked for an hour or so before dropping out - the staff could not figure out the problem and we still had to pay for it. There is no complementary bottled water which was disappointing as you can't drink the tap water. Also there was no room service menu, didn't follow this up but don't think they offer it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Bell staff here are eager to porter bags despite any resistance, in exchange for tips (and they are not shy to wait with an open hand). The rooms are small, clean with good quality furnishings. Water temperature for showering can occasionally go hot or cold unexpectedly, so keep the temperature somewhere in the middle. On the second floor is a restaurant and a piano lounge/tea area where you can get free internet access on 2 old computers. Attached to the hotel at lobby level is the Kings Court restaurant which offers cheap dimsum, and a local bus station that can take you to places in China. The Temple street night market is a couple of blocks away and the hotel is walking distance to Jordan subway station. Upscale stores surround the area, grocery stores and pharmacies are nearby as well. 30 minutes walk will get you to the ferry terminal. I have stayed here previously in 2004 for a few days, and it was pretty much the same, just a little newer.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For the price we paid for this hotel, we really were expecting something very basic. However as our airport bus pulled up outside, we thought that we couldn't surely be in the right place. The lobby is truly impressive and well decorated. The restaurant was divine. The staff were really friendly. Everything was great! For the price we paid we did get quite a small room (although larger rooms are also available for a higher price) but everything in this room was, although basic, pristine and in excellent condition. The Scout Association of Hong Kong have their headquarters in the same building, and as I have been associated with Scouts in the past, it was great to pop in and converse with some scouts from a different country. The location of this hotel is fantastic; right next to the beautiful Kowloon Park and within easy walking distance of public transport to access other parts of the city. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling in Hong Kong.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is very good hotel, with an excellent location in Kowloon (i.e. it took us 10 min by foot to get to the Star Ferry to go to the HK island, the Temple Street Market, the jade market - and 15-20 min to go to Mong Kok) and a good rate. The room was very nice, with a view overlooking the city, the park of Kowloon and part of HK island, so we could even enjoy the Symphony of Light from our room (ask the harbour parkview room). The only negative part would be that the walls are very thin (we could hear when the guest next door was leaving/coming back) and if you're a non-smoker, make sure you ask for the non-smoking floor (we would sometimes smell cigarette smoke). I would definitely go back there and will recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in HK. The staff was polite but not very friendly, but it did look like a very busy hotel (reception was always crowded). It is also the Scout center so it is quite funny to pass by tourists, businessmen and... young (and older) scouts in the hotel lobby!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The best thing about this hotel is that its centrally located in the Kowloon Area, and the hotspots of Kowloon are extremely nearby. Also, there's an MTR station just few meters away from the hotel, which is extremely convenient, as travelling by the underground is the best way to go around Hong Kong. I'd suggest this hotel to whoever is looking for a nice and comfortable room to stay at night, with the necessary facilities. But if you're looking for good service and a leisure stay, then this one is surely not for you. The rooms are sufficiently comfy, but not very spacious and at times, get claustrophobic. But that was not an issue for us, as our priority was to visit as much of Hong Kong, as possible. So everyday, we used to leave the Hotel after breakfast in the morning, and return late at night only. So after an exhausting day of travelling, we used to just crash on our beds and revive ourselves for the next day. So considering all these factors, it was an overall good experience and not a heavy one on our pockets either.</p></li>

Close to Jordans MTR Close to Temple Street Market (if you like tat) Not many decent looking restaurants nearby - hotel restaurant seemed pricey Don't get the airport shuttle transfer - BP is the last stop in Kowloon and still drops you around the corner - better get the train and taxi from Kowloon station. You will want to purchase an octopus card anyway Good communication during the typhoon Breakfast is buffet style but no instructions on what the chef can also cook for you. And instructions on telephone were poor. The international dialling code is 001 rather than the normal 00. Found mini bar items are charged twice - once by cleaner on the day, and second when you take your minibar bill on checkout. If I was going back to HK I would stay more central as the MTR is excellant for getting around Take a visit to the peak (up on the tram and return on 15 bus) , but don't bother with the roof experience</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here on my first night for an eight day business trip to Mainland. Reason for staying here was that my trip was a last minute trip, and all of my regular hotels were booked. This was apparantly the only room in town. My rate was $1400 HKD/night. Requested non smoking room and was given a room with 2 twin beds. I am 6' 4" tall, so I ask to switch, and was refused as it was the last room in the hotel. Room was nicely decorated and very clean. After settling in my room, I then tried to access the internet/email from my room, and was told that there was no wireless on non smoking floor, although they did have broadband access in all rooms. Unfortunately, I did not have a cable, so I checked with reception and was told that they were all out. When I asked what I should do, I was told to go to Mongkok to buy a cable. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I did venture out on the streets, and found a cable. When I did get onto the broadband, it was slower than dial up. I could not even access some websites. Needless to stay, I wil never stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For a traveller who is 'geographically challenged' this is the best hotel for you. Just a few minutes away is Jordan Stations MTR (train line)- this is the most convenient way to traveller around the city. Also for us who went to Macau, the China Ferry Terminal is walking distance so we saved in the taxi fare. The room is clean, bed plush, the room is averaged sized. There's a lot of closet room for our clothes. The bathroom maybe small but all the amenities are in (bath gel, shampoo, toothbrush and paste, slippers, cotton buds and cotton pad as make up remover). Water heater also available. We didn't get the harbour view but the view of the city- it's nice to see the city lights in the evening. I liked the breakfast buffet, since it has a lot of choices. And since it's a buffet, we filled ourselves up and just ate light lunch outside- we were able to save some money again for the meals. There is a tour desk at the hotel lobby too, they helped us a lot. All in all, I had nothing bad to say about this hotel. When there's no smoke, there's no fire ^_^</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good value for Kowloon”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at the BP International just on check-in time (2.00PM) and we booked for three nights through Expedia. We had clearly requested a non-smoking double room. Upon arrival I was told they could put me in a Smoking room with 2 single beds for one night and they'd move us on day 2. I said that this wasn't acceptable and we waited about 30 minutes for a double non-smoking room to be cleaned. This was all a bit of a painful start to our stay, but that said, the staff were very polite and professional and they did expedite a room for us. The hotel appeared to be very busy. The lifts were very slow (they are upgrading them) and the room was a bit pokey but for a really good location in Kowloon and for the price, it was quite reasonable. The room was spotless and serviced professionally each day and the staff were friendly and very helpful. For location and value the BP International is a good choice. If you want a more luxurious and romantic stay (and a King Bed) then this is probably not the place. One tip for HK and surrounds: get rid of smoking in rooms completely!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I transferred to the B P International (where B P stands for Baden Powell, former leader of the scouting movement) from the nearby Evergreen in Yau Ma Tei (see my review of that) to provide my wife with a more memorable experience for her short visit to join me after a business trip. The rooms are well over twice the price of the Evergreen and, yes, you get a huge lobby to walk into. I paid extra for a "harbour parkview" room, on the side overlooking Kowloon Park and parts of the island. The view was pretty nice, despite the number of buildings that are now in the way. However, the window was very grubby, which is no way to present one of a hotel's main features. The room was small and not very clean. Worse, it was clearly still being used for smokers - and I thought all civilised hotels had outlawed that nasty habit in their rooms. Breakfast and internet are extras here, in contrast to the excellent Evergreen. All in all, I would say that this hotel needs to either upgrade the rooms and provide included breakfast and free net use, or reduce its prices significantly. Not recommended at the price.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">BP International Hotel is conveniently located at Austin Road. Right in front of the hotel is a 7-11 store, a money changer and a small grocery called "Wellcome" - where you can buy drinks, snacks & even electrical outlet adaptors at a fair price. Austin Rd is known for having small international restos that have good prices too. Just a few blocks away is Temple Drive where there is a flea market and a good outdoor place where you can eat good chinese cuisine. The Jordan MTR station is also just a few blocks away, from there you can go to any point in HK: Causeway, Disneyworld, Mongkok, etc. The hotel room was sized just right, it may be a bit cramped and the bed may be a bit short for those who are over 6'4" tall - I'm 5'11" and it wasn't a problem. The room has all the basic amenities. For Filipinos, you may want to bring an electrical outlet adaptor to charge your celphones, cameras & laptops. The hotel can lend you an adaptor for free but it doesn't fit our usual plugs. You can buy one for HK$12 in the Wellcome grocery right in front of the hotel. Hotel staff are friendly & most speak basic english.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros: One of the more affordable hotels in HK. Reasonable walking distance to two Metro stops. Bathrooms were clean. Cons: It started with our check-in. We had reserved a room with a double bed in a non-smoking room. We get upstairs to our room and not only are there 2 twin beds, but the place reeks of smoke. We go back to reception to the most unfriendly staff member imaginable. We get the manager involved, and he explains that they catered to our "nonsmoking" room and that the double bed room we reserved was "preferred" and not guaranteed. Considering we paid extra to intentionally book the double, we were at a stand-off for several angry minutes until the manager finally decided to upgrade us for the evening to a suite until a double room opened up the next day. Because he finally decided to meet us half-way, they get 2 stars. The beds were horribly hard, but I'm guessing this is the standard in China and HK. It was a marginal upgrade over sleeping on a bare tatami mat. The double room was also small (as was the suite, to be honest), but I value quality sleep over the size of a room I don't intend to spend much time in.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have chosen BP Int'l based on my budget and reviews on tripadvisor and I am glad that I and my spouse have not been disappointed. The service rendered was good 1. We emailed to BP Int about the Airport Express free shuttle before the trip and was given prompt and clear response. 2. Request for a high-flr room and subsequently a change of room due to the beds are accomodated. They even made arrangement to shift our luggage to the new room after we leave the previous room for the day. 3. Service was pleasant and helpful. No problem with checking whatsoever. After our trip, we came to realise that our credit card was charged with some items that we didn't consume. We emailed them about it and to our pleasant surprise, it was waived after our explanation. It was great service recovery as we were upset over this as it was unfair to us to pay for unconsumed items and BP Int did a great job in refunding our credit card company for the charges. All in all, it is a good value hotel, located in the heart of Kowloon (you can take a 5 min walk to either Austin/Jordan MTR) and we will definitely stay in this hotel, should we visit HK again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location. 5 minute walk to train station, short walk to shops and restaurants. Bell boys very helpful and keen to assist with baggage however a tip may be expected. Staff were helpful in assisting with directions. However, if a smile is expected with service, it was rare to come across. The rooms were very poorly sound proofed. Walking down the corridor we were able to hear people sneezing, talking or watching tv in their rooms. BP international are currently undertaking construction therefore construction noises are quite loud towards noon. We found on this trip that some hotels may not provide affordable laundry service. BP International has a fully equipt coin laundry with a tv included! The room was clean and had adequate space. Bathroom was very small and lacked a bath tub. Despite this, the room has a great view of the city at night and from our room we could have seen the symphony of lights. We went to a few hotels for this trip and this particular hotel was by far the most expensive for the amount it provided. However, if you are looking for a simple no fuss hotel where all the essentials are covered, this is the place for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at the BP International a number of times and do so for two basic reasons, its location and the fantastic views across Kowloon Park, including sections of Victoria Harbour. Book a Harbour View room and ask for a high floor (Istayed on the 20th), it is well worth the extra cost. Located in Kowloon, the hotel is a short walk to the main shopping areas of Tsim Sha Tsui, there are handy shops such as Wellcome just across the road and Jordan MTR station is only a few minutes away. It is also within walking distance to tourist attractions such as Nathan Road and Temple Street should you wish to subject yourself to such activities. The service at the reception desk is efficient although a smile would make it even more pleasant (why don't Hong Kong hotels teach their staff this simple gesture?)! The airconditioning is excellent and easily adjustable. Rooms are not huge but a comfortable size for Hong Kong. Give breakfast a miss, there are plenty of shops around offering a more interesting, local fare. My main issue is internet charges. In my opinion, all hotels should provide a free internet service as BP International did on my previous visit. At HK$100 per day, this charge is a blatant rip-off.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed at this hotel, having read so many good things about it. The hotel building and the location are excellent, and the hotel lobby with its high ceiling, the large stairways all decorated for the year-end season look really nice, although sitting in the hotel lobby you could hear loud noices of cups and saucers, plates and spoons rattling against each other coming from the upper ground restaurant. It was a very nice fresh feel as you stepped out of the lift with the seemingly new lighting, wall panel and carpet. The disappointment came when you went inside the room - it was really quite tiny, including the bathroom. While we managed with our queen-double room, our children's twin-bedded room with an extra bed that we requested for just looked and felt so crammed. To allow them more space we have to bring their baggages over to our room. If the hotel has slightly enlarged the room size, say add another 50 - 80 sq ft, it would provide very comfortable stay indeed. I was told the room size as it is is 220 sq.ft or so and trust me, I have no idea that 220 sq. ft is so small. The rooms we had were clean, and came with nice partial harbour view in the day as well as night with lights up in and around the area.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived late after being bumped from flight due to typhoon season, took bus from airport which went up Nathan RD and stopped right by Kowloon Park . The hotel is just a short walk towards park, and we felt safe even with our rolling hand carry size suitcases. Found out the next day there is a police precinct near the corner. The lobby is beautiful and the reception staff were very polite and nice in a reserved way. Our room was a decent size, two twin beds on the firm side,but had all the amenities and toiletries. Only thing was it smelled of smoke. We thought we would only stay one night so did not bother to complain since it was past midnight. We ended up staying for two nights, but was out all day anyway so did not have to deal with the room. Bed was comfortable and clean , bathroom and towels were fresh and clean. Breakfast had an excellent spread, and a lot of it. Cost is reasonable , but one can certainly eat for less somewhere else. There are lots of restaurants nearby and fruit stalls on side streets. Internet is purchased separately but it was reasonable. Just have to keep your eye on your bill when checking out as well as for phone usage. The staff spoke English very well and very helpful. All in all I had a pleasant stay .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was the third time I stayed here and I was not disappointed. Its location is excellent and its quality is better than other hotels in the same class. The rooms are NOT small in Hong Kong's standard (in fact they are huge for the price you pay). Jordon subway station is 2 minutes away and the hotel is walking distance to both TST (tourist area) and Mong Kok/YMT (shopping areas for local). Fantastic Value: the hotel is owned by the boy scouts (literally!) so I assume it is not aiming for high profit margin. If you live in any major city in North Amercia with a sizable Chinese population, the secret of booking this hotel (and a bunch of other hotels in Hong Kong) is to book through Chinese travel agents in Chinatown. They have access to "vouchers rate" which are even cheaper than anything you can find on the web. The one I think I was not thrilled about is its lack of free internet access (and the rooms are too high for you to access the PCCW (the telecom provider in HK) access-point at the 7-11 across the street). However, there are computers with free internet access at pacific coffee two blocks away. Or better, buy a PCCW monthly account (dirt cheap) and sit at the Starbucks down the street (one of the very few quiet Starbucks in HK).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The rooms at this hotel are tiny. When first entering, you see a grand lobby, nice elevators, big hallways...........and then the room. I suppose that for the price paid, you should not expect too much more. The service is well below average. The desk staff was vey rude. When we asked for an extra key, we were told that hotel policy was one key per room. However, over half of our tour group had requested and received extra keys. It was only after pointing this out and arguing for 15 minutes that they finally relented. We had a number of other experiences with the rudeness of the staff over our two night stay which told us that the attitude was prevalent among most of the staff. The food was also terrible at this hotel. We had a buffet breakfast on the 2nd floor where the food was barely edible. After a few bites we were done. Dinner at the Chinese restaurant on the basement floor was also poor, but edible. The final straw was the cockroaches in the room. Upon waking up and turning on the light, I saw a couple of cockroaches scatter off the bed. I had to empty and repack my luggage to make sure that I did not have extra travelers with me. I brought this problem to the attention of the hotel staff upon checkout and there was no apology or promise of action. I would never stay in this hotel again. Very poor.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from my trip to Hong Kong. I stayed for 3 nights in BP International. I can say that there is nothing extraordinary with this hotel. The rooms were very small for the price and bathrooms were very slippery - be careful. My friends stayed in a guest house nearby and the room size were similar although less modern. Next time, I think I'll just stay at a guest house since I only stayed in the room 4-5 hours a day for sleeping anyway. The restaurant at the basement was absolutely delicious though. I will definitely eat there again the next time I am in the city. What's great about BP is that its really close to Canton Rd and Nathan Rd. Everything is very accessible and it is more secure than the guest houses available nearby. Customer service was average and the bell boy sort of rude but later apologetic, when I confronted him for it. My uncle, who I was with, got hit by a taxi and we had a to spend a day in the ER. I think BP should be more cautious with this. They should request traffic personnel near the pedestrian line since they have a lot of guests using it. If you want a "hotel" feel and have the budget for it, I would recommend this hotel. It is way cheaper compared to nearby 3-5 star hotels, but if you don't really care for all the fancy stuff, I'd say better stay in a guest house and use your money for some shopping. :D</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My friends and i stayed here this September for 5 days. From the outside you'll think that this could be a 4 star hotel coz it's big. But once you're inside you'll know it's just a 3star hotel. though they have a huge lobby, there are no doormen to open or close doors for you, a bellboy did help us one time to bring our luggages to our room. but at the reception, a very friendly attendant named Sun is very accomodating to answer and help us with our queries. the ROOM: we had standard twin (they were gracious to give us non-smoking rooms as requested) single beds but hard mattress, mini ref, personal safe, heating kettle, hairdryer. they provided new slippers, basic toilletries each day. very basic but manageable. 7-11, wellcome grocery (cheaper), restos are just across the hotel. short walk to temple street night market with LOTS of eateries. mcdonalds and mtr jordan, bossinni are 10-15minutes walk. macau ferry terminal around 15 minutes walk too. avenue of the stars at the end of nathan is around 20 or so minutes walk. parklane shoppers area and granville road are 15minutes walk. overall, for the price we paid, this hotel has a very convenient location and is worth it for budget travellers like me who would not settle for anything less desirable. that at the end of the day you also look forward to coming to your room to take a bath and sleep. also, the place is safe ;p</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were pleasantly surprised. This hotel is in a good location (right next to Kowloon Park, and one of the night markets), and has several nice features for families. First, the price is good - about half of what I was able to get from the Marco Polo Prince. Granted, the location is not as good as the Hotels on the water, but that was not our main concern. The rooms were clean and big enough to accomodate our group. We took a couple of strolls to the park and our kids enjoyed the playsets, McDonalds, and the peaceful atmosphere. The hotel provided us a spare bed for our child at a nominal price. Much cheaper than getting another room or having our 3 year old sleep on the floor. The breakfasts were very good. At about $10 per person, there was plenty of good food and attentive staff. This set us up as we went to Beijing right after and were wishing we were back at the BP international. The tour desk lady was very nice and helpful. She set us up with a tour and answered all of our questions with a smile. This really makes a difference when you're working with people who are happy to be there - this was not the case at the hotel we stayed at in Beijing. The in house laundromat was very nice - this help us do some mid-vacation laundry which kept things going smoothly. Overall - good stay; not a 5 star, but nice, clean and with a good location. I'd recommend this to anyone and would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for a couple of nights after 8 nights in a tiny guest house style place. So I thought this hotel was really nice. The lobby was really new and had a gorgeous christmas tree. Our room was motel style, but I thought it was great, spacious, clean, and had an amazing view of the city with a big window. Had a cupboard, in room safe, bathroom was fine everything was clean and worked well. Bed was amazing after so many nights in a rock hard bed. Had manager on call 24/7 to help you with anything you needed, in our case when we ran out of toilet paper!! The location was really good, just about 100m from Nathan Rd and hardly any further to the subway. You could walk either way down Nathan Rd and find lots of shopping and interesting things. We ate at the buffet for dinner. It was really nice, though I stuck mostly to the things I knew. They had lots of hot and cold dishes, and had a bbq area where the chefs cooked prawns, fish, kebabs etc for you. Nice desserts and drinks, and waiters were always clearing your plate so you didn't have that big pile at the end! Also drank at the bar, and enjoyed all you could drink from 9-12pm for $150 HK (about $30 NZ) which we thought was a wonderful bargain. Had breakfast at the buffet which was nice nothing too exciting had the normal western style scrambled eggs, bacon, hashbrowns as well as some asian dishes. All in all I loved staying here and my boyfriend loved it too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our first trip to Hong Kong and we were not disapointed. We stayed here for 3 nights at the end of March as a stopover on our way to New Zealand. The service was efficient and helpful. Our room was excellent, perhaps a little small for 2, but perfectly adequate for a short stay. It was beautifully clean and the beds were comfortable. We had an immaculate en suite shower room. Kowloon park was just behind the hotel and provided a lovely walk on the way to the star ferry which only took about 10 minutes. We found Hong Kong to be extremely clean and efficient and were very impressed that no one is allowed to eat on the streets or on public transport, consequently keeping everying extremely clean and tidy. Incidently if you drop litter there is an instant fine of £150! We found eating out challenging, probably because we tried to eat with the locals and chinese food in Hong Kong is nothing like it is in England! I think you have to pay a little more and eat in the European restaurants. Getting from the airport is so easy as there is train from the airport to the centre where you are able to get a taxi at a low cost to your hotel. One day we visited Cheung chau island which is about a 50 min boat trip away and we felt we experienced more of the real China. The buildings on Hong Kong island are awe inspiring, go up to the 43rd floor of the Bank of China for a great view. All in all we had a great experience here and would certainly recommend the BP International for a comfortable few nights stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Have just spent a couple of days in Kowloon at the BP International Hotel . What an amazing place Hong Kong is but do not think it is as cheap as everyone seems to say it is. We stayed at the BP International Hotel in Kowloon right in the centre of food courts and shopping centres. The hotel itself was spotlessly clean Staff all very friendly and helpful and most spoke perfect English. The rooms ( we had a twin) were not very big but certainly good enough for a few days stay. There was plenty of hot water and good size shower even though the shower room was very small. I always think if the bed is very clean and the shower is good that is fine for short stays. Our room was on the 20th floor overlooking the city so lots of lights at night . There gave you two free bottles of water a day which came in very helpful . The bar had happy hour for a couple or hours a night. and the buffet restaurant for lunch was very good. The hotel also looked after your luggage if you had a late flight which i thought was helpful too. you are within walking distance of the night market and ferries to Hong Kong Island and Macau as well as some great shopping malls I think if we visit Hong Kong again i would certainly stay at this hotel They do a shuttle from the airport to hotel for 110 HK dollars ( March 2012) one way We found this very helpful as we arrived in the evening and didn't really want to be getting on buses and trains but if you are young public transport is really cheap. A seven 11 was right across the street and behind the hotel was Kowloon Park a lovely oasis in all the high rise buildings Well worth a visit if you are in the Kowloon area</p></li>

<li>A seven 11 was right across the street and behind the hotel was Kowloon Park a lovely oasis in all the high rise buildings Well worth a visit if you are in the Kowloon area</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at BP International House for 4 days. The hotel had shuttle service from the airport which was arranged by our travel agent. Very convenient! The hotel looks very new and clean. Our check-in was handled very efficiently, it took only a few minutes -- but this could be because the room was already fully paid beforehand. We requested for a non-smoking room and since there weren't any more available, we got an upgrade to the 24th floor with the harbour view at no extra charge! The room is very clean, looks newly renovated although a bit small. I'm very particular about bathrooms (I think hotel bathrooms are disgusting, in general) but I didn't have a problem with their bathroom which also looked newly renovated. They have glass walls instead of tiles so I know they're pretty clean. They also have complete toiletries for guests like toothbrushes, shower caps, slippers, toothpaste, shampoo, etc. They do have soap but it's in a dispenser. You might want to bring your own soap. The room is also very cold. We keep on turning the AC on and off because we couldn't get the right temperature. It was okay but it was colder in our room than outside -- but Hong Kong malls are also cold so I think they like their indoors cold. The concierge staff is also very accomodating although not that so in the middle of the night when we get back from shopping. They TRY but I could see they just want to go home. There is also a cranky male staff who is constantly checking on guests at the lobby. The hotel is walking distance to the Jordan station, to the Temple Street Night Market and to Harbour City. It was very convenient. I like this hotel. I'll consider staying here again. =)</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location is key here. The Jordan MTR station is half a block away. Right outside the hotel is a 7-11 where you can buy necessities or even top up your Octopus Card credit. Directly behind the hotel is Kowloon Park where my husband and I went for a short morning run in attempts to run off all the delicious food we were having in HK. Temple Street night market and Nathan Road are a stone's throw away. I don't disagree with the other reviews about the small rooms, but hey, we've got to be realistic here. This is Hong Kong and real estate is expensive and scarce. If you go to New York or Tokyo, the rooms are not going to be any bigger. In fact, we've stayed in even tinier rooms in NY. Within its category, BP International met expectations. Service staff was friendly and our bathroom was equipped with toothbrush, comb, shower cap, facial cotton, etc. We don't see these complimentary toiletries anymore unless we are staying at a 5-star hotel these days. One thing is that they only have 4 non-smoking floors, so be sure to request for it at check-in if that's what you want. One quirky thing: the hotel played the same elevator music the entire week we were there. I caught myself humming to the tune when walking on the streets. The poor hotel staff has listen to this same tune everyday! Tip 1: right outside is the pickup point for the Airport Shuttle Express bus that will bring you to the Airport Express train, if you don't want to take a taxi. Tip 2: When catching a taxi to a place where you only know the English name, ask the receptionist to write the Cantonese name of your destination on a card for you to hand over to the taxi driver. Many of the drivers don't know the English names.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was a nice place to stay. Check in was acceptable. I wanted a double bed, but they only had two singles. Seems like they don't have very many rooms with double beds to begin with so you really have to check with them to make sure you get it. They apologized and upgraded me to a sea view room instead. The room was nice. Bathrooms very clean. Would have hoped for a bathtub but those are quite rare in Hong Kong. The room had what seems like taller ceilings. The sea view also faces the park behind the hotel instead of the road in front. That said, not much of a see view left with so many taller buildings in the way. Bed was a touch hard, but that's pretty typical of Asia. The AC is powerful enough but it turns off when you take your keycard out of the slot. Ripping the cardboard sleeve they give you for the keycards and stuff it into the slot does keep it running. Room has a basic safe, but its bolted to a cabinet, not the wall (sorta iffy). The elevators are awful. Simply awful. They were working on them during my stay so they had 3 instead of 4 running (one of which ran on it's own with separate buttons). Normally, it should be fine, but the elevator controller is pretty idiotic. Hopefully it'll improve once the work is done. Oh and the 25th doesn't have elevator service, you walk a flight of stairs from 24. The crummy elevators is really the only thing keeping me from giving this hotel a 5 star rating. Location is good. Close to MTR Jordan Station and Austin Station. There are busses on the main road, but don't bother, the MTR is usually much quicker. There is a shuttle bus to the Airport Express at the side of the building. The Airport Express was much faster and cheaper than taking any of the hotel shuttle services.</p></li>

The rooms are small about 20 sqm. once you enter the room you would see the bath room on the right ( shower with glass enclosure, no tub, toilet and sink ) with basic toiletries, closet on the left with hanger and safe. the room was 1423 near the fire exit and the rooms were clean. there were 2 bunk beds w/c is just right for our party. theres a small tv with dresser and a blow drier and a fridge with mini bar. all of it fit in a small space. the elevators were fast as well. i cant say if the staff were rude or friendly - they didnt smile and they have a hard time speaking in english so they just point or use sign whatever it is we asked. we forgot to bring an adapter (for cell phone and camera charging) and we called the housekeeping and they delivered it in our room at no extra cost. when we arrived we wanted to go to ocean park but 5 of the taxi cab refused to take us there (guess because of the distance ) and we asked help from the concierge and they gave us a small calling card and wrote something in Chinese and when we showed it to the taxi driver and asked to go to ocean park they drove us there no questions asked though we didnt know what the concierge wrote in the card. for the amount that we paid, id say that its a good value and wed stay there again the next time we visit Hong Kong.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is my third trip to Hong Kong and my first stay in this Hotel. My friend and I stayed for a total 5 nights. Compared to the previous hotel I stayed, this Hotel is just good. It is located within walking distance to the Jordan MTR (5 mins walk) and it is surrounded by many restaurants and cafes. The famous night market, Temple Street is about 8 mins away. Tsim Tsa Shui (TTS) is about 20 mins walk. If you do not feel like walking, then just hop on the Jordan MTR to TTS. The hotel room is big compared to other hotels. The staff from the housekeeping department are super friendly. There are 2 negative things about this Hotel. Firstly, I find that the staff manning the reception are not helpful or friendly. They have this "air of arrogance" in them and it seems that they only treat guests who can speak in Cantonese well. Their English is mediocre and they have a tendency to speak fast. They would not volunteer any information but rather acted very aloof. Secondly, the elevators in this Hotel seems to be specially made for a remote little village and not for a mega fast paced city like Hong Kong. The elevators take ages for any guests to ride. From the many reviews in Tripadvisor, I believed this is the main complaint. People in Hong Kong tends to walk fast, eat fast and talk super fast and yet this elevator is superbly slow..... P.S: For those who want to go to the airport or going to the Hotel from the airport, you can travel via the Airport Express. The costs is HK$90 per person. but if you buy the tickets in a group of 2 or more, then you'll save more than HK$20 per pax. From the airport, take the Airport Express and stop in Kowloon station. In Kowloon Station, there is free shuttle buses to major Hotels. To go to BP International, take bus no. K5. The last stop for K5 will be BP International.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a solid 3-star hotel with what should be considered bargain rates (given the location and the quality of room). We stayed in a harbour-parkview room, which had a surprisingly great view of the harbour and Hong Kong skyline with a direct wide-open view of the 2IFC (the tallest building in Hong Kong) and the rest of Central, although a couple of buildings did partially obstruct the view. I do believe we got extremetly lucky with the view, and I don't think that every harbour-parkview room would have the Hong Kong view comparable to ours. This is definitely a 3-star, not 4-star. The room is tiny and the bed was nothing more than just basic. The hallway was gloomy and the lobby was also rather basic and no-frills, with cramped check-in counter. But the check-in was very quick and smooth, and we had no complaints with the service here. And the important positive was that everything inside the room was pretty clean although basic. I especially thought the bathroom was spotlessly clean; very small but well-designed with a nice new sink and a powerful shower. The location is decent, though not the best. It's on the north side of Kowloon Park, and the closest metro (subway) stop is Jordan only about 5minutes away. If you were to walk to the main part of Harbour City shopping mall, the Star Ferry, and the harbourfront area of Tsim Sha Tsui, it would take a good 15-20 minutes. The area right near the hotel isn't all that interesting, although it is very close to Temple Street Night Market. I will say that Kowloon Park that the hotel sits right next to is very pleasant, with an aviary, well-groomed gardens and a flamingo pond all within the grounds. A stroll through this park is a nice way to get to Tsim Sha Tsui from the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who's budget-conscious but would still like to stay in a nice clean hotel with a decent Kowloon location and a possibility for a nice harbour view from the room.</p></li>
