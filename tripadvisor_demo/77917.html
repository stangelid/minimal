<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I stayed overnight during an overnight stop-over at LAX. It was very good with a spacious room and free breakfast. The trip to the terminal was very short. We stayed there again on the way home. The pool is also a nice distraction for the kids.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My nephew was married at the hotel, and the large majority of the guests stayed here - some of us, for the entire weekend. The staff was very friendly, the place very clean - rooms and common areas. They do a great deal for happy hour, and the food from the bar/restaurant is good.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This Embassy Suites property is one of the best! The location from LAX can't be beat. Its only about a 5 minute ride on the hotel shuttle to the terminals. The property is clean, most rooms have been renovated, and the staff are nice. Also, this property offers a few extra items at breakfast which I don't notice at other ES hotels. Managers reception is good and the fitness center has good equipment.</p></li>

A free shuttle to/from the airport rounds out the convenience offered. I would certainly choose this hotel again during a layover.</p></li>

It was no where near quiet, it directly faced the LAX runways. We expect some noise and with less than 5 hours a sleep, no time to change rooms or even properly get any sleep. Very disappointing service.</p></li>

A shuttle to/from LAX and the best free hotel breakfast I've had -- including made-to-order omelettes! We got a great 1-bedroom suite (I guess they're all suites here?) for under $100/night because of our CAA/AAA membership. The same room a couple nights later was over $200! Definitely worth it if you can get a reasonable rate. My new favourite hotel for LAX stopovers!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We ended up at this hotel after a disastrous experience at a Ramada near LAX. A gentleman at the front desk was not very welcoming but none the less, the hotel was beautiful, the pool was well kept, the rooms were clean, the continental breakfast was amazing, and the manager's reception was a nice treat. It was a very comfortable hotel. One downfall was that even though there was a business centre, there was only 2 computers and they were ALWAYS in use and they block you from checking sites such as facebook.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location in proximity to LAX is great. The hotel is nice for families because of the extra room. Beds were comfy and the breakfast buffet was included. Down side was the paper thin walls. Our "neighbors" came in at 3am and were really really loud. Front desk staff said they would handle it, which I'm sure they tried. But I have to say I didnt feel toooo bad being obnoxiously loud when I got up at 530am to leave for the airport. All of the staff were easy to deal with and I appreciated the laundry facility.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Rooms are spacious. The atrium is brilliant. Free breakfast is ample. The staff though are amazing. Very knowledgeable and keen to help. We did request a high room and got one on the top floor and on the airport side. We had a clear view of planes taking off and landing. We could hear some road and plane noise from here, but nothing that disturbed our stay. The only real negative was no free internet. You have to use one of 2 computers in the business lounge. Handy if you want to stay near LAX as the free shuttle comes regularly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a family of 6 we stayed here in April 2011. We overnighted here on the way to Mexico as it was close to the airport. Very tired and rundown hotel in desperate need of a makeover. We love Embassy Suites as they are usually relaxed and family friendly. My wife and I went down for the happy hour. The woman serving the drinks suggested that I was drinking too much after I order our 3rd round!?!? Cheeky and rude bugger! The area around the hotel was old and tired too. Closest shops are a 15minute walk away. Conventient to the airport and thats it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent a week here waiting for my niece to be born. The hotel is showing it's age a little, but everything was tidy and the staff were very nice, especially at the breakfast and cocktail receptions. We must have looked pathetic spending Christmas Eve in the hotel lobby, but everyone kept a smile on their faces and wished us a happy holiday. The omelets were a delicious departure from some other breakfast buffets I've been through. I would have appreciated free internet since they are an extended-stay property and my USB modem did not get a signal in our room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the hotel overnight on our way out of the country to Baja. Coming from the East Coast we arrived late morning and went directly to the hotel and were very pleased to be able to check in early -- before 1:00. We enjoyed a nice lunch in the Bistro, relaxed in our spacious suite, and worked on our computers (we had our own internet connection so didn't have to pay for hotel internet usage -- the only downfall we could find with the hotel). We were very pleased with the complimentary evening manager's reception and the delicious and vast offerings for breakfast.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The LAX Embassy Suites was a very accommodating hotel with nice amenities. The happy hour and breakfast are well appreciated. The rooms were nicely decorated and comfortable. This hotel does offer allergy-free rooms for slightly more. The only negative thing I can say about the stay was that you can hear a good deal of traffic that buzzes by on airport road. Bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper to drown out the traffic. The windows were not thick so I suspect that's where the noise came in (at least in Room 504). I was worried about hearing planes, but didn't hear any.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 nights and it was great value. The room rate includes a full breakfast, and the evening happy hour with drinks and snacks. The rooms were great, roomy and clean, and we loved the indoor pool and spa to relax before a long 13 hour flight home. The foyer of the hotel is very beautiful, and the layout of the hotel and the location of the restaurant is nice. We'd stay there again, and hope to on our next US holiday in 2012. It's close to the airport, but the hotel IS quiet, although we did wake during the night to a small earthquake - but that was a highlight.</p></li>

Had to pay for internet connection and parking. My room was on the 2nd floor on the Airporter Rd so the outside noise was present but didn't interfere with sleep. Liked the atrium set-up and the free hot breakfast was very good. Had a couple of drinks at the Manager's reception. Dinner food was fine. The LAX location was pleasant even though we had to go downtown. We walked down Century Blvd at night with its colorful lights and palm trees. There are some fast food places nearby.</p></li>

Extremely large and well appointed accomodations. Complimentary bottled water for frequent traveler guests. Small, but nice exercise room. No free internet here. The staff provided a box breakfast since I had an early morning flight and would miss the free buffet. Great happy hour at this hotel. Clean rooms. Free shuttle to airport running every 1/2 hour starting at 4 am. Super convenient and within walking distance of numerous rental car locations. Reasonable corporate rate. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We travelled with 3 children and grandparents. We booked two rooms and stayed for 2 nights. Although the hotel is dated it served our purpose, as a good hotel close to LAX, perfectly. The rooms are spacious and clean. The indoor pool was a hit with the kids and the nightly free drinks and snacks offered in the bar were very welcomed. We ate in the restaurant both evenings and enjoyed our meals and found the service very accommodating. We drove to Universal Studios and, with LA traffic, it took about an 1 hr each way. The free shuttle bus to the airport was very quick and allowed us to get to the airport hassle free.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For our last night in LA, after 5 first at the westin bonaventure(so, so...) and a night in Death valley, we choose the Embassy suite to be near airport and so to be "cool" the day of departure. The room(a corner suite) is very large and very well furnished. The traffic is high till 11 pm but after it's quite and the night has been good for the three of us. The complimentary breakfast offers a lot(even "Ã  la demande" omelette for those who want...). So an adress to highly recommand The diner at the restaurant(shrimp cocktail for 3,ravioli-steak and hot wings-chocolate mousse cake and creme brulee) was perfect. Erik</p></li>

Beautiful spacy room - the beds were just out of this world comfortable and wonderful pillows too! Enjoyed the managers reception too which was complimentary nibbles and drinks in the evening. The pool and spa and exercise areas were beautiful! They provide free internet and business facilities which was great. They held our luggage for us during the day too since we had a late flight out that night. Great service. Easy getting the free shuttle to and from airport - was perfect for us as a landing point to then continue our journey the next day.</p></li>

Not only were the rooms clean and spacious, the rate of $113 per night included free cocktails and breakfast the next morning. Every where I walked inside the hotel there were people cleaning and painting to keep the hotel in excellent condition. We were tired and the rate got us there, but I was truly suprised how nice the hotel was. Paid $300 plus many times at a beach hotel only to have a small room that is dirty. Congrats to this hotel, i will certainly stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here on June 7 after visiting with our daughter in LA and getting ready to fly to Hawaii the next morning. It was a good deal ($149 online) and is was a very large two room suite. Even though all of the rooms were centered around a middle courtyard, the bedroom was in the back and it was very quiet for sleeping. The omelet station for breakfast the next morning was great, the staff was polite and helpful, and there was a convenient shuttle every 15 or 20 minutes to get us to LAX. One of the better hotel deals around as far as I am concerned. I would definitely stay there again, especially if I needed to be close to the airport.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 1 night (before our flight home). Our room was clean and not worn out at all; almost modern I'd say. I say almost modern because apart from our room the hotel itself is a bit dated as is the exterior (but all the hotels in the area are). For a hotel stay it's great and adaquate for a family that needs extra space. And with the made to order breakfast and managers reception it's what you expect from an Embassy Suites. Judging it for it's location it's a great suite option and a good value. I will stay here again if I need to be right by the airport. The shuttle was great and got all 6 of us to the airport in lightning speed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What great value for money. The suite is huge and very comfortable. Bedding was excellent including the sofa bed. Breakfast was one of the best we have had in the terms of quality, not selection(only basic, but very tasty). The service was fast and efficient. Check in at noon and we were given a room, no waiting. The shuttle was quick and reliable. Great location to airport and even tourist attractions. After checking in we walked up the road(2 minutes) to Avis and collected our car. Budget is right next door to the hotel. There is a $9.90 fee for the internet. I could not fault this hotel in any way, and will certainly return in the future</p></li>

If we need a LAX hotel again we would use this one. One note of caution - the shuttle to the airport goes every 15 minutes. It took us another 25 minutes to get to our terminal (United). The front desk the morning before quoted us about 10 minutes. Be careful - leave yourself enough time. We had plenty spare and were travelling very early so avoided the worst of the traffic but be careful!</p></li>

Breakfast was a huge hit with cooked to order omelettes and all the usual breakfast buffet options (in fact this was the best complimentary breakfast we had on a 3 week US trip). Their onsite restaurant was also very nice. Carls Jr is also a short walk away which our son just loved! If I was wanting to explore LA I would stay somewhere closer to all the action but for a fabulously convenient airport hotel I wouldn't stay anywhere else but Embassy Suites and will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great choice for a short stay if you are flying in or out of LAX. Rooms are fairly spacious, King bed is very soft and comfortable with the pillowtop. The hotel is SURPRISINGLY quiet considering I was on 2nd floor with cars, trucks and buses rumbling by right outside, not to mention planes taking off and coming in on final approach. Once the sliding door to the very small terrace was closed, I didn't hear a thing. Free drinks nightly for everyone at the manager's reception with some light snacks as well. Breakfast was fast and good. Shuttle bus to the airport (3-4 minute ride) runs every 15 mniutes. I paid $199 after booking at the last minute. I would recommend this hotel and will stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What I found fascinating is that the building is something you don't see too often, a marvel. I am assuming the building was built a few decades ago, but its large open air atrium is something of a rarity in most cities. Certainly, proximiity to the LAX airport is reason for building such a monster (in a goodway) building. The restaurant had a very nice selection, although they ran out of their nightly special (NY Strip). It was fine, as I didn't have dinner until 10 pm. I wish I took some photos of the building, but you will have to view the other users. They have koi ponds, ducks in a portion of the building. Very nice place, and the rooms are very large. I mean, my room was basic, and it came with a wet bar.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stated here for a quick overnight trip to LA. Found the property to be very clean & what you'd expect for an Embassy Suites property. Our room was recently refurbished with contemporary decor which was very attractive. My only gripe was that the walls, both interior & exterior, seemed to be made of paper, hence the overall rating of "3.". We were on the fifth floor & could hear every bit of traffic...thank goodness we were in the back of the building! I can't imagine being in a room that was facing onto Century Blvd/the airport! At 4 a.m. I was awakened by my next door neighbor's wake up call. All in all, I would probably stay here again, however, the Embassy Suites in nearby El Segundo (also near the airport) is quieter.</p></li>

There were a catalogue of problems; The first room that we had was facing the main road and was very noisy, far too noisy to sleep in, we were then moved to another room and this was not suitable as all the rooms on one side of the hotel get noise from either the cooling tower or the kitchen. We were finally given a room that was not noisy, but in the process of finding this room we were shown a room with guests already in bed! We were compensated with $100 food voucher, unfortunately the food was deep fried and inedible. This is not what we have come to expect from a Hilton family hotel, if possible stay at a different hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall I find the Embassy Suites North very nice and very comfortable. The evening manager's get together is nice and the breakfast is excellent, if your flight is not at 7 AM or earlier. With high security at the airport most guest have to be at the airport at least 2 hours early so most guest cannot use the free breakfast service, although the coffee, fruit, juice, and pastries become available around 5:30 AM. The only disappointment is they charge for hgh speed internet when surrounding hotels supply high speed internet access for free. I just pull up to the window and use my wireless to access the Four Points Sheraton accross the street. There is also free free Wi-Fi in the area around the hotel so why do they charge their guests?</p></li>

Aftering making it through the maze of LAX, we got our hotel shuttle bus which went about 150 yards and died. Another bus showed up in about 15 minutes, and we were away to the hotel. Upon our arrival, the desk clerk automatically gave us 15% off from either the restaurant or room service because of the shuttle problem. The room was nice and quiet and the room service wa prompt. The breakfast the next day was fine, but I have eaten at other Embassy Suites where there was much more "creativity" in their breakfast meals. The shuttle back to the airport was running behind schedule in the morning, so I am glad that we left earlier than planned.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I selected this hotel because it is right next door to Budget car rental which allowed me to return my rental and walk next door then take the hotel shuttle to the airport the following morning. It's a nice clean hotel with big rooms. They offer a nightly managers reception with snacks and cocktails and they have a restaurant on site. I had dinner there and while it's not the largest selection the food was good...service was a little slow. My only minor complaint is that you hear a lot of street noise when in the bedroom. I had a 6 am flight so I went to bed pretty early and was awaken several times by buses, sirens...etc but I would assume its the same for all hotels in this area. You do have to pay for parking which I'm not a fan of at any hotel but I would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice clean hotel with lots of facilities included in the price .Big screen TV's, microwave, fridge, pool, fitness room, business centre with free boarding card printing, free breakfast and a manager's cocktail reception. Not eactly luxurious, but spacious well equipped suites and welcoming, friendly staff. There is a 24 hour store accross the street and a few fast food options close by. Admittedly there is airport noise but not excessive. Reliable frequent airport shuttle free of charge. I would stay here again. I wish we had value this good in rip off Britain! My only gripe was no in room safe and no deposit boxes were available at the Front Desk. For an airport hotel, I find this surprising and I would have felt more at ease had there had been a safe, even it cost to use it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">-Better than continental breakfast: had eggs, bacon, and pancakes available (come before 15 minutes of closing.) -Large suites; nice appointments. -Responsive staff. -Frequent shuttle to airport. (every fifteen minutes.) -You could walk to airport, if you wanted. -We stayed here our last night in LA, dropped off rental car night before, and walked the few blocks (under 5) back from Avis. They would have picked us up via shuttle if we called and waited 15 minutes or less. -Nice enough pool; gives you something to do while waiting for afternoon flight. -They let us check out an hour later; very convenient. -Nice looking atrium. Loud enough AC, while it lets you sleep you yet can't hear nearby airport noise or atrium noise. -While everything quite clean, sink and its cabinetry a little worn.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I and 35 others had the pleasure of staying at Embassy Suites North LAX in LA. This hotel was perfect for our group as we were overnighting on our way to Fiji. The hotel served up a great hot to order breakfast, helped us get on the trolley to Manhattan Beach and even stored our luggage for the day as we had a late flight out. Kelly the sales manager was excellent to work with making sure all our requests were met. When we came back from Fiji we overnighted again in LA. This was a nice break from such a long flight. The hotel checked us in earlier, offered us free snacks and beverages in the evening and even prepared a box breakfast for those leaving early in the morning prior to breakfast. If you are looking for a stop over hotel at LAX look no further Embassy Suites was perfect.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had to make an emergency trip to L.A. - my first time traveling to California. I have to say that the hotel staff treated me very well especially after factoring in my appearance. I was allowed to check in very early after making last minute reservations - at 6:30 a.m. - and I was not charged extra to do so. When asked, the desk clerk gave me free toothpaste and detergent to wash my clothes. The living room, bedroom and bath are all very large and spacious. The room included a working refrigerator and microwave which I appreciated. The hotel lobby is open and inviting with lots of seating. The only downsides are the in-suite internet charge and parking fee. My stay was only for one night and even though I didn't spend much time in the hotel, I would stay there again if I ever return to Los Angeles.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel after a cruise. The hotel is situated 2 short blocks from Avis car rental drop off, and is a 5 minute shuttle to the LAX Terminal. When we arrived, we enjoyed a managers reception with complimentary cocktails and snacks, the rooms are 2 room suites, each room containing 40 flat screen TV's. In the morning there is a complimentary breakfast, omlettes made to order, the staff was friendly and very efficient and the shuttle runs to the airport every few minutes. Our airline made a sudden change to our itinerary at another terminal location and the shuttle driver waited for almost 10 minutes while we got things sorted out. Room service was very good and inexpensive. I would highly recommend this property. Our stay for all the above was less that $125.00 CDN. (plus well deserved tips..of course)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Embassy Suites on 2 separate nights when we were in transit from LA airport with 3 young children. There is a shuttle to and from the airport. The rooms are very adequate - we had 2 Queen size beds and a fold out couch in the living room. The beds are extremely comfortable, the room was quiet and the curtains blacked out the room very well - all the important things you need when in transit. We had a nice dinner meal in the hotel restaurant (with a children's menu) and a good buffet breakfast that is included in the nightly rate. Our children spent a very enjoyable few hours in the pool. The front desk staff were extremely helpful. We appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities. The only minor criticism I had is that the shampoo, body lotions etc smelled awful. On the whole though, we had a nice stay that was particularly good value for money</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in this hotel based on an 18 hour journey from Ireland to LA, great idea just to get your head down with the kids after the trip. I would agree with a previous reviewer whereby it a nondescript both externally and internally. The Check in was fine, fast and the booking was as booked. As with any Embassy Suites they were big enough with all the normal things like TVâ€™s and microwave etc. Breakfast was included in room price and a very good selection of fresh fruit at buffet and cooked foods as normal, the kids got a great kick out of the staff and the attitude which was excellent to our young travellers. My only grip really was around the BAR, they were very attentive but they charged me $5 for a cup of Hot Water, I would guess the facility is outsourced but hey the charge was a bit of a rip off. Overall it was a good basic hotel and well worth the rate for LAX.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and two teen age daughters stayed here for two nights while visiting Loyola Marymount University. We had two queen beds and a double fold out. The suite contained three sinks, a microwave, and refrigerator. The wifi internet worked very well, but there was a charge for 24 hours of about $5. The three rooms including bath, were large but somewhat dark. The bedroom had a sliding glass door which could be fully opened if you wanted to listen to the airport which was just a couple blocks away. We all enjoyed the free cooked to order breakfasts and the manager reception each evening, where they would provide free cocktail, nachos and popcorn. The place was clean and pleasant. The indoor pool looked like it would be a lot of fun for parents with younger children. If you are visiting Loyola, tell them and they will give you a promo code which will save you a few buck.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here after flying in late from the UK prior to driving down to Vegas. I'm not a huge fan of airport hotels full stop but after doing my research on Trip Advisor this appeared to be the best one in terms of reviews. The room was large and mainly clean (sofa felt a little grotty), and the bathroom was fine although it's a while since we had a bath and shower combo! Good power in the shower though to wash away the flight! The bed was comfortable and appeared clean although the pillows seemed to have a funky smell, not dirty, just sort of musty. We got a package whereby we parked for free and that saved over $20 and got a good rate as well. Room Service was fast, reasonable and the staff was pleasant. Basically this hotel does what it says on the tin. It's not the Four Seasons but it doesn't pretend to be and we had no cause for complaint, you get what you pay for basically.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Embassy Suites was beyond my expectations given that it's so close to the airport and is so reasonably priced compared to airport/city hotels in Australia. It has a huge atrium with water features and feels spacious. Good food in the restaurant/cafe/bar. Good service. Perfect for a one-night stopover between Sydney and elsewhere in the US without breaking the bank. The rooms are very generous - my room had a King bed and lounge/sitting room. The bed had a luxurious pillowtop mattress. I'm a light sleeper, have a hip injury and have trouble sleeping. My room was very quiet and I slept well. My room faced Airport Boulevard. I didn't hear any noise from other rooms but I'm not sure if the rooms either side were occupied. Breakfast is included. Free airport shuttle. Very close to airport without being right under a flight path. I'll definitely be staying there again on the homeward journey!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here one night in July 2011 for business. The previous night, I had spent the night at the Embassy Suites in Downey, CA, so i was able to do a direct comparision. The Embassy Suites at LAX was over $200/night compared to $180 at the Downey location, and the rooms at LAX were less updated, especially the bathroom. The window had this weird film over it so that you couldn't see outside. I kind of felt like a prisoner in my own room. It looked like a sliding door, so I tried to open it and it triggered some alarm. So, needless to say, there wasn't much of a view. The inside of the hotel was nice, lots of plants everywhere, and there was a convenient shuttle to the airport, only about a 5 minutes ride. The room served it's purpose by giving me a place to sleep, but I found the room to be overpriced, and if i was traveling on vacation rather thatn busienss, i probably wouldn't choose this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 nights at the end of a 3 month Mexico, Cuba, California trip. As a family of 5 this was fantastic value. The 2 room suites are very spacious (even larger than the Embassy Suites El Segundo which weren't bad). The lounge dining area was big enough for a family of 5 to spread out in (we constantly found it difficult to book 5 in a room at most hotels so the 2 room suite represented excellent value). The room rate included the cooked breakfast plus in the evenings they have a Managers happy hour 5.30 to 7.30 which is complimentary wine, beer and spirits, drinks for the kids as well as snacks - pop corn, corn chips etc. When you're traveling as a family these extras are gold! The amenities are good - pool, spa and gym and the location for us was great as we were just relaxing waiting for our flight home. The staff were very friendly and the restaurant and room service was actually pretty good and well priced.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This past weekend we stayed at Embassy Suites. I have decided due to the amount of other hotels in the area we won't be returning. The hotel has good points- the two rooms and it ends at about that. This is the second time staying here that an elevator quit working-even if they are all working they are the slowest in town. The keys did not work twice to our rooms and no they were not next to cell phones or credit cards. The food area is a disaster-kind of dirty and really unorganized. The lighting in the bathroom (generally the whole room) is so bad you have to sit next to a floor length mirror in the bedroom to apply makeup. We were also put on the second floor which is very loud beginning at 6 in the am. We thought we would give this hotel another chance but not again. It needs some major overhauling and in general clean up of the entire hotel. Parking is very expensive as well and come on people shouldn't there be free wireless?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Conveniently located about halfway down Century City on a sidestreet called Airport Way. Check-in was prompt and friendly, with what was new to me, complimentary beer and wine. The kids were refreshed with all they can drink soda, along with nachos and a few other finger snacks. The room was a two room suite (bedroom, living room) with a complimentary newspaper at the door in the morning. In the morning, a terrific, made to order omelet and hashbrowns along with several other breakfast goodies were again complimentary. We chose Embassy Suites because we needed the park, stay, and fly package. Our car stayed secure in thier underground garage for the week while we were gone on holiday.(parking included) The price was right in the middle of the competition, and now that I know I and my family can get some food and drink in makes it that much more of a value. The shuttle service to the airport runs promptly ever 20 minutes, around the clock.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I were looking for a hotel to stay at prior to our 15 hour flight back to Australia and the Embassy Suites had received some good reviews on trip advisor so I went ahead and prepaid via the net a few weeks in advance. The hotel rooms are very spacious and clean. A free breakfast (huge selection) was included and there were free drinks during happy hour (5.30pm to 7.30pm) where they served drinks and snacks. The location is very convenient for a number of reasons ie: I dropped my hire car at Avis and walked back to the room; We caught a bus (Big Blue) to Santa Monica for a day trip; The hotel has an airport shuttle that took us to our terminal when we were leaving. I booked for 2 nights but checked out at 8pm on night 2 because we were flying back home. This gave us the advantage of having a room to relax in, shower and leave our luggage prior to the flight. Outstanding staff and amenities make this hotel a definite choice when I come back to LA.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Two in our group of three had early flights so we stayed at this hotel the last night of our LA trip. It worked out great that we had a two room suite and the two with the early flight could get up, shower and dress without waking the third in our group (me) who was sleeping on the living room sofa bed. The hotel has a really good hot breakfast buffet that is included in the room price. If you have an early flight before the buffet starts, you can request a breakfast to go the night before- but you have to ask for the breakfast- one hotel clerk knew nothing about it. The "togo" breakfast was fruit, a muffin and granola bar.There is a free hourly trolley shuttle one block away that I took to Manhattan beach- it is about a 20 min ride. I also saw that there is a public bus near the hotel that goes to Santa Monica but I did not take that bus. When I came back from Manhattan beach, I grabbed my bags and took the hotel's free shuttle to the airport (about a 5 minute ride and the shuttle leaves every 15 mins).</p></li>

The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. We had no problem with airplane noise. The front desk staff are very helpful. Actually everyone, from the cleaners to the breakfast buffet staff were pleasant. The breakfast and coffee were delicious. The free transportaion from the airport is good and we were picked up at 5:30 AM for our return flight with no issues. The Hotel is due for an upgrade, so that will make it even better! My issue was not with the Hotel, but with taking advantage of the Hotel online prepaid booking and "thinking" that this was a good deal..Ha.. once I paid in full the rates DROPPED the next week.. I had paid in full already so too bad for me! I will not do that again. If you pay in FULL and the rate drops you should be able to take advantage of it. Next time I will just hold the reservation (at the published rate) and pay once I arrive. If the rate drops after I hold it, I can just change it.</p></li>

The late check-in went flawlessly, the parking garage was ample with covered parking and in/out access. The location was close to the airport, but I didnt hear not one plane while resting/sleeping. Let me tell when they say cook to order breakfast....it IS cook to order!! I mean, u have so many choices!!! Omlettes, pancakes, waffles, french toast, fruits, muffins, sausages, bacon, oatmeal, .,..you get the idea!!! The reception in the evening is also nice...they provide chips, dips and a free, (2 drink maximum) bar! The pool area is inside with a hot tub and the fitness room looks nice. I didnt go in there because I was 2 busy eating!!! LOL...I will definitely make this my hotel upon returning! We had one altercation when our room did not get cleaned during one day, but the management gave us a good bit off of our bill and had housekeeping clean as quick and efficient as they could...so, no one is perfect, but at least the management is on top of things to make it right!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family had a very good experience at the Embassy Suites LAX North. It had everything we were looking for: an indoor pool, complimentary breakfast, large suites, a shuttle to LAX and was near the car rental companies. I also requested and received WIFI as part of my rate b/c many other hotels at LAX inc. free WIFI. The hotel has 8 floors and all the rooms are situated around the huge Atrium (see pic). On the main floor of the atrium is where they host Happy Hour and breakfast so every sound carries up to the rooms. However, you would only hear that if you were sleeping on the sofa bed (luckily, my daughter is a heavy sleeper). The king beds have a door to the room so we slept very comfortably. The suites are all renovated, spacious and gorgeous.The bathroom was heavenly. The one annoyance I have with all the hotels (not just this one) is that when I book a room for 3 ppl and that is clearly stated on the reservation, the room only has 2 towels or 2 pillows. This was the case at Embassy also where there were no blankets or pillows for the sofa bed.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">While this Embassy Suites was ok, it was not as nice as other Embassy Suites I have stayed in. The suite was a nice size for our family of 5, but the upholstered furniture was starting to show wear and tear and the bathroom was a little dirty. Nothing horrible, but nothing fabulous either. Internet was not free, but we could use the business center. Breakfast was great and had a made-to-order omelet section, fresh fruit, pastries, etc. Our biggest disappointment was with parking. We checked in very late and were told that the parking attached to the building may be full and we might have to park in a nearby lot. Indeed, there was no parking available, so we had to use the nearby lot. We were given a pass for it, but there was no map or clear directions to the lot. After finding it, we were confused on our directions back to the hotel and began walking the wrong way, not something you want to do at 1:00 a.m. in an area you aren't familiar with. Parking was $20, which was acceptable if it was available in the hotel but not when we had to walk to another lot.</p></li>

Pros- The shuttle was prompt picking us up at the airport. Check-In was fast and courteous The hotel lobby and exterior is very inviting and clean Indoor pool looked very nice Room, although dated, was spacious and offered several amenities(Room 509) Room service was prompt and reasonably priced Breakfast was sufficient in the morning with made to order eggs. The front desk was very helpful when we picked up our Rental Car and need to park for a little while before checking out. The Budget Rental Car is directly across the street from the hotel Cons The room was clean but dated. I don't know if other rooms have been updated. There was an extreme amount of noise coming in from the street. I am actually hearing impaired but the amount of traffic noise and airplane noise made it difficult to sleep soundly. We liked the Embassy Suites but the dated rooms and the noise level that we experienced would make me shop around next time before booking here again.

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great base for 3 days near airport after long transatlantic flight. Free shuttle arrived fairly quickly and short trip to hotel. Initial reception a little frosty but after this all staff were helpful and cheerful even phoning local garage for us to see if they sold mobile topup cards. Area feels safe but being near the airport there isn't much local (apart from other hotels.) Big clean rooms, comfy beds. No problems with plane or traffic noise. Little kitchenette with fridge, microwave, coffee maker. Made use of pool and spa every day. Free business centre provides Internet access if you don't want to pay for wi-fi. Breakfast and managers reception both add to the value of this hotel. Parking available just behind hotel for about $12 per day if you need it. Good bus service up and down the coast from just outside the hotel allowed car free first few days. Only downside we didn't get the promised in-room safe although we were in a refurbished room (very nice too) which should have had one. Apparently their builders let them down! Great start to a 3 week tour of the SouthWest (stupendous scenery) will certainly use again if in LA.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I wish I had seen the review regarding parking being a potential issue for some travelers. If I had been informed by the hotel website when I booked that they had limited parking in their single floor parking garage and used another garage on the same block for "overflow" parking, I would not have booked here. As it turned out I lost time looking for a space in the hotel garage before being directed to the overflow garage. Unfortunately the overflow garage was fenced in. This made it difficult to find an exit for my young children (4 and 6 year-old) and me to walk through with our luggage. We then had to walk through a poorly lit alley behind the hotel to reach the front lobby. I would not have agreed to this for my family if I had known ahead of time. I did not feel safe. It would not have been as much of an issue for me as a single person. Although I received "complimentary" parking, a member of management was not on site to provide me with any further compensation. Overall, we lost an hour of time searching the original garage, finding the overflow garage, finding our way out of the overflow garage, and getting to the lobby to finally check-in! Unacceptable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent several hours on Trip Advisor trying to find a hotel near the Airport and chose this Embassy Suites for location, free shuttle, proximity to our rental car pick-up, price and the breakfast. We arrived late and by the time we cleared LAX it was 1 a.m. The shuttle was prompt and the driver insisted on helping with our suitcases. At the hotel, our first room had an electrical problem, there were no lights working in the room. The desk clerk could not have been more apologetic but I had read about the ongoing renovations and it was not an inconvenience to have to change rooms. The second room I thought was even nicer and had been fully renovated. The king bed was very comfortable, with lots of pillows, and we slept well. No noise problem but we were on the side of the hotel, away from the Airport. The breakfast the next morning was a nice surprise: a lot of variety and lots of fresh fruit. The only little thing was the surcharge for WiFi access. In this day and age it would go a long way to include it in the room price. It is like being charged for the use of cable t.v. Otherwise all was good and for airport accommodations this was a good choice for our one night stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed here twice - January and February. The rooms at this Embassy Suites were very nice. They are much larger than I expected. I've stayed in both the King Size and Two Queen bed rooms. Setup is almost the same in each room. Lots of mirrors in each room, which was very important for 4 women sharing. Nice dining area, refridgerator, microwave and coffee maker. 27 Inch TV provided in living room area and bedroom. The bathrooms are nice and big! They have an indoor pool and small business room They should put a time limit on the use of their two computers. Small, but nice exercise room. They have a convenient store to buy water, sodas, ice cream and traveling essentuals. They have a great Happy Hour! They also have an onsite restaurant and their complimentary breakfast buffet is just wonderful. Their front desk personnel could take a class on how to smile and how to handle guests in a pleasant manner. Their other staff is just wonderful and very helpful and friendly. Can't say enough about them. Parking is a bit tight, but they make it work. For being so close to LAX, it is amazingly quiet. Overall, very comfortable and very reasonable in price. I will stay here again in a heartbeat.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice hotel but VERY noisy”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed for one night one a layover at the hotel. Front desk was very nice and my son and I enjoyed the managers reception. When I checked in, you are made to sign a paper stating that you will not hold any parties in your room. Not a problem, I'm with my 5 year old son! When we returned from the manangers reception, the noise next door started. Loud music, people screaming and lauging. WHen I walked by the room to get ice, their door was propped open, they had streamers hanging from the walls and at least 10 people in there. Sounds like a party to me. Around 9pm I called to complain about the noise. Followed up with a second phone call around 11. Was told there was a wedding going on and that was probably the noise. She asked if I wanted to change rooms. Seriously? I have to move and there is a party going on next door? My mother arrived from her flight and slept in the bedroom area while I slept in the quieter area of the living room with my son. My mother had to put up with the noise until the wee hours of the morning. I guess you need to call more than two times to get something done. If you are looking for quiet, do not stay there on a weekend night when they have an event. I didn't have a chance to eat the breakfast in the morning, but it did look nice.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Hotel, but design carries the sound”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent one night here after a late flight in from the East coast. First the positives. 1. Great LAX shuttle! We were a party of 8. The first shuttle was too full for us, we turned around and a second empty shuttle was right behind. Quick and easy. 2. Check in, plesant and efficient. We were in our rooms in no time. 3. Big room. The "Master" suite is a separate room with lots of space. 4. GREAT Free breakfast. Lots of verity, omelet station. 5. Next door to budget rent a car. We didn't know this and were pleasantly surprised to be able to walk across the street to pick up our rental in the morning. Negatives, 1. The design is one of those open atrium in the middle, sound travels up, models. Lovely to look at but someone was having a party in the lobby which carried up to the kids trying to sleep in the pull out couch in the living room. Us, parents in the bedroom got a great nights sleep behind heavy bedroom doors. 2. There were a bunch of pretzel crumbs in the pull out couch when we pulled it out. Weird...and annoying. 3. Elevators were s-l-o-w. But I think there may have been fellow young guests causing breakdowns the same day. I'd lean more towards a 4.5, over a 4. All in all a great nights stay, if we were sticking around town longer I would have been happy to stay longer.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good decent hotel, but watch out for room 816 (only a 1/2 room??)”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose to stay down by LAX to avoid a long drive early in the morning for a 6am flight. Based on reviews and proximity we chose this hotel. Everything was actually pretty OK if not good; nice comfortable bed, pretty lobby, and a nice touch offering muffins, coffee and fruit even before the official breakfast was ready (we left the hotel at 4am for our flight, and the included breakfast doesn't start until 6am). We ate at the lobby restaurant, and that was pretty average. My complaint is the actual room we got. When I booked a room the description said a "king suite, non-smoking room." When we checked in we had a choice of a smoking king suite room, or a non-smoking "not quite a suite" room. We took the latter, and our non-suite room was more like a standard small hotel room with a long hallway leading to the room. This was clearly an "afterthought" room (as in, how can we squeeze one more room on the floor.) We were adjacent to a facility room (which probably is why our room was smaller.) There was a bracket on the wall where a hairdryer SHOULD be, and coffee packets and such where I assume a coffee maker SHOULD be? I really didn't mind the room, but I did mind paying the same amount that I should have paid for a regular "suite" room. Like I said, the rest of the hotel was fine, and the bed was comfy. I just felt a little slighted on paying full price for that particular room.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had previously stayed at another hotel close to LAX when arriving and leaving the US, but as I am very fond of Embassy Suites, and as it was a little cheaper (including breakfast), we changed to the Embassy Suites Los Angeles International Airport North for this trip. We weren't disappointed. Great service from all staff, comfortable room, delicious breakfast, good shuttle service and the option to have a later check out (for a reasonable price) all made this the perfect option for an overnight stay. We were very impressed. The surrounding area is nothing flash, but this isn't really the location you would stay at for people wanting to have a vacation in Los Angeles. You could do that, but the main attraction for staying is the proximity and convenience to LAX. We were very impressed with the level of service, and the warmth and friendliness of the staff. We stayed on both the 10th and 28th August, and will definitely be staying again on future trips to the US--without hesitation. One little added bonus is that there is a Burger King just a few minutes walk down the road. Nice and simple for an overnight stay between flights. There is also a little kiosk near the front desk of the hotel, where snacks and other items can be purchased. But, of course, there is also the complementary Manager's reception every evening and delicious breakfast every morning. So many good reasons to stay at this particular hotel before heading off for the rest of your trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I checked in with several bags on the trolley, was provided my two rooms, and was assured they were connecting. Took the elevator up to the sixth floor or so with the bags, opened the door to one of the rooms....and discovered they were not connecting! Shortly after this discovery, the young man who had checked me in entered the room, I figured he was going to move me to connectors. Actually, he was there to see if I was finished with the trolley, as they were in short supply. I informed him of the connector problem, and he informed me he could get me a connector, but one of the rooms would be much smaller; he then showed me this configuration. I said I'd meet him at the front desk to change. I hauled all the bags back down to the front desk, where another couple was not happy about the lack of baggage trolleys. They had had enough, and decided to cancel. I decided on a third room configuration for my gang, which I was assured had connectors. We made the arrangements, and I hauled the bags up to a high floor again. I got to the rooms, and they were not connecting! I, as well, had had enough, and cancelled and moved to another hotel, just around the corner, where the experience was much different, and service and accomodations were exceptional. From my very brief experience at this Embassy Suites, it appears that they may be understaffed. The rooms and the property are IMHO tired and not fresh and bright. I would not consider this property again unless the property underwent a significant upgrade, and we are fairly frequent Hilton guests.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My parents celebrated their 50th year of marriage during the month of June. We searched for hotels, restaurants and halls that would meet our criteria. Obviously this was a momentous occassion and we wanted it to be special. Our main concern was that the venue & the people working their would support our enthusiasm. We were so pleased to be able to work with someone like Katherine Ko who is in charge of catering. She is a YES person. She didn't give away the farm but anything we asked she made every effort to make it happen and didn't show any signs of being put upon. That is so rare in todays business environment when many act as if they are doing you a favor when you are spending your hard earned money at their venue. Believe me, we had other choices but her favorable business attitude is what won us over. Our event is still spoken of several months later by the 200 guests that attended. Katherine (and apparently her staff) made sure our ball room was decorated beautifully, they were flexible in terms of the time that the food was served, she offered great advice... I could go on and on. We had a "free" nights stay with our event and the next morning as a guest of the hotel you are welcome to the "free" breakfast buffet which was vast & tasty. The chef who made the omelets was also nice to work with. I forget his name but I think it had a latin flavor, he is tall and bald. The atrium is quite lovely with its watefalls/greenery and offers an inviting social setting. Again, the most important part to us is that they were accommadating. Therefore I will be referring business to Embassy Suites LAX North and I will suggest that they ask for Katherine Ko or someone with her business sense and spirit.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed at Embassy Suites LAX North and we really enjoyed our visit. As we were going out the next day to australia we were able to get a real nice rate on a half day rate.. untl 600 pm and this helped because if we had to wait in the lax airport for our 8 pm flight we would have killed eachother. Waiting at LAX for an outgoing flight is analogous to having dental work done without an anesthetic. The suite was spacious, clean and the staff were helpful and thoughtful. Breakfast was great.. .

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">MERITS: Reviews of this hotel seemed mostly positive on TripAdvisor and was one of the reasons why I chose to stay at this hotel. Rooms are large and updated. Rate I paid was very reasonable by LAX Airport standards. Check-in was quick, friendly and efficient. Breakfast was complimentary and had 2-3 hot items to go along with the basic cold breakfast items. SMALL CONS: Room smelled somewhat strange...almost like a brand new room smell? Coffee maker didn't work but someone came to fix it within 20 minutes. The vent in the ceiling right before you enter the bedroom was coming off and could possibly fall on a person's head if not screwed in eventually. Hairdryer did not work but I didn't complain to the front desk since I didn't really need it. The lamp light by the bed worked, but the outlet right beneath the bed did not work when I went to plug my phone charger...also didn't complain about this since there were plenty of other outlets in the room. BIG CON: At breakfast time, the guy cooking the omelets put two $1 bills on the counter so guest would assume that a tip was necessary. I saw at least 3 other guests put $1 bills on the counter and it looked rather tacky with all these $1 bills spread all over the place. Normally, you should put a tip jar or a tip plate on the side of the counter, but this guy placed the two $1 bills right smack in the middle of the front counter. I don't have a problem tipping (I tipped the HK before I checked out), but his procedure was rather unnecessary and kind of put me off. Makes you wonder whether a guest is suppose to pay or what happens if you don't tip considering the breakfast is complimentary? Perhaps management might want to research this matter because at the other 3 to 3 1/2 star hotels I stay at, they don't allow employees to do this because again, it's rather tacky..</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just returned from a week long LA stay , what can I say about this location- its a great value. From the wonderful complimentary breakfast, amazing fresh omelettes to the manager's reception in the evenings - popcorn and beverages. I treated myself to one too many complimentary amaretto sours! I would like to compliment the latin gentlemen who made the omlettes 3/13-3/15 we were there at 6am and he was such a delight. I am truely sorry that I didn't get his name!!! Lourdes, a member of the front desk team provided excellent service. Slight disclaimer: I've lived in LA before so I do want to warn "travelers of color" that the latin staff is not equally welcoming to travelers of "color" in all instanves. we did have some servive issue with the front desk team and the make bartender- was unpleasant. During the manager's reception the male bartender carded only black guests and almost started something. On the opposite end of the spectrum was Eva the female bartender who carded every one equally, was a pleasure to see and friendly. The Suites are spacious, equipped with 2 flat screens, a budget car rental is right next door and remember this is a Hilton Hotel so use your Hilton honors membership for upgrades! There is a busness center but room wifi is not complimentary and is slow. There is also a spa pool, fitness center and regular pool- all in good condition. Aero is on the onsite restaurant and vab services is accessible. There is a liquore store around the corner ( within walking distance) and a weird homeless woman who has taken up residence near it (its right outside the main entrance on the side street) but that was the only oddity. A free shuttle service is offered to LAX and if you vall they will pick you up. Excellent value for the area!!! This hotel has the classic embassy Suites design and despite the minor service issues we will be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am a very understanding, easy going traveler but had to write this immediately to warn others. I have been booking hotel rooms for over twenty-five years and have never ran into the issue I had with Embassy Suites LAX North. I booked a room on May 18th for a stay on July 31st. I reserved an e-mail confirmation that my Room type was Non-Smoking Confirmed King bed with a preference for Non-Smoking two beds. The day before our stay I phoned the hotel because I saw on line that rooms with two queen beds were available. I was told by the person that I spoke to in reservations that I was changed to two queen beds Non-Smoking and was sent a new e-mail confirmation with the same confirmation number. Meaning the non-smoking confirmed was still part of the reservation. Upon arrival at the hotel I checked in and when we went to our assigned room found out it was a smoking king room. I spoke to the gentleman at the front desk about this and showed him my e-mail confirmation. He pointed out on the e-mail a sentence that read the following. Your room type preferences have been submitted with your reservation and are subject to hotel availability. He was very professional and gave me a discount on my room. I did not have a problem with the king bed since that is what I had originally booked. But I had a non smoking confirmed room according to my e-mail. In my dictionary the word confirmed means not subject to change. Obviously whoever oversees the running of this hotel does not know the meaning of the word or what is typed in the e-mails that are sent. In addition to being assigned a smoking room, the sleeper sofa frame was broken and the mattress partially fell through making it feel like you were camping on a hill. I have stayed at other Embassy Suites and Hilton Hotels but I can guarantee you I will never stay at one again! I specially read trip adviser for comments and wanted to make others aware. Avoid this hotel!</p></li>
