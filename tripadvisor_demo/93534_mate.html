<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent Hotel Don't let the small informal lobby confuse you. The rooms are very spacious for New York City, and very well decorated with dark wood and a nice mini-bar. The bed was comfortable, and the location of the hotel cannot be beat if you want to be in the middle of Times Square.</p></li>

The staff is very friendly and the rooms are spacious in comparison to most NYC rooms. Even though you are in the center of Times Square activities, it was not too noisy to sleep.</p></li>

New York is totally amazing and i would recommend the helicopter flight and the night bus tour.</p></li>

The rooms were spacious and the staff was unbelievably courteous. The concierge was a huge help for people who have never been in NYC. Most polite and he even got us the connection for David Letterman tickets. I don't know if there is a better location or a better hotel in NYC!!!</p></li>

We had a king size room on the 8th floor. The room was very clean and comfortable and we had a great view from the window. The staff were helpful and friendly throughout our stay. We did not eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the standard of food there. Loved this hotel and am planning to go back next year.</p></li>

We had a wonderful stay and the people were very nice. Omar the concierge was very helpful. This was our first visit to NYC and it was worth the wait. The room was nice but I have stayed in better, but we were not in the room much.. I would recommend this for location as well, we were in walking distance of most things and the subways were very close as well.</p></li>

I can, without a single doubt, say that The Renaissance is one of the best--if not the best. Everything is perfect....location, comfort, quality, staff. Subway station is a few steps away. Theatre's are a short walk. Many restaurant choices close by. Concierge was friendly and knowledgeable. My only complaint is that we couldn't stay longer!</p></li>

The room was great - even for two adults and two older children. Total silence at night despite the location. Quick stroll to Central PArk, Rockefeller, RAdio City, Plaza etc and quick subway links to everywhere else! New Year's Eve saw us nipping in and out into the centre of the crowd thanks to special hotel passes - some people had waited since mid morning for such a view!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location Stayed 2 nights around thanksgiving when hotel full. Excellent location, good bar and restaurant. Decor a little tired although room well equiped with comfortable bed. Some noise from adjoining room through connecting door. Reception rather cool and under pressure, but concierge very good - although also under pressure. Overall satisfactory stay. Some hotels we visited like the Hyatt and Sheraton looked much more tired - so perhaps standard are not so good generally in NY?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">right in times square We stayed in this hotel for a romantic getaway. 3 nights right in times square. The rooms were not bad considering the price. Bed was very comfy and outside noise was barely audible. Inside noise however we could hear everything in the next room. Even though our neighbors were not loud simple conversation could be heard. Workout area was good.The bad: no in hotel store. Only 2 computers to use situated right next to the bar.Not a bad hotel but we believe not worth the price</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location -- funky smell The hotel was in a great location and the amenties were nice..... but the only complaint was the crazy smell in the lobby area. I couldn't figure out want it was. Was it some fish dish from Foleys Fish-- or some kind of bizarre curry blend room deoderizer? I almost gagged everything I had to walk thru the lobby. Other than the smell it was nice. The linens were fantastic. The decor was very warm and masculine. Had a boutique feel compared to the Marriott Marquis. Recommend it.</p></li>

As soon as we walked into our room, we knew we had made the right choice to shell out a bit more cash for a highly rated hotel in the same area. The room was spacious, the view of Times Square was great, the staff were helpful, and most importantly, the bed was super comfortable! This is a very nice hotel and we highly recommend it if you are staying in Times Square.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I Will Gladly Stay There Again. I stayed there Jan. 2007 for a two night stay. The hotel is located in the heart of Times Square with easy access to everything. The check-in was perfect. They were extremely quick and polite. My room was well decorated and furnished. The bed was perfect with quality linens. My only complaint was the dirty floors and carpeting, which they corrected immediately. In summary, marbled bathroom with great plumbing, great bed, perfect location, and impeccable service. I will definitely stay there again.</p></li>

We checked in after a long international flight. The bed there are extremely comfortable and the bathrooms, although not large, were larger than many in New York Hotels and had granite countertops. Usually when we stay in Times Square, we go to the Marriot Marquis. Compared to that hotel, the rooms are nicer, the elevators quicker, and it is much quieter than the ever busy Marquis. The staff was friendly and the room clean. We will stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">great location The hotel lobby was being renovated but it did not cause any problems with check in etc. We booked one of the larger corner rooms which had just been renovated and it was a really nice room with a great view over Times Square. There was no bath but a lovely large shower and compared to other bathrooms we have seen in New York it was really spacious and of course brand new after the renovations etc. Would recommend this hotel as it is in such a great location. They also have a computer and printer in the lobby dedicated to on-line airline check-in and to print off your boarding cards - very useful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Terrific Hotel Spent the weekend in the city with some friends and got a great rate on the Reaissance. Somehow the dates were mixed up, and when I called to confirm they let me know and apologized getting me the same rate for the days I needed. The staff couldn't be friendlier or more helpful. The rooms are very nice and pretty spacious and clean. Great views. Prime location. The restaurant has a spectacular view of Times Square. The health club was great too (and totally empty). Highly recommend. I would definitely stay here again. I had other friends who stayed at the Edison and they hated it and everyone was rude.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">great hotel We stayed for a long weekend in Oct. and loved this hotel. The rooms are lovely, clean and quite roomy. The location is great for theater, restaurants and sightseeing tours. The staff was helpful and friendly. One night there was a lot of noise in the halls from a group of women who were going back and forth between rooms, slamming doors and talking loudly. One call to the desk and they sent someone up who asked them to be quiet. We never ate in their restaurant, but the views from it are wonderful. Elevators were quick and although the hotel was sold out for the weekend it never seemed crowded. We would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect Perfect Perfect Location and wonderful Hotel This hotel is in the perfect location! It is within walking distance to all the famous tourist sites! Very fun to be in the center of it all! No need to spend money on cabs because everything is so close and subway stations are conveniently located nearby. The service is excellent--the concierge knew directions to every place I wanted to go. Everyone is helpful and nice. The porters (bell hops) were great help! The only, and I mean only downers are that the rooms are a little small, and the beds are a little firm, but the location and great service make up for it all! I will definitely be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One of the NYC Hotels That I've Been The location of this hotel was excellent, only one block from a subway station and a few blocks from the Times Sq. stop. I had a king size room on the 12th floor. The bed was amazingly comfortable with lots of pillows and a douvet. I liked the big walk-in shower, glsss doors, seat in the shower. This is not the postage stamp size bathroom in most NYC hotel rooms. The complimentary shoe shine service was professional. The room was very clean and comfortable, large plasma screen TV, and we had a great view from the window. Yje lobbies are funky and tasteful. The staff were helpful and friendly throughout our stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overpriced, small rooms My wife and I spent a weekend at this hotel as a romantic getaway. Though the hotel was OK, I would say overall it was disappointing, and I would not recommend it for that kind of stay. The room was very small, even though it was one of the more expensive rooms ($429 per night). For this price, I expect superluxury service, which this was not. The number of TV channels was disappointing. Also, there was no turn-down service. And there were tacky touches such as a breakfast menu left on the bed. I didn't like having to take two elevators to get to our room. On the plus side, the location was great if you like Times Square, as I do.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Almost Done... The hotel has undergone a huge beautifucation, but isn't quite there yet. Thank goodness for the so-far slow holiday season. There would be some pretty upset folks! The rooms were guaranteed at 100% done, but weren't. Mismatched furniture, reverse hot and cold water, not a clean room...But the new decor that's either there or coming is outstanding. Keep up the good work. And the bell staff should teach the rest of the hotel about customer service...they were OUTSTANDING. Hit this hotel in a couple of months when the now-closed fitness center is done and the staff has a proper desk to welcome guests. It's all a bit transitional at the moment.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Liked it!! Stayed overnight in NYC because I had opera tickets for Saturday night. Would have preferred closer to Lincoln Center but this place was on the northern block ending Times Square. Very funky inside--I liked that a lot. I heard it has just been renovated and it looks great. Bathroom was lovely with colorful tiles in the shower. Large flat screen TV and nice cushy Simmons pillowtop mattresses. The blue headboard did not go in the neutral-colored room. The location is very good. Noisy late into the a.m. though so bring your earplugs! If you have a room with an adjoining door, be aware you will hear the people in the next room very clearly. I would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Superb Room and location This place is great!!! The hotel has just undergone a renovation and the rooms are beautiful and very large by New York standards. The staff are very friendly and helpful and go way beyond the call of duty. I left some clothes in the dresser and didn't realize it until I got home. I called back to the hotel, and the staff in lost and found retrieved my clothes, boxed them up, and overnighted them to me at no charge. NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL SERVICE!!!! Also the Time Square location is extremely convenient to the theaters and tons of other attractions. There is a subway station just outside the door as well. You definitely won't go wrong with this super hotel!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent again This was my second visit to NYC and the Renaissance. I just love this hotel. I had a STD room on the 8th floor which looked over Broadway on Time Square. Yes you can hear the odd traffic noise like fire brigade sirens but your in NY. The hotel bar is great however watch out for the price's. The rooms are of good size with King bed, table and armchair and still plenty of room to walk around. You have big windows and its great to sit on the ledge and look down to TS below. Bathrooms are marble and have deep baths. All the staff i spoke to couldnt help you more. Cant wait to go back. 49th st on the subway is just outside the hotel entrance to is great for exploring. Have Fun!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Renaissance was great Just arrived back 24 November 2004First time in New York in fact first time in the States. Everything about this hotel was superb. Arrived on our wedding anniversary and decided to eat in Foleys as it was a special occasion and expected it to be really expensive. It turned out to be no more expensive than any restaurant in our local town. The food and service were wonderful only mistake we made was ordering a starter we were so full couldn't eat all the main course. Rooms were good and clean. Expected it to be noisy when we saw Times Square but not at all. We too had excellent service from Omar the concierge and the rest of the staff. Would definitely recommend this hotel</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Decent stay Plus- Location is the best. Hotel is close to everything.- Room is surprisingly quiet given how busy the location is.- Complimentary buffet per my Marriott Platinum status was excellent with unbelievable view!Minus- Our room is very dated. Wear and tear are everywhere.- Bellboys and all guys downstair were helpless. I had about 5 bags checked in before my ride came and picked me up. No one downstair offered me any help (not even catching the door) and I had to make multiple trips coming in and out the door with all guys just looking at me. It was horrible.- We had to ride two elevators to get to our room. Just found that inconvenient.- Front desk promised to bring us a fridge... it never came.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Times Square location. Location, location, location! We did a Mother's Day trip to NYC in May 2004. I picked this hotel after reviewing the comments on this website and I must agree, this is a top notch hotel, esp. for the price and location. Right in the middle of Times Square. It was extremely easy to find and always convenient when walking to sight-seeing locations. The restaurant in the hotel provides an unbelievable view of Times Square. The hotel staff was wonderful. Easy check-in and checkout. No problems at all. Room size was good and cleaning service was great. Beautiful view from my 19th floor room. Everyone in my group was impressed at the hotel and the price. I def. will stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Why is this hotel NOT in the TOP 5!!!!!!!??????!!!!!!! WHOA!!! What a truly magnificent hotel.. First off, we were upgraded to a view room at NO charge; we just asked.. This hotel is in the middle of the most happening city on the planet.. Close to all of the tourist traps and the not soo touristy areas, and yet when you are in your comfortable room, you feel like you are NOT anywhere near a city that literally NEVER sleeps.. Sweet and diligent service by ALL staff members.. What else can this hotel have?? Free shoe shine, cool consierge service and NO elevator issues, had service to and from room in seconds, even though we were on the 16th floor.. Consider this awesome hotel next time you visit New York!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic, wonderful staff This hotel is in a fantastic location, right in the middle of times square. The views from the rooms and the restaurant are amazing. I stayed there with my mother and my younger sister on a sightseeing trip. I had been to New York several times before and this was by far and away the best hotel I have stayed in. The room was spacious with a large bathroom and an extremely comfortable bed.What really made this stay special was the staff. Every member of staff we encountered was friendly and polite and made an effort to get to know you. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant each morning and the waiters remembered what we ate the morning before. I would certainly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

The location is great and within walking distance of most 'must do's' in New York. The room was clean, great view of Times Square, bathroom spacious and the beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept on in a hotel!We ate in the restaurant, Foleys, twice for breakfast, the food was good, service great, very attentive and the view of time square outstanding, I would have thought it would be fabulous at night but we just never made it back for dinner. Ordered room service one night and it was fast and efficient, food good. Concierge helpful, bar staff a little glum. Check out was easy, would definately stay here again next time we go back to New York.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Wonderful Experience! We just returned from a week long stay at the Renaissance Times Square and enjoyed every minute. The room was spacious and very clean, as was the bathroom. My wife loved the deep tub and enjoyed a relaxing bath every night. Room service was delicious and affordable (try the breaded chicken and shrimp for a scrumtious late night snack). The service was impeccable. The view of Times Square from the bar  resturaunt is all that it's hyped up to be. If you're looking to be right in the middle of Times Square, your wish will be granted. One step out the door of the hotel and your knee deep in the midst of it all. If we decide to stay in Times Square again we will not hesitate to stay at the Renaissance again. Enjoy!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great stay! Perfect for shopping and shows! A group of 4 women stayed here and had plenty of room in a larger than average New York City hotel. The staff was great and always very helpful in finding a cab, shopping, great restaurants and gave directions for walking to all the sights. The housekeeping staff was wonderful and always friendly. They accomodated our request for late checkout as well. Our room had two double beds, a great view of the Hershey's Time Square, and a good sized bathroom. We were on the 19th floor and water pressure and air condition were in great working order.The location is wonderful; only a few blocks to Rockefellar Plaza and 5th Avenue. Very convenient to the subway as well.I would definitely stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good location, great view of Times Square You can't beat the location since it's near the theaters (next to tkts) and major NY attractions. My room was clean and up-to-date. The restaurant has a very nice view of Times Square. The service is solid but the concierge and restaurant/bar wait staff were exceptional--very attentive, pleasant, and polite. I agree with previous reviewers re: towels and noise: towels did have a faint chemical smell and I could hear the neighbors' muffled voices. I've stayed at a few boutique hotels with rooms half this size, snobby/poor service, and no restaurant--and I'm tired of it. Overall, I would recommend this to business travelers and anyone else who wants a consistent experience at a full service hotel.</p></li>

The subway stop is close and we were within walking distance of our Broadway play and the Rockefeller Center. The concierge was great. Omar was there through the week and he gave us wonderful suggestions. The weekend staff was also great and gave us good information about weekend construction on the subway and which cars to get on to get to the south ferry exit. Checkin was fun with Eric waiting on us, he had a wonderful attitude and sense of humor. The room was bigger than we expected for New York and quieter than we expected. The beds were very comfortable and the hotel was very clean. All in all it was a great experience and we can't wait to go back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Definitely would return It was my first trip to NY and I wanted to stay somewhere in the middle of the action. This hotel is perfect for that. Everything is just a short jaunt away. The room was very clean and the hotel staff made above-average effort to accomodate a rollaway cot and gave about 15 towels (3 women the room), which were very very appreciated. The hotel was very secure. The little drawbacks were that the internet is available only Monday-Friday during business hours (if you needed to do business which I did but didn't want to drag my laptop)...and the hotel restuaurant for breakfast was less than fabulous. However Foley's (the major restaurant) was very very nice for supper and excellent seafood.I would definitely stay again for sure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A fantastic hotel for all the family! We stayed at the Renaissance for five nights with our two children, age seven and five. From the moment we arrived until we left, the staff were very friendly and always had some fun with our kids. We also had dinner at Foleys, again great staff. The meal was delicious, and worth the cost. The room was spacious and very clean. The bathroom was lovely and we were always well stocked with towels. We have absolutely no complaints and would definately stay here again. The subway is at the corner and a lot of major attractions are easily accessable. Two recommendations - go to Jamba Juice right beside the hotel for an amazing smoothie, and Pax wholefoods one block up on the same side of the hotel for amazing breakfasts.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Comfortable and Friendly We just returned from an excellent stay at the Renaissance. I had read some recent reviews before we left and I was curious as to what we would encounter, well those reviewers who found the staff to be unhelpfull or unfriendly must of had a shift working that we never encountered, eveyone was pleasant and helpfull. Even though the hotel is under renovations things were quite , clean and yes it may take a little longer navigating the elevators but once you get into the habit of changing cars it isn't a problem. The bed is by far the most comfortable I've slept in. There is a small market across the street that has fresh cut fruit, panninis and salads, very tasty and very affordable, better than anything else in the area for breakfast.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect! We chose this hotel based on location and price and it was perfect! It is right in the middle of the theater district and pretty central to everything else as well. A huge advantage for us was being able to locate the M  M sign and know that the hotel was right there! Foot traffic in front of the lobby was minimal. Check in was smooth-all of our requests were met and exceeded! The rooms are nicely furnished, the beds are amazing and the bathrooms nicely laid out. Maid service was excellent the entire stay. All of the staff members we encountered were friendly and helpful. The restaurant was quite good and well worth the $$ just to be able to enjoy the view. If you want to stay in Times Square-this is the perfect hotel - neither too busy or big- but still in the center of it all!</p></li>

The best thing about this hotel is the location. It is located right in the center of time square, and only a short walk from 5th ave., and Broadway shows, stores, ect (if you are looking for great Broadway tickets at discounted price and willing to wait in line visit the 鈥淭kts鈥?booth located 5 seconds south of the hotel). The hotel staff was extremely friendly and courteous. The concierge desk was more than knowledgeable and will to assist. The rooms were nice, clean and full of information to help you plan your stay. The beds were so comfortable that it was hard to get out of them in the morning. I had such a great stay, that I will definitely return to this hotel on my next trip.</p></li>

We stayed here for a celebration with our extended family and as a result got to see a variety of rooms. Most of them had views of Broadway that were filled with all the lights and action of Times Square, without the noise. The rooms themselves were a fairly good size by NYC standards and they were VERY quiet. They were nicely appointed with really nice bathrooms and THE MOST comfortable beds I have ever slept on. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Foley's, the hotel restaurant, doesn't have the greatest food in the world, but it's worth eating at least one meal there, just for the view. It's like being inside of a video game.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Outstanding Service I am from NY and hadn't been back in 15 years. Took my family for Xmas. The staff was extraordinary! Omar the Concierge, made arrangements for me well in advance of my trip. Even called me back in Florida to confirm plans. It was as if I had a personal assistant arranging things for me. Everyone was friendly and eager to please. With the volume of visitors I was amazed that everyone was cheerful and friendly.The room was a bit tired (not too bad), and the rollaway bed for my daughter was almost painful to sit on. However, the view, location, service and everyone's pleasant attitudes were wonderful. No chips on any shoulders here! It was not noisy at all. The room was clean and there were plenty of towels and it was the 14th floor. I would stay here again in a NY minute!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not Quite Finished, but Nice Bellman were nice and service was excellent. We got there early so we expected that are room might not be ready and it wasn't. Due to their renovations, the lobby is half of its intended size and very crowded. It looks like it will be nice once it is finished, but right now it is barely functional. We went out into the city for a while and came back and our room was ready. The room is new and very nice. The only dissapointing thing about the rooms is that there are no good views of time square because the face of the hotel is covered with signs. It also was dissapointing that there is nowhere to have a drink overlooking Time Square. The lobby has no view. I guess I am spoiled by the Marriott Marquis. Other than that the service was excellent and staff very nice and helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lovley night in the City excellent location Other than the difficulty discerning where to valet park, we had a great night on the town here. The lobby can be a bit disjointed and we were dissappointed that the bar did not open until later in the evening but our room and service was excellent.The bathrooms were large, very clean, plenty of marble and the toiletries were plentiful and fragrant.The best part of this hotel is the excellent location right in Times Square. Very fun and busy. We had room service for breakfast. I had Eggs Benedict and my husband had pancakes and then we split their signature dish, the lemon soufle pancake. Except for the over tart lemon pancakes everything else was excellent.Watch your valet ticket, we were charged an extra night because we were an hour over the 24 hour limit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Best location, great hotel Rooms big for New York, clean and tidy. The bed was simply wonderful as reported by others on this site (wondered what the fuss was about) - I now understand! The location is the best in Manhattan, in particular for first time tourist. It's located in Times Square, tourist info office is opposite. Shops, all theatres, subway and tour buses within 200 metres of hotel. The downtown, uptown and night tour buses are across the road. The staff were freindly, especially the concierge who could not do enough for you. The best feature of the hotel has to be the view of Times Square from the restaurant in the evening or at breakfast. It's on the third floor, reception level and is a site to behold. All in all, this is a class hotel. One word of caution, they are renovating the hotel this year.</p></li>

Booked using Marriott points, so for a freebie it was amazingFantastic, stylish property, loved the copper wall coverings and unique lobby furnishings.The staff was extremely helpful, the car valet was courteous and helpful. Front Desk helpful as well.You must check out the view from the restaurant - it is probably the best view of time square. Kids loved the view. We tried the food, just apps, they were as good as would be expected.In terms of room choice, no need to stay on the highest floors, the lower levels have the best view of the street action and signs.This hotel is much nicer than the westin nearby, the westin rooms are tiny and the bathrooms looked like prison cell latrines.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location!! I have just spent 5 nights with 3 friends at the Renaissance Hotel in Times Square, New York. The location is fantastic, right in the middle of all the action. We had a room on the 19th floor (requested this through our Virgin holiday) and had two large double beds which were so comfy it was difficult to get out of them. Found all the staff very obliging especially in the resturant where we had breakfast each day. There is a great view from here. If you are travelling to New York and intend to go up the Empire State I would advise you to prepurchase your tickets as we had to queue for two hours. Would recommend seeing Mamma Mia, it is brilliant, also the open top bus ride round the city. Macys is the best for shopping, Bloomingdales is classier but sells the same things at a higher price.Have a great time folks.</p></li>

Requested a king bed, and got a king bed. Room was nicely decorated, bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in.Overall I had a difficult time finding fualt with this hotel and are amazed at the bad reviews that I have seen posted before. We haved stayed at some of the best hotels and these guys are doing something right.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect We stayed at this property for one night in October and had a great time. The hotel could not be located more centrally to the action and was perfect for either the tourist or business traveler. The rooms are nice -- slightly larger than other rooms we have stayed in in NYC -- and are very well appointed.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, odd hotel The location is great as long as you want to be in the hustle and bustle of Times Square. The hotel has an unusual entrance in that you have to take an elevator from the street level to the lobby and then another elevator to your floor. The lobby is not at all glamorous and had a strange odor during our entire stay. Although we thought we had a reservation for two rooms, each with double beds, we were informed when we arrived that the fine print had indicated that this was not guaranteed. I had actually called the week before and was told that double beds would not be a problem. They wound up coming up with one smoking room with double beds and another non-smoking room with a king and a rollaway. The rooms themself are nothing special but do have unique views of the Times Square area. We have stayed at other hotels in NYC and found them to be more user friendly and enjoyable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Awesome! We stayed at the Renaissance in early March and absolutely love it. It's in a perfect location- right in Times Square, near theaters, right by Metro station, etc. The rooms are small, but you're in NYC so all the rooms are small. The beds were very comfortable, and we had a great view of Times Square from our window. The service was excellent, and the concierge was extremely helpful. We weren't able to eat in their restaurant that looks right over Times Square because it was closed for renovations, but we were told by many it's a prime place to eat before the theater, get drinks or dessert afterwards, etc. The hotels in Times Square price out more expensively, but it is worth it to be in such a prime location- the only other hotel in the area that would be a great location and isn't as expensive would be the Comfort Hotel- however, the difference (luxury wise) between this one and the others in noticeable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice Hotel Good Location I booked this hotel when my first choice the Marriott Marquis was unavailabe. Hotel is centrally located and nice and quiet. Rooms are a good size, bathroom has a nice deep tub forlong soaks after a day in NYC. I had a room with a king size bed and it was lovely.  I didn't like having to take 2 elevators to get to my room, but,  I will say I never had to wait more than 2 minutes for an elevator. Warning: unlike every other Marriott property I have stayed in, (at least a dozen) that puts a $50.00 per day hold for incidentals this one puts $100.00 and doesn't bother to inform you. I noticed it and went to speak to the front desk and got nothing but attitude from the woman there. Not a very pleasant way to start a stay. All in all, though the hotel is nice and except for the rude woman at the desk everyone else I came in to contact with was great. I might stay again, but, it will not be my first choice.</p></li>

It was a bit smaller than the typical hotel room at Renaissance Hotels, not sure if it is because we had the end room, or all the rooms at this property were small. Other than size, the room was very clean, had everything we need, and provided everything we expected from a hotel room.Service:The staff at this hotel were excellent at every level. Although we arrived very early, the front desk was very courteous and helped us check in early with no charges.Location:The location of this hotel cannot be beat! We had no idea that this was literally one of the buildings in the middle of times square and had a little trouble finding it when we first arrived. We were absolutely right in the middle of everything! We walked around times square, saw a show on broadway, and took the subway all around Manhattan.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location.. clean... very satisfied My fiance and I stayed one night at the Renaissance and were very satisfied with the hotel. It's location is perfect for visiting Times Square and the Theatre District and our room was very clean. The bar across from the lobby had a nice jazz trio playing and had a decent view of the action. There was that smell that other reviewers have mentioned; it's not a bad smell, just very potent. My only complaint would be the noise from the street at night. From reading the reviews here, I knew to request a room on a high floor which is supposed to be quieter. However, that room wasn't ready when we arrived (we arrived before check-in time), so we took a Queen room on the 7th floor instead. That may have been a mistake. The sirens and horns definitely bothered me during the night. I think if we had stayed on a higher floor, that might not have happened. Overall though, we had a great stay at the Renaissance and would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location, BUT....... A word of warning about this hotel. Although this hotel is located in a very centric location the hotel does misrepresent itself. The problem started when I booked a room with 2 queen size beds. Upon my arrival the reservations clerk informed me that I would only be receiving a room with one king size bed and a rollaway. This was not the room I booked. Then when we went up to see the room, it was the size of my closet for 3 people. The rollaway was supposed to go in front of the door. When I informed the hotel staff that this was a fire hazard that is when they proceed to give me a slightly larger room and of course I had to argue with them to get it. On top of all this the first room had a large insect flying around in it, the chair in the room was stained and the room had been double booked. Before I was able to move our things out there was already someone else trying to occupy the room. With all the other hotels in New York City I was not impressed. Stay at your risk.</p></li>

Before that, I used to stay about twice a year for 5 years.I have not had the opportunity to get back to New York and my favorite hotel due to my last job.I truly cannot say enough about the staff that made each of my stays make me feel like I was a movie star. They really gave me the Royal treatment each and every time I was there. Amos, the doorman is a gem. He would listen to me go on and on about every detail of my days and evenings in my favorite city.Charlie, who managed Foley's, made my 50th Birthday, a night that I still remember. He had wine and the works sent up to my room knowing that I would be seeing Chicago. What a wonderful thing to walk into. Each time I went back, they asked if I would like my same table and gave me complimentary wine. You find it hard in this day and age that people actaully remember you, but they did and it has stayed with me.The next time that I am lucky enough to get back to Manhattan, I would not stay anywhere else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">excellent location we stayed here between 30/06 to 6/07. we had a great time. the location was perfect, right in the heart of all the buzz and lights of times square, so if that is what you want then this is the place for you! staff were polite and friendly and answered and dealt with any queries we had straightwaway. 3 of us shared a room and it was really spacious with enough room for all our shopping and suitcases. the bathroom was great too.we used the free internet downstairs, you get 15 mins at a time and for us that was fine, the computers were always free and more than adequate to check emails etc from home. my only minor criticism would be the breakfast, normally i wouldnt bother with breakfast in hotels in NY and indeed we had some great ones at other places during our stay, but the one at the renaissance was not great at all - expensive even by hotel standards and the quality/quantity was below average.all in all a great place to stay for a short shopping/city break trip to new york. we would definitely stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location We stayed at this hotel from 1st-4th August. The location is very central with easy access to the subway and tour buses. The Rockerfeller Centre is a very short work and it's well worth the trip up 'Top of the Rock'. We found the hotel to be clean and comfortable, although my two teenage sons weren't too impressed at having to share a king bad when I had specifically request two beds upon booking. I'm sure if we'd made a fuss they might have changed the rooms but we were tired after the flight etc. so didn't bother. This was our first visit to New York so had taken pot luck with the hotel and all in all we were very satisfied with the accomodation. The rooms were a decent size and we enjoyed watching the world go by from the 7th floor.My only criticisms really are that the staff, whilst efficient, were not in the least bit friendly and on reception couldn't manage a single smile. Breakfast was expensive but very good and the restaurant (although we didn't have an evening meal there) has an amazing view over Times Square.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Macy's Parade Perfect Spot This was our 4th Thanksgiving visit with extended family. We try to do it every two or three years. This year we were about 15 altogether. We make reservations in January for the Parade View rooms and plan on a weekend celebration, beginning on Weds. night. It cannot be beat for the view and the location for the parade. The children are able to see the balloons eye-to-eye! They love it! It has become our favorite family holiday. We have family from all over join us. Even on a crazy weekend like this, the staff is always ready to help. They could not be nicer. The location is perfect for those out-of-towners who are unfamiliar with the city...it is right in the middle of everything. You always feel safe and secure. Although the city is famous for being expensive, there are restaurants nearby that are extremely reasonable for quick meals. On one visit we had lunch with Geraldo Rivera in a nearby coffe shop...usually our favorite breakfast place. If you plan on a Thanksgiving visit planning a year in advance is a must!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location. . . Great location, right in the heart of Times Square. This was my second visit to NY, and my husband's first. We stayed in the hotel on a Room Only basis, as there are so many great places to eat in NY. We ventured into the restaurant for breakfast on our second day, and the food and service was so good, we went back many times. Price was also very reasonable. The view out of the restaurant is fantastic - the famous pot noodle and bottle of bud is right in front of you!On arrival, and throughout our stay, the staff were really helpful and friendly. Our room was really comfortable - everything you need (inc proper hairdryer, iron and ironing board). The rooms are a little tired, but no one going to NY is going to spend all of their time in their room as there is so much on offer outside. The rooms are clean and well made up and despite what we read in some reviews before we went, we found the bed really comfortable! We would definately stay at this hotel again (and we are not easily pleased!) It must be without a doubt one of the best locations in NY.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Comfortable bed was the star attraction The room was not a big as I would have expected but was fine. The bed was the star attraction, one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. We had requested a high floor and therefore had no noise distractions for an excellent nights sleep.As the hotel has an ecellent location we were able to walk everywhere around mid-town manhattan. A good nights sleep was much appreciated.I was disapointed with the quality of the towels in the restroom. They were old and shabby and I expected better for this quality of hotel. Perhaps I was misled by a website review that stated the restrooms had Body Shop bath products. They were NOT body shop and not high quality by any means. The bar maid in the hotel bar was not very friendly. The concierge were excellent. Omar's recommendations made my holiday special. Check-in and check-out was fast and without any hassle.Overall I felt the hotel was quite nice with a good location but for the price paid, the little extras can make the difference and these were lacking. I will try some other hotel next time in New York.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, great room and the concierge is a legend! My partner and I decided to go to New York to celebrate my Birthday and booked this hotel solely on the great reviews we'd seen on this website, we were not disappointed! As it was our first trip to America and we were quite overwhelmed but the staff were very friendly, especially Omar, the concierge. He helped us plan out our day and recommended some wonderful restaurants and Broadway shows to visit. I don't know what we would have done without him! After moving on the second night from a small bedroom on the 5th floor, to a big room on the 20th floor overlooking Broadway and 7th avenue with great sights of Times Square, we were very happy. The windows were soundproofed with black out curtains so the busy traffic and lights of Broadway were not a problem. The only problem was on the last night the room next door was very loud, but a quick call to the front desk and security came up straight away to ask them to keep it down. Overall the hotel was lovely, the staff were very accommodating and the location was ideal.Best Birthday ever!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location This was our first time in New York,  we decided on this hotel due to its central location  we weren't disappointed.We spent 4 nights here over Easter, the room was a reasonable size  the double beds were just so comfortable - the best we've ever slept on - that it was a joy to get back to our room after a hectic day sightseeing.Our room was on the 15th floor  the outside noise didn't bother us at all.All the staff were courteous  helpful, the concierge recommended  booked us a restaurant on our first night, It was reasonably priced  a lovely way to start our holiday.Its a good idea if you are doing a show or if you want to eat by 9pm to reserve a table at a restaurant, as they all get very busy.The subway is literally a few steps from the hotel entrance  a very cheap  quick way to get around the city - $24 for a weeks unlimited travel on subway  bus.If you want to have cold drinks in your room ask for a refrigerator on checking in, as if you move anything in the minibar it automatically gets charged.We would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel on our next visit to NYC.</p></li>

<li>Great Location This was our first time in New York,  we decided on this hotel due to its central location  we weren't disappointed.We spent 4 nights here over Easter, the room was a reasonable size  the double beds were just so comfortable - the best we've ever slept on - that it was a joy to get back to our room after a hectic day sightseeing.Our room was on the 15th floor  the outside noise didn't bother us at all.All the staff were courteous  helpful, the concierge recommended  booked us a restaurant on our first night, It was reasonably priced  a lovely way to start our holiday.Its a good idea if you are doing a show or if you want to eat by 9pm to reserve a table at a restaurant, as they all get very busy.The subway is literally a few steps from the hotel entrance  a very cheap  quick way to get around the city - $24 for a weeks unlimited travel on subway  bus.If you want to have cold drinks in your room ask for a refrigerator on checking in, as if you move anything in the minibar it automatically gets charged.We would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel on our next visit to NYC.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice, with a few hiccups.... The hotel was very nice, however, there were some annoying things about staying there. Most of the problems were due to the renovations that are currently going on. It's a pain to take two different elevators to get up to your room. We also had Gold status, and normally that comes with a private room where you can grab a quick continental breakfast. With this hotel, you literally have to take the time to be sat and you are required to order off the menu. That is fine when you aren't in a hurry, but we happen to be in one.The last thing (And this is very minor, but I'm going to mention it anyway) is that there wasn't a soap holder, and every time you washed your hands and sat the soap down, it would slide off the sink and onto the counter. Just little things like that could have been thought of, when they did the designing. They also didn't think to put a garbage can in the bathroom either. Overall, it was a great place to stay. Especially the location. And if you can get away without staying there until the renovations are done, then I would definitely recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">poor guest service not impressed at all.... spent one night in this hotel, got a good sunday rate at $199.00 compared to other 4 star hotels in the neighborhood. Not impressed at all! Guest service was poor considering we arrived and requested for extra pillows, front desk says they will take care of it...no one came to deliver. Spoke to a housekeeper who took care of our room for the turn down that afternoon, I mentioned to her about the pillows, she said I still have to call for that in the housekeeping dept, you would think that she would have the initiative to take care of the simple request, nope! no extra pillows for us....that only shows that they are not there to really take care of their guests....my family and I are all well travelled to different luxury hotels, by far the other hotels in Orlando and Las Vegas would have taken care of this little request right there and there. Oh well! I am not a happy guest....but they don't really care! I am not returning to this hotel all because good guest service is a priority on my list of where I want to stay the next time around! I am disappointed guest.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the Renaissance We stayed at the Renaissance August 26-August 30, 2008. 3 girlfriends in their 50's , first time in New York City. We loved the Renaissance. Before coming we emailed the hotel for advice on the best type of room for 3, bed types, etc and immediately received great advice from Jennifer at reservations. We settled on a room with two double beds , very roomy , fantastic linens, comfortable beds. Very friendly and accomodating staff, modern decor, rooms were comfortable, roomy and tastefully decorated. As stated in previous reviews, the entrance from the street leads to a small bell desk and lobby and an elevator to the main reception area and check in. We were surprised at how small the reception desk was, but this did not present a problem at all. Very intimate atmosphere and the staff were attentive to all our needs, granted us late check out when requested. Hotel is close to everything; Broadway shows, subway on the corner , within walking distance of all attractions, 5th Ave, Rockefeller Centre, St Patricks, etc. Highly recommend the Renaissance Times Square and would definately stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location! We stayed at the Renaissance New York Hotel in Times Square from June 11th -13th. We are from New York City, but we still did a lot of research before picking our hotel. We were not disappointed with our choice. This hotel is located right in the heart of Times Square. Tourists and locals alike will be impressed with the views from the rooms-- especially at night when everything is lit up. The rooms were immaculate and the hotel provided plenty of towels and bathroom amenities. The beds were real comfortable and there were extra pillows in the armoire. The only thing that you should be aware of is that the mini-bar has sensors in it-- everytime you touch something, it is automatically billed to your room. We found this out as I was moving things around to put some of our own stuff in the fridge, and I noticed the small sign that tells you about the automatic billing. We called the front desk to ask about this, and they confirmed that we had been billed for three items. After speaking to a Manager and explaining what had happened, the charges were removed, and they supplied us with a mini fridge free of charge.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel Just returned from a 4 day visit with two pre-teen grandaughters and we had a very nice stay at the Renaissance. I was a little concerned after reading some previous reviews but we were more than satisfied with the choice. The ONLY inconvenience was having to go up an elevator to the 3rd floor, which is their temporary lobby, and then having to take another elevator up to the room. I'm sure this will not be an issue when all the renovations are complete which should be soon. On the plus side of this, the security people on the ground level ask to see your room keys before allowing you to go up to the lobby. The rooms were very spacious and the beds VERY comfortable. The bathroom was large and very attractive with mother of pearl tiles on the wall. The Lather amenities were nice. You can't ask for a better location in Times Square. The staff was very cordial and accomodating. We did not eat in their restaurant but there are scads of restaurants all around plus a market across the street Smilers I think that carried any kind of food that you could imagine. We used the smoothie shop adjacent to the hotel for yummy treats!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">DISAPPOINTED We recently stayed in the Renaissance in New York and were quite disappointed in it. We booked a room on a higher floor, at an additional cost, so thought we would get a better room. Our room was extremely small, even by Manhattan standards and the room cleaning service was spotty at best. We had difficulties with our internet, as it disconnected after 3 days, even though we bought a 6-day package; hotel staff were unable to assist with this. Note: internet connection was included with the room; therefore, this had to be manually removed from our bill upon checkout. Also, there were no complimentary bathrobes in the room, which in most better quality hotels are a standard feature.If you are looking for a little luxury, you will not find it here, if you are looking for value for money, you will not find it here.From all accounts the hotel had gone through renovations and we could not get a good sense of what the theme was suppose to be, although I think the designer was going for trendy, edgy. The Concierge was helpful in finding a taxi and storing our luggage.We will not be staying here on any return trips to New York.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel, Great Location We arrived at the hotel on Friday 13th April. The check in was quick and efficient and we were shown to our room on the 21st floor. The first thing that we noticed was the sound.... considering the location it was peaceful. The room was large, well equipped and spotlessly clean. There was plenty of closet and drawer space, which we have often found lacking in most NY hotels. The bathroom too was a very good size with plenty of towels and toiletries. I noticed that the hairdryer was missing, but after a call to housekeeping, it was delivered 10 minutes later.Unfortunately the weather in NY was absolutely atrocious for the ten days we were there, but the staff always had a smile on their faces and made us feel we were coming home after a day out. We only ate once in the hotel, and that was for breakfast. It was bbuffet style. There was a very good choice and for a hotel, very good value. The location of this hotel is superb. No more than 2 minutes from the subway and of course theatres and shops. We travel to New York three or four times a year as our daughter lives there and we would have absolutely no hesitation in booking this hotel again.</p></li>

<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 0.951&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>The check in was quick and efficient and we were shown to our room on the 21st floor.</br>
<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 0.999&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>The first thing that we noticed was the sound.... considering the location it was peaceful.</br>
<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 0.999&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>The room was large, well equipped and spotlessly clean.</br>
<span style="background-color:#4363d8">CLEANLINESS</span>: 0.999&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>There was plenty of closet and drawer space, which we have often found lacking in most NY hotels.</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 0.999&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>The bathroom too was a very good size with plenty of towels and toiletries.</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 0.982&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>I noticed that the hairdryer was missing, but after a call to housekeeping, it was delivered 10 minutes later.Unfortunately the weather in NY was absolutely atrocious for the ten days we were there, but the staff always had a smile on their faces and made us feel we were coming home after a day out.</br>

<li>We only ate once in the hotel, and that was for breakfast.</br>
<span style="background-color:#f58231">FOOD</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>It was bbuffet style.</br>

<li>There was a very good choice and for a hotel, very good value.</br>
<span style="background-color:#008080">VALUE</span>: 0.994&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>The location of this hotel is superb.</br>
<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>No more than 2 minutes from the subway and of course theatres and shops.</br>
<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>We travel to New York three or four times a year as our daughter lives there and we would have absolutely no hesitation in booking this hotel again.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not jaw-dropping exciting but nice hotel, fab location! The hotel in conveniently located right above the 49th station on the N R W subway lines).We had a normal room - which I got at a good rate (read not their normal website rates... I don't think it is worth the money at that rate). Anyway since we got there a bit early, we had horror scenarios of inward facing rooms with views of the air-con vents! Thankfully these fears were all unfounded and although we did not get a room looking out onto Times Square, we were facing Broadway and the Hershey's Building instead. The room was ok size wise and everything worked except that there wern't central controls for the lights ( = several trips out of bed to turn off the room lights). The bathroom was acceptable... the bath linen was nice. Only complaint which I can find (at a push) was that the air in the room seemed to be very dry and arid; am not sure if it was the effect of the heating (very effective) although we only had the heating on for short periods. The concierge (Omar and Davina) were SO helpful and I would highly recommend using them as a sounding board to enhance your trip to the Big Apple!Overall though, I am happy with the room for what I paid.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic Location and staff I have just returned from my honeymoon after staying at the Renaissance Hotel Times Square, and yes there is major renovations going on at the minute but I have to say that, that did not ruin our honeymoon one little bit. We did hear the odd 'bang' and drill going once in a while but to be honest that was when we returned to the hotel to drop off all the shopping bags we had gathered during the day. The location of this hotel is 5 star and you couldn't ask for anything better, with all the city noise going on 24 hours a day, you can not hear it with their sound proof windows. The staff were top class and Omar the conceirge is fantastic he definately knows his New York without a doubt and how to get here there and everywhere and if you need tickets etc you MUST go see him.All I can say is yes the renovations can make you think 'oh my what have i booked' when you arrive but trust me when i say that, that should not put you off from staying at the Renaissance Hotel Times Square, I am already booking my next trip for March and I am certainly staying at the Renaissance, I cant wait to see what there do with this hotel I was told that it will be complete by December.Top Class Stay!!!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Nightmare This is a terrible hotel. Let's begin with the lobby. Oh, wait. There isn't one. You enter from 7th Avenue into a dank box with two rickety elevators that take you to the third floor, where you find... another dank box. This one has a tiny bar and several temporary desks. A video projector blind you as you exit the elevator, projecting meaningless sperm-like squiggles in a possible attempt to distract you from the disgusting space. Following a twisting passageway, you arrive at three elevators. Two and a half, actually, as one of them was used primarily to trap guests throughout our stay - to the point that hotel employees - ever helpful - joked about it. Once you arrive in your room, the space is actually fairly nice, if somewhat dirty. As I type this I literally cannot converse with others in my room, because of the 'minor' construction noise that begins on the floor above at 7am every day. The location is great, right in the middle of Times Square. But don't expect a view - the side of the hotel that would have one is blocked by that giant Coca Cola sign. There is a view of one thing, though - the four other hotels you should have stayed at: the Sheraton, the W, the Westin and the Marriott Marquis.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fabulous City I stayed at the Renaissance last December and thoroughly enjoyed it. Room was clean, spacious and the beds were amazing! I wanted to take the bed home on the plane with me!! We paid for room only (not many NY hotels do BB or if they do they charge like wounded rhino) so we ate out which was cheaper. The staff at the hotel were incredibly friendly and helpful and answered questions with a smile. Main reception is on first floor via a ground floor lobby - please check if you are staying at this hotel in 2007 though as I think they may be renovating it at some stage - although please check this with the hotel. It is slap bang in the middle of Times Square one of the best locations in New York - we were quite high up and had amazing views of the street and flashing billboards - we had no problem with noise as double glazing was very good and also being high up helped. Lifts were prompt - no waiting around for ages and in the stair well they have an ice machine which I think should be mandatory in British Hotels! its so handy to have an ice machine to keep your wine cool ;o) have a wonderful stay anyone who is staying here - I found it a wonderful hotel and as for New York well it speaks for itself! Loved it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Oasis amid Times Square Great location and wonderful staff! Whether on the 2nd floor (in 2006) or the 13th floor, we could not hear any street noise! Nor any noises from outside our room. This trip included my 17-yr-old niece (loved the modern decor), my mother (preferred the prior 'old world' decor) and myself. I appreciate the cleanliness, the large rooms and bathrooms, the fabulous beds and the friendly staff (especially Tammy G). At check-in, the clerk noticed we had a higher rate for the last night (since it was a weekday) and she offered to ask her supervisor to match our weekend rate - she was successful and saved us over $100. This hotel is smaller than others on the Square and thus allowed us to become familiar with the staff and other guests. The street-level seating area was a perfect place for Mother to 'people-watch' with the bellmen when she preferred a rest and we wanted to keep going. The location allowed us to split up, do different things nearby and meet together easily - this made our trip perfect for all ages! I've read that some dislike taking an elevator to the 2nd floor lobby (the bellman can take your luggage on the 1st floor) . We didn't mind this at all as it seemed to take us away from the street noise and gave the feeling of stepping into 'an oasis'!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Really the best there is We visited this hotel in December 2003 for my husband's 40th birthday and had such an amazing time we decided to return for the week before Christmas 2004. Only I was a bit worried that it wouldn't be as good as I remembered it. I couldn't have been more wrong, this was even better the second time around.I agree with another reviewer, why is this not in the top 5 hotels. The staff (all the same as the year before) were fantastic, they all remembered us and made us feel like we'd come home. The hotel itself is fantastic, great location, great rooms, fabulous bar, and Foley's food is not only great, but you cannot beat the view. Obviously the hotel would stand up on it's own, but what makes this hotel outstanding are the staff, I don't want to name any of them in particular as they are all as good as each other, from front door to concierge to waiters to maid service to managers. We both want to go back again next year, but sadly finances won't allow (that is unless we win the lottery!!), one thing is for sure though I will miss this place until we can return again, and when we do return I know that we will be welcomed again with open arms. We've travelled a lot and this is one of the best and friendliest places we've stayed in all over the world, our home in New York. Thanks guys!</p></li>

<li>Obviously the hotel would stand up on it's own, but what makes this hotel outstanding are the staff, I don't want to name any of them in particular as they are all as good as each other, from front door to concierge to waiters to maid service to managers.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic... Absolutely Fantastic We have just returned from a 5 day break in New York and we stopped at the Renaissance New York Hotel Times Square. The hotel is magnificent and situated in the best possible area. The service from the staff was incredible. Omar and Greg are a credit to the Hotel. If you鈥檙e new to New York like we were Omar in the Concierge area provided great help in supplying information on how to get about, what to see, where to go, booking tables in Restaurants etc etc etc. Greg on the front desk provided help to any issues you experienced. (Our only issue was finding the best take-a-way Pizza... Greg sorted it). This hotel is best placed for all your requirements. If you are considering this hotel you'll regret not booking it due to its location. The Room is tidy with a huge bed. We have stopped at some great hotels in the past but this bed by far was the most comfortable. After long periods of walking, shopping and dining taking a shower or a bath and relaxing in that bed was ideal. A great start to the next day. We didn鈥檛 eat in the hotel restaurant which was unfortunate on our part as the view of Times Square is breathtaking. I here refurbishments are taking place in March 2007 to allow customers to see the view on arrival into the hotel. Overall, this hotel is a must. We will be stopping again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Maybe it will get better When we first arrived in the room we thought it was great. Nice and clean, furnished well and plenty of room. But then we noticed what looked liked bodily fluids on the spreads (bleach white so I'm not sure how they missed it). It might not have been something else but it looked like it and made me uncomfortable. We reported it and they only changed one but left a nice bottle of champaign and chocolate covered cherries for us. That sort of made up for it but over the next few days we came to be really disappointed. The main problem was the guests and cleaning staff slamming doors, which made the front door in our room shake and the joining rooms door rattle. A couple of times they slammed it so loud it made me jump straight out of the bed! With all of the renovations I can't understand why they didn't do better with the doors. We tried for two days to get the front desk to ask them to stop but to no avail. The walls are extremely thin, as well. We could hear the people next door putting their clothes in the drawers and closets. Honestly, if it weren't for the issue with the door slamming I wouldn't mind going back but would never pay that kind of money again to be inconvenienced. The restaurant has a GREAT view! Someone rented it out for the Macy's Parade and they gave us a nice hot breakfast to go free.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">excellent rooms, nice atmosphere my sister and I stayed at the renaissance 5 nights in August. We loved the room. at first when I booked they said 2 double beds were not available but then a few days before my reservation, I got an e-mail stating I could send the concierge a request for added amenities and so I requested the 2 double beds again and a high floor. when I checked in, I was grateful that they were able to get me 2 double beds. we had a nice view, and I loved that the window opened. the room was clean and modern and was set up well for the space. we requested and were given extra hangers. the location was terrific. the staff was very friendly and very accommodating. I never got a hint of attitude. the bar in the lobby is a little lacking, and I would have preferred a more active bar scene. we didn't eat in the restaurant there, but they gave me a cup of coffee when I was waiting in the lobby for my sister. the computers in the lobby are accessible and w/ a comfy private setting, although sometimes you do have to wait for them (there are 2 of them). all in all I would highly recommend this hotel as a nice, friendly sanctuary once you are done exploring the city! (by the way there is a great store/deli across the street where you can pick up supplies or snacks). we loved it so much, we are thinking of taking a trip to NYC every summer!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A wonderful stay! We stayed at the Renaissance for 4 nights beginning March 23rd (Easter weekend). There were four of us - my husband and I and our two daughters - 16 and 12. The trip was a birthday trip for our 16 year old. As had been said - the location is great. We had breakfast the first morning at Foleys which was very good - the staff was very friendly and helpful. We also had dinner on Saturday night before going to the theatre - again the food was very good and the view cannot be beat. The room was a nice size, the beds were great and given the location it was very quite. We found all of the staff very helpful and friendly. The day we were leaving my youngest daughter discovered that she did not have her cell phone - we were collecting our luggage from the bell station, getting a cab to the airport. The bell staff called housekeeping but they did not have it - he suggested we run up to the floor and double check as they were still cleaining rooms. Sure enough they had just finished our room and were planning to send it to us. The only negative is that Times Square in general is just packed with people so every time you leave the hotel it is crazy. However that is part of the adventure and it is nice to be so close to all the shows - I never felt any concern walking around after a show back to the hotel. We also ate at the Blue Fin in the W just across the street. This is a very hip  trendy place but the food was excellent - we just had oysters and sushi.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The staff is what made the difference! This was my first stay at the Renaissance in Times Square, and I have to say, our stay was exceptional. Like many other reviewers have stated, the location is superb, right in the heart of Times Square. I knew when I booked the hotel in June that it was being remodeled, and had been monitoring reviews. I also received a letter in the mail before our stay advising us of the renovations.When you first walk in, it seems less than impressive, as the entrance is under construction and you take an elevator to the reception area. The lobby is nothing special ... but I am sure it will look much nicer come October when everything is complete.I had called the night before to request a newly renovated room, and they complied with our request. The new carpet in the hallway was busy and obnoxious ... not necessarily my taste ... but I guess it won't show the wear as much. The room was very nice, and the bed was heavenly.The best part of our stay, however, was the staff, in particular Cathy and Mario. They were so friendly and helpful, it truly made our trip special. They even went so far as to have a complimentary bottle of champagne and strawberries sent to our room. It is details like this that make the hotel stand out from the rest.We weren't bothered what-so-ever by the renovations, on Saturday morning we could hear them starting around 10 am but it was not too loud or bothersome.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone, and we will definitely return to the Renaissance on our next trip to NYC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice Hotel - Great location I went to the Renaissance Hotel with my husband for Christmas Holiday. The first thing I noticed was the great location. You have to do Times Square at least once. The location of this hotel was ideal to be able to see everything. The lights and the sounds were exhilarating. I picked this hotel as I have had luck with Renaissance Hotels in the past. It was a good choice.The room was large for New York standards. We had a room that looked over 7th street and all the billboards. It was great. The room had a King bed with a foyer area that had a fridge and coffee area. It also had a chair and desk. So it was big enough for 2 people. The bathroom had a huge tub and large sink area to place many things for both of us. Overall the room could use some freshening as it looked like it hadn't been updated in quite a while. The bed was very comfortable so that was great. We slept really well. The hotel personnel were friendly but not overly compared to other Renaissance hotels. Other hotels I have been to the staff were very friendly and wanted to help in any way. Here they barely said 2 words. One day we were taking a nap around 4:00 and housekeeping barged right in. Fortunately we had the lock on so they couldn't get in. Not sure what they were doing except maybe turn down service. It was very annoying. We did not go to any of the restaurants so I can't rate them. But you can't beat location and the size of the room. The price we got was very good as well. I would definitely stay here again but would like to see something maybe in a more quiet area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fabulous friendly hotel We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Renaissance, and cannot speak highly enough of the place. It is in a fantastic location, in the centre of Times Square, yet despite the hustle and bustle outside, stepping into the hotel was like entering a haven of tranquillity! The public areas are beautifully designed and the place even smells great. The bedrooms are fairly spacious, tastefully decorated and the beds are comfortable. As for the staff - what can we say? Everyone including the maid was friendly and polite (don't believe the rumours about New Yorkers being rude!) and if you need advice or tips on places to visit (or avoid) you should speak to the conceirge, Omar, who has to be the nicest guy in the city. He was more than happy to help and was a fountain of knowledge on everything from the Underground system to bargain hunting. Omar even checked us into the airport online prior to our flight home. We never ate at the hotel, but discovered a great restaurant, Pigalle, on the corner of 8th and W48th Street where they served lovely breakfasts. We went to see The Lion King on Broadway (amazing) and recommend Carmines restaurant, which is really close to the theatres and serves huge family size portions, meant for sharing. You'll need to make a reservation if you want to eat pre theatre, otherwise you'll have to wait for an hour, but the place has a great atmosphere and lovely food.We visited with our 11 year old daughter, and found plenty of things to interest her in the City, but plan to back on our own and will definitely stay at the Renaissance again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel litterally IS Times Square! Who would've thought that an address like 2 Times Square was pretty much Times Square itself!? This hotel is smack dab in the middle of all the hustle and bustle that is Times Square. Great location for tourists, steps from multiple subway stops, and easy access to everything in and around Times Square, the Empire State Bldg, and the Theater district.I stayed at this hotel for a combination of leisure and business. For leisure, you can't beat this, as described above. For business, I would stay elsewhere in the future. While in the middle of Times Square, there was just too much everyday commotion around the hotel for it to be quiet and a getaway after work. You constantly have tourists around you at all times, which is okay when you're a tourist yourself...different story when you're trying to go about your everyday routine.That being said, the hotel accomdation is wonderful, as Marriot properties always are. Beautiful room with an excellent room overlooking 7th Ave. Checked out the hotel restaurant for breakfast one morning which has a fantastic view looking out over Times Square (but expect to pay a premium for the view and service). Unfortunately the hotel did not have a pool, but does give you access to another hotel really close by which has the facility (I did not utilize this). It also has a nice gym facility.Hotel staff was very helpful and courteous. Luggage holding service was great, because I could check out in the morning, leave my bags, go to work, and come back after dinner to grab them and head to the airport. Very convenient overall.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very disappointed Having stayed at the Renaissance several years ago, I was very excited to return. However, that excitement was short-lived once we arrived.I did receive a letter regarding current renovations, but not until shortly before the trip, and long after I had prepaid for the room.I was assured several times that the construction would not start before 9 a.m. So I was rather unhappy to be woken up at 8 a.m. on Saturday morning by hammering. The woman in the room next door poked her head out of her door at the same time I did. She was irate, to say the least. She said her stay had been miserable because of the construction.I called at least three times during the next 45 minutes because the hammering would stop shortly after I called the front desk, and would start up again a few minutes later.The water also was turned off when I checked in, so I had to cancel my plans to go for a run and then have a shower.Things improved on Sunday and Monday. The water was not turned off, and I was not woken up by construction.Elevators were an issue, as everyone in the hotel was funneled into only one elevator between the lobby floor and the street level. There often was a long line for that elevator.The room itself was large by New York City standards, and the beds were very comfortable. A good shower, but the lack of a fan in the bathroom left it smelling vaguely musty. The TV, which appeared to be circa 1983, did not work properly. Using the iron and hair dryer at the same time shorted the electricity for half of the room. The outlets provided on the desk tripped about every 2 minutes, so using those was impossible.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Second stay - bit of a disappointment Having had a glorious stay here in December 2004, I returned to this hotel without hesitation. Check-in is only at 3pm, but I had an early arrival (9am) at the hotel, as my international flight landed at 07h25. Needless to say, after 22 hours on planes and in airports, one usually just likes to have a shower or bath and put on some clean clothes.I enquired at reception whether it would be possible to check-in earlier. The gentleman very politely explained to me that they had a full-house the previous night and that I could enquire again at about 12h00 for a possible cleaned room. At 12h30 I made enquiries at reception again, this time encoutering the Cruella de Ville of the reception domain. In a condescending manner, she told me that check-in was at 3pm, no exceptions. Well thank you so much anyway for all your efforts mam, but that's exactly the reason I will seek out alternative accommodation in the future.At rates of $459.00 per night I truly expect just that little extra for heavens sake! Even back in South Africa I get better treatment at Intercontinental hotels for a room rate, far less than $459.Eventually I got a room at 4pm just to realise, when I opened the roomdoor, that I got the Royal Suite of broom closets, with the added luxury of an adjoining roomdoor propped in the one corner of the room. For the rest of my Easter weekend I could clearly hear every word that was spoken in the adjoining room - from girlfriend talk to dirty talk......Clearly being a Marriott Rewards Elite member is not working out for me and I will keep an eye out for alternative accommodation in NYC.</p></li>

<li>The gentleman very politely explained to me that they had a full-house the previous night and that I could enquire again at about 12h00 for a possible cleaned room.</br>
<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 0.970&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>At 12h30 I made enquiries at reception again, this time encoutering the Cruella de Ville of the reception domain.</br>

<li>Well thank you so much anyway for all your efforts mam, but that's exactly the reason I will seek out alternative accommodation in the future.At rates of $459.00 per night I truly expect just that little extra for heavens sake!</br>
<span style="background-color:#008080">VALUE</span>: 0.985&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Even back in South Africa I get better treatment at Intercontinental hotels for a room rate, far less than $459.Eventually I got a room at 4pm just to realise, when I opened the roomdoor, that I got the Royal Suite of broom closets, with the added luxury of an adjoining roomdoor propped in the one corner of the room.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I could live in that room forever... It was our first time in NYC and we wanted to be in the middle of it all, so of the hotels on Times Square we chose this one almost entirely based on tripadvisor reviews, and were extremely satisfied. It has recently been renovated to a very high standard and was clean and comfortable. The bathroom is lovely and shower is glorious. I became particularly well acquainted with the bedroom when I had to spend a whole day in it with a horrible bug, so can also confirm the bed continues to be comfortable after 20 odd hours and channel choice on the TV is fantastic! By the way, don't be thinking you don't pay for all this. You pay, and you pay good. So be prepared.I read a couple of the reviews complaining a bit about the service, and to be honest though I agree the attitude of reception staff wasn't great (and the check in is WAY late at 3pm), it wasn't something to make or break the holiday. The lifts are very annoying though - one (which I believe is posessed and tries to hurt you on purpose) from street to reception then across the hall to another lift for bedrooms. Also, as you enter from the street you're faced with three huge mafioso types in long black coats. Sometimes they take your bags. Times Square is awesome, of course, but it is absolutely crazy busy and having friends who live in NYC we didn't spend that much time around tourist central. There's no need to be quite that in the middle of it all, as though it is a huge city it is real easy to get around. When we return we'll most likely stay at the Union Square side.On everything else: cabs are cheap, food is good, everything is huge. Love it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location at Times Square We stayed at the Renaissance Times Square for 1 night in Feb.'07. Everything at the hotel is great from front desk to wait staff at their restaurant Foley's. Location--absolutely the best ! The hotel is right at Times Square. Tons of restaurants are within walking distance, as well as the theatres for shows. We took a taxi to get to Little Italy/Chinatown in downtown, total taxi fare is $12 incl. tips. Also we walked 10 blocks up to FAO Swartz toy store and got some really good toys there that weren't found in other places. On the way back to the Renaissance from FAO Swartz, we stopped at the huge Catholic church (sorry forgot the name already). The hotel is only 2 blocks to the Rock. center and NBC studios. We walked there a couple times and had a good time there.Food--we went to Foley's for breakfast. The whole restaurant has got a full view of the Times Square so it doesn't matter where your table is. Breakfast is buffet style, our server Samuel is great. Coffee is delicious there as well as the fresh orange juice. Food is good in quality, we loved the smoked salmon, hash brown with sun-dried tomatoes, lean bacon, sausage, as well as plenty of fresh fruits such as strawberries, watermelon......very yummy and healthy start of a day. Price is around $23/pp, half price for kids.The hotel itself is great in general. Small lobby but who wants to sit in the lobby when you're at Times Square?! Our room is very clean, quiet, with marble bathroom. We got a nice sized room with 2 double beds, a sofa chair, an executive desk, tv.....very nice size based on our previous stays at other hotels in NYC. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything was perfect except the bed and pillows We arrived around 1 pm and were immediately offered a room. We always look at the room first. We requested a room overlooking Broadway. Big mistake UNLESS you go higher than 15th floor. The huge, market quotes ticker on the Morgan Stanley building raced by continuously. We then asked for a room on 7th Avenue. It wasn't ready until 3:00 pm which was check-in time. We looked at that room which was an end room which didn't have a full side-to-side view so we asked for another. The third had a great, unobstructed view on the 25th floor overlooking 7th Avenue. (They do a have several rooms facing Times Square but they cost more and have obstructed side-to-side views.) The windows are really large. The room itself was sort of dark and cave-like, about 350 square feet, large closet, normal Marriott furnishings except for the bed which was cheap and hard. Don't stay here if you want a comfortable bed. The pillows were really small and cheap as well. We asked for and received four more. The bathroom was beautiful, elegant marble tile and a soaking tub. Everything was very clean. Service was excellent, friendly and helpful. Foley's restaurant is a must for the best-in-the-city Times Square view. Breakfast was delicious and well prepared. Location is fabulous, right in the heart of Times Square which is safe and bustles 20 hours a day. Perfect if you have theater tickets. You have to take an elevator to the lobby and another to your floor. No problem because they are fast and available. We recommend for location, cleanliness, friendliness, view, window size, closet size, bathroom elegance. We do not recommend for sleeping comfort.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">2nd trip - still FANTASTIC Stayed at the Renaissance in Jan 2006 and had a wonderful time so it was our 1st choice of hotel when we decided to revisit NYC in Sept 2006. Rooms are well appointed with a huge deep bath for a long soak after a hard days walking around the City. The beds are so comfortable it is hard to get up in the mornings. (Thick DURHAM mattresses). The pillows are soft and fluffy. The rooms are cleaned every day with fresh towels left. Rooms have direct dial telephone, internet connections, mini bar, television and a safe for your valuables. Hotel lobby has bell boys who open doors for you and greet you with a smile on entering the hotel. Guests take a lift up one floor from the lobby to the reception area on the 1st floor. This adds to the feeling of security for guests. The hotel itself is in a fantastic spot - right in the heart of Times Square. ( 7th avenue and 47th street). Handy position for visiting all major tourist sites and very handy for the TKTS kiosk for your theatre tickets. Hotel concierge OMAR deserves a special mention, nothing is too much trouble for him. Recommended places to eat - Try SPARKS restaurant for a fantastic fillet mignon. For breakfast - you must go to ELLENS STARDUST DINER on 51st street. Wannabee Broadway stars singing to you while you tuck in. Fantastic experience. Kids may enjoy the MARS 2112 experience - opposite the Winter Gardens theatre - dinner served by aliens. For a real treat, take a river cruise on the WORLD YACHT. $90 dollars each but worth every cent. Great food, music and dancing. The music and view at the Statue of Liberty will bring tears to your eyes.Places to visit - Empire State Building, Top of the Rock, Bronx Zoo, Central Park, FAO Schwartz toy shop, Trump Tower, Grand Central station, Ground Zero, Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, NYPD museum and 5th Avenue shops.I will definitely be staying at this wonderful hotel again.</p></li>
