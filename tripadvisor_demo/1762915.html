<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Brand new JW Marriott in Indy. Stayed for busines and it was really nice. I expected it to be much nicer than a standard metropolitan Marriott. To me there was very little difference. I have no complaints, just wasn't blown away. Very nice, clean and good staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The new JW Marriott Indianapolis is nice...but not as nice as other JW Marriotts where we have stayed. It is a beautiful hotel but I feel that the Conrad is a more luxurious option in the city. Would I stay there again? Sure, but the conference crowds can be overwhelming.</p></li>

The views from the hotel are great, but by far the hospitality and friendliness of the staff was the best part of the hotel. They bent over backward to help my wife with something. A great hotel, and I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a wonderful place. Helpful and friendly staff are everywhere. I was met at the door by someone who took care of my registration and then walked me to the elevator that went to my floor with no hand held out for a tip. The rooms are very clean, large, and well appointed. Restaurants and bars are first class. Nothing at this property is a bargain, but I left feeling I had received an excellent return on my money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The facility is clean, fresh and the fitness center was the best Marriott fitness center I've visited. Very impressed over all. Most importantly, it's been a year since my last visit. On my first visit the hotel had been open for only a few months. On that visit I expected the staff to be especially courteous since they were making a first impression. I'm pleased to say that a year later, the impressive impression continues.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was so happy to learn that I would be staying at the brand new JW Marriott while on business in Indianapolis. The hotel was beautiful, the service was wonderful, and best of all the hotel connects directly to the convention center. I ate in the restaurant multiple times and ordered room service and each time my food was amazing. The room was clean and modern, and best of all you received free internet and bottled water daily.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A welcome addition to Indy... Great exterior and fantastic foyer. Something went wrong with the design of the room hallways, they look very typical 70's standard american hotel in my opinion. Service was well above expectations, on site restaurants were great, fitness centre and spa was excellent! Fantastic conference facilities also. 12.95 per day for interest which is annoying. Room Service menu was a bit unappealing to my tastes..</p></li>

The room was clean and the shower was great. There are two spray heads located about 2 feet lower from the shower head to envelop you in water.</p></li>

The staff were cheerful and very helpful and considerate, but frankly a $200 a night hotel should avoid excessive add-on overcharging.

I would like to note that they have upped their game, and had a lot of Westin type features. I was impressed. Also, they have a newer shampoo and soap type...really nice...better than the soap from the last Marriot I stayed at. I would stay here again.</p></li>

Rooms were very clean. We also ate at the Sunday buffet which was also very good. It was $16 for the regular buffet and $25 if you wanted Bloody Mary's. The sports bar, Velocity, was crowded on a Saturday night and had plenty of TV's. Located on the west side of downtown Indy, you could walk indoors all the way to Lucas Oil Stadium or the Circle Center Mall.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the JW Marriott in Indianapolis for a conference in October. It was an excellant stay! The staff was very professional and friendly - especially the front desk staff. Rooms were well appointed and cozy. Everything in the hotel sparkled with newness.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am a die-hard Marriott loyalist and stay in one of their properties 99% of the time. This property offers exemplary service, quality restaurants, and active and friendly lobby bar and a concierge lounge that is open all day for elite members. The staff can't do enough to make stay comfortable and welcoming from the moment your arrive. The city's sky walk system makes getting from place to place easy regardless of the weather...well worth the few extra dollars for star treatment and qualiity service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a fantastic view. Lucky enough to get a corner room and with the floor to ceiling windows the view was spectacular at day and night. Well worth for this reason alone. Service good. Room was very tastefully decorated. Breakfast excellent. A few minor disappointments: had to ask for a second robe twice, wifi was not free as advertised, car parking expensive and there was no fridge in room. These disappointments were far outweighed by the many positives found in this hotel. A great stay. Well worth it!</p></li>

Breakfast was very good. They have a buffet with everything or you can order off the menu. A great fitness room. Inside walkways are an easy way to get to the mall or other restaurants downtown. Underground parking is very convenient.</p></li>

The employees were the most helpful and friendly that I have ever run across. I travel for a living and stay at at least 50 hotels per year and was surprised at what I experienced at this property. The Italian restaurant was great and had pricing comperable to local restaurants instead of being overpriced like most hotel restaurants. I look forward to my next stay at this hotel.</p></li>

The staff is very professional & polite, from the valet to the front desk clerk to the bell hop. The room is very well decorated & we had a great view of the city from the 30th floor. We had access to the Executive Lounge, which I highly recommend...free Pepsi products & snacks. The location is perfect for attending a football game or any other event in the downtown area. I highly recommend the JW Marriott for the traveler that likes to be pampered. :-)</p></li>

The hotel is new and beautiful. The rooms are great -- very clean. The pool and health club are above average for a downtown hotel. The health club even has refrigerated bottled water (free) and chilled towels. The concierge lounge has great views of the city and serves delicious food in the morning and evening. You can't go wrong with this hotel. The JW is substantially nicer than the standard Marriott in downtown Indy.</p></li>

New hotel with the a Starbucks on premise, sports bar, upscale Italian restaurant and a super reasonable buffet breakfast. Comfortable beds and generally quiet except for the occasional emergency vehicle sirens (Fire station just a block away). Staff was friendly and helped us score some tickets for a sold out event.

Every detail has been considered. Staff is A+. Location is excellent. Connected corridor to mall and restaurants around the convention center. Even though the price is high, you get your money's worth. The only con: parking is way too expensive.</p></li>

The lobby area is beautiful and check in was quick and easy. I was concerned that our view wouldn't be great as we were on the back side of the hotel, but we had a great view of White River State Park. Ask for a higher floor and either side will have a great view. The room was very large and exceptionally clean and well appointed. A mistake on our bill was quickly taken care of and we had a great night in the hotel. We would recommend the hotel to anyone coming to Indy for a stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a nice new hotel in a good location. The glass full length windows made the downtown views awesome. I had a room right across from the AAA baseball stadium and could watch the game. The rooms are very large with a large tv with lots of channels. The hotel is designed for trade shows and has plenty of spots - but ends up with long walks. The food was good, internet very good. There is a TGI Fridays next door if you want food outside the hotel. A good tip - take the green line bus from the airport for $7! it picks up and drops off less than a block from the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A friend and I stayed here Halloween weekend. Quite simply one of the best Marriotts where I have stayed. The lobby, common spaces and rooms are tastefully designed. Rooms are more spacious than at most marriotts, and we had an excellent view of the white river park. Concierge lounge was fully stocked, had excellent view of downtown, and best of all is open on weekends. One of the best hotel fitness rooms I have seen. And paid under $100 a night, and were even comped for the valet parking. Staff was very friendly, no line at check in. Definitely would stay again any time I am in Indy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is very nice with modern decor and a perfect location. It is next to te White River park, museums, NCAA builing and Victory field. The bar is nice. The only complaint was a request for a rollaway. I was there for three nights and needed a roll away bed for the last night. I requested the bed at check in and the clerk said no problem. However, the third day when I went to confirm the bed request, I was told that with two queen beds they were not allowed to give me one due to a fire hazard. The extra person had to sleep on the floor. Without this issue, I would have provided a 5star rating across the board.</p></li>

On the fist night my wife and son went looking for a pop machine, they asked at the bar and was told "there are no pop macines in the hotel." The bartender promptly gave them a pepsi and a rootbeer. The second day their adventure was riding a city bus and exploring the Childrens Museum. He bought a toy submarine that needed baking soada to work. My wife asked the kitchen and was given a large quantity of baking soda. Great view and comfortable beds work but "happy wife = happy life"</p></li>

They called shortly and dropped off room key and during turn down service they left a little popcorn treat and a card to apologize for the room key glitch earlier which was not a big deal, but I appreciated the gesture. The hotel and restaurant staff (Ate at High Velocity) was very attentive and friendly. LOVED the floor to ceiling windows, had a high floor room with great views. The fitness center was the best of the hotel gyms in the area and the hot tub was great!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a really nice hotel. The service was amazing. Each staff member we encountered really made us feel welcomed and invited. We spent a long weekend at this hotel and the lobby is always busy no matter what time of day. As big as the hotel is the pool area was unusually quiet in the morning, which was nice. Location is 10 minutes walking distance to most downtown shopping and dining. The closest CVS/Walgreens is a little farther and closes at 7pm. Parking is convenient but a little high at $28 a day. You need a room key to go up the elevator - it's good for security but can be annoying if everyone in your group doesn't have their own key.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First off, this hotel is clean and safe. That is what I always check for first when booking a hotel. The location is great, pretty much right downtown. We had a wedding to attend at the Indiana State Musuem so this hotel was perfect for that. The outside of the hotel and the lobby are both lovely. The rooms are very modern and nice (although nothing overly spectacular). My only real complaint is that I requested a King bed in March, our stay was the end of July, and we didnt get the bed. Not a huge deal, but it was important to me and I had requested it so far in advance that I was really disappointed that they couldn't give us the bed we had asked for.</p></li>

Quick elevators, convenient to get to/from rooms, meeting rooms, and lobby/businesses. Great variety of lobby restaurant choices. Excellent downtown location, can walk to anything needed, including minor league ball park across the street (or watch the game through the conference area windows!). Take the IndyGo green shuttle from airport for only $7. No problems with housekeeping service, front desk staff and concierge very friendly. Organizing meeting rooms was not as smooth as desired. Would certainly stay again if in the area.</p></li>

Everyone was friendly and helpful, they almost answered your question before you asked it! We will most definitely stay here the next time we visit Indy!! The room views were incredible, the beds were comfortable & the room had pretty much every ammenity you could want. Plus there was no annoying window air conditioner to deal with. The Children's Museum and the Indianapolis Zoo are very close, the zoo is close enough to walk to. Victory Field is right next door & depending on which side of the hotel you're on you could watch a game from your room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family stayed at the JW Marriott on the way to a big family reunion. We found a great deal for this hotel on Priceline! Anyway, the hotel was easy to find, parking was cheap ($6/ day) for a major city and the hotel is right across the street from a museum and a big park. The hotel itself is modern in style and guest services (touch screen lobby directory and free wifi). The rooms were very clean, the towels and linens were soft. What I did not like is that the ice machine was on the 2nd floor, and staying on the 14th floor, we found that inconvenient. Also, in order to use the internet service IN the business center I had to pay. 40 cents/min. Other than those things, I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Indianapolis.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed at the JW after a wedding. It was fabulous. The decor is fresh and contemporary and everything is (of course) brand new and sparkling. We found the staff to be helpful and friendly. We did eat & drink at High Velocity off the lobby. The ambiance is fantastic but the service left quite a bit to be desired. The rooms are well appointed but are missing a mini bar and fridge. That was surprising for a hotel of this status. The views are fantastic! We faced the city which was stunning at night - you can see the "Christmas Tree" downtown and the beautiful skyline. Park views are also beautiful. This is a unique and fun choice in the myriad of run of the mill downtown hotels. I would choose it over the stuffy Conrad any day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This new hotel in Indianapolis by far exceeded my expectations. Beautiful hotel, professionally designed modern facilities and rooms. Abundant, helpful, and very friendly staff! Rooms were superb! Clean in every corner, comfortable bed, amazing view of the city from the floor to ceiling wall size windows! (I was on the 24th floor), flat screen Samsung TV in the rooms, room service, video checkout. Hotel was a short walking distance from the State Museum and the Eiteljorg Museum (both worth seeing) and Fridays restaurant. On site restaurant and bar/cocktail lounge. The cities sky-walk also connected to the hotel making it convenient to get around the city and avoid traffic. I would love to come back to this hotel for a longer stay next time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Was recently in Indy for the Dealer Expo 2011 and stayed at the new JW Marriott. Just approaching the building is incredible - one of the most beautifully modern hotels I've ever seen. From the moment we walked in, the attention was on us. There is someone to help you around every corner and they don't have an attitude or seem like they are being bothered. My ONLY issue was the quality of sleep. I understand it is a brand new hotel and so the amenities are also brand new. With that being said, I would have slept better in the back seat of my car. The bed was extremely uncomfortable and all we had were down pillows - I ended up using the throw pillows to sleep on. With the lack of sleep aside, it was a wonderful hotel & we had a wonderful stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this brand new hotel for a week long conference and enjoyed every minute of it. The staff are obviously trained to cater to the needs of every guest. My room on 29 had a great view, super fast elevator service and an awesome multi-headed shower. I used the laundry service three times and it was done perfectly, with same day service. Pickup the phone and there is instantly help on the line. Right night to the hotel is a AAA minor league baseball field and I enjoyed a night game there within sight of my room. Great access to the central canal with bike rentals and for general strolling. Breakfast buffet is copious and well prepared. The fitness center is topnotch with plenty of machines and free weights. Costs a bit more, but worth it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed there for couple of nights on 20th floor. OMG, the view is breathtaking!!!!!!! The hotel is brand new, everything is shiny and colorful and smells nice and new. We got a corner room so two walls were all glass from top to the bottom. My son did not want to leave the room, he enjoyed the view so much. The room was very clean and nicely decorated, the bathroom is big and very well designed.The halls are nice with beautiful artworks. We were very impressed with breakfast buffet, and it was not overpriced, only $16 per adult, $8 per child. The location is great, you can walk everywhere in downtown. We loved people at the hotel, everyone was so helpful and friendly. Overall, my new favorite!!!!!!!!! We highly recommend it to everyone. Kids friendly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the JW this past weekend. Booked a king room and when we checked in they gave us a room with two doubles. Not really what we wanted since nit what we booked. When called front desk was put on hold for ten minutes before told they had no king rooms available. Is it a huge deal? No, but when we stayed at the JW in Cancun I just got the feeling they would have built us the room we booked if they didn't have it and this place was just...not available, not even a sorry. They offered a key to the concierge lounge which from where we were you had to ride two different elevators to get to, exciting. We actually just cancelled an upcoming reservation we had here and are staying elsewhere. The other place not only takes your reservation but fills it correctly.</p></li>

BUT....we decided to do a little Friday night getaway and stay in the new JW Marriott in downtown Indy last night. UNBELIEAVABLE! We were on the 33rd floor, top of the hotel with a perfect view of Lucas Oil Stadium (home of the Super Bowl this year) and couldn't believe the beautiful hotel's amenities. The executive lounge was all decked out for the Brickyard 400 and the buffet in the Pronto restaurant downstairs was just awesome. This is the largest JW Marriott in the world....over 1000 rooms....and we'll be back. Just spectacular! Good job Marriott!! (NOTE: $28 to park is a bit steep and no real pool to speak of)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Although Indianapolis will not see its Colts in the 2012 Super Bowl, the city is already a huge winner with the addition of this first-class hotel. The JW is in a complex with three other Marriott brand hotels. They share a common parking garage and have access to the new skywalk which makes it possible to walk all the way to Lucas Oil Stadium without ever going outside (by going through the Convention Center). The hotel is a couple of blocks west of the center of downtown, but the skywalk remedies this as you can connect directly to Circle Center Mall as well. Rooms are good sized and well apportioned. The breakfast buffet was very ample with a good selection and well prepared. If you can include this in your package, it is worthwhile as is an upper floor room with a view.</p></li>

So I booked the room a few weeks in advance and it turned out to be the same night of Peyton Manning's Children Hospital Fund raising event with Kenny Chesney performing. The place was a ZOO, but the plentiful staff that was there to help was wonderful. I kind of got the feeling they would have helped me go to the bathroom if I needed it! lol The place is beautiful, clean, relaxing, very accommodating, and romantic. I wish we would have gotten the King room but we got two queens and slid them together so it was no big deal. The view of the city was great as well. Did not have time to go to the bar or restaurant but they both looked awesome. I would for sure go back!</p></li>

Other rooms had a great view of the baseball field. Fitness Center was great - had plenty of treadmills, elliptical machines, weights, etc. Concierge Lounge was the best part of the hotel -- enjoyed the free breakfast and afternoon snacks. They even had desserts in the evenings! Downsides - no ice machines on each floor - you had to call Guest Services or go to the second floor. I felt silly having to call someone to get me ice, so I didn't do it. Having to pay for wifi in my room. I wish Marriott and some of the higher priced chains would just give free Internet access - or at the very least offer it free to Marriott Rewards members.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is my 3rd stay at this hotel. I dont travel alot for business but when I do I try to stay in better hotels as I like to be comfortable and dont want to stress about things. This hotel always meets those expectations and this visit in particular. Everyone here is very friendly and helpful - even doing something minor such as giving me toothpaste which I forgot rather than having me buy it in their little store area. It was raining and they offered me an umbrella without me asking. It is stuff like that that sets this hotel apart from others, including its sister hotels in the immediate area. If you have a chance to stay on one of the upper floors, do so. I was on the 33rd/top floor and the views, particularly at night were incredible. I will definitely be coming back to his hotel.</p></li>

The rooms are modern with the latest technology. Call ahead to ensure you get a high room with a view at no extra charge. The atmosphere is classy and upscale. Osteria Pronto is the Italian restaurant downstairs and it is great! If there is something not on the menu that you want, ask the chef and he will personally go get it for you! It's definitely one of the best hotels in Indy if not the best!! The negative side is that you have to pay for parking in the garage. I talked with the hotel desk clerk though and got it for free.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for one night. From start to finish, the JW Marriott staff did everything possible to ensure that my stay was a positive one. When we checked in, we were walked to the elevators. On the way, I mentioned leftovers from lunch, and the employee offered to send a refrigerator up to the room. It arrived promptly, and the front desk called to ensure that all was satisfactory. Upon checkout, we checked with the concierge about catching the IndyGo shuttle, and we were given a coupon for $2 off a ride. In addition, the room was well-appointed and had a beautiful city view. I also really appreciated the connected Skyway to the Centre City Mall and restaurants in downtown. I didn't need to carry my bulky jacket with me - it was great! I just wish that WiFi was included in my room rate. For me, that is a must-have.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">OK, I've been disappointed recently in a number of hotels that claim to be first-class (are you listening, Westin Tampa Harbour?) but this hotel really, really reminded me of Great American hotels. Excellent, attentive service by LOTS of people. Great part of revitalized Indy. The hotel is positively charged with positive energy (it is apparently THE place to meet and greet in Indy these days). Tasteful rooms (not large, but not tiny) with outstanding views of the city. The food may be forget all the bad meals I've had recently. I had roasted chicken, something I don't eat a lot of on the road but eat at home, and it was THE best roasted chicken I've ever had. Negatives? Food is pricey, as you might expect. Internet access isn't world class, just OK. Rooms are on the smallish-size. But that is IT. This is the ONLY hotel I want to stay in, in Indy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here on our wedding night and paid for the romance package which included strawberries and champagne and late checkout. When we got back from our wedding, the strawberries and champagne were not in our room so we asked the front desk and they said they couldn't deliver those after midnight but we could have them the next day (not as romantic at 10am on a Sunday morning). The next morning, despite our late checkout (3pm), housekeeping knocked on our door around 10am and I informed them of our late checkout, they apologized, yet came back again about a half hour later. Our stay was not romantic and not relaxing so we left early and just went home. I've stayed here several other times and yes, it's a beautiful hotel and the service is generally great, but very disappointed that we didn't get what we paid extra for on our special day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I got engaged at The J.W. Marriott this past weekend. Everything was so nice. The arrangements between my finacee and the hotel were done exactly as asked. We were acknowledged by the staff throughout our stay and made to feel like royalty. I couldn't have asked for a better proposal site. We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is really nice. We had a room that overlooked Victory Field and Lucas Oil Stadium to our south and the zoo and IMAX to the west. The restaurant is pretty good too:) The location of this hotel is superb. I definitely give it the 5 star rating! We look forward to another stay in the future. This hotel does not have a spa, but it does have two massage rooms. I didn't enjoy my massage as much as I could have because the radio was broken, so we had to listen to kids screaming in the pool area and people talking in the hall during our massage . The massage itself was nice though.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a huge JW. 1,000 rooms. This means the lobby is busy at times and somewhat chaotic. It is a beautiful hotel with great views from the rooms. Nice rooms of a fair size for a city hotel. Concierge lounge is open seven days a week and busy. Now the negative. It is a new hotel and the bugs are not worked out of it yet. Great 40” HDTV with actually HD picture – when it works. Clearly some bugs to work out – staff was aware. We went the first 90+ degree days for this hotel and it was hot. The “green” HVAC for the room does not work when you are out of the room. This means that when you get back from that 90 degree weather outside the room was 74.9 degrees. Place the thermostat at 66 and it will get down to 71. The king bed was hard and the shower has a drain that is a good ¼” from the tile—you hit is constantly. Parking is expensive -$28.00 self Overall it’s a great hotel that is still getting out the kinks.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the moment you walk into the lobby, someone is there to greet you, check you in, and make all your wishes come true. But seriously, they do try to accommodate all your request the best can. I was able to get a room on the 30th floor, city view, and complimentary access to the concierge lounge; not bad for my first stay. You'll definitely noticed how courteous the staff is after they walk you to the elevator and show how operate it using your room key; an extra touch that adds to the class of the hotel. The room was stunning and tastefully designed with ceiling to floor windows that added to the breath-taking views. For anyone visiting Indy, I would highly recommend this hotel. Positives: Courteous staff, Tastefully appointed rooms, Accessibility to downtown attractions, Wide range of services and amenities. Negatives: Parking, internet access, and renting in-room movies is a little bit on the expensive side.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this Marriott while in Indianapolis for a conference and it was first class in nearly all respects. The hotel is located in the heart of the downtown area, just a few blocks from Lucas Oil Stadium, the convention center and right next to a minor league baseball stadium. I was immediately welcomed by the staff and the interior of the hotel and its facilities were very nice and well-kept. There is a small indoor pool and hot tub and a large, well-equipped work out area. My room was on the 29th floor giving me a great view of the river and the adjacent IUPUI campus. The Italian restaurant on the first floor was excellent and they also have a sports bar with lots of room to sit and socialize and above average bar food. My room was very nice and large, lots of room to spread out and work or relax. The furniture and decorations are also nice and well-kept. Overall, this is an extremely nice hotel, a definite step above most others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I spent a couple of nights in the new JW Marriott this weekend and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Pros: Our room on the 32nd floor was large, comfortable, and very clean. There are staff members everywhere, eager to be of service. The concierge lounge was wonderful. I was appreciative of the security - a room key is required to get the elevator to go to the guest floors. The exercise area rivals most full service gyms. Skywalks connect the JW Marriott all the way to the Circle Center Mall, the convention center, most of the largest hotels downtown, and Lucas Oil Stadium. The restaurants are all very nice. Cons: Parking is limited and a bit pricey ($28/night for self-parking). The pool is tiny. Finally, the heating/cooling system includes motion sensor technology - it will shut down when you leave the room to conserve energy. This is a nice touch, but when it is hot outside the room will be rather uncomfortable upon entry.</p></li>

<li>The concierge lounge was wonderful.</br></br></li>
<li>I was <span style="background-color:#911eb4">appreciative</span> of the <span style="background-color:#911eb4">security</span> - a room key is required to get the elevator to go to the guest floors.</br></br></li>
<li>The exercise area rivals <span style="background-color:#fffac8">most full</span> <span style="background-color:#fffac8">service gyms</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>Skywalks connect the JW Marriott all the way to the Circle Center Mall, the convention center, most of the largest hotels downtown, and Lucas Oil Stadium.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">restaurants</span> are all <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">very nice</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>Cons: <span style="background-color:#9a6324">Parking</span> is limited and a bit <span style="background-color:#9a6324">pricey</span> ($28/night for self-parking).</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#808000">pool</span> is <span style="background-color:#808000">tiny</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>Finally, the heating/cooling system includes motion sensor technology - it will shut down when you leave the room to conserve energy.</br></br></li>
<li>This is a nice touch, but when it is hot outside the room will be rather uncomfortable upon entry.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the JW Marriott the week before the Super Bowl in Indianapolis. They were really on top of everything. The service was awesome and the staff friendly and helpful. They were more than willing to go out of there way for you help you find restaurants and accommodate you in every way. They have an onsite spa so you can book massages. $89 for an hour long massage and it was wonderful. Stayed on the 30th floor. Fantastic view- windows went from the floor to the ceiling. Room was immaculate and I found the bed and pillows quite comfortable. There were other people on the floor but the rooms were so quiet I couldn't hear anything. Bathroom was very nice. Glass shower and three shower heads. The location was great and didn't seem that pricey given it being Super Bowl time. Food & drink prices reasonable. Nice lobby bar w/ unique cocktails. Try the ginger crush cocktail very delicious. It's a downtown hotel I will definitely stay at again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 4 nights during the Brickyard. What a great find. The hotel was very clean, and the staff could not have been friendlier. Our room was well furnished and very comfortable. We asked for a refrigerator at check in, and they promptly brought one to our room. Hard to find this at most hotels (at no charge). The sports bar near the lobby has great food, and at reasonable prices. We ate there 2X and had no complaints. Great tap beer selection as well. Kudos to the bell staff. They were on top of everything we needed. Furthermore, we got into a cab one morning and the driver tried to gouge us on the fare to the track (double the price). I immediatley got out of the cab and informed the bell staff at the door. They promptly took care of the matter and kicked him out of the lot. At any rate, we would stay here again in a minute. The only thing I wish they would change is the price of internet access. Most places throw this in now days.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the JW Marriott for one night this past weekend. I was impressed by how quickly I was greeted by the staff at the front desk and the quick check-in. We stayed on the 25th floor and had a spectacular view of the city. The bathroom was quite luxurious at first, but the door into the bathroom and shower door can make it a bit awkward to use, and the toilet paper holder is not easy to use as well. The room was quite spacious and had very contemporary decor. I felt that they did cut corners in quality of decor and furniture around the room. The mattress was firm and made it difficult to sleep peacefully through the night. My husband slept perfectly, and I understand that this may be different for everyone. The office chair was already showing some wear and tear, and the decor seemed cheap. JW could have put a little more effort into the quality in the rooms for being a luxury hotel, but it was overall a pleasant stay. I would stay again at a reasonable rate.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I are sitting at the Indianapolis airport waiting for our flight back to LA. Our experience during the Superbowl even was absolutely fantastic! The city of Indianapolis did a marvelous job of hosting the large crowds. Traffic was a bit chaotic, but that's to be expected. The city is so compact, cozy and safe that walking to everything was a breeze. Especially since you could use the skywalk to get to most places. And the JW Marriott did a fantastic job of hosting a massive amount of celebrities, former players, TV analysts, corporate executives, journalists and the NFL itself. The crowds were large and demanding, yet the staff remained extremely polite and friendly at all times. The people of Indianapolis showed other cities what a good host does, which is to make the guests feel special and welcome no matter how hectic things get. Well done Indianapolis and JW Marriott! The NFL would be absolutely crazy not to bring the the Superbowl back to Indianapolis very soon!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a lovely property. Just not to my personal taste, as it felt cold and hard to me. Having said that, all employees were exceptionally helpful and pleasant. The room was spacious, with a glass wall window overlooking the park. Glorious evening sunsets from the bed!!! Beware - the windows "pop and crack" which is kind of unnerving the first time you hear it - sounds like the wall is going to blow out! The location is on the edge of downtown, so any restaurant/coffee house is at least a two block walk. It is right across from two museums, with easy access to the canal (lovely area to walk), and on the other side of the building is Victory field for those who enjoy baseball. Parking costs more at this location than at other "name" hotels just a couple of blocks away - as much as $10 more per night - but if you don't mind walking, you don't have to use a car. Internet available for a price. All in all, lovely area with kind employees. I'm just more of the "warm and cozy" type.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The JW Marriott in Indianapolis really knows how to pamper its guests. We have visited twice in the last couple of months and have totally enjoyed ourselves. The first time we used the shopping package and received a gift card to use at Simon Mall which is the Circle Centre Mall and the breakfast buffet on Sunday. The 2nd visit we used a Marriott EBreak rate the weekend of Thanksgiving. We were on the 27th floor and could see Monument Circle where they had the "tree" lighting on Friday evening. They do not have ice machines on each floor and when you are in need of ice, you just pick up the phone and call and they bring it right to your door. The room service is excellent. They usually say 30 - 45 minutes but it is never that and all the employees are so kind and considerate. The corridors are very quiet at night - have never heard a sound in the halls. I will go back and back and back to this hotel. It is so convenient to the Indianapolis Zoo, Victory Field and Lucas Oil Stadium where the Colts play.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Marriott with our 12-year-old son for an event at the very nearby Lucas Oil Stadium. We checked in at 2:00 in the morning and were greeted warmly by a team of 2 or 3 front desk staff. The lobby was large and spotless and we saw lots of amenities along the way to our elevator. Our room (2 queens) was really beautiful. Brand new, gorgeous large bathroom, modern, and even an iPod dock on the alarm clock between the two beds. The beds were comfy and the heavy drapes kept out all of the sun as we slept in the next morning. We found a note from the front desk staff slipped under our door in the morning when we woke up. They noticed how excited we were that there was a brand new Starbucks right in the building (hey, we're from Seattle), and so they gave us a card for a free drink! Now that's service! We didn't use the fitness center, but we walked though it and it was modern and gorgeous. Lots of great equipment, light, and space. We all felt very at home at the Marriott and would definitely stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've had the pleasure of staying at this location twice since it's opening in early 2011 and both visits have been wonderful. From the time you walk in you know you are in someplace special. The staff actually walks out from behind the individual desks to greet you and check you in, and the walks you to the elevators and directs you to your room and amenities. The rooms are beautiful and many feature views of White River park, the baseball field, and the local museums. The hotel is within walking distance of all the local attractions, and if it's a rainy day you can take the covered skywalks to Circle Center Mall. Be sure to check out the fitness center. The exercise bikes feature video screens that are similar to video games where you can track your progress, and the chilled towels (two temperatures are available!) are a great refresher at the end of your workout. The complimentary disposable earbuds are also a nice touch. I've stayed in many locations in Indianapolis including the Westin and the older Marriott, and this is the best by far.</p></li>

<li>The <span style="background-color:#ffe119">rooms</span> are <span style="background-color:#ffe119">beautiful and many</span> feature views of White River park, the baseball field, and the local museums.</br></br></li>

<li>The exercise bikes feature video screens that are similar to video games where you can track your progress, and the chilled towels (two temperatures are available!)</br></br></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had expected a better hotel that other Marriott locations we have stayed at before. As a platinum elite member I had hopes for this location while taking my family here but was greatly disappointed. Upon arrival after 4:00 room was not ready. We had to wait an hour and half for housekeeping after being told it would take only 30 minutes. We had plan on shopping but lost value time waiting on JW. It would have taken longer if we had not ask what was taking so long. Found out they forgot about us. We waited in the lounge for elite members but they appeared to be unprepared as there were no snacks available and would not restock. Also upon our return in the evening the lounge was was also out of dessert and was told sorry again due to being unprepared again. Room was OK but rather small compared to other Marriott locations we have visited. Currently considering canceling future reservations due to poor service. The hotel is a long walk to anywhere interesting other than the convention center. Forget about carrying shopping bags from the Circle Centre.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a first class hotel and no doubt one of the best in Indianapolis. It is practically brand new, and is within a reasonable walk of the major sporting venues downtown (Lucas Oil Field and Conseco Fieldhouse), as well as the NCAA Hall of Champions and other nearby museums. It is connected to the Indianapolis Convention Center, a large downtown mall, lots of restaurants, and other major buidlings downtown via a skywalk system. The only real downside is parking. The JW Marriott shares an underground parking garage with three other connected Marriott properties (a Courtyard, a Fairfield Inn, and a Springhill Suites). Each feeds into the same three level garage using different elevator banks, but guests at each are competing for the same spots. Much of the garage is taken up by "valet only" spaces. The weekend I was in town for the Big 10 tournament, the self-parking spaces frequently were full, leaving no choice but to pay for $40 a night valet parking or else park across the street in a public parking garage. A small inconvenience, but somewhat annoying nonetheless.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My mom and I stayed here for the weekend when we came to Indy to see the DCI World Championships. What a beautiful hotel! I expected as much being a part of the JW series. I loved the underground parking and also how the parking garage was color coded to let you know where you needed to go. Check-in was super easy & the young woman at the front desk walked us to the elevator and explained all the hotel restaurants & other details we might want to know. Our room was perfect! It was clean, well-stocked, & had everything we possibly could want in a hotel room. We did however hit a snafu with ordering room service. It took us about an hour & a half at about 1:00 a.m. to get our room service order, but the hotel was great in making it up to us by deducting our room service bill by 50% since the food was delivered warm & was actually very tasty. This by no means hurt my rating on this hotel! We had breakfast in Osterio Pronto, and it was pretty good. The hotel overall was very nice, clean, the staff was very accomodating, and the decor was just gorgeous! I highly recommend this hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Beautiful, New, Top Notch....unless they are hosting a large event! I chose the Marriott for its location, price and ambiance. The hotel is new, beautiful and in a great location. The rooms were well arranged, had great interior design and the beds were very comfortable. The staff was all very nice, very helpful and willing to step up and offer assistance. The real issue was that the hotel was 90% occupancy and the staff was happy to share that information in preparing you for service delays. The hotel entrance was congested and backed up into the intersection of Washington and West Street. The staff though nice, struggled to organize the mass amounts of patrons, valet parking management and general organization. The pool was so overrun that enjoying the facility was nonexistent. Both of my children were disappointed that we really could not swim and enjoy the facility. The restaurant and service good. If this is a test for Super Bowl 2012, they still have lots of steps to take to meet the expected customer service for a JW Marriott. Had I known that the hotel was at 90% occupancy, I would have chosen another hotel Downtown.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Currently staying at the JW Marriott in Indianapolis for a business conference. Upon arriving on a bus from the airpoirt, was greeted by bell staff. Walked into the lobby where there were at least 10 front desk people standing in front of the front desk to assist. She promptly escorted me to the check in counter. As a Marriott platinum inquired about a possible suite upgrade and was given a corner suite on the 26th floor with amazing views. I was not just given the keys and told were the elevators were, I was escorted to the elevators, she inserted the key and pressed my floor. (i have had experiences like this before, but usually at a Ritz Carlton or St Regis, never at a convention hotel) So far I have interacted with about 8 team members for the hotel, all who are always smiling and very courteous. I have easily stayed about 1000 nights in a hotel over the past ten years. Of all of those experiences, never have I experienced the most consistent high level of service throughout a property, that I have at the JW Marriott Indianapolis. Obviously this property has high standards influenced by a very effective management team. Great Job!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in the executive suite with my husband at a discounted rate the night of 1/1/12. Excellent hotel. Brand new. The suite had a double shower with all kinds of shower heads and plenty of hot water. king bed. 2 baths. no tub. 2 TVs. Mattress very comfortable. View fantastic. Nice small pool in building with a hot tub. Very nice gym with view. Had room service for breakfast which was very tasty. They forgot salt and pepper but brought it quickly when I called. Mini fridge and coffee maker in room. The room was clean. We stayed on the 28th floor and the wind was a bit loud but didn't bother me. Excellent heating and a/c system adjustable by the half degree digitally. 2 restaurants on property. Tried the non Italian restaurant for drinks and dessert and was very good(this is also the restaurant that does the room service). Parking is expensive($30/night) but was free for us because of the holiday. There is a government parking lot that may be available at times and is worth a try because it is much less expensive. This hotel is in a wonderful location and has walkways to many other destinations like the Convention Center and Circle Centre Mall.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The new JW Marriott was a perfect place for a weekend getaway. The design and quality of the hotel far exceeds anywhere I have ever stayed at in Indy. We checked into the hotel on a very busy Friday evening. There was a convention in the hotel plus a baseball game right next door. Even with the events and people, we were still greeted like VIP and able to sail through the check in process with no issues at all. Our room was on a high floor and even though our view did not face downtown, the view out over the baseball field and zoo/park/river areas were quite beautiful. Our room was very well appointed, comfortable, and clean. No complaints at all. We utilized the fitness center and were extremely satisfied with the quality of the facility – cold towels, bottles of water, and wonderful views from all the machines. We visited the main lobby bar for some pre-dinner cocktails and thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance and drinks. I would highly recommend St. Elmo Steakhouse for dinner which is an easy walk from the hotel. I would also recommend checking out if the Indianapolis Indians have a home baseball game and if the weather is nice, take a walk over to the zoo.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The JW is brand new, having opened in 2011. Overall, the whole hotel just works nicely. Check in was easy, they walked me to the elevator (no idea why), the lobby is great with a nice bar off to the side, and the overall atmosphere of the hotel is just very pleasant and relaxing. The room I was in seemed typical (judging from the floor layout on the back of the door), super comfy beds, big flat panel TV, good lighting, and the bathroom was nice - not huge, but good sized. As noted in other reviews, it is odd how the bathroom door opens into the bathroom - it blocks the tub, and opens on the toilet. OK, that is fine, but personally if I designed it I'd open the door on the tub and not the toilet. But hey, we all have our preferences, eh? The hotel is basically on an urban trail, so you can do up to a 5-mile run out the door of the hotel (ask for a map), and it's next to the AAA ballpark (across the street). Parking is expensive, so look into options if driving (I was not), and as all higher end hotels seem to do, they charge for internet in the rooms (any why is it the cheaper hotels often don't?). In sum, it's a great business hotel in the center of Indy...certainly not a resort at all, but if you are in Indy looking for a resort you're in the wrong place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Check in went well and was given a room on the "B side" of the property overlooking the White River, and a few museums, a GM plant but not much else. The clerk walked me to the elevators but failed to tell me how to use my room key to access the floors above the third floor. The place still smells new (a good thing my wife stayed home) and the room was well appointed. I particually liked the iHome radio where I docked my iPod for the duration of my stay. The wakeup phone links you to a real person and not an automatic system. The king bed was equipped with a down comforter with a spare blanket, I shed the comforter and just used the sheets and blanket. You can hook your electronics up to the big flat screen through a panel of connectors, but I had to ask for the cords (no charge) even though the in-room literature said they were in the room, no big deal. The bathroom was a little skimpy on towel racks so the vanity was a little buisy. They do have recycling recepticals in the room (too bad my wife couldn't be here to see them. I only ate breakfast here, not a bad deal ($16.99), they even bring you your choice of newspapers. I opted for the internet connection and chose the basic (slow) service which was very slow. The second day I paid the extra $3.00 and got the much better service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In January we reserves a Club Level Guest Room, with a City View on the top floor. $455 after tax The room was booked on the jwindy.com website and claimed it had access to a Lounge where complimentary snacks, sodas, and breakfast could be found. I received a confirmation and have a copy on hand. I received a reminder confirmation the day before my check in date. I did not review it, since I had before. The confirmation number is the same and so is the $455 price tag. However upon arrival to the JW Indy... I was told the best available was on the 29th floor with a "Park View" the view was not what we reserves, the room was not located where we had booked it to be, We did not receive access to any lounge and breakfeast was an additional $16 a person. Not to mention.... The price tag remained the same! I have yet to get an answer as to how. The staff was polite and friendly, but it was obvious that they hotel is new and so was the staff. I'm trying to get better contact informatio, but want folks to CHECK YOUR CONFIRMATION! Don't get me wrong! THIS IS A GORGEOUS BRAND NEW HOTEL AND THE STAFF IS VERY FRIENDLY!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for a 3-day conference in September. It was my first time in Indianapolis. Was really impressed by the size of the place - it's absolutely huge - you could probably spend a whole day walking around it (the place even has its own Starbucks!) As it's fairly new, everything was in pristine condition and my room was finished to a really high standard. I had a corner room, pretty high up, which had floor-to-ceiling windows along two sides. This meant fantastic views in the day (wow, Indianapolis is flat!) and the views at night were gorgeous. As it was a corner room the room was big and had more than enough space for me. The bed was really comfy and everything was absolutely spotless. The only thing I disliked was the air con. It was like there was only 3 settings: cold, more cold or off. It was a bit frustrating not to be able to control the temperature yourself. Also, had a bit of an issue not being able to connect to the room WiFi (but this could've been because of the conference going on). Anyway, I reported it, it was resolved quickly and I was given 24 hours complimentary service, so I was quite impressed by that. Check-in was fast (considering the amount of people they were attending the conference) and service was spot-on. Overall, this is a great hotel which has everything you could ask for, which made for a very comfortable stay. Would highly recommend.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a spectacular addition to Indianapolis that is really convenient for the Convention Center, to which it is linked by a walkway, and the Lucas Oils stadium. It is also a brisk walk to the city center, either on the street of through the myriad walkways. Firstly, from beginning to end of my week's stay there, the staff were attentive and polite, the only hiccup being the safe in my room that malfunctioned but it was immediately dealt with, the remedy being a new one being installed. There are two restaurants, the High Velocity sports bar is just that - nothing special about it except that it's a handy facility to have on your doorstep. The Osteria Pronto restaurant was extremely good, so good in fact that my wife and I ate there a couple of times. It is not cheap, but if you are a wine drinker, then the cost can be somewhat contained as it is supplied in a variety of measures to suit both the pallet and the wallet. Although I'm not an avid gym addict it was one of the best, if not the best, gym I have ever used. All the equipment was very new, as is to be expected, but a nice touch was the plentiful supply of refrigerated wet towels that were there for guests' use. Alongside the gym was the smallish swimming pool but I cannot really comment on it as I did not use it. A spacious, well laid out room with a comfy bed made sure that I got a good sleep every night. All in all, a great new hotel and I will definitely return.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very Nice Hotel with Great Service”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I traveled to Indianapolis for the weekend. I found out that our trip coincided with opening weekend of the new JW Marriott. We booked it via the Marriott web site getting a very good rate. Overall the hotel is very impressive and the service was exceptional. We found the hotel no problem. It is directly across the street from the Indianapolis Convention Center and it is a short drive from downtown. Check in went very smoothly. We were immediately greeted by the valet as we pulled into the driveway. The Gentleman at the check in desk was also very helpful getting us a speedy check in then escorting my family and me to the elevator (nice touch). Our room was located on the 30th floor. The floor to ceiling windows enhanced a fantastic view of the city. As one would expect on a hotel's opening weekend, the room was spotless. The room has nice modern furniture and the bed's were comfortable. For Marriott rewards members, the Executive Lounge was extremely nice - one of the best I've seen. The hotel offers an indoor pool (kind of small) and a very nice fitness area. We did eat at the Velocity Sports Bar in the hotel. It was a nice casual restaurant with good food. One exception was my wife's steak which was way undercooked, but the waitress made it right and took it off our bill (without us even asking). I can't overstate how good the service was here. They certainly had plenty of staff on hand to help with every need possible. It was certainly a great opening weekend and I look forward to staying there again in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here with a convention for 2 nights. Fast check in, I asked for a high floor room and got 17th, about 1/2 way up. Others in the group were higher without the request. Place wasn't very full. Plenty of people on hand for service. The card in the elevator could be a pain but the elevators were amazing at fast response. I'm with the others about all the extra costs like internet and $28 self park. I couldn't even get a stray wireless from elsewhere. Also got stuck in the garage as my keycard expired later in the day I checked out. Pushed the button on the garage gate and they let me out. Room was nice as would be expected. Not that big but great bed & pillows. Great TV too. Liked the big bathtub, plenty of hot water & pressure. A/C in the room worked great but had low limit of 66 which in realty was about 68. The fan turned on & off constantly all night. I like white noise but not on for a couple off for 5 minutes. I'm surprised there aren't complaints about this. Some, like me, would find it hard to sleep. Room had no bath towels, had to call the office to get them. Another in our group complained to a housekeeper about his room not being cleaned at 5PM. Not sure if he ever got taken care of. Lobby bar was a bit pricey but servers were nice. Didn't go into the sports bar but food prices didn't seem out of line. The Italian joint was good and prices not much above Mac Grill or Olive Garden. I expected it to be steep. Might be a good destination for non hotel guests looking for Italian downtown. Hot tub was hot but didn't bubble as expected. Pool was cool but bearable. Liked the longer hours than many hotels/motels.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This brand new hotel has created significant excess hotel capacity in downtown Indianapolis. It is better than competing hotels and may be triggering a price war in the area. I booked at $129 with a group discount, a great non-Priceline non-Hotwire price for a hotel of this quality. Location: This hotel is adjacent to the Indianapolis convention center and football stadium and is on the local transit system express shuttle bus route to and from the airport. Suggestion: Take the Indygo Green express from the airport for 7 bucks instead of taking a taxi for $30. If you ask the driver to drop you off across the street from the JW on the way in (at the start of the loop through the city) and catch the shuttle at the JW on the way back (at the end of the loop through the city), the travel time is about the same. Rooms: My room was clean and well furnished with desk/pullout computer table, comfortable chair, large screen TV, and normal amenities coffee/tea, bathroom with tub. Bed was large and comfortable. Suggestion: Request a room facing east for a nice city view and wake up to rising sun. Service and food: The front desk staff was very efficient and helpful. On premises restaurant was slightly overpriced with standard items characteristic of decent convention hotels. Suggestion: If you want to escape from the convention bubble, head one mile to Shapiro’s Deli for classic corned beef on rye, pastrami, matzoball soup and local color. I know – a New York Deli in Indy is not plausible, but this is a local favorite. Or walk a half mile to Palomino’s, a midlevel chain with a mix of items, from local cheeses through standard Italian fare to steaks and seafood.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I visited this hotel/city as a late Valentine's Day celebration. The hotel just opened a few months ago. Rooms are very nice-large and comfortable with large windows. Comfortable chairs, desk area, flat screen TV, large closet. Bathroom was large with nice amenities. We had an upper room with views of White River State Park and the White River. Service was wonderful-from the clerk at the front desk through everyone we ran into until check out. All were very helpful, asking how we liked our stay, smiles...very much appreciated. Location was near several attractions-Indiana State Museum was across the street and within walking distance. Indy Zoo, White River Gardens, & Victory Field are all very close. We didn't use Internet or any other services. Valet/parking is available on site, but is $28 for regular parking/$32 for valet. There is a parking garage across the street connected to the hotel by a skywalk that is available for less than half the price that we utilized. We had breakfast in the Osteria Pronto restaurant-also very nice. Lots of the regular breakfast fare plus a made to order omelet bar. Lots of fresh fruit, danish...great assortment all around. And again, service was great. Very attentive without being overbearing. My only complaint about this hotel was the bill....a $50 "incidental fee" was tacked on to the bill when we checked in to cover damages or extras. No mention of this on the confirmation or at check in. Was assured it would be removed and credited to my card within a week. Suggested that they might want to mention this somewhere along the way so it's not a surprise when you check out. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a downtown Indy visit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for a gymnastics meet held at the convention center. When booking, you will want to upgrade to the concierge level. More on that shortly. Check in was prompt and efficient. Staff were very helpful. Hotel layout is fantastic except some of the elevators don't go to some floors so look sharp. Hotel rooms were spacious and clean. Have everything you would need except for maybe a refrigerator or microwave. Our shower was great...had three jets and the water was fabulously hot. There is a Starbucks on the second floor. A real Starbucks, not a "we serve Starbucks." There are two restaraunts in the hotel. I didn't eat at the Italian place but it looked rather pricey. The sports bar was very upscale and had a good selection of food and drinks, at about regular pricing. The food there was pretty good. If you have a chance to upgrade to an executive room or get upgraded, you will want to check out the Lounge on the 31st floor. They have snacks out all day, breakfast in the mornings, sodas and waters in refrigerators all day and beer/wine for purchase in the evenings. Plenty of TV's and couches for relaxing. Very comfortable for unwinding. Hotel is centrally located and connected via skywalk to the convention center and other hotels. There is a mall in walking distance as well as numerous other restaraunts at all price levels. They do have a gym and indoor pool. Gym had ellipticals, treadmills, machine weights and some free weights. Was health club quality for sure. And they have chilled wet towels for cooling off, if one might need that in Indianapolis in the winter. In closing, this was perhaps the best hotel I have ever stayed at. Very clean, very upscale. If I could choose one hotel to live in, this would probably be it. Very impressed and glad we stayed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I thought the JW was to Marriott what the Conrad is to Hilton but I didn't find that to be the case. The hotel is massive and very state of the art with every bell and whistle you can buy today but I just thought it would be more plush and opulent. If you were blindfolded and put in a hotel room you would think you were at any nice upper scale full service hotel, including their full service Marriott sister hotel down the street. Service was pretty good except for I also experienced the problem with the key system which I was ok with, even though unlike another reviewer I did not get a nice note or any sort of turndown service for my inconvenience. However there was one problem with not having a key and that was gaining true access to the workout facilities. At check-in I asked about gaining access without a key and was told just to come back to the desk and they would let me in, ok no problem, but what they didn't say was that once you are inside of the exercise complex you need a key to move around freely. Without a key I couldn't even get in the women’s locker room to use the facilities. Why the place is locked down like Fort Knox inside the exercise room I have no idea but if you have a key you probably wouldn’t notice the inconvenience. On the plus side the equipment is all state of the art and plentiful! Aside from the key issue and my coffee/tea amenities in my room not being replenished during my stay everything else was fine. Employees were courteous and friendly. Lobby bar has a nice atmosphere with a drink menu that is fun and creative. I highly recommend the basil lime gimlet for a refreshing treat! Once they work through the opening hiccups they should be fine, but I'm still not sure the value is there for the hype I’ve heard over JW’s elsewhere.</p></li>

<li>Why the place is locked down like Fort Knox inside the exercise room I have no idea but if you have a key you probably wouldn’t notice the inconvenience.</br></br></li>
<li>On the plus side the equipment is all state of the art and plentiful!</br></br></li>
<li>Aside from the key issue and my <span style="background-color:#A00000">coffee</span>/tea amenities in my room <span style="background-color:#A00000">not</span> being replenished during my stay everything else was fine.</li>
