<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Clarendon is just a fantastic property. The crowd are diverse, hip urbanites and the decor is very artsy-'70s. We will absolutely be back to this property and loved the little amenities, such as late-night snacks and a hot tub that seemed longer than a football field. Fun decor that brings retro design into 2012. The restaurant and lobby bar are great and the staff friendly and attentive.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved this hotel, it is a great 'find'. The bed was wonderful, the staff was extremely friendly and attentive, and the pool area was very enjoyable. This was my first trip to Phoenix and I had to travel throughout the city during my stay, this hotel was near the center of everything. You can definitely tell the owner takes great pride in this 'boutique' style hotel and has done a wonderful job with this property!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my second stay at The Clarendon. Liked: the hotel's attached restaurant, it has a great ambiance and very good food; the pool, pool area patio, and roof-top patio are awesome and great places to relax; good-sized flat-screen t.v. ; and rooms are fairly spacious. Be aware, however, that this is a former motel, with cinder block walls. Perhaps not for everyone, but overall a fun atmosphere and very helpful staff.</p></li>

I like The Clarendon in Phoenix, AZ very much: they have a cool pool with a huge hot tub, the design is very tasteful, the staff is friendly and helpful. There is a yummy Mexican-themend rastaurant, cool music everywhere, the rooms are spacy and comfortable. Don't expect it to be luxurous (the baths are a bit old), but it is fantastic value for the money.</p></li>

Large suites, great views from the rooftop patio, and amazing cuisine in the Gallo Blanco Restaurant make this a perfect place to either unwind or conduct business with important clients.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great place, probably built in the 1960's but updated nicely and still retains the retro feel. I appreciate what they are trying to provide here, there is a good restaurant onsite, a roof top lounge with great views of downtown and the surrounding mountains. Diverse clientele, lots of younger people seem to be around on weekends. Rooms are large with a bedroom and separate area with seating, desk, refrigerator, etc. Close to the light rail system and downtown.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently was at Clarendon for birthday celebration with boyfriend. They front desk was SO friendly and helpful especially when I told them I was there for birthday. The taco stand is always fun and reasonable priced especially for happy hour. The room was very nice and clean. The whole staff was super friendly and we had a great time. I can't wait to come back. I would only suggest trying to get to pool early enough to get a good spot if you plan on hanging there all day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place rocks! The pool is sparkling, sexy, & always has a lot of eye candy lounging around for both sexes. We loved our retro decorated suite and the fun stuff included in our stay like free snacks after 10pm. We stayed 4 nights and had a blast, dined at the cute restaurant and enjoyed the pool and hip roof deck on top w/ stunning views of Phoenix and beyond. The only thing we would suggest is installing more towel holders and hooks in the bath/vanity area. Otherwise highly recommended!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything was just a little off making me feel a little more dip-ster than hipster. I like things really clean and fresh, this was not the case and even after switching rooms, I had to do a little cleaning making me wish I could get my hands on a vacuum. All that great Phoenix air and no way to get any of it. The staff was super nice and accommodating, the bar and pool are great, I am just a room kind of person and am focused on the bed and the bathroom.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was on a last minute business trip and all the cities hotel rates were double because of conventions. Expedia found this nice boutique hotel that was close to downtown but off the beat and path. It's located in a residential type area. I really liked the very metropolitan feel with all of the clean lines and unique furnishings. Alicia was great. She changed my room so that I would have better internet reception to work that night. Really enjoyed the stay. Reminded me of the south outside and New York inside. C. Williams</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Clarendon Hotel on September 25, 2010. Still hot as Hades in Phoenix, so we were thrilled with the sub-zero air conditioning and the awesome 42" flat screeen TV. Check- in was seamless and staff was extremely knowledgable about the area. We took the light rail (a 5 minute walk from hotel) to Sun Devil Stadium as recommended by staff. Room was clean and well apportioned. Plenty of towels and great hot shower with plenty of water pressure. We will stay again and will recommend to all our friends and family. Keep up the great work.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Work suggested a chain hotel. I looked online and found the Clarendon nearby. Clean, comfortable room. View of open courtyard and pool. Rooftop bar with view of city and mountains, very nice around sunset. Great little bar with good microbrew selection next to the lobby, with good restaurant attached. Friendly staff. Convenient location Reminds me of Jupiter Hotel in Portland and the Motor Lodge in Prescott. Places with a little style, not the run-of-the-mill rooms in most hotels. Recommend highly. I'll definitely stay there my next trip to Phoenix.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My company held a 3 day conference at the Clarendon with 20 attendees. They upgraded their meeting room chairs which were very comfortable. They're privately owned and take customer service as a serious priority. Rooms are spacious, beds are the same as Ritz Carlton, free mini bar, in-house restaurant with locally, organically grown and purchased food items. They immediately responded to any special requests and treated everyone as if they were VIPs. I highly recommend the Clarendon for your travel and business needs or if you want to hang out and chill.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was in Phoenix on business and I stayed at the Clarendon from Sunday to Wednesday - I love this place! There is a sense of arrival and relaxation in the middle of the city. The pool offered a place to relax and enjoy some cocktails. The culture is trendy and chic. The restaurant Gallo Blanco offered a welcoming atmosphere. The staff at the hotel were exceptionally attentive and they were at our beck and call. The staff at Gallo Blanco - God bless them - they are great! There are so many places to eat - but if you want a great Mexican Cuisine - don't go anywhere else!</p></li>

Made reservations for June for dinner, two poolside rooms, and also arranged a late checkout so we can swim all afternoon Saturday... I am pretty sure that the big chain hotels would not take care of you this way- something to consider when planning a stay-cation or traveling the countryside=locally owned establishments take care to take care!!!!

A minor car accident the morning of my arrival caused the locking mechanism in my rental car to break. Ben, the owner and his electrician, Gilbert, came outside, took my door apart and fixed it on the spot. Saved me tons of $$$ on the car considering that I opted to waive the insurance. My room was upgraded to a wonderful suite overlooking the pool with custom furniture, 2 TV's and the most comfortable bed outside of my own!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I live in the Phoenix area and anytime I want a "staycation", I always choose the Clarendon Hotel. I've always gotten excellent customer service and the rooms and pool are wonderful! It's modern and classy, but not pretentious. As others have said, the downside is that it isn't really near anything too exciting (shopping, nightlife, etc) nearby. Aside from that, I have no complaints. A huge plus for me is that the hotel is not a chain--hotel chains typically just have "okay" customer service and the design, layout and rooms are rather mundane. The hotel has a personable feel to it, yet has four star ammenities.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I would highly recommend this hotel. While others have suggested that the outside needs some updating, we found it to be just perfect and more European in design. The room was delightful and unique in its presentation and again, had a much more European feel to it. The customer service was excellent. Parking and location was easy and safe. The hotel is located midtown/downtown and is close to other attractions. If you are tired of the typical corporate chain cookie-cutter hotels, this is a perfect choice for getting off the beaten path. For future business and social travel to Phoenix, the Clarendon will be our hotel of choice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently I had an overniter in Uptown (North Dowtown) Phoenix and had a wonderful stay at one of the few true boutiques in Phoenix. The Claredon is what a boutique was meant to be - trendy, but doesn't break the bank, centraly located to great food (Fez, Ticoz) and bars and a room you wouldnt mind holding up in for the night. The staff was pleasant and though there was construction, it was not intrusive to our stay. My partner in from out of town was thrilled since his company booked the hotel and we were meeting up downtown. It cost less and was a lot easier to manage (avoiding all the downtown one way streets). A definate recommendation for any Phoenix stay. K. L.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I will keep it factual. Upon check-in I was not told that my credit card would be pre-approved for "any incidentals that may occur", I was told the bar would be open until 12am, it was closed at 10pm, by an undertrained bartender. Wi-fi was only available in the hotel lobby, it would not connnect in my room or at the pool. The heat in my room did not work. Very few outlets available in the room. There were half-empty shampoo bottles left in the bathroom. The shower knob fell apart, the attendee offered to repair it himself or change my room, which left me with no time to shower before my flight. The food in the restaurant was good. The bed was comfortable and clean. I will not return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have been to Phoenix a number of times because my son went completed his undergraduate and law degrees there. I wish I had been staying at the Clarendon during more of these trips. I cannot say enough good things about my time there. The bedroom had a remote control a/c unit so the Phoenix summer was not a problem. Also, there was an empty mini fridge in my room, so I was able to put my own beverages in there and not pay charges for overpriced candies. The flat panel tv in my room and the pool go unmatched in Phoenix. The rooms were quiet, but there was a DJ near the pool, which seemed like a lot of fun. Next time I stay in Phoenix, I will definitely be staying at the Clarendon! -M. Meyer</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel at the last minute on Expedia just before hopping on our flight to phoenix from Hawaii. Arrived at 4.30am and was very pleasantly surprised. Check-in was smooth and friendly. Room was spacious and very nicely furbished. Huge flat panel TV and the king size bed was fantastic. Room was very quiet (top floor of the tower). Appreciated the coffee machine in room. Bathroom was small but adequate - not a problem. The artwork in the foyer and rooms is great. Love the cowboy motifs. We didnt use the pool but it looked great. Breakfast was more than adequate and best bagels I have had for a while. Free international calls were much appreciated. Would definitely recommend to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the moment I came through the door, I was treated with friendly service tht was above and beyond what I have experienced at most "chain" hotels. From the bottle of water and "Otter Pop" I received when I was registering to the Kit Kat when I needed a chocolate fix later that night, I felt like the most important person staying there. And the price was definitely reasonable. The Clarendon staff was always ready to answer and question or help me with anything I needed. The Rooftop seating is a great place to enjoy the morning sunshine. The little touches of decorating genius had me and my camera very busy. The room was clean, but the carpet need a good steam cleaning. The bathroom was immaculate!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Enjoyed stay. Great service, comfortable, and very spacious room and the bed was excellent. Can't say enough about the service. From the General Manager (Ben) to each and every staff member, this is a very friendly and accomodative hotel. Thank you! I gotta say that the courtesy car within 5 miles of the hotel is a huge plus! This is very convenenient and valuable. For example, if you are going to a baseball or basketball game or a pub or eatery in the downtown area enough can't be said about how the staff do their best to get you when you need. Very nice! What other hotel in ARIZONA would do that for you as a courtesy? Thanks. Stayed one night Friday June 22nd 2007. Certainly earned my loyalty - thanks again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a great hotel! We are here now, and I did not want to wait until I got back to home on the east coast.The Clarendon is awesome! We arrived late last night from out flight, and the hotel staff was ready and waiting for us. Wow, talk about pleasant and informative, the nice young lady that checked us in showed her true love of her employers and business. The rooms are pleasant and fun, the beds are comfortable, and that is a big plus in my book! The whole hotel has a great atmosphere. We ate dinner at the restaurant tonight, and ate fantastic food at great prices. We came out here to visit my brother's daughter in St. Joe's Hospital and were lucky to be also close to the hospital. Would come here again for sure!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I did not care for this hotel at all. My room was right above the on-site restaurant. The first night the noise of the dining room was tolerable. However, the second night there was a live band playing until 9pm. I called the front desk to see if I could change rooms and they said I would have to pay for an upgrade! The room was clean but a little run down (there were dings in the walls, the mirror in the bathroom was chipped and the shower wasn't very clean). The hotel looks like it was previously an apartment building. The walls were all concrete and it felt like I was staying in a jail cell. Do not stay in room 234. Pros: They didn't make me pay for the third night I had originally booked and the beds were VERY comfortable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'm currently staying at this hotel and it certainly was a great find!! Both the exterior and interior are very fun and clean. The pool area looks adorableee!! The rooms are very spacious, I have a big bed with incredibly comfy pillows, a huge flat screen, mini bar, a long desk and bathroom. They really paid a lot of attention to detail, adding little accents here and there that make this place special (including the super relaxing ambient music they have playing in the room when you come in - nice detail!). I just got back from two supposedly 4 star hotels that didn't even have showercaps, it's refreshing getting to the Claredon and seeing a message that says everything is complementary (toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving kit, sewing kit... even international phone calls). I would highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I came to Phoenix for two film screenings end of June, and the Phoenix Art Museum put me up in The Clarendon. I'm usually not too keen on hotels and yearn to get back to sleeping in a home. Not this time... The Clarendon was the perfect mix of classy, relaxed and artistic. There are free night time snacks at the front desk! Endless coffee, tea and bottled water. Awesome pool, powerful yet adjustable airconditioning, big tv and rooftop patio . Dreamy beds and a real personality. And they are dog friendly- I didn't bring my dogs but I enjoyed seeing them around. I could never understand how people could live in a hotel, but now I do. I could live at The Clarendon. I am intending to go back in November 2011 to shoot a film in the desert. Lisa Anita Wegner Mighty Brave Productions/ Dufferson Herman Arts Umbrella</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">my husband and I stayed here for 3 days and 2 nights in the hot month of august. very chic hotel, being remodeled and looking amazing. we used the complimentary shuttle (electric car... bonus points from me!) to take us to several local, fine dining restuartans. we found these great places to eat on the hotel's website. even more kudos from me for suggesting such amazing food! my husband loved the large flat screen mounted on the wall. the pool area was quite comfortable and chic. also the entire room set up was perfect with refrigerator and organic bath products. the staff was so helpful in getting us anything we asked. complimentary bagels and coffee were great and really good! i just loved the feel of the place. very modern... very unlike other chains surrounding it. it will definitely be the place we stay on our next visit to phoenix!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed here for business and will be doing so again this week. It's well-located to get to Sky Harbor and other parts of metro Phoenix, and having a decent restaurant is a big draw for me. I did not get a chance to use the pool although it looks very nice, and overall it was pretty quiet. The rooms are nicely decorated, although this does not mask the fact that this is an older block-construction building so it has more of an upscale hostel feel as opposed to higher end boutique hotel, as well as a bit of sloppiness in painting and maintenance. However, the beds are nice and that plus the general atmosphere makes this preferable to a major hotel chain in the same price range. When booking keep in mind that you will have a $20 per night hotel convenience fee, plus a slew of local taxes that will add about 25% to the quoted nightly rate.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the big, Covered parking, parking lot; to the airport style luggage carriers, the funky exterior, we knew we lucked on to a great place! Entering the hotel, it was lively and we were greeted and checked in painlessly, with the elevator close by. The rooms surround the pool, which was clean and fun with a LARGE hot tub called the hydro pool, as it was as wide as the pool. Jets were great. The room had all the amenities you could want, and included in the room price. No gauging! There is a 20$ hotel fee that they were sure we knew about. It included internet, local paper at the desk, free snacks at the desk in the middle of the night, etc. The town, as well as the hotel guests, rave about the tacos at the hotel restaurant. My fav extra was the luxurious house robes. The bed was so comfy great that I felt it should have it's own sentence. GO, ENJOY</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not quite downtown so that would be the "lost point" in my rating. Check-in staff is very nice and helpful. They saw me on TV and did everything they could to help me get a cab, carry my heavy props et al. Very helpful beyond the "call of duty" :) A former condo complex converted into a well-appointed and surprising hotel. Rooms are well- equipped. Phone is FREE for international calls! iPod player, cool TV, nice bathroom and attention to details. If you are hungry and jet-lagged at any time of the day you get FREE snacks and small plates during the happy hour. Hungry for a nicer meal? Their TexMex restaurant serves some tasty food items in a nicely decorated area. The staff in the restaurant is also simply perfect! And if it is a warm day and you need to chill out, the amazing pool and its lounge chairs is waiting for you in a very modern atmosphere. Highly recommended!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were very pleased to arrive at the Clarendon after a long drive from San Diego and felt very welcomed by the friendly receptionist. The Clarendon is a breath of fresh air from chain hotels and the little touches of an independent hotel were much appreciated (such as Aveda toiletries and a real hairdryer!). The $15 "resort fee" is great value, and includes a free evening snack bar (much appreciated after our long trip!) as well as wi-fi and free local and international calls. We loved being able to call our family in Australia without worrying about the cost. The only downside to our stay was that our room seemed to be quite noisy, including the window rattling in it's frame throughout the night, which woke me up a few times. I was too tired to follow this up at the time. The pool area and rooftop deck looked great, and it was a shame we didn't have the opportunity to use these on our short stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent a night here for a little 'staycation' and really enjoyed it. The staff was very friendly, the bed was SO comfortable, with about five big pillows. I loved that they offered free snacks in the evening, and the restaraunt was good too. We stayed on a Friday night, and the restaraunt was lively, but not overpacked, we ordered some chips and guaco and took them to the rooftop. Great views! It was totally empty up there, I thought it was staffed on the weekends, but maybe not. The pool was nice, the waterfall feature was a cool touch, but I did notice the tiles around the pool could have used a good scrubbing. Overall everything was clean and orderly though. The pool wasn't crowded either. Only complaint was that our air conditioner woke us up early by making this buzzing sound every five minutes like an alarm clock, weird! Overall we had a great time and would be happy to stay again.</p></li>

<li>We stayed on a Friday night, and the restaraunt was lively, but not overpacked, we ordered some chips and guaco and took them to the rooftop.</br></br></li>
<li>Great <span style="background-color:#808080" title="p=0.999">views</span>!</br></br></li>
<li>It was totally empty up there, I thought it was staffed on the weekends, but maybe not.</br></br></li>
<li>The pool was nice, the <span style="background-color:#808080" title="p=0.942">waterfall feature</span> was a cool touch, but I did notice the tiles around the pool could have used a good scrubbing.</br></br></li>
<li>Overall everything was clean and orderly though.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#9a6324" title="p=0.998">pool</span> wasn't crowded either.</br></br></li>
<li>Only complaint was that our air conditioner woke us up early by making this buzzing sound every five minutes like an alarm clock, weird!</br></br></li>
<li>Overall we had a great <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.993">time</span> and would be happy to stay again.</br></br></li>

I live and Tucson and my friend lives in Flag so we dicided to meet in Phx for one night. I wanted a hotel that was central, had a cool, unique feel and a restaurant/bar inthe hotel. The Claredon did not disappoint. From the check-in to the cafe to the matinence staff, all of the people who were on duty were amazing and friendly. I loved the unique, relaxed feel of the place and the special touches in the design that you see all over the place. I loved that the mini bar, internet and parking were all included in my room rate, so many hotels now a days add on fee after fee for all the little stuff. It was very nice to have it built in to the cost of the room. The rate was a little higher than I would of liked ot spend but there was so much going on in town that I understand. I would visit again in a heartbeat.</p></li>

I do it all day. But what this gentleman didn't realize is that you have to gauge a customers interest by feeling them out. Instead of gauging where I was as a customer, he proceeded to tell me what I should do, how I should make my decisions. "I don't know if you know anything about hotels, but...." in a ridiculously condescending tone. I said I would talk to my girlfriend and I would get back to him, but the gentleman would absolutely not let me get a word in. Feature dumping every little thing he can find about the hotel. This is not a reflection of the hotel itself but merely the undereducated salesman who lost the interest of a customer. I may be a drop in the hat to the "fully booked hotel" and "regular customers" of this establishment, but I am still a person. I would much rather be coaxed into purchasing the place that having it shoved down my throat.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was here a few years ago and loved it. Since then the lobby and pool area have been updated. Pros: The rooms, staff and clientele are still hip, and that counts for a lot in Phoenix. Pool area is very nice. Adjoining Mexican restaurant and bar are excellent - really fresh, tasty food. Nice amenities and free samples. Cons: Condition of rooms has declined a little. Service declined, also. Though we had arranged for a late check-out, we were awoken at 11 a.m. by the phone and asked to clear our room. (After talking, they re-agreed to the late check-out.) No bathtub plug, and when we requested one they never did find one despite a follow-up call. The jacuzzi was being serviced Saturday when we arrived. We had counted on using this to recover from the flight before a performance - couldn't they clean the jacuzzi on a Tuesday morning or some other low-use time? I would still stay here since I felt comfortable being with unconventional colleagues; the environment in Phoenix can be a little scary.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Well, I managed to get a fantastic rate for this hotel via an online booking site, so I really can't complain at all. However, if people are truly paying $100-200/night, I feel as if I should warn them. The front desk was very friendly and very helpful-- but they have to be friendly and helpful when the key making machine wasn't working right and the wireless internet was down. The hotel has been recently painted and decorated and was clean, but you can tell that it is an old building with surface fixings. My sink was new and nice (and the Aveda bath products were nice as well) but everything else (floor, shower) in the bathroom was old. My bed was huge and very comfortable. I have no complaints about the bedroom itself. The wireless internet worked very poorly for about an hour later in the night, so this was very frustrating. The pool and hot tub area was cool and modern looking. Like I said, for what I paid I got a great deal, but if you are planning on spending more than $80/night on a room in Phoenix, I would suggest going elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've been meaning to make it over to this hotel again after staying here about 13 years ago. What a difference the new ownership has made. I had seen the pool area remodel over the years, and now after last nights stay, I got the full flavor of revitalization. As a lover of the boutique experience, I enjoy the retro charm and touches in the lobby. I was booked in a Junior Sweet, and had no expectations when I walked through the door. I was greeted with soft classical music (a wonderful touch, by the way), a clean room with adorable furnishings, and a wine fridge. The staff, from the owner to housekeeping and the front desk were warm and welcoming. I loved every aspect of the hotel, pool area and the fabulous roof top patio. The only two suggestions I would make (actually, my partner would make), is to have a more convenient smoking area, as the hotel front and roof are quite a trek at 3am, AND have some fun in decorating the brick wall view from the glass elevator. Great job guys! Had a fantastic Staycation and didn't want to leave...hence the late check out :-)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you want to go somewhere and feel welcomed the entire time during your stay--definitely stay at The Clarendon. I have never had all my concerns taken care of so quickly. The staff was always ready and willing with suggestions for places to see in the area and if they didn't know off hand they didn't mind printing out directions. It seems like they were always busy but never too busy to help out. The bedding was superb and I have never slept better and housekeeping did a great job every day keeping things tidy. I had some of the best food at the restaurant attached to The Clarendon hotel Gallo Blanco. While the hotel is a little older it has fresh trendy decor and without the attitude that you usually find in newer trendy boutique hotels. The Clarendon holds its own with outstanding service and willingness to make you feel welcome with outstanding amenities. They do have a Hotel Service Fee which is $15 which covers parking, internet and phone calls which isn't too bad considering what I have paid double that in the past for just overnight parking. I would definitely recommend</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Almost nothing to add to what most travellers have already said: Great staff, good atmosphere, free wireless, free worldwide calls and so on - that's simply gorgeous at these incredibly low rates. Compared to the many chain hotels on my recent trip across the southwest the Clarendon is much better and more stylish. I booked on hotels.com and got a rate that was similiar to a chain hotel. On the minus side just two things to add to some stuff that has been said: Our non smoking room has obviously been a smoking room in earlier days - or some guest smoked anyway... that taste of old smoke in the air disturbed me a lot, but not my two friends who were in the same room, so we stayed in there anyway. There has also been some above average noise from A/C and a nearby generator on the street or something similar all night, but a) that's probably a temporary thing and b) we're in a downtown location where such things are to be expected. Be sure to watch sunset from the roof deck. Fabulous! And I like the attitude of the staff here, answering to most complaints immediately. I wish more managers were like this.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visit The Clarendon in Phoenix every month, staying anywhere from two nights to five in a row. The front desk staff David and Reva usually are working when I check in and out and they are always happy to see me, greeting me by name and knowing exactly what type of rooom I get and where. The pool is beautfiul, the waterfall wall is beautiful! The rooftop has the best views in Phoenix of the sunrise or the sunset. This is my "office" for any down time I have during my stay. The Gallo Blanco Cafe is another stellar part of my stay at The Clarendon Hotel! The ceviche is amazing as is ANYTHING you will get on the menu, The Agua Fresca is sweet and delicious and even better spiked! Wednesday night is ALWAYS jammed packed as that is Flamenco night with authentic dancers and singers. The morning staff at Gallo Blanco doesn't even give me a menu anymore they just ask if I am getting the usual! It's awesome! As far as I am concerned, there is no other place to stay in Phoenix! Thank you to all of the staff and owners of The Clarendon for creating a truly unique experience that I will continue to return to again and again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had the luxury of staying at the Clarendon Hotel in early Nov. By no means was the pool completed but I can't wait to go back and see it done. It was shaping up nicely and tile was laid. The staff was WONDERFUL!!! I am always out looking for a fun, cool hotel at a great rate and by far this was it. I would say that it not in the best part of Phoenix but I felt very safe. I wish that I would have had a chance to stay more than one night so I could have seen the night life their. We drove in on a Friday night and didn't arrive until 10:00pm, so we were pretty tired but it looked as though the resturant/bar was a fun place to go. If you are young and don't mind a few minor cosmectic issues (plugs & cords visible in lobby, few small issues near the bathroom in our room) But other than that it was great!!! My only request to Managment is to tell the cleaning staff to look up when cleaning. i would have never noticed but my husband did. The ceilings in the bathroom were a little dirty and to add a TV to the living space not just were the beds were. OH and the beds....FABULOUS and the window shades....very creative!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Clarendon Hotel so I could be close to the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport, as I had an early flight the following morning. The Front Desk agent at check-in was totally professional, friendly and courteous, couldn't have been nicer. The room decor was very cool and trendy. The room had a great minibar set up, and the bath amenities are top quality. Before dinner I went to the rooftop bar for a glass of wine, there's lots of comfortable seating, the view and the Phoenix sunset from the rooftop was amazing, the hotel's owner was mingling with guests, the atmosphere couldn't have been nicer or more welcoming and everyone was having a great time. The rooftop bar was open late, nice touch for a night cap. Dinner in the restaurant was perfect. I'm vegetarian and sometimes meatless entrees are non-existant in hotel restaurants, but the server pointed out several selections, I was impressed. Loved the food, great service, the staff was very attentive, Wish I'd had time to use the hotel pool, again very trendy, with a unique waterfall and fountains that spray into the pool, eclectic and fun. Check-out was fast and efficient. Great experience, I will DEFINTELY be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had a very good time at this hotel, but I'm from Arizona and live in Phoenix so I wasn't as surprised as out of towners might be at things that some might see as flaws and that others might find charming or a comforting reminder of AZ's 70s seediness. The room was just fine, a top floor junior suite that was clean and well appointed. It had two new beds, a very nice, large flat screen TV, and hip furniture. The radio was set to some sort of in-house sound system that put out very cool music that was perfect for chilling in the room. I slept very well in the bed and didn't want to get out in the morning. Fortunately, the staff obliged my request for a late check out. The pool is very pretty, with nice furniture poolside, but I didn't spend much time in it. The lobby is fun, with a nice sitting area to people watch, a bar with good local beer on tap, and the exceptionally good Gallo Blanco Mexican restaurant. I've now been there twice and had excellent food both times. I recommend the chilaquiles and the Bloody Mary they serve. My only disappointment with the place was that the much vaunted rooftop bar was closed before its advertised closing time, on a Friday night no less.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiance and I stayed at this hotel for a quick overnight before I headed out on a business trip. We picked this hotel because of its uniqueness, location and most of all price. It was very easy to find, parking was close. When we walked into the registration area (shares space with the bar) there was a flamenco performance in the room. We thought it was a fun addition to the night, but it was very hard to hear at the registration desk. No big deal for us, but imagine some may find that difficult when trying to check in. When I say it has character, that is true. If you are looking for a "Hilton", this is not the place for you. If you want something that is not the "usual", you should check this place out. The room had fun decor - the window covering was a slide-over picture which was cool. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. Least liked: It is August in Phoenix, which means it is hot and humid. The room did not have the air turned on at all before we arrived. It took quite a bit of time for the room to cool down and in the meantime, it was uncomfortable. Of course, this is Phoenix so it is hot, but would have been nice to walk into a room of cool air after traveling and being outside.</p></li>

<li>We picked this hotel because of its uniqueness, location and most of all <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">price</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>It was very easy to find, <span style="background-color:#e6beff" title="p=0.999">parking</span> was close.</br></br></li>
<li>When we walked into the <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.769">registration area</span> (shares space with the bar) there was a flamenco performance in the room.</br></br></li>
<li>We thought it was a fun addition to the night, but it was very hard to hear at the registration desk.</br></br></li>
<li>No big deal for us, but imagine some may find that difficult when trying to check in.</br></br></li>
<li>When I say it has character, that is true.</br></br></li>
<li>If you are looking for a "Hilton", this is not the place for you.</br></br></li>
<li>If you want something that is not the "usual", you should check this place out.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#aaffc3" title="p=0.998">room</span> had fun decor - the window covering was a slide-over picture which was cool.</li>

<li>Overall, we enjoyed our <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.998">stay</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>Least liked: It is August in Phoenix, which means it is hot and humid.</br></br></li>
<li>The room did not have the <span style="background-color:#911eb4" title="p=0.929">air turned</span> on at all before we arrived.</br></br></li>
<li>It took quite a bit of time for the room to cool down and in the meantime, it was uncomfortable.</br></br></li>
<li>Of course, this is Phoenix so it is hot, but would have been nice to walk into a room of cool <span style="background-color:#911eb4" title="p=0.996">air</span> after traveling and being outside.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had to be in Phoenix for one night and booked a deal on Hotwire. It was a good value for what I was charged but this is not, in my opinion, a 3.5 star hotel. The good. The beds are comfortable with high quality linen and nice down pillows. The room was clean and the bathrooms were well stocked with nice plush towels. Nice large screen TV in room. The room had a small refridgerator and was also stocked with some snacks. I did not use any of these so do not know what the hotel charges for them. The breakfast buffett was limited in offerings but was well done. Eggs, ham, sausage, and potatos were all good and the service was attentative.The bad - this place is LOUD. It is a refurbishished building probably dating from the 50's or 60's and the construction is cement block. Cement block construction alone would make it loud but the the rooms are also built around a courtyard containing the swimming pool. That combined with the the rooftop bar made this a noisy room. If you do stay here make sure you have ear plugs. I picked some up when I went out to dinner and got a good nights sleep on a comfortable bed. Good value at the Hotwire deal price but I would have been upset if I had payed full rack rate.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was really curious about how I'd like this hotel after reading the variety of reviews here. I almost cancelled but decided to give it a shot and try it for myself, which I am glad I did. I am the kind of person who's willing to have an open mind! The Clarendon is a cool place - and I also fully agree with aem49 that its not for everyone. The staff is young - but good, and the whole place has a fun attitude, from the background music to the Employee of the Month photo wall ( you have to see it). The pool area is great and the rooftop happy hour (with DJ) was a lot of fun (at this time of year, anyway). Rooms were large and the bed was very nice, & it had a sort of living room that made me think it would be a great place for a few people to get together and party. My only criticism is that for the price I paid ($219) I would expect a little more attention to detail in the remodeling than they did. You can tell its an older place that's been restyled, but they didn't 100% hit the mark with the quality of certain small things. Nevertheless we had a great time, the free breakfast was good, and I would def. recommend it to the younger crowd. I'd stay there again if I could get a better price next time.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I were able to stay at The Clarendon during Phoenix Fashion Week, m client was showing and we wanted to be close to the venue but not too close so we wouldn't have to deal with traffic. It was recommended by a friend of mine who also recommends it to his family and friends. When I first saw it I was not expecting the hidden gem inside. It looked like a regular hotel with basic amenities from the outside but when you stepped inside you kind of got taken by surprise. It's stunning and definitely has a personality of its own thats hip and trendy. Everything was decorated with thought...The elevator, even the room had original art inside entitled "storms and snowflakes" and little artistic images of the city. Other pluses included flat screen tv, a comfy bed, free wifi (3 different wifis depending on where you are at the hotel..so try all three to find the one thats the best reception), and 2 pools...one pool was on the roof! and it was stunning. The other pool was on the 1st floor and it had a mosaic catwalk down the middle.. My only con would be the air conditioner made a noise every few hours that got to me a little at first, but other than that I plan to stay there every time I need a hotel in Phoenix.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiance booked this hotel to surprise me with an evening away from Flagstaff. I had to be back at work the next morning, so this really was just a quick trip. I loved it! I am from Phoenix and generally hate going there but the view from the rooftop bar was wonderful. The bar was not crowded, but started to get busy as we left, really expensive, but worth it. I have worked in hotels for years and am attempting to get into hotel management and this place is doing a great job. The staff is corteous and I can tell from the number of times the management has responded on this site, that they really care. Rooms are very different. Our bed was incredibly comfortable and the big screen TV was wonderful. It would be nice if they had in room movies, but it was fine without them. I loved the set up of the hotel. I have a phobia of roaches, which can be a big problem in Phoenix, so I am always paranoid about Phoenix hotels. No problems here, which is good for me. We got desert from the restarant and it was very good, but expensive. The evelvator is really slow, stiflingly hot, and it kind of feels like it could kill you...but I'm still here. We forgot our suits so we did not get to use the pool, but it looked wonderful...hopefully next time.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Clarendon hotel perfectly embodies the desert modern aesthetic that I miss so much about Arizona and (parts of) California. I lived in Arizona for seven years before moving to New York City and then Boston. I still come to Arizona for business and when I do I stay at the Clarendon. I wish we had something like this on the east coast. The decor is modern and in perfect harmony with the surroundings; it all just feels right. The rooms are well-appointed and comfortable and it's the nice touches like the big flat-screen televisions, the comfortable beds, the very creative and artistic "curtains" and the quirky selection of snacks in the rooms that make this place really stand out. In addition, I think this has to be the best value in Phoenix. Not only is it fun and unique but the prices are extremely competitive and they're centrally located; close to everything! On top of this, the pool and water wall and lighting are simply amazing. It sets a tone that cannot be beat. I haven't been to the hotel since the opening of the roof top bar area, but the bar and restaurant at the lobby level are also very awesome. This is the type of place where you want people to meet you because it is simply beautiful and your friends will think you have great taste. Admittedly this hotel may not be for everyone, but if you are a fan of Dwell or DWR this is the place to be in Arizona.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am not sure about "Yourconnection's" review on Jan. 5, 2008. It is almost like we stayed in two different places. I did not see any indication that there had been a fire in one of the restaurants. All of the restaurants that were on the property were open when I went only 5 days before "yourconnection" went. Maybe I missed one of the restaurants, but I am sure they were all open to all of the guest. The linens and rooms were great. The customer service was great. I actually liked the fitness room and there were machines in the fitness room that you normally do not find in hotel fitness rooms. I am not sure but you can not compare a fitness chain's facility to a hotel facility fitness room. When I was in the hotel (New Year's Eve) there were a few celebrities staying at the Clarendon. I enjoyed myself and I did not feel like there were security issues, but every person has a right to their opinion. I know that the Clarendon met and exceeded my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone. You will not be disappointed. It is a bit colorful, (in a good way) but it has a style to some of the boutique hotels I have stayed at (in New York, Miami, Los Angeles) for a fraction of the price. The beds are crazy comfortable and the rooms are spacious. The hotel is centrally located to everything. Close to downtown and Scottsdale. Definitely a hotel you want to try if you are in the area. The pool area is very nice too.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">That they took a nondescript, boxy '50s motel and turned it into a desirable place deserves credit at the get-go. It's kind of like W meets Hard Rock -- in the desert. (The hallways are painted purple!) But it's quirky, and the service levels are spotty. I'm guessing that the owners are young. Apparently a number of the rooms have both the air conditioning and, only coincidentally, the hot water reversed. That means you turn your thermostat to "hot" to get cool air; and you turn the shower control to "cold" to get hot water. They've had cable problems (for quite some time, apparently) so there's no movie channels, and there's no pay-per-view. Mostly, take note that there's a gay-hipster-young "scene" at the pool most every night, whether it's happy hour or a private party. It's interesting - for about 15 minutes. The staff seem to be oblivious to the noise in the parking lot, the noise from the restaurant, and the noise at the pool. I'm here on a special rate, so it's hard to complain, but if I'd paid $160+ for this room, I'd be annoyed. This is not a good hotel for families. It is a GREAT hotel for young scenesters who want to stay up late and drink and carry-on. I'd stay here again, I'd just make sure I asked for a quiet corner of the hotel. This place is obviously very desireable to a certain demographic, and I continue to be thankful they've fixed up what was probably only an eyesore -- they get big points for urban renewal!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had a business trip to PHX and decided again that the Clarendon offered a great central location. There was some sort of entertainment industry party going on when I arrived late Friday night. Beautiful types mixed with people who looked like the guys from Flight of the Conchords. Parking was convenient (just beside the building) and check in was quick. I headed straight to my room. I was happy to see that the rooms were still pretty much the same as my last visit. I like the funky art and interesting touches. The bed is still awesome. I slept like a rock and in the morning I headed to the roof for a nice cuppa before starting a day of shopping. I headed to the lobby and used the gym then stopped by the free computer/printer to print off directions to the place I wanted to go... a store that serves as the last stop for Nordstrom's. Full of junk, mostly, but it is THE place to get New Balance shoes for dirt cheap! I spent 3 days/nights at the Clarendon and plan to go back next time :) The people make the difference. I agree with the comments about Ben and the rest of the staff. How many hotels do you actually feel like you know the manager? I have a feeling there are people all over the world that say they 'know' the manager of the Clarendon. There is just something about this laid back, small place that makes me feel welcome and comfortable. Next time I plan to lay around the pool and maybe watch a Phoenix sunset/sunrise on the roof!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Clarendon is a strange little hotel, but in a good way. The outside walls painted with blue stripes give you an idea of what you're in for, but you really understand it when you enter the lobby. Everything is kind of funky retro: bright colors, bold patterns, shiny everything. The front counter was incredibly helpful and welcoming. Our room was fairly large, clean, and comfortable with some nice little features, like a keurig single cup brewing system and to go cups in your room. LOVED that. We're not really pool people, but our room did overlook the pool and we enjoyed people watching. The pool and hot tub area is really striking, with a lot of places to lounge, read, play, etc, a water wall, and some awesome tile work. Couple of minuses: fluorescent lighting in the bathroom. Ick. Also, the smokers (and there seem to be quite a few) all stand right outside the front door and smoke, so you get treated to that crowd and that smell every time you come and go. The roof deck is under construction, but it does provide a great evening view and will be really lovely when it is completed. It's obvious that the property is very much a work in process, but it is still, in it's current state, a very nice, fun, customer-oriented place to stay. Oh, did I mention the front desk gives out free snacks after 10 pm? Because they do. And it's awesome. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is bringing your kids. This is really more of a singles/ younger folks/getaway kind of place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a wonderful time to be in Phoenix! During my trip this February in part for work but also for fun, I had an opportunity to stay at the Clarendon again. I don't know how they do it but they have certainly improved on their already spectacular service and ammenities. Two of the "Must Do's" during your stay at the Clarendon. The awesome roof top sunset exeperience is one. I got a chance to enjoy a beer while watching the sun set from this amazing roof top vantage point. The roof has been recently remodled to give the guest a incredible panoramic view of uptown and downtown Phoenix not to mention the incredible South, Estrella and White Tank Mountains. The roof top seating provided for guests and vistors of the Clarendon certainly hold true the Hotel's creative and unique high end decore. The second must do while at the Clarendon, have a meal at their new restuarant, C4. This restuarant has certianly molded in to the hot spot for the hotel guests and locals. C4 is working with their local vendors and focusing on gearing their menu to reflect the produce and animals raised in the Phoenix Metro and surrounding areas. What again ties all of this together is the attentive employees at the Clarendon. This group certainly knows how to make guests feel how much they value you; from the nice lady who cleans your room and says, "Good Morning", to the person who brings you room service in the evening. Thanks again Clarendon Hotel & Suites... Nick Almendarez Regional HR Manager Los Angeles, California</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Beautiful property - Wish I could say the same about the rooms”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We are locals and stayed at the Clarendon for two nights as a mini staycation in November and used two groupons for our stay. There are a lot of very good things about this property - the pool (albeit unheated), the rooftop deck, gallo blanco, the front desk staff, the complimentary late night munchie bar and free coffee and water in the rooms. However - the main part of staying at a hotel in my opinion *are* the quality of the rooms and unfortunately our room did not match the quality of this beautiful property. 1. Our sink was becoming detached from the wall. Seriously, it was so awkward and I was afraid to put any weight whatsoever on it. 2. The conditioner dispenser was broken. 3. The room's baseboard was peeling/detached from the wall. 4. The walls were so paper thin we could hear the housekeeping staff going from room to room, doors slamming all the time and music from the pool. It was difficult to sleep at all (even trying to sleep in) because of all the exterior noise. I really, really wanted to like this place especially since it's a local business but I can't go back or recommend it to anyone. I would definitely recommend the property for an event -- just not the rooms. We had one more groupon to use on a future visit and I ended up calling groupon and getting a refund. I really hope we were just stuck with a bad room but it's not worth it to me to take the chance. We did alert the front desk staff about our rooms' issues upon checkout and they said it would be addressed - I sure hope it was!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Not Our Cup of Tea”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed there during Spring Training and basically decided it was not our cup of tea. We did get a room that was quiet. And it was clean. We found the decor to be too modern for us. I particularly disliked the dark color on the walls. And I generally found the hotel to be rather run down. The pool was fine, and the over-sized hot tub was neat. Though it was closed one day because someone had broken a glass or bottle nearby and they had to clean it. Of course you're not supposed to have glass in the pool area, but there's not enough staff out there to monitor that. The rooftop lounge is also overrated. Basically blue carpet, lawn furniture, and big umbrellas. Also run down. If you do decide to support independently owned businesses and stay there, be sure to bring your own towels. Towels were at a premium when we stayed. The front desk was always running short on either pool towels or bath towels. We ended up hoarding every towel we could get our hands on. Oh, we were on the 4th floor and the elevator was busted for at least a day. Luckily it wasn't a day we were bringing luggage up to or down from our room. The superior service everyone refers to in their reviews was a big attraction for us. We found it just average. The bright spot of this place is the restaurant in the hotel. Excellent, fresh, Mexican food. They make their own horchata! So for most average tourists who want a down-town Phoenix experience, I'd recommend staying at a hotel on North Central Avenue near the museum. But definitely have meal at the Clarendon's restaurant.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Okay, so first, the good. The staff is really friendly and nice. The rooms are large and the decor is really cute with a huge super comfy bed, a giant full length mirror and a big screen tv. Also, you should definitely eat at their restaurant. I had the unusual sounding chorizo mac and it was great! So, then the bad. First of all, there is only wi-fi in some of the rooms and they won't tell you if your room doesn't have it when you check in. The bathroom is tiny and all white and looks like a motel 6 bathroom. They put no thought into it. There's a nice sink/mirror area, but there is absolutely no lighting. Even after I moved an extra lamp over there, I had to keep going outside as I was doing my makeup because I couldn't see what I was doing and kept getting streaks all over myself. So the first night I got there, I thought I'd check out the rooftop bar that was supposed to be so great. Well it would have been great if the staff had told me there was some kind of lesbian party going on up there! Some big woman came up to me and pulled my hair REALLY hard! None of them were hotel guests, they were all just a big group that was together so they figured I was one of them and it was okay to assault me?!? So then all I wanted to do was get away from all the people and hang in my room for the night when I discovered they put me in a no wi-fi room and I would have to hang in the lobby to use it. I guess it would have been a better hotel if I were a guy, since men care more about tvs than makeup lighting and would probably be thrilled to have some strange scary woman pull their hair.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is an older property that was refurbished in 2000. It is downtown Phoenix where there are no other eating establishments within walking distance. The hotel has a very good, moderately priced restaraunt on site which is open at 6 am for breakfast and stays open for late dinner thru 10pm. The buildings themselves are situated in a big square shape and in the center is an amazing pool and jacuzzi. The pool is well stocked with all kinds of water toys including water guns that all the teens seemed to enjoy. Music is piped into the area and there is even an underwater speaker in the pool! The nice thing about the pool being in the center of the property is that the sun goes behind the buildings in the late afternoon and one does not have to worry about sunscreen... I checked in for a medical conference arriving the evening before it started. Check in was smooth--luck of the draw, I had been "upgraded" to a two room suite. The rooms are enormous! Lots of funky furniture, a well stocked minibar, and crazy window coverings. The room itself was clean and the bathroom amenities nice. There are two robes hanging for use during your stay. Pool towels are available at the front desk. There is a HUGE flat screen television set in the bedroom. About the only complaint I have is the breakfast service in the dining room. There was one young, extremely overwhelmed gal who was trying to accomplish more that what one person was able to manage. Service was slow. Lunch and dinner weren't a problem. I would recommend Orbitz as a booking site since they had a price that was 1/2 the properties web site.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The staff here is really nice, and the design aesthetic (Mad Men boutique hotel to the max) is pretty extraordinary, but you have to be in the mood for a place like this, and, well, I wasn't. (For one thing, I was born in the '50s, so been there, done that.) This hotel seems to have been created from a 1960s-era apartment building -- everything (including guest room walls) are plaster and cement, and there's a big pool in the middle of the complex. The decor is pretty amazing -- very attractive and unusual and retro -- but it affected the livability of the room. My room was REALLY dark, depressingly dark, had-to-use-a-flashlight-to-read-in-bed dark. Lighting was not adequate, and the deep blue painted plaster walls made it gloomy and creepy. There were several small annoying maintenance issues -- broken switch on lamp, burned-out bulb on another lamp -- and little signs of wear that just made it more depressing. It was clean but not immaculate. Good: the mattress and bedding were plush and comfortable. Bad: the bedding and towels had little stains on them -- I knew they were clean, but the effect was icky. Location: it could be considered close to the light rail, but only relative to the rest of Phoenix: when you're pulling a rolling suitcase behind you, it's kind of a slog to the light-rail station. Also, it seemed on the edge of some kind of industrial area, and trucks started waking me up at 5 AM. The beautiful pool area and the hotel lounge/restaurant seemed to be very happenin' places -- the hotel even throws pool parties sometimes -- but the atmosphere and property was all just a little too hipster for me.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We read all the reviews good, bad, neutral and given the price we received from Expedia.com decided to take a chance for our one night in Phoenix. We are glad we did. The woman at the reception desk set the tone when our credit card was denied (out of town travel--not over use!) when she calmed us down and talked us through another credit card (jet lag is my only excuse for the nerves--my husband was calm). Check in was smooth after that and we got to our room to find music playing. It was a biggish room, very clean, with a nice sized, clean bathroom. One little glitch, the air conditioner was not working at 100% as some people have stated in their reviews, but there was a fan in the room, it was early evening so cooler than the heat of the day, so we were comfortable and didn't complain--so we didn't really give management a chance to respond to our concerns. It was dinner time so we asked about Delux Burger which I had read about in other reviews. The woman at the desk quickly printed out directions and gave us her review--great! We had a wonderful dinner at Delux which is about 10 minutes (by car) from the hotel on Saddleback (I think). It is open until 2:00 a.m. and is apparently popular as an after evening eatery, but it was pleasantly busy and very attractive. Upon our return to the hotel we went to the rooftop bar and enjoyed a wonderful view of the Phoenix sky line and the stars. Slept very well, had a nice breakfast in the dining room (we were the only ones there for the most part). I would recommend the Hotel Clarendon for a moderately priced stay and the clean, modern rooms. We took a beautiful picture of the view from the roof top but it came out blurry! Sorry I can't share it with you.</p></li>

<li>The woman at the desk quickly printed out <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1" title="p=0.998">directions</span> and gave us her review--great!</br></br></li>
<li>We had a wonderful <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">dinner</span> at Delux which is about 10 minutes (by car) from the hotel on Saddleback (I think).</br></br></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 1 night after an all day meeting in PHX, not wanting to make the 3 hour drive home that afternoon. I had investigated the property prior to arriving so I was looking forward to my stay. The on-site restraurant lived up to my expectations. Happy hour specials included $5 all wines, $1 off all tacos (they range from $2-$3 ea), and reduced prices on appetizers. Completely enjoyed the food! Staff was ok, not very friendly, more concerned with gossiping between themselves about weather someone working with them was gay or not. I don't care, but don't talk about it so everyone has to hear the conversation. Loved the bed!! It was so very comfortable and I was surprised when I woke up that it was after 7am. I never sleep so long. Thank you for that. Great tv for unwinding with wonderful channel line-up. Was disappointed with the Wi-FI. It kept disconnecting trying to switch to different wi-fi networks all evening and the following morning. Was very frustrated with this as I was hoping to get some work done in the evening and then the following morning. Wished the room had a clock in the room, I hate waking up and not knowing what time it is. The room was also missing the hairdryer and I had to wait at least 30 minutes before one got to me. Loved the shower products a nice change from the cheap stuff they usually use in hotels. Aveeda products smell awesome!! Wish that I could have taken a hot shower in the morning. The water temp never got hot, it stayed lukewarm. Goose bumps through the entire shower. Was really upset about that. But, despite the few negatives stated here, the pool was awesome, the on-site food was awesome, the bed over the top awesome and I will stay here again if I, looking to stay in PHX again. Bear Down Ben!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is the worst place to stay, if I could give it a "0" star rating I would. When booking this hotel it showed as a three and a half star (not true) Arrived for a late check in at 10:45pm. The room (#228) was very outdated and it had been painted to look updated with bright blue paint. The furniture was chipped, and the bathroom sink did not fit properly onto the vanity. The power strips under the TV were strung together by electrical cords. There was something disgusting on the carpet between the beds, told the kids to keep their shoes on. The restaurant/bar service door was below our single paned window and each time they would open the security screen door it would rattle our window. The WORST PART was awakening on Saturday morning at 6:00am to a contractor wearing crocs on a ladder outside our window sawing/grinding a metal structure. Smoke was coming in our room through the unsealed window. I called the reception desk to report this loud noise and smoke, she said she thought she smelled something too and would investigate...nothing was done. When I called for more towels (room only had 2) at 6:40am, no mention of a resolution. The guy was still sawing outside the window. When the towels were delivered at 7:10am. I inquired with Michele who was told of the problem from the off going night receptionist, but had no resolution. Said she was told by the guy that by city ordinance that he could start work at 6:00am. I showed her the smoke in the room and she said she would see what could be done...I told her we were leaving. Upon checking out at the front desk (7:40am), she gave me a photo copied coupon for 20.00 of my next stay....like I would want to go back there. We drove to the side that our room was located at to see smoke stains going up the wall outside our room window. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Firstly: let's talk about Gallo Blanco, the restaurant in the Clarendon. Some of the most delicious Mexican food ever, served up by a courteous, friendly, and good-looking staff. Reasonably priced as well. But here's the real reason I'm writing this review: It's a Saturday afternoon, and I'm chilling in the lobby with some friends. A few hours later, I notice that my expensive sunglasses are missing. Last place I remember having them? The lobby. I stupidly left them sitting on the big coffee table. I ask a woman at the front desk if there's a lost and found; she checks it, and there's no sunglasses there. I search all my bags; no sunglasses. I go back to the front desk, where I meet Ben, the manager. I desperately ask if there's "another lost and found" in the hotel. He quickly offers to review the lobby security camera tape from the time I was there, to see if anyone recovered them Then he gives me his card, and says to email him if I need anything else. I go upstairs and turn my room upside down; no sunglasses. Back downstairs I mention this to Ben; he says "Hmmm...wait here a minute," and goes into the office. Comes back a minute later, asks me to describe the sunglasses, which I do. That's when he hands them over, saying that they were somewhere else in the office and not in the lost and found. A hotel manager willing to review a security camera tape to help recover a pair of lost sunglasses? Never heard of a big chain doing that! For the most part, The Clarendon is definitely a place for dazzling urbanites and hipsters to hook up: very trendy-looking, slightly funky (rooms could be a little cleaner and better maintained), but the staff will go the extra mile for you when asked. And the rooftop lounge offers a fine view of the city at night. Would definitely look to stay here again next time I'm in Phoenix.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was the second visit for my wife and me. We stayed at The Clarendon a year ago. Since the price was reasonable, we thought that we'd give it another try. As other guests have mentioned, the staff is very friendly and courteous (although in our experience not always effective.) The colorful decor is interesting. There have been some cosmetic changes, but the condition and maintenance is poor. When we arrived after midnight, very tired from a long journey, we moved into our room only to find that when we turned on the faucet in the bathroom sink the drainpipe burst and water flooded the bathroom. We had to pack up our belongings and move down the hall to a new room. In the morning we discovered that the privacy shade on the window facing the hallway was missing. We had to put a towel over the window, so we could let in a little light, or else it was as dark as a bat cave. We were promised that maintenance would fix it, but that didn't happen during a 4-day stay, even after repeated (5) requests. At the end of our stay we were told that the maintenance man was on vacation. Other issues: hotel security is somewhat lax with the side door to the parking lot unlocked at all times even though keyed entry is available; no locks/closer on bathroom stalls in women's room near lobby/restaurant; bathroom door lock was on the outside not inside of the door; broken glass on pool patio from the aggregate which our son stepped on and cut his foot; no security chain on room door; voice messages on telephone contained 9 old messages for previous guests with personal information stored. Upon check out we asked if we could have a fee adjustment for the inconveniences. We were told that it wasn't possible since we had booked through a third party (Expedia). With so many hotels in Phoenix to choose from, even though the location is great, we won't stay at The Clarendon again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">With all the traveling we do, I have to say that this hotel was a funky breath of fresh air in a big, big world of relatively unmemorable mid-market hotel offerings. The Clarendon probably isn't for everyone (e.g., perhaps, the older set), but we enjoyed the fruits of some very creative and talented decorating/designing minds. The first impression, from the exterior, is of an old 70s apartment building with a colorful paint job, but stepping inside, our eyes got a little big and we felt like we'd landed in a cool corner of Hollywood. None of this, frankly, is a real priority to us (traveling with a toddler), but nonetheless, the real art on the walls (most of which appeared to be for sale), the funky wallpaper, creative light fixtures, & other unique design touches, the awesome rooftop bar, and the extremely friendly staff all made for a truly pleasureable stay. The pool area is surely the centerpiece of the hotel, with a gorgeously & colorfully tiled walkable divider between the 'cool pool' and the very spacious 'hot pool'. The backdrop to all this was some very modern and diverse pool furniture, and a stunning 'wall of water', fronted by cacti. The night we were there, there was also flamenco on the rooftop (only until 9pm, which suited us fine). Our room was the 2-room suite, ground level, poolside, and we had no noise concerns, but perhaps that was partly a function of our midweek stay, as I could see the pool being a real hotspot on the weekends. Our unit was spacious, the bed comfortable, and the interior decor made the best that can be done with an older building, adding character and a feeling that a real person, a real COOL person, designed the room and decor. Not fancy at all, but fun and different. Front desk service couldn't have been nicer. we also appreciated the computer out front where we could print boarding passes. Overall, a refreshing and unique visit at a very affordable price.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Not your typical hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I wasn't sure what I was going to get when I booked at the Clarendon but I decided to give it a try after reading the reviews. I was still a little unsure when I entered the neighborhood, not much else around but I was determined to keep an open mind. The lobby of the hotel was nothing much but the person at the desk was very helpful and offered me a bottled water or soda. This is an example of the small nicities that make this hotel unique. The rooms of the hotel are arranged around a central courtyard containing a decent sized swimming pool and huge hot tub. There were many lounge chairs, outside speakers playing music and a cool water wall at the far end. This pool area is open to midnight, which is cool considering the heat of Phoenix makes outdoor living after dark a must. Because this hotel caters to a more adult clientele there is not the mad chaotic pool scene that is often found at the chain hotel's pools. The only thing missing was a poolside bar but the restaurant bar is not far from the pool and are happy to put your drinks is a platic cup to be enjoyed poolside. Also several times when enjoying the pool area the manager walked by and asked people if they would like a water or soda. The rooms were spacious, the bed was comfortable, the room had a refrigerator and a 42 inch LCD TV. The bathroom was clean but nothing special and the room was a bit dark. There is also a cool roof top deck that had tables, comfy chairs and large umbrellas for shade. This is a great place to enjoy a drink, surf the Internet and watch the sunset. top Pros of this hotel: service of staff, great on site restaurant, roof top deck, people watching, covered parking, large TV, free wi-fi throughout the property, location close to many area attractions. Top limitations of this hotel: wi-fi spotty at times, no poolside or roof top bar, one small elevator makes using the stairs the preferred method, $15 a day resort fee.</p></li>
