<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel had convenient facilities within the location. The location was a bit west of the main action of the city of Chicago, but still within very easy walking distance of everything. It was quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of the center of the city. The service at Italiasia was terrific in that we were in a hurry and they accomodated us extremely well, however the check-in staff was not the most pleasant.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was a great location to the major attractions downtown. However, it was not worth sleeping there. The bed I slept on was so hard and squeaky!! I did like that they had complimentary toothpaste, shampoo, and razors if you needed them. The view from the room was spectacular of the Chicago skyline! There was a beautiful lobby entrance waterfall. So if you don't mind sleeping in a crappy bed-then stay there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband, son, and I traveled to Chicago with my parents. We used Priceline to get two hotel rooms - we got a great rate ($99/night) and were quite impressed. The rooms were reasonably sized and we had a great view of the river. We were within a 15 minute walk to Navy Pier and other great attractions. Good location if you want to see the city. Nice property with good staff. Oh, and I LOVE staying at a Holiday Inn and getting free internet - you never get that at a Ritz!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I were going to Chicago to see Jersey Boys and needed a hotel for one Saturday night. The Holiday Inn Chicago Mart Plaza was a great choice. It was a great location, near the theatre and with awesome views of the river and the city. The hotel was very clean, obviously recently renovated, and had a very helpful and friendly staff. We also got a great price on Hotwire. Parking is not cheap ($31/night) but that is hardly unusual in Chicago. I would highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We are from Chicago and we used this hotel for our wedding room block. The sales staff were extremely helpful. We got a good room rate for all our block. The views from the hotel lobby, bar, and guest rooms are outstanding. The guest rooms were comfortable and clean. There is a ton within walking distance which was really great for our out of town guests. It is a perfect location to be near everything, but not so close where you get all the noise and commotion. Great experience overall.</p></li>

Nice hotel, great location, updated rooms, very unlike old-school Holiday Inn - as others commented, more like a Hyatt in general feel/appearance. Friendly front desk clerk at check-in, my room had a great view of the river and beyond. Comfortable bed. Gap below door is large but nothing a towel couldn't fix. Only negative was Gwendolyn who at check-out refused to give me a printed statement until I got nasty about it. I would stay here again.</p></li>

It's also centrally located - and there's an El stop accessible directly through the convention center which is connected. I'd definitely stay here again.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Typical Holiday Inn in a major city - expensive parking, OK service, and not very efficient. Check-in takes a bit longer than expected at a chain hotel. Lobby is on the 15th floor of the Chicago Sun Times building. Would stay there again based on our corporate rate negotiation but when staying on the river, in downtown Chicago, you can expect to pay north of $100 or even $150 for anything average. The crappy reviews are simply unrealistic - considering the cost of living, this is a well priced hotel.</p></li>

They changed their tune to say they "try" to accomidate requests but don't guarentee it (quite different to when I booked it) Did move the next day however(after alot of complaining). The whinning was worth it. Spectacular views of the river from the 20'th floor. Parking $36/night; extra rollaway $20/night. Factor these when booking. More upscale than most "Holiday Inns". Mediocore restaurant.</p></li>

If you get a room with a window facing the outside, the views can be stunning, and the rooms are nice. If you get a room with an interior window - facing the light shaft, they are gloomy and claustrophibic. Pros. Quite good value for Chicago. Easy access to the El Price includes internet access. Some rooms have magnificent views. Cons: Not at all central for the main tourist districtis...you are going to have to get a train. Not close to many good restaurants.</p></li>

It is a long walk from major shopping and dining, but if it is a nice day the walk is manageable. It is a short cab ride otherwise. The views are great, both in the rooms and from the hotel bar.

Last time I stayed here I gor a fabulous room with a fantastic view of the Chicago River and the Sears Tower. Since I've seen that view, I decided to get a quiet room away from the elevator this time. Not much of a view of the "courtyard" and the top of the pool. However, it was quiet, and nicely furnished. The tub could have used a re-coating though. It was peeling a bit. Still all in all, it is a nice, comfortable hotel in River North and it is easy to get arounf the city.

We walked to all of the locations we wanted to go around Chicago from the hotel. Cabs were right outside for the few times we did need a cab. Free Internet. Food delivery options for late night ordering. The bathrooms do not have ventilation/fan so it did get steamed up easy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got a great deal on Price Line (about $75/night for Friday and Saturday nights, taxes included), but if we had paid full price we wouldn't have been as satisfied. The great things about the hotel included location, quietness, cleanliness, and free internet. The biggest con was the bathroom, which was small and outdated with lighting that would make Cindy Crawford look like Frankenstein -- yuck! Other than that, we were happy with it. Also, the hotel has a fabulous bar/restaurant with an amazing view of the skyline and river. I highly recommend stopping in for a cocktail.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a clean and comfortable hotel. Chicago is a great city for walking, so we certainly did not mind the distance to attractions. Otherwise, there is indoor access to the El.. Because it is located on top of the Chicago Sun-Times building, it is very quiet. I don't think i would pay the premium for rooms with the city view again. The lounge has great views. On the negative side, I would echo other comments regarding the internet connection - it was incredibly slow. If you are on business or otherwise need internet access, this could be a real problem, Water in the pool was surprisingly and uncomfortably cold. .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is smart decent and effective business hotel in the Loop in Chicago. You don't stay here to linger in the hotel. You stay here because it is at the heart of the city. The room I had was large with all the comforts you need and a good bed. The bathroom was clean and well cleaned. My only problem was that my shower when I had to leave very early to catch the flight to DC was only just warm. Disappointing. The glory of the hotel though is the awesome view of the city as the hotel sits on the top of the Sun Times Building. Food is hotel standard - it won't do you any harm but you will quickly forget it. I would happily stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel has an excellent location in downtown Chicago. It is a modern hotel. Rooms are big and clean, and some of them have a very nice view over the town. Internet connection is available for free. I don't suggest to have breakfast in the hotel since it is rather good but too expensive for that quality (a Starbucks is just a couple of minutes from the hotel). Rooms are very noisy: you can hear everything happens in the other rooms near yours, and you can also hear what happens in the main entrance hall (when I was there, there was a wedding party downstairs, and I could hear lot of noise till late night). The service is not very warm.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel with 5 of my friends. We had very nice rooms, excellent service from everyone at the hotel. The concierge was very helpful with the planning of our vacation. The only complaint we had was that too much food was served with our meals. It seemed like a waste but I guess a lot of people would think lots of food was a really good thing. Food served in the restaurant was delicious and the wait staff very good also. The City Scape Bar is an excellent place just to relax at the end of the day and overlook the city lights. Overall experience was excellent and would highly recomend to any age group.</p></li>

I was a little worried about parking but the Holiday Inn MartPlaza has an open air parking lot just outside the front doors and while it was a bit hard to find at first once we got oriented to where it was in relation to all other places we were going it was great. Found a great rate online that included free parking (a big deal when comparing rates!). Room was clean and quiet and we enjoyed our stay. (Did not eat at inhouse restaurant so I can't comment on that; we found breakfast and dinner elsewhere) Love Chicago's museums and aquarium and Skydeck. Buy a CityPass! Best way to go!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Setup of hotel is odd. Parking is not under the building, it is an outdoor lot that you must walk up approx. 20 steps or go down a ramp to a low lit door that you need to have them buzz you in to get to the elevators/escalators to the main building. Once in the main building, take another elevator to the 15th floor to the Holiday Inn's front desk. Once checked in, you take a third set of elevators to the floor that you stay on. The particular weekend we stayed there was not a very peaceful sleep weekend since the hallways are on the outside of the square and it is open in the middle and the bar with loud patrons were there until after 3 a.m.</p></li>

My room was spacious, comfortable and very well set up for a business traveler, even if the decor was a bit tired, and the views were gorgeous. The reliable free wi-fi turned out to be a real life saver when a minor crisis arose. The staff was incredibly helpful, worthy of a 5-star hotel. The meeting I attended used two large meeting rooms, one with more great views, that were great meeting spaces. The food served was fresh and terrific. Truly one of the most pleasant meeting experiences ever, and I expect to check this property next time I go to Chicago for personal business.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is advertised as being in the Magnificent Mile area of Chicago, but in reality it's in the River North area of Chicago. Unless you're in Chicago to go the the merchandise mart, avoid this hotel. You must cab everywhere. The mag mile is 6-8 blocks away and the loop is 8-10 blocks. The rooms are OK, but the bathrooms are very dated with stained tile, no vanity and bathtubs that look like they've been there since the 30's. The rooms are also quite noisy with thin walls and dated air/heat. The air/heat is something you would see in a motel 6. In summary, this hotel is not anywhere near the attractions of Chicago, too noisy and too cheap/dated.</p></li>

The hotel is so far from everything that the transportation to and from the hotel would have been saved if we would have stayed closer to the Mag Mile. A very business oriented hotel. I did not know what hotel I was getting b/c I booked through a 3rd party and was reminded of that several times throughout my stay. The concierge was wonderful. He was very helpful multiple times and very friendly. People who were around me that did not book 3rd party (hotwire) were more upset than me at service and location b/c they had paid a larger price.</p></li>

The view over the river was amazing! Taxis were always close at hand and we were close to just about everything we wanted to do. VERY PLEASED with this place and would stay again. Rooms are basic and double beds were smallish (full sized) but we weren't in them long! :) Tolietries were great, Bath and Body works brand. They had a nice bar in the Hotel too.

After MUCH talking, we were able to get a room with a King and a pull out sofa...which worked ok. The first night there we ate in their restaurant. We'd been told that the hotel was sold out, so it was shocking that there were only 2 servers working the entire dining room. The food was decent, but the entire dining experience took us no less than 2.5 hours...really felt bad for the server, he was good and very appologetic for our wait. The best part of this hotel is its location next to the Merchandise Mart...our reason for being in town, the Gift Show.</p></li>

<li>The <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">food</span> was decent, but the entire dining experience took us no less than 2.5 hours...really felt bad for the server, he was good and very appologetic for our wait.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I like the location of the hotel, it has a great views from the room. Note, that hotel is in upper stairs in the building. Rooms are big, very clean. The only problem I had is too loud air-conditioner. Sometimes I had issues to sleep during jet-lag. Free and fast wi-fi in the room. I always take king-bed with big choice of pillows - nice thing :-). Unfortunately, like in many US hotels, breakfast is not included in the price. There's ala carte and buffet choice downstairs in restaurant. I used restaurant only once and food was good (fish), they also have a bar. Overal, I can definitely recommend this hotel. If you book in advance, you can have it in a very good price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was very impressed with the reservationist and had also received a nice email response when I inquired about the location. However, when I arrived at midnight after a grueling delayed flight, I was told they were overbooked. Apparently other guests decided to extend their stay, so they gave my room away. The hotel did rebook me and paid for the other hotel, but as a business traveler...that didn't help me personally since my client pays the bill. I was the one inconvenienced. I had to stay a mile away, and had to fight for a taxi to come back to my meeting in the mart early the next morning. This cost me much needed sleep. I would have appreciated an email or phone call telling me about the problem so I could have planned accordingly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed one night for a night stop after a ski trip in Vail, CO. My idea was to make a little visit during the morning and take a night flight back to Europe. I arrived very late at night (due to snow in airport) and in the front desk was a very friendly and efficient staff member: he was able to manage me a late check out at 1pm so I could take a shower before going back to the airport. The room was on the 23th floor with nice view to Chicago. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom correct. The only but was a little noise coming from the bathroom airhole...but didn't cause me problem to sleep. Free wifi Regarding the location, it is in the city center...It only took me 15 min to arrive to Sears Tower. Taxi ride from O'Hare Airport 35', 38USD</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked my stay here over the phone. I had stayed here before, and it was great. Not this time, though. The lobby is in shambles. The ceiling is gone, wires hanging down, the fumes of fresh paint, "Beware of dust" signs plastered all over the lobby. Horrible stuff. I got to the front counter, and asked what the deal was, and accomplished nothing. I just kept finding myself asking why it was not possible to tell me that they were undergoing absolute and complete renovation over the phone while I was booking my stay. The room was no better. Green paint, a 1976ish theme, and just a general plainness. I also couldn't get any internet, which is a huge problem for me. The only redeeming quality was a fairly good view of chicago, and a canal just below my window.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Holiday Inn at Mart Plaza doesn't look like a "Holiday Inn". They've spent a lot of money making the lobby look very snazzy and the view and location from the lobby are probably one of the best in the city. But once you get to your room, you'll see why it's a Holiday Inn. not to say it's "bad" in any way. But don't let the "4 star" lobby fool you. This is a nicer "3 star". One word of caution: I had a double bed room, and expected (like most other hotels) that the room would have two full size beds. Boy was I wrong. The beds were essentially wider twin bed. If the two people sleeping in one bed didn't have a close relationship before, then they would for sure then. They are really narrow "double beds". Other than that, standard amenities for a Holiday Inn. Great location and can't complain.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I were attending a reunion of her hospital unit from the Vietnam War era; attended by more than 90 people.We had a river view room with a queen bed. The view from our room was worth the price of the room. From the moment we checked in, we were impressed with the outstanding front desk and housekeeping staff. The concierge went above and beyond providing outstanding service. When he found that we had made dinner arrangements at Keefer's, an excellent steak house, at the end of our meal, our server informed us that our dessert was courtesy of the hotel concierge. I am a disabled veteran with special dietary needs that the restaurant cheerfully accomodated. Great food at a reasonable price. Overall, our experience in Chicago was equal to that of the top hotels of Bangkok, Shanghai, Kathmandu, or New Delhi.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The best part of this hotel is the view. It sits on TOP of the Chicago Sun Times building, with the huge lobby on the 15th floor. Our room was on the 23rd floor overlooking the Chicago river & everything on it ~ Breathtaking! I feel bad for the reviewer who said she had a view of a wall ~ that WOULD be awful! The beautiful Merchandise Mart was next door by way of a pedestian walkway, as was the train station, which was SO convenient for us! The room was lovely & clean with comfy beds (most important!) We were also able to take advantage of the view from the CityScape bar on the lobby level, complete with free appetizers! My only complaint would be the VERY EXPENSIVE breakfast menu in the hotel's restaurant ($14 for french toast(!) & $2.50 for a cup of coffee) I believe it was the same as the room service menu in the room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Came to Chicago for a small vacation during Spring Break and wanted to stay downtown to enjoy the city so we booked the Holiday Inn in Mart Plaza. The hotel actually turned out to be really nice, clean rooms with cable, etc. The room was a little small but that was expected. We did not use the pool since it was usually packed with families and noisy kids, but that was all fine since we spent our days shopping on State street or on Michigan. However, the scenery is amazing! We stayed up every night to look out of our room and enjoy the night scene of Chicago. It was amazing. I suggest paying a little bit more to book the rooms with a scene. Plus, the restaurant in this Holiday Inn is fantastic. THE FOOD IS AMAZING, which surprised us. Try the New York steak with fried tofu, it was amazing. i will be back, especially back to the restaurant.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family stayed at this hotel over Easter Weekend. We enjoyed our stay in Chicago, visiting a few museums. The kids under 12 eat free in the hotel at every meal. The only drawback, is that the prices for adult food are high, and when they take the price of the child's food off, they leave on the full price of the tax before the discount, and added the tip themselves, with the full price. This aside, the food was still great, and the pool was a lot of fun for the kids. We had two rooms to accomodate all of us (we have 5 kids) and the views of the city were really beautiful. The staff was excellent, friendly and helpful. The beds were fluffy and comfortable, and we had a large television with all the cable channels to watch in the evenings after a day of sightseeing. I would definitely tell my friends to stay at the Holiday Inn Chicago Mart!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had a reservation at this hotel, and when I punched in the address in my GPS it did not come up. I called the hotel and spoke to Todd. He was very helpful, asked me to apply another address and let me know to make sure and turn immediately after the river. When I arrived, and saw the quick turn, I was so glad that he told me this. I would not have been excited to reroute another 2 blocks in heavy Chicago traffic. When I pulled up the bellman, Johnny, could not have been more helpful. He was so polite and friendly and told me everything about the hotel's amenities. He suggested the hotel bar for dining as they have a great view of the city on the 15th floor. I did go to the bar area and the food was very good and the view spectacular. When I checked in Valerie was also very helpful. Everything was great. I would definately reccomend this hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A great location on the river with easy access to the middle of Chicago. The lobby is actually on the 15th floor and looks great, newly decorated and modern. There is a restaurant that we didn't try and a corner cocktail bar with great views of the city and prices you'd expect (my cocktail was about $10). The guest service seemed fine, although we didn't make much use of it. The rooms look like any other Holiday Inn though and don't look like they've been renovated in over ten years, it's clean, but just looks tired and for the price per room was a little disappointing. Maybe they hope the wonderful views make up for it. The rooms were comfortable, with all the usual fixtures and fittings. The A/C worked wonders on one of the hottest nights of the summer! So while we stayed to attend a wedding there and got a slight cut in the rates because of this, I still felt it was a little over-priced.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 3 nights, and I was pleasantly surprised, especially because of reading reviews. Keep in mind this hotel is on the edge of the action, so if you are not keen on walking or taking transit, this hotel won't be for you. Its a good 15 min walk over to Michigan Ave. not bad on a sunny, warm day. We had a south facing view, overlooking the city, it was awesome. Rooms are really clean, comfortable, bathrooms are nicely updated. There are some good restaurants in the area, if you want to try a real deep dish pizza, head to Lou Malnati's on Wells. The parking is outdoor, and for $36/day you have in and out privileges. The door man Johnny was a great help with were to eat and see. Got AAA rate which was really good. If you have really small kids, you may want to find something closer, but my two little people really enjoyed it. The staff aren't super friendly but they were efficient.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room was confortable and clean. The view overlooking the the river was was wonderful. The public areas were spacious and attractive. However, there were long check in lines. It was almost impossible to reach the consierge desk by phone and when I did get through the man was rude and condesending. The evening I went to the bar it was impossible to get served. The hotel is the top portion of a building that has has an entrance which is difficult to locate. Once inside the building, one must first locate a bank of elevators that goes to the hotel and then walk down a hall way to the hotel lobby. There are many resturants and entertainment venues in the area but is difficult to get in and out of the hotel to enjoy them. The building is connected to the Trade Mart which makes it easy to do business there. The price of the accomodation was reasonable but I would look for a more accessible hotel on a return visit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Holliday Inn for the second time in three months !! I would never believe that I would be saying that !!! To begin with the location of this hotel sucks, I wish we would have stayed at the other Holiday Inn which we have stayed at before, because it is so much closer to everything. If Holliday Inn would not have been written in this hotel, I would have thought we where at the W where we frequent. I have only wonderful things to say about both of our visits. The lobby, bar and reception area where first class and very impressive !! The staff was extremely accommodating and helpful. The rooms where extremely nice and modern, the bedding and linens where very high class and the bed was very comfortable. We where sad that we where not staying longer !!!!!! This is a great hotel especially for the rate we paid !! But just make sure you understand the location, it is rather far from most of the downtown activities !!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were glad that we made a decision to stay at Holiday Inn Chicago during our first visit to Chicago. The best thing about the hotel was the location and the dining service that they provide. Inside Holiday Inn, there are Italiacia and Cityscape bar and both of the dining service were very good. It was also very nice that we could order dinner from Italiacia and we could dine in Cityscape bar where we could see the beautiful sights of the downtown Chicago. The bed was very comfortable and the amenities were also nice that the shampoo and conditioner that they provided had good smell. The only problem that I had was the front desk misheard my request in regard to the change of my schedule and accidentally shortened the amount of nights that we were supposed to stay. The price was very good and well adjusted and I hope they continue to do so in the future as well. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who's visiting downtown Chicago.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When I was looking for hotels in Chicago most that I came across cost waaaay more than the Holiday Inn. I was grateful when I found such reasonable prices considering the prices of the other hotels in the area. I was so excited to find that the hotel was exceptionally nice considering the price which makes it a no brainer as to where we will stay any time we visit Chicago! We had a nice view of the city and the river below, our room was spacious, clean, and the bed and pillows were sooo comfortable! Being attached to the Merchandise Mart was great because we could walk to coffee shops without having to go outside, and being able to walk to the metro through the Merchandise Mart was great! A few blocks away is Lou Malnati's which has great deep dish pizza and on the bottom floor of the Merchandise Mart I really liked the blueberry muffin I had at Au Bon Pain. I am very happy with my experience and am grateful that I saved hundreds of dollars by staying here!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My mom and I just got home for a three-day girls getaway in Chicago. I booked the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza hotel via Priceline for $120/night + tax, which was a great deal for the location and timeframe. I was pleasantly surprised - the location was great. It was about mile from Union Station as well as the Magnificent Mile. We walked everywhere from our hotel, but it's close to the El as well. Thought the rooms were fairly average, but clean. We also had a great experience at check-in. We arrived around 1 and were quickly checked into our room even though check-in wasn't until 3. The hotel clerk was quite courteous. I had read some reviews where clerks had been somewhat rude to customers booking through priceline. I definitely did not have that experience. Also the hotel bar was great - located on the corner of the building overlooking the Chicago River. It had a wonderful view and the drinks were extremely reasonably priced. All in all - had a great visit and would definitely recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The beds at this hotel are some of the worst that I can remember. I unfortunately was attending a two-day conference and had already prepaid for the rooms - a sofa would have been more comfortable. The beds also had three small pillows that were the size of a "throw pillow" - it was very awkward. Overall the hotel rooms, hallways, and lobby were very dated and in need of a make over. There are some good points to this hotel. There is free WIFI, location is okay but will probably need a cab to get to most places, nice bar with sweeping views of the city and river - some rooms also have this view. Also, the staff was very friendly and concierge "Robert" was helpful with restaurant recommendations and can get you last minute tickets to shows or the Cubs. If you can afford it, stay next time at a hotel that is closer to Miracle Mile, the Pier, or Millennium Park. By staying at this hotel you'll end up spending money on cab rides and have a bed made of rock awaiting you when you get back from your night out on the town.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 4 nights in this hotel on 18th floor (Thurs-Sun), connected by pedway to Merchandise Mart. Also CTA train station located in the mart. Long walk from hotel but still good. Please note, all closed on Sunday, must enter from outside and down the street. Good mid city location. Registration staff we encountered not especially helpful or friendly but concierge Christopher AND Robert were exceptional. Was not given the $20 complimentary voucher from breakfast for each day as was stated in my Expedia purchase info. Hotel staff totally refused to honor my request, even though I paid a LOT for this room and they admitted they had such an offer. View was fabulous. Room clean. Heating/air worked great. Minimal noise could be heard from rooms around us but the cleaning staff VERY loud outside our room for an extended period as they prepared each morning to clean rooms. Bathroom did not have heat lamp or fan. No counter/mirror area outside of bathroom so very difficult for two or more people to get ready at the same time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had never stayed at this hotel before and to be honest I didn't realize that it would be so convenient a location when I booked it. It's an unusual set up where you enter the building and have to take an elevator up to the hotel lobby on the 5th floor. The hotel is housed on the 15-19th floors of the hotel. When we checked in they mentioned "corner view" room but I didn't know what they meant.. well.. if you stay here, get a corner view room! Two of the room's walls were almost completely glass. One view was of the river and the other towards the city. At night it was gorgeous! Our first night there we didn't know where to eat and the woman at the desk suggested Lou Malnati's .. for it's traditional Chicago Style pizza. The restaurant was a quick walk to blocks over. The next day we were able to walk to Michigan Ave, the Navy Pier and back to the hotel. That night it was a $7 cab ride over to the Hyatt Regency for the event we were in town to attend. I would definitely stay at this hotel again the next time I visit Chicago.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel twice in the past week, two nights each time. The rooms booked had identical descriptions but were quite different. The first room was on the top floor with a great view looking towards downtown and was very spacious with enough room for our daughters pack n play crib as well as a large picnic blanket spread out on the floor. The room was modern and recently redone. The second room had an identical description but was quite dated and considerably smaller. The water pressure was quite low and the wallpaper was peeling in places. We called the front desk to see if we could switch rooms but there were no other rooms available. If we had this room during our first stay we probably would not have returned. It was clean, but after the first room very disappointing. The hotel overall is in a great location, only about a 20 min walk to the magnificent mile. The hotel staff were very friendly, especially the bellman. If we could be guaranteed a stay in a new larger room we would return in a heartbeat. Otherwise we'll look elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband booked this hotel at the last minute because it had a pool and complimentary breakfast. We orginally were booked at the Hyatt Regancy. The worst thing about this hotel is that is it 15 floors up and to get from the parking gargage (down a long hallway) to the elevator and then to another elevator to get to your rooms takes about 15 minutes. The rooms were okay. Nothing great about them. The room was clean. The shower water pressure was awesome! The beds were hard. They do have a pillow menu where you can pick the "type" of pillow you would like. We had a nice view of the city. We walked everywhere. It was a long walk w/ 2 children and a stroller but we all survived. We walked to Michigan Ave, Navy Pier and Millenium Park. I think next time we will pick a hotel a little more centrally located. We had free breakfast because it was included in military discount. It was okay. Never would I have paid $15 a person for it!!!! Our bill before the coupons taken off was $59.32 for 2 adults and 2 children. Basic foods: eggs, hashbrowns, bacon, sausage, fruit and bagels.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room was clean and relatively modern, the bathroom was spotless and new which was nice. Beds are on the softer side but comfy. There's a small flat screen TV with a decent selection of channels. The air-con however is loud enough to keep you awake and looks to be a portable unit bolted to one side of the wall. The furntinure was basic as one would expect. Room service dinner was surprisingly good, right up there with top hotels in terms of quality and wasnt cheap either. Location wise its sits next to a conference centre of sorts with a handful of fast food outlets inside. Theres a convenience store downstairs which was great but it shuts pretty early. Taxis lined up outside at most hours of the day, but its a 15 min hike just to get to the main area of the magnificent mile and this gets pretty annoying after a day or so. Not a great location at all and its also pretty quite at night - but not in your room because the walls and insulation are pretty thin. At $160 a night it was pretty poor value for what is essentially basic (but clean and comfy)accomodation in a deceptively bad location.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I came back from a trip to Chicago, IL. We stayed at the Holiday Inn-Mart Plaza. I will never ever stay there again! The room had an odor and the vents had not been dusted!! The cleaning personnel stored all the cups and glasses in the same area/room with the soiled and wet towels. When we passed by to go to the lobby to eat, we were taken aback! We didn't use their cups and glasses; we purchased cups at Walgreens. My sister requested a roller-away-bed ($20.00 per night), but she asked that they take it back, because it had a musty ordor. The breakfast buffet was $15.00 per person, that is way too much! I paid over $6000.00 dollars to stay (2 days), but never ever again! You have to pay to use the computer and the printer. The location is great and the lobby is beautiful, but when you go to your room, you're in shock. I wish I had a photo of the room. I believe if you're paying over $600.00 dollars, you should get something free. I could have stayed at another hotel paying the same price. Please learn from my error! Overall, the hotel should tear down and rebuild! I give this hotel one star. Please do not make reservations at this hotel!!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Holiday Inn Chicago (Merchandise Mart) is correctly described as adequate. Stayed here for two nights as part of a quick trip to Chicago. Picked the hotel for the price above all but in some ways I guess you get what you pay for. Location: The hotels location isn't horrible; itâ€™s just not that convenient. Youâ€™re close to River North and the Loop but not too much nightlife or shopping. It gets frustrating after the first couple days of navigating several elevators, flights of stairs, escalators and hallways just to get to a cab or train station. The hotel is good choice if you want to save some cash and don't mind walking a couple extra blocks to reach some sites. Rooms/Hotel: Clean just very plain and somewhat dated. Beds were OK and there was also the pillow menu which is standard at most Holiday Inn's now. Bathrooms were basic the lighting was too strong. Free Wi-Fi in all guest rooms. Restaurant: Didn't eat at the hotel because we thought it was way too over-priced. (Tip - Inside the merchandise mart is a food court that serves breakfast very quickly and cheaply). Check out Blueprint in the Merchandise Mart for close cocktails.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from this hotel after staying 2 nights(July 24th-26th). Got this on priceline for $100 per night, though parking is $36 per night...still not bad for downtown Chicago. This hotel is in the Chicago Sun Times building, near the river. The hotel is actually on the 15th floor, so you have a bit of a walk to get to elevator, then to lobby, then to elevators to your rooms. The staff is great, and the rooms are nice. We had a view of the pool which was a covered pool the kids loved. The Sky bar has a beautiful view, though drinks are a bit cashy, as well as the restaurant. We opted to walk to a CVS for breakfast snack food. The hotel is located centrally and we were able to walk to plenty of shopping on State Street and Michigan Ave. We would stay here again, but would prefer an even better location near the loop or MIchigan Ave. however with priceline you really never know where you'll end up if you choose the discount over an exact location. Still a nice place..not perfect but very nice. We did find several fast food restaurants in the merchandise mart which is connected to this building. They do give you a code for free internet access if you have an ipad or laptop.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were very happy with our stay. There are significant renovations going on, but they appear to be nearing completion and they were limited to the lobby area and did not interfere with our stay in any way. The location is awesome, linked to Merchandise Mart (by an enclosed bridge) where there is a stop on the brown line subway. Lots of restaurant options within walking distance or by train. We did not swim in the pool but it was very pretty. The view from the room was very nice with city lights. However, we stayed on the west side of the buliding facing away from the lake and city, and I think the view would be even better from the east side. The truly amazing thing about this place is the value. The public rate on the room was pretty reasonable for being in the city. The amazing thing is the AAA discount which was over 40%. I am already a AAA member, but even if I was not, I would have saved over $100 on our three night stay even after incurring the cost of joining AAA. The only negative thing I can say is that the room was decorated a bit on the plain side, but it was spotless and perfectly acceptable. There is parking, but it was expensive as it is with most hotels in the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at the Holiday Inn near the Merchandise Mart. It's easy to access from the main highways coming into Chicago and via public transportation. I was a little nervous about accessing the hotel because of one reviewer's comments about the hotel being on the top of an office building, but the building is located on its own side street, so it was no problem. (The hotel sits on top of the Sun-Times building.) Bellmen were stationed on street level all the time and were very helpful. Paid $169 plus tax and outdoor parking in their lot was included. (No problems with theft or vandalism.) We thought this was a decent deal, although we see that others here paid far less--oh, well. The room was clean, although it looked like the carpet might need to be replaced in the next six months or so. Quiet, comfortable, safe; decent indoor pool with towels (had to call one night to get them to bring more, which they did). I don't understand the complaints of reviewers who comment about the walk to sites in Chicago--the L is connected to the Merchandise Mart which is connected to the hotel. We didn't have any problems. Didn't eat at the hotel. Beautiful view of the city from the bar.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is older, but very clean. Friendly staff and close affordable parking with in and out privileges. It can be a little difficult to get to your room, as the hotel is actually on top of another business. However, once you find all the elevators, this is much easier to navigate. We did not realize we could stop in front of the hotel and drop all our luggage off when we checked in. This would have made our first few hours easier, rather than carrying all our baggage up the stairs or through the handicap accessible entrance. Make sure to use the taxi/drop off lane when checking in. The pool was nice and warm and very large. Sometimes difficult to secure towels. We had a double bed room, which was VERY large. The beds were small, but the room was very nice. The view of the river and Merchandise Mart was outstanding. The hotel is off the beaten path for a lot of sightseeing tours, but within walking distance. Taxi cabs were always waiting in the front, and easily accessible. An in-room mini fridge would have been nice, as there was no breakfast included (however there is a restaurant in the hotel) and with two younger children, drinks and snacks in the room are a must. We stayed for three nights, and enjoyed our time in Chicago.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Family of four stayed here on a cold, snowy Presidents Day weekend. Location is ideal; there is an enclosed walkway to access the above-ground mass transit, the "L." Our room was comfortable, spacious, plenty of towels, TV worked fine. Beds were acceptably comfortable. The view was amazing - we were on the 21st floor. The hotel itself begins with its lobby on the 15th floor - so every room has some kind of view of the lights and the city. Our bathroom had a large crack in the sink. Our children were told by other kids in swimsuits that the indoor pool was cold. Room service prices were outrageous (and they like to heap on taxes and extra fees and gratuities to the point of being beyond belief!) and there is no nearby quick food on a Friday night, we discovered. We recommend breakfast or other fast meal at the Billy Goats Grill located in the adjacent "Shops at the Mart." Our room rate was $135 (closer to $180 with taxes) for two double beds but it did include free self-parking. The entrance is very difficult to find; it is at the side of the building and poorly marked. From our parking space (outdoors), it was quite a hike up many, many icy stairs to the Sun-Times lobby, from where guests take a direct elevator to the lobby on Floor 15.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza over President's Day weekend, booking the rooms on Priceline at $75 per night. We were in Chicago for a weekend to enjoy the city, so our time in the hotel was limited. The location is convenient for driving in and the parking lot is more than adequate. If you're on a business trip to the Loop, this would certainly be a good choice. For a weekend/family getaway, you may want to look for something like the Hyatt Regency just to be closer to Michigan Ave and the main tourist sites. The layout of the hotel, entering through the building lobby and then proceeding to the hotel lobby on the 15th floor, is somewhat inconvenient, but certainly not a problem. Unload your bags before you park. Parking is $27 a day with unlimited use, so if you'll be traveling by car during your stay, it's a good value. Otherwise, the El Brown line stop at Merchandise Mart is located a block east (through the Mart building). Michigan Ave is a six block walk to the east, certainly doable, even in winter. Room had a great view looking over the Chicago River and the Mart. Room was very good size, bed was comfortable and the bathroom was fine - all in all, this is a very nice Holiday Inn. It's certainly a great value on Priceline, and would be a good value in general.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were very impressed with our stay and will definitely return on other trips. The hotel has incredibly helpful staff, from the doorman to the concierge to the manager! We were in a newly renovated "room with a view" on the 23rd floor and I was very impressed. There is an overall modern & hip feeling our room as well as the hotel's lobby & restaurant areas. The bathroom & room updates have been done very well. The shower was a generous size and there was nice storage in the sink/vanity area. The room was HUGE! We had 2 double beds and ample room for a desk and an armchair with an ottoman. We had 4 people in the room and did not feel uncomfortable in the least. The beds & linens were clean, inviting and comfortable. I can't vouch for rooms that have not been renovated yet though so if you are booking, I highly recommend asking for an updated room. My only issues with the entire stay were: -very chilly pool temperature -reaching the hotel lobby required you to walk through the building lobby and then take an elevator to the 15th floor which was awkward when laden down with luggage and tired kids -if you chose to park your car and handle your luggage yourself, there were many many stairs to climb to reach the building lobby from the parking lot In the grand scheme of things, my issues were negligible. Very nice stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've actually stayed at the Holiday Inn Mart Plaza twice. Once for a wedding (the reception was held in the banquette room with the spectacular view) and the other was just recently when I brought my nephew downtown for his birthday. Not many of the Chicago hotels have a pool but this one does. They have some nice breakfast choices...but room service is a bit pricey. They offer parking at a reasonable rate, but the cars are not covered as they sit in an outside parking area. There are very steep steps down to the parking area. There is a drive-up area to the front entrance. The hotel lobby itself is situated on the 15th floor so you need to take an elevator up once you enter the building. I've always seemed to find the cheapest rates on the Holiday Inn website. They provided us a room with a wonderful view of the river and Sears Tower. Its easy to get a cab. If you walk 2 blocks you can catch the el. The hotel rooms were average size. We had 2 double beds, desk , 2 chairs, tv with lots of first run and just released DVD selections for an additional fee. Video game rental for an additional fee. Electronic checkout. Bathroom was large and brightly lit. We went at Christmas time so the lobby was all decorated. Overall its a great place to stay for the price, but if you want to walk out onto Michigan Ave its a bit too west .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Checked in and being a platinum club member I received a nice little goodie bag with nuts, chips, cookies, water and a coupon their restaurant. This was a much nicer gift than what Hilton gives out. I was supposedly upgraded to a better room. On the 23rd (top) floor far, far away from the elevator. Not a good location for anyone with walking issues. Or for anyone who is afraid of heights or movement as movement is felt in high winds. The room was OK, decent sized. They need to do some upgrades like get rid of the old hangars in the closet without a door (the kind that you can't steal as if anyone needs to steal a hangar these days) and for goodness sakes remove the old AC units already. What a disgusting disgrace to a room that would be considered above avg. It was dirty, extremely dirty that is, and probably so full of mold. In fact, although I had non-feather pillows in the room I struggled with a terrible headache the two nights I was there and basically didn't sleep. The carpets need to be cleaned as well. Bath & Body Works toiletries which is welcome. Nice water pressure, too. And the room stayed cooled well for being on an upper floor. The bar was nice, great views. The margarita wasn't worth tasting but the mojito was OK. Not very cheap but most hotel bars are not. Since this was my second visit to this hotel I would rather not stay here again but it was an OK choice for the location and the money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel room was very clean and it was nice having a choice of firmness on the pillows. The sheets were clean and the bedspread was very comfy! Some of the wallpaper was coming off in the bathroom and the cover on the back of the shower head wasn't secured to the wall. The view of the river and city was very nice! The stairs from the parking lot to the entrance sucked! The bell hop did offer to take our luggage when we first got there and asked where to park, but dumbly I said no :P SAY YES! The whole having to take two elevators to the room wasn't a big deal at all. It's close to the bus, but it wasn't a very good option. We ended up walking most of it, which sucked, but we saved lots of money in the end. It is a good 15 minute walk from Michigan Ave., which was ok for us. The staff were very friendly. We didn't have the maid come any day we were there, so I can't comment on that. The towels were nice and clean (very important!) The room was small (two double beds), but we weren't in there most of the time, so it was ok. Nice big tv! No safe, which was unfortunate. Also the parking is very expensive in my opinion, $34/day. I do realize there are in/out privileges, but honestly we never did because it's easier to take other forms of transportation downtown. Overall I really enjoyed my stay and had no big issues with the room or the staff. I would rather be closer to Michigan Ave., but I will likely stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located at Chicago's Merchandise Mart in the heart of the Magnificent Mile, this Holiday Inn is perched atop the Chicago Sun Times building and the underground shopping mall known as the Merchandise Mart. Easily accessible from both Midway (about 8 stops on the CTA) and O'Hare (about an hour by CTA). Trains on the Loop stop at the Merchandise Mart, which is virtually at the hotel's doorstep. Better signs in the Mart would help guests find the hotel after exiting the CTA train. Rooms are small but comfortably appointed. Free Internet was great. Many rooms feature fabulous views of Chicago's lively canyon of art deco buildings and newer skyscrapers. The hotel's bar is an all-glass venue overlooking the river with the city's dazzling lights spread out before you. The spacious atrium hosts the hotel's "Regions" restaurant that features a nice variety of entrees, sandwiches, and salads. The hotel's location could hardly be better. An easy walk to Wacker Drive, State Street, Dearborn and Michigan Avenues. The River Walk is just yards from the hotel. A concierge desk sits in the lobby but is not always staffed. The front desk is very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful but somewhat understaffed. I had to wait in long lines to get information I needed. The only complaint I have about the room is that the walls are a little thin. I could hear an annoying cellphone conversation in the neighboring room. All things considered, this is a good Holiday Inn convenient to shopping, restaurants and a CVS drugstore.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were on the 21st floor and had a magnificent view of the Chicago River. Staff were friendly and helpful in giving directions to attractions and train routes. Rooms were average. The beds were kind of springy, but somewhat comfortable after a couple of nights there. The bathroom fan didn't work and we were offered another room, but since we had settled and fallen for the view, we opted to go without a fan. Our room keys kept on getting deactivated-happened three times, but they said it was because of carrying them close to cell phones. Housekeeping was late once out of the four days we stayed. We didn't have our room ready when we came back mid-afternoon. The location is in a secluded area-perhaps it was because we stayed during Memorial weekend. When it's a regular work-day there's a hustle and bustle of people coming in and out of the college located in the same building and Merchandise Mart. Go across the walkway to access a foodcourt, CTA Lines, look through the furniture/furnishing showrooms, and post office during the weekdays. Michigan Avenue is about 15-20 minute walk from the hotel. It's a nice walk on a good day or $5 for a cab drive there. With all the walking we did, we got to know the streets real well. We felt pretty safe walking around the area late at night. Parking-On Sunday and Monday (a holiday) we parked for free along Wacker Drive. The other nites, I parked in a parking facility located about a block and a half on Lake & Franklin for $22.25 for 24 hrs vs. the $27/night at the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was there for a conference and the hotel booked late (my bad) and through hotwire ended up about a mile from the hotels where the conference was held. It is actually a lovely walk along the river so that wouldn't be a problem -- except it was a bit of a drag in the rain and snow. Got off to a bad start when greeted with the notice that their Wifi was down -- this is critical to me traveling and I had lots of business I needed to conduct using the net -- so not having this essential tool for 24 hours was a real drawback. I had planned to take care of several important tasks that evening that I couldn't get done because of this. The room was fine. A basic clean holiday inn type room. The view was of the airshaft. At least I didn't end up with a room on the inner lobby which I would imagine would be noisy. Having read about theft in this review site (after I had received the hotwire pick) I looked into leaving my camera and laptop in a safe deposit box while I was out -- their boxes are tiny and won't handle anything but documents. Given their obvious concern about theft (lots written in the documents), it is unfortunate to have neither room safes or adequate security boxes. There is a pretty fair deli on the first floor of the building which was convenient -- especially since the neighborhood is not particularly good for small restaurants etc. Room service breakfast was prompt and good. They even provided the hot milk I requested (to make my own latte with the room coffee) fair value if the location is convenient for you.,</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is the hotel that came up with my Priceline bid - far lower than any of the rates I noticed looking thru the reviews quickly & we couldn't have been happier with it. Our stay was over the Memorial Day weekend - Sunday & Monday night. There is an enclosed walkway to the Brown Line (CTA trains) which we discovered was closed except during business days. The walk outside takes just as long as the winding corridor you need to walk thru. The stop across the way makes it quite convenient to all of Chicago. We were not at the hotel much but it was quiet, clean, friendly staff, and very comfortable (especially after the rock hard beds we had stayed at outside the city). Also they held our luggage until we were leaving which made taking one of the last flights out a lot easier. The views were great - we were on the 22nd floor, outside room. The lobby is an open area that extends all the way up creating a square. I do not know if the inner rooms have any kind of view. One reviewer is correct about the restaurants. You are staying in a business district of Chicago so there is not a lot of good restaurants 5 steps from the door but with CTA so convenient that should not stop yoiu from staying here. No matter when you go look into the Go Card thru the CTA if you are not driving - buy it for the number of days needed & pay one price for unlimited use. Also, during the summer months there are a lot of free trolleys to take you to & from the major sites. I had ditched my rental car before checking in so I can not say anything about the parking.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice Hotel for a reasonable price....sometimes”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel on Priceline for the weekend of 10/21/2011-10/24/2011 (3 nights) for ~$120/night after taxes. It was easily accessible from public transit and right on the river. I flew into Midway and it took me about 30 minutes on a Friday night. For those that are unclear, this hotel is on top of the Chicago Sun-Times building. From the outside, it doesn't appear very special but after you take the elevator to the hotel lobby, it is nice without being overly ostentatious. We were originally booked for a bed with a single king bed but instead asked for one with two double beds. Initially, we were told this was unavailable but a manager overheard our request and he freed one up for us. The room was reasonable size with a spacious bathroom. The bathroom did not have a vent fan which was annoying after showering but nothing to make me not stay here again. I left a note for the cleaning crew to leave some extra shampoo and they did so. Beds were not great but not terrible. Four Pillows come with each bed (two firm, two plush). Our room was an inner room which meant the only view we had was of the pool (which closes at 11pm. It would've been nice to have a view of the river or the city but because we had already placed one special request we decided not to go to the well too many times. The hotel bar had fantastic views. Drinks at the bar were a bit expensive. The free Wifi was convenient and never dropped out once. A/C units were noisy. For the price I paid ($120/night) I would recommend it but I would have difficulty paying the asking price of $200+/night for it.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Worst stay in Chicago”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When checking in on a recent business trip to Chicago, the front desk personnel noticed that I have booked the room through a discount travel website. Then she automatically assigned me to the worst smoking room in the whole place, right next door to the entry to their exercise room, without even looking to see if there was a non-smoking room. I told her that I am not a smoker. She said, "The room isn't that bad". Obviously she had not been in that room before. Then, she suggested that next time I book a room directly with them if I wanted a non-smoking room. The smell in the room was so bad that I had to go out in the middle of the first night and get a couple of deodorizer sprays. The room smelled like a filthy ashtray. Upon returning home, I had to spend nearly $100 on dry cleaning bill. It seems Holiday Inn have signed up discount travel website to just to fill their worst rooms that would not normally sell under any circumstances. What infuriates me the most is that during my stay, the place was practically empty. For a discount of mare $15 off their regular rate per night ($165 during my stay), this experience left me with disgust and anger over the management and business relationship between lodging industry and discount travel websites. Lastly but not the least, when checking out of this dump to go to the Oâ€™Hare airport, the doorman kept me waiting for a cab (special cab) nearly thirty minutes, while not calling for any other cab. When the special cab arrived, it was an off-duty cab of his buddy who splits proceeds of the fare with him. That just tops it all with my nightmare experience with this Holiday Inn.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I received this hotel deal through a Travelzoo promotion with the hotel. I paid $59/a night. The offer was for $15 parking which I did not use....and a upgrade to a view, a gorgeous view or the skyline and the river..a $25 food and beverage voucher for the first night which included room service and alcohol...and a buy one/get one free entree the next day which I did not used. I have never felt like things were so great that I owed the hotel money. Noteworthy things: The hotel gave me early checkin....and 2pm checkout for being a Priority Club member. To me the location was a great distance to where I wanted to go...Union Station, Magnificent Mile, and Chicago Cultural Center. The hotel is in Merchandise Mart and the lobby is on the 15th floor. So you have 2 elevator rides to reach the lobby. Room service above averages. I thought the prices were decent. Told me it would take 35 minutes and a knock was at the door at exactly 35 minutes. The spring rolls...yummy. The Italian KOBE burger and sides....extra yummy. It did not taste like a "free" meal and I tipped the server 50%. Room: Bath a little dated...I love the recycling options. I loved the soft vs firm pillow selections in the room. My room also has a sitting area. Very large area. Enough towels to keep me happy the entire stay. Quiet unless someone was outside the door. The not so great: The WIFI...blech..it kept going in and out, in and out, along with my phone reception. That was the only issue that I had. I will note that there were no offers to help with my baggage although I was flirted with...I had no problem but the offer would have been nice. Front Desk provided EXCEPTIONAL service.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Stunning 21st floor views but ... wifi terrible”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found a good online rate for both rooms for family Thanksgiving in West Loop. The window walls of the corner executive king offered fabulous cityscape views, the bed was comfortable (no bedbuds) & small fridge necessary. Downstairs, the pool and exercise room were tops, and we found the bar and reasonable $ breakfast buffets good places to relax and nosh. When a knee injury meant walking became very painful, Philip, on duty in the lobby, searched the storage room & found help. He also located a walker, but the cane w/ arm brace was enough to get me outside to enjoy Zoo Lights opening night. So why not 5 star? Hot water & a good wifi signal were both too hard to achieve. For an advertised green hotel to have patrons wasting water before it's warm enough to shower is a problem that needs fixing. And my hubbie, who always travels w/ laptop & iphone, was frustrated by the weak (Verizon) signal in our room. Was it better in the biz center? Don't know because HI-MP has the quirk of free in-room wifi on your devices but $$ wifi in the biz centerâ€”and who needs any additional cost? Location was great for visiting the newlyweds but wifi & water may have us chancing the Crowne Plaza again (which had bedbugs summer 2010) Detour for foodies: After Zoo Lights we headed to The Counter for best burgers so far in Chicago. It's fun to decide how to build'em in this well-lit, casual family spot. With all the 50-cent additions to choose from, believe me, you don't need a 3/4 pounder. And the pretzel burger is great way to hold it all together. Late night sorbet & wine in the HI bar went well w/ my painkillers, allowing sleep before (another) game day w/ the kids.</p></li>

<li>It's fun to decide how to build'em in this well-lit, casual family spot.</br></br></li>
<li>With all the 50-cent additions to choose from, believe me, you don't need a 3/4 pounder.</br></br></li>
<li>And the pretzel burger is great way to hold it all together.</br></br></li>
<li>Late night sorbet & wine in the HI bar went well w/ my painkillers, allowing sleep before (another) game day w/ the kids.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ok, I went to priceline, entered where I wanted to stay and crossed my fingers. Found the hotel that accepted my rate, and again, crossed my fingers. Read some reviews on the hotel and was a little concerned, everyone complaining about using two elevators, and how terrible the people who worked there were. I was apprehensive from the start, ready for the worst, but when I arrived, the bellman gave simple directions (there were 6 of us, to include a 13 y/o 8 y/o and 3 y/o..) to get up to the hotel. Walk in the revolving door, by the escalator and take the elevator. WOW.. And people had compained about THAT? Ok, I figured it had to get much worse. Upstairs, at check in where the "rude obnoxious" desk people were according to another review, stood these two women who were MORE than happy to help us, and even went the extra mile to find us adjoining rooms, on the same floor as the pool deck. Ok, we went to the rooms, yes did take another elevator, but we made it with no effort (remember 3 kids!). Got to the room and expected the huge CSI crime scene another reviewer posted about, and the rooms were immaculate. I opened the curtain expecting a view commensurate with what I had paid, and POOF, there was the Chicago Skyline. Hancock Building one way, and Sears tower another, along with the river right below us. Yes, the restaraunt is over priced, but 3 blocks away is a fast food restaraunt. We used room service for desert only and had no problems with the delivery or service. The pool was a little chilly, but I believe it to be because the pool deck was kept at 80 degrees. The water was great once you were in it. Fitness room with a sauna was superb. If you want a complaint from me, it will only be that next time I use priceline, Sadly I am afraid that my experience won't be this great.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Second Stay - Renovation almost complete!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Second stay here, this time two nights, enjoying the flat screen television, cozy duvets on the beds and the four pillows to luxuriate in. The lure of Earth Hour brought us back this particular weekend. The renovation is almost complete and the lobby area looks fabulous. Unfortunately, the new restaurant was opening the day after my stay, but we enjoyed the great breakfast via room service one morning and the temporary location the next. Just as in my previous review, the restaurant staff is amazing. Everyone is so pleasant, helpful and genuinely happy to be working in their hotel. Dined in Cityscape Friday night and fell completely in love with Tony Miu's Zentini, a wicked combination of Skyy Citrus, Zen Green Tea Liqueur and lime juice, followed by an equally wicked Grand Pandaro Cheese Pasta, all while watching the beautiful night skyline along the river. Earlier in the day we had watched the Chicago Police boats going back and forth past Wolf Point and the river tour boats have already started service. Wish it had been warmer so we could have enjoyed some outdoor activity too. This trip we got to the gym and were very impressed with the equipment available. Everything was spotlessly clean to begin with and there were wipes and sprays available to clean the equipment before and after use, which gives great peace of mind. There's stacks of fresh clean towels and a convenient spot to drop the soiled towels, so everything stays invitingly clean, unlike many gyms.There is also a very nice sauna in the same area, but we hadn't thought to bring swimwear this trip, so no pool - no sauna. Next time for certain! Cityscape was a verrrry popular spot for Earth Hour so alas, we thought we'd have a better view from our room. We settled in front of the expanse of windows and watched as the lights went off in many downtown landmarks. It was gratifying to see how many people became involved in the energy saving movement, including, of course, the hotel who even doused the parking lot lighting. Once again, a completely enjoyable stay.</p></li>
