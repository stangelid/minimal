<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a lovely, small hotel, tucked away at the end of a quiet side street but only minutes from the main road, Via Veneto. The rooms are tastefully decorated and in excellent condition. The service is wonderful, room service is quick, and the front desk very helpful. But the best part of this hotel is its rooftop restaurant with a panoramic view of Rome. A gem of a hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall a decent hotel in a good central location. However we stayed over a couple of warm days in late February and our room was unbearable hot. The air conditioning didn't work and it I was told it was because the system is set to provide heating only in the winter months. I'm not sure if this is correct. I don't really care why the air conditioning didn't work. This just isn't acceptable for a 4 start hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located in a rather quiet, slightly out of the way neighbourhood, but an easy walk to key attractions like The Spanish Steps, this is a lovely hotel. Rooms are very comfortable (though could use a little maintenance - peeling paint etc) with those Sofitel beds which truely are amazing. Very helpful and friendly staff. The rooftop terrace bar is the perfect place to wind down with an afternoon drink and catch your breath after a busy day walking around Rome - great cocktail list and fantastic bar staff.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent 4 nights with my girl friend at the hotel Sofitel Roma Villa Borghese. In comparaison with the other Sofitel hotels we know was this stay rather disappointing. Nothing negative to say about the location, very close to the center in a quiet area, or about the cleanliness. The room was well decoreted but very small, the bathroom tiny. The breakfast was very poor, with artificial fruit juices and an indecent quality of the "fresh" fruit. Impossible to eat at the restaurant on the top floor, it's far too expensive.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Based on other reviews on trip advisor, we booked 3 nights in this hotel in February on a special Valentine's package. Despite the website saying that they did not do rooms to accommodate three people, we were allocated a triple room - a room with a king size bed and a separate adjoining room with a single bed for our 8 year old daughter. It was perfect. The staff were great, the hotel was spotless and rooms very well appointed. We were made to feel really welcome. Excellent location for exploring the sites. Highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose this hotel using trip advisor and was not disapponted. . This hotel is in a great spot for all the main sites, although does involve a steep hill walk at the end of the day. Facilities and room was excellent - we had one of the best bedrooms we have ever had in a hotel. For breakfast there was an extensive choice and food was of a good quality. The staff are discreet but are more than happy to help if you need their assistance. It is typical of a hotel dealing with tourists and business clientele. Would definitely return.</p></li>

If you have mobility issues, this is probably too far out of the central district for you. It is not far to walk to places if you are used to walking. Rome is not handicapped accessible...and traveling with older parents is a chore. The city is wonderful and enchanting. There is grafitti all over, but remember...it is a big city and it does not detract from the wonder of Rome. WE LOVE IT HERE! Rome è bella! any questions, just email whtheater@aol.com</p></li>

I contacted the hotel directly to get a feel for their customer service and was so impressed, we decided to book directly with them. The wonderful staff, especially Eliseo, made sure we received top notch service, something you rarely experience anymore. If you can splurge, book a room on the 7th floor, the largest most beautiful rooms and views await you. Stop reading this and book a room with Sofitel. :-) Ciao.</p></li>

We stayed a week at the Sofitel and enjoyed our spacious very clean room. The hotel is located in a quiet area that is hidden away from tourists. There are tons of coffee shops and restaurants in the area. And of course, our favorite spot to end our day was the roof top bar and restaurant. The views from the top were beautiful. The food in the restaurant is really good, we enjoyed an amazing dinner the last night when we did the chef's special. Close to spanish steps.</p></li>

You can't beat the location, walking distance to both the Spanish Steps as well as lots of nice cafes and restaurants, but at the same time it's located in a quiet spot so you're away from the crowds. The room was beautiful, and the bathroom was total luxury. I have to agree with the post below about the sheets, I definitely noticed that they were on the rough side, but we didn't mind it too much. All in all it was a magnificent trip and we would do it again. We LOVED the Sofitel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved this hotel. It's in a great position, only 10 minutes from the Spanish Steps. Staff were very helpful, booked restaurants for us from the Lonely Planet guide. Nice bar where you can sit and have pre-dinner and post dinner drinks (if required!). Concierge were great, organised a taxi to the airport for us and when I telephoned to say we would be late as we were still having lunch, they sorted it with the taxi driver without any problems. Rooms and bathrooms were very clean and comfortable. All in all a great stay, very good value for money - would highly recommend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Sofitel Roma in Oct. we booked two rooms. The hotel itself is beautiful and in a good location. They offer a nice breakfast which was included in our rate. The staff was fine, nothing outstanding. We had to track down the bartender each night to get a drink. The rooms are neat and clean, but the sheets are made of burlap. Ok, not really, but were so scratchy and stiff that we put towels down to sleep on! I booked the hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor, so I thought it was important to note the sheet problem for others to be aware of. vicki- London England</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a wonderful way to start a vacation. My husband really wanted to stay here and I was worried because I thought it might be too far away from everything. Was I wrong! We were treated like royalty by everyone we encountered. The rooftop bar had a great happy hour and spectacular views. Our room was plush and modern. The huge tub begged me to take a bath! iPod radio, mini balconies, pillow top bed mattresses. Robes, slippers, turndown service and chocolates just enhanced the experience. I threw my coin into Trevino fountain so I know I'll be back and have no doubts where I will stay!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “No towel warmer???”</li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent four nights at Sofitel Roma and it was by far the best hotel out of the four we stayed at during our trip. This is clearly a high-end luxury hotel which delivers. The location is great, the staff were all extremely helpful and spoke proficient English. The room was wonderful with a very comfortable bed. The walls must be 10" thick, because we could not hear a sound, which was amazing given this is in the center of a major city. The only item we could come up with on the "negative" side was the lack of towel warmer in the bathroom. When in Rome, stay here - it really is the best.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a very nice stay at the Sofitel Roma. The staff was very friendly and the room was quite nice. The hotel was extremely quiet (which is what you want after traipsing around ruins all day). Ezzio was especially friendly and recommended a great restaurant. Avoid the laughably expensive continental breakfast (45 Euros!) and go to some of the cheaper places very close to the hotel. The terrace bar is breathtaking, but expensive too. Very close walk to the metro, Spanish steps, and Trevi fountain, but tucked away in a quiet residential area. Will we stay here again when we return to Rome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked our room based on the high rating the hotel received on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. We booked a deluxe suite and enjoyed the luxury and spaciousness the Sofitel provides. The location can't be beat for its quietness and its proximity to the Villa Borghese. The views from the terrace are spectacular and is the perfect setting to enjoy a glass of wine at sunset. We were very impressed with the full breakfast buffet the hotel provides. We also enjoyed a dinner at their restaurant. However, it was pricey but the service was spectacular given we were the only couple dining.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything was perfect! The staff (every single one) was so nice, polite and helpful. The hotel is so fantastic and beautiful that it´s impossible to describe! The trip to Rome was my 12-year old sons first trip outside of Sweden and the stay at Sofitel really helped to make the trip a wonderful experience for him (and me of course). We got chocolate every evening too... I can´t say anything negative about this hotel. If I must it would be that the breakfast could have more healthy alternatives. But breakfast was good! I would recommend this hotel to everyone, but I think honeymooners have the perfect hotel here...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for three days in August. The hotel was comfortable air conditioned throughout, clean and quiet. The breakfast was all you would expect with fresh breads, cheeses, fruits, bacon, eggs etc etc. Service was excellent throughout the hotel. Only a short walk from the spanish steps, pantheon and trevi fountains but in a quiet street with little passing traffic. The open top bus tour of Rome stops one street away and the metro is nearby. Great roof terrace which could use some sun loungers to take the weight from weary feet but otherwise great views over the city. Quite expensive however but it is Rome. Well worth considering!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In a city full of hotels, I would highly recommend the Sofitel. The hotel was clean with a bright and helpful staff. The location was ideal, a short walk from the Spanish Steps and in a neighbourhood with some good restaurants. The area is very quiet. There is a stunning, outdoor rooftop bar/restaurant with amazing sunset views. At night they light it up with candles. It's really beautiful. We only had drinks but the food we saw being served looked quite good. The breakfast buffet is expensive but it's an incredible spread. We ate there just once and it was a real treat. Other breakfast options are available locally. I will stay here again.</p></li>

Separate lounge area with a sleeper sofa. Nice bathroom with rainshower and deep tub. Big king size bed with lots of pillows. 2 flat screen tv's. Bose docking station. Nice linens. We had room service coffee and cocoa each morning - fast and delicious. Rooftop terrace for a surprise Thanksgiving lunch. Excellent turkey dinner and desserts. I loved everything about this hotel. The service was lovely. A quick walk to the Via Veneto and Spanish Steps. Room on 6th floor was dead quiet. We will definitely stay here again.</p></li>

All personnel at reception desk were so friendly and had wonderful attitudes. Always a smile on their faces. Very knowledgable in suggesting restaurants etc. Outdoor doormen had same great attitude.- One of them suggested a great pizza place within walking distance to the hotel. Had a beautiful suite on the 7th. Floor, with a huge balcony with great views of the Vatican. The female bartender in the bar was so lovely! Buffet breakfast is very good with many choices. About a 10 minute walk to Spanish Steps. Overall a great experience at Sofitel Roma!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The final leg of our second trip to France and Italy was topped off by the excellence of the Rome Sofitel Hotel near the Gardens. A genuinely courteous, friendly and professional staff that provided impeccable service from the door man to the front desk to the turn down service. The room was incomparable, exquisitley appointed and very large by any standards. The location was perfect for touring, especially for walkers. I would compare this hotel to the George V in Paris as far as qaulity of service and overall ambience, just not as big and less eating options. The hotel was a memorable part of our visit to the Etenal City. Will definitely stay here again on next visit to Rome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel was very nice and staff friendly. Some remarks however: - Advice from the staff about good restaurant were not exact. - As well the concierges confirmed us that Castel Sant'Angelo were open Monday although this is not the case. Luckily, before to go there, we phoned to the castle museum and a voice mail informed us that it was well closed on Monday. - With a young child (6) the place is perfect for the Villa Borghese gardens but a little far, by feet, of the city center. - Breakfast is splendid but e little expensive (30€/p). Nevertheless we keep a very very good memory of this hotel (the room was splendid) and about the staff in general. We will return with great pleasure !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We travelled to Italy in May 2011 and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Sofitel. The room was spacious with a little outside balcony. The staff were so helpful, anytime we wanted advice or directions they were very accomodating. Luigi was our favourite, each day he greeted us with a big smile and reminded us to beware of pick pockets with our bags secured in front of us. It is just around the corner from the Villa Borghese park, we hired a little four person bike and rode around the park laughing and joking along the way. There a restaurants and shops nearby and you can walk anywhere as it is a central location. It was probably more expensive than a lot of hotels but certainly worth it for our experience!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros: 1. Great views from our room 2. Comfy beds 3. We were afraid that the bathroom would be tiny, but were happy that this was up to par 4. Close to Hertz - as we had to return car and wanted to be close to hotel 5. Could walk to some sights - spanish steps/trevi fountain/villa borghese 6. Close enough to the subway 7. Roof top bar 8. We were able to walk from Colosseum to the hotel, it is a good 20 odd minutes walk Cons: 1. Restaurants around neighborhood were not that great 2. Terrible room service food Note: If you need a taxi, walk up to Via Veneto - about 1/4 mile away and get it from there. If you request hotel to fetch you a cab, the meter starts ticking from the time the taxi is called from taxi stand.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my third Sofitel hotel experience and the best so far. I have previously stayed at their St James location in London and at their Washington DC location just off La Fayette Square. Everything however at this Sofitel just seems to come together from the service to the rooms to the location.The rooms at the Roma location are an excellent size and the place is just the right spot.Just around the corner from the Spainish Steps and not too far from other sights such as the Trevi fountain. Rooms are well appointed and a good size. Great breakfast served daily downstairs keeps you going till dinner. Nothing was a problem for the Front desk staff. Overall a truly enjoyable experience. Would definitely recommend this one.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just came back from Rome after a four nights stay at the Sofitel. It is a very nice hotel in a great location. It's only 30 minutes from the hussle and bussle of Piazza Navona (by foot) and it offers the most beautiful views over Rome from the top floor bar. We were lucky enough to have our room in the upper floor (6th) and the view from it was astonishing. The room is not very big but is nicely appointed with all the bits you expect from a 5 star hotel. Reception staff and breakfast staff were very professional and friendly. The breakfast is particularly good for Italy with a large choice of cold and hot dishes. One downside, the staff at the bar "The Boston" was very rude and not friendly at all. Altogether it was a lovely experience and we will definetely come back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed for 3 nights at this lovely hotel. It is worth the money especially when we have the spectacular view from the rooftop restaurant and bar. We had dinner twice in the restaurant and the food was great. The cocktails were to die for despite being a little pricey but worth it. Our room, the basic delux room with 2 beds together was fine, we have a lovely view from the window onto a busy street but we could live with that. The only downside to the room was that we have an interconnecting room which was locked at the time, however, we could hear the people next door drying their hair etc waking us up at 6am!!. Overall the staff were very good, the room was always cleaned when we returned. We would definately return to the hotel and recommend it to others too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Sofitel is a great choice for a stay in Rome. The hotel is in a great location and the rooms are very large and comfortable. The bathrooms were very nice and the breakfast buffet was extensive. The hotel would have gotten a 5 had there been any kind of concierge help at the hotel. My girlfriend and I were first time visitors to Rome and needed some suggestions for both dining and tours. The front desk did not have a concierge and the extent of the reception desk's help was providing a street map. That being said, there was a doorman at the hotel that should be promoted to concierge. He had some great advice on where to get tickets to avoid lines and certain "off-the-beaten track" sites. For the price, the Sofitel is a prime choice in Rome, just promote the doorman and we will come back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I stayed in the Sofitel while in Rome. The staff was exquisite to us and they did whatever to make us feel very welcome and even on the last day, when we had already checked out, and I went back to the hotel as I had hurt my foot,they did their best to make me feel comfortable while I was waiting for the taxi to go to the airport. The room was lovely and spaciuos, so the bathroom. The level of cleaness was excellent, they were coming in the room twice per day to clean and tyding up.Top notch also the roof terrace, we had a couple of drinks in there that were lovely.The location is perfect near Trinita' dei Monti and Villa Borghese. This hotel really made the difference to our stay, I cannot really find a thing to fault it.I would really reccomend it for a romantic week-end.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I called the Sofitel on the morning of my check-in date after the original hotel I made reservations at (Roma Boutique) lost my reservation (they blamed Hotels.com) and put me up at hotel Della Regioni. I was sick of all the hassel, really disliked the accomodations at Regioni and willing to pay any amount to stay at a great hotel. I called Sofitel and the reception desk gave me a rate which was about $100 less than major websites had advertised (probably since it was a last minute). I have nothing bad to say about them at all. The location is amazing, staff is incredible (one of the men at the front desk spent 20 minutes looking for a place that sold curling irons because mine broke) and the room is EXTREMELY spacious by Italian standards, clean with beautiful decor. I don't think I will ever stay at another hotel in rome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We are just back from a 3 night stay in this lovely hotel. We booked it based on the great reviews it had received on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed. The staff were very helpful and friendly and our room was great (a good size, comfortable king size bed with a lovely bathroom). The hotel's location is also excellant, just a few minutes from the Spanish Steps. We also enjoyed taking our time and walking back from the Vatican to the hotel. It's a long walk but with great sights along the way and we actually found the hotel to be so central that everywhere was within walking distance. The breakfast was very nice, with lovely fresh pastries and it filled us up for the morning's sight seeing. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone as we felt it added to our wonderful weekend break in Rome and we plan to definitely come back in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very good hotel in an excellent location. Staff very friendly and attentive, clearly a result of a dedicated effort by the general management. Overall sparkling clean, without being "clinical". Bathrooms excellent with "Roger Gallet" products.Rooms spacious and extremely quiet (at least mine). (Bed-linens are not that scratchy: they are made , precisely, in linen, which is a material more costly and even more healthy than cotton ). Beautiful breakfast with prosciutto crudo sliced on the spot. Two or three PROBLEMS. Room-service hours , for hot dishes,are way too short : from 19:30 to 22:30. I was sold a three-bed room , but one was actually a rather uncomfortable chaise-longue, which my senior relative did not appreciate too much (I know, I should have used it...). My bed was creaking (revenge by the senior relative ?). Very good place overall.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I spent three enjoyable nights at the Sofitel. While the staff aren't the most attenttive in the world we found them charming and helpful in their own Italian way. The room was typically Roman with lots of rich coloured furnishings. Although it was quite small, we found it cosy and more than adequate for our stay. The breakfast (included in our rate) was a well presented buffet with cured meats and pastries The coffee was unusually weak for Italy but they will politly get you a pot of local lava when asked! The hotel is very central, only five minutes from the Spanish Steps. The only minor complaint we had was that there was no business centre so we were unable to access the net on site. Having said that, next time we're in Town we'll definitely stay here! If the net is essential I would advise you to bring a laptop and access it in your room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the sofitel in Jul 2006. Very elegant and luxurious rooms. We were a family of four with two rooms, which were interconnected by a private hallway. We loved this arrangement. The bathrooms were very nicely appointed and modern (as the other reviewers commented, water does splash out when taking a shower due to insufficient barrier but this is a rather minor inconvenience). The hotel is located close to the Spanish steps and a short walk from the Trevi fountains. Access to bus and Metro stations was also convenient, which allowed us to go to all the sites during the day and retreat back to a quiet oasis after an exhausting day of sightseeing. There were also many dining options near the hotel. Our expectations of hotel rooms are very high, and I would say this hotel is comparable to many top resort hotels in the US in terms of room size and quality.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is really good, on a perfect location, within walking distance from the Spanish Steps, Villa Borghese and Via Veneto. The rooms are spacious enough and the bed very comfortable. Bathroom needs updating, though, my bathtub was quite old. Breakfast excellent and the staff there extremely kind. One major complaint: I had a pair of gold earrings that were stolen from my room. The room does have a safe and I had put the rest of my jewelry there. Right before going out I realized I had left this pair of earrings on my nightstand. I remember thinking "this is not the kind of hotel where things get stolen" so I just left them there. But guess what? When I came back the earrings were gone. I reported it to the reception, they made some efforts trying to find them, but of course they didn't. I appreciated their efforts, but I was very disappointed as this is not the kind of thing you would expect in a hotel like this.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just returned from a 2 week tour of Italy. Our first 2 nights were spent at the Sofitel Roma. I should preface my comments by saying we had previously stayed at the Sofitel New York and couldn’t have had a better stay. My expectations, therefore, were very high for the Rome location. The hotel is nice, the breakfasts are very good, the staff is certainly cordial and the roof top terrace gives an excellent view. The rooms, however, were a disappointment. They were tiny, the décor was loud and ornate in an overdone way. Our walls were scuffed from previous occupant’s luggage and the room just didn’t feel plush. The bathrooms were very nice, however. We decided during our trip to return to Rome the day before our flight, instead of the day of, and did not book with the Sofitel. We, instead, booked at the Hotel Piranesi and were thrilled with the accommodations and location. Breakfast there was even better!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This property has a lot going for it. Location is excellent, easy walk to the Spanish Steps, Trevi fountain and Medici gardens. It sits a few blocks from the Via Veneto in a relatively quiet area. My room faced a small street with lovely buildings. The staff were uniformly helpful. The room was nicely sized, amenities appropriate for the class of hotel. Bed was a bit hard for my taste. The sheets were atrocious. Like cheap gauze and not comfortable to lie on at all. This is my only dislike. The hotel is not big enough for tourist groups but large enough to accommodate the average guest which i appreciate. The included breakfast was good, the service in the restaurant above average. One tip I got from the hotel: The travel agency two blocks down sells train tickets (seat reservation included) for no extra commission. Definately a time/hassle saver if your plans include train travel and you have not purchased online. Lines at Termini in Rome are mostly miserable!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A 5 minute walk from the Spanish Steps, the Sofitel offers a location that is just far enough removed rom the hustle and bustle of the tourist sights, but yet centrally located. There is a supermarket located in the metro stop only 5 minutes away. Not many restaurants right by the hotel though. The hotel has a terrific roof top terrace where light meals and drinks are served only in the evening. A very beautiful spot to watch the sunset over St. Peters. The hotel has limited services: no fitness center; a smallish restaurant located in the basement.. Breakfast didn't look all that appealing for Euro 25. But what it lacks in physical plant, it makes up for in terrrific rooms and bathrooms. We had 2 rooms that were connected by a foyer, creating a decent sized private area for 2 adults and 3 children. We found the front desk staff to be very helpful and the housekeeping staff was great in providing 2 sevices a day. The hotel is not "grand" but is "charming and intimate"</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a small, boutique feeling hotel located in a quiet residential area of Rome. The front desk staff were extremely helpful and nice and allowed us to check in at approximately 9:30 in the morning after our flight from the United States. The rooms were tasteful and exceptionally clean, if a little on the small side. The bathroom was beautiful, although the shower configuration allowed water to leak out onto the floor, which I hated to have to mop up with the bath towels, since they were thick and luxurious! It was a short (five-minute, approx.) walk to Via Veneto, and a bit of a longer (10-15) walk to the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain. Ancient Rome and Vatican City were a longer distance to walk, but we found the peaceful, quiet and peddler-free area the Sofitel was located in worth the extra distance, either on foot or by cab. We got the bed and breakfast rate and were very pleased with the breakfast. This was a perfectly wonderful place to start our trip through Italy!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for one night. On arrival Luigi the doorman/bell boy was extremely friendly showing us all the amenities of our room and hints and tips to get around Rome. We were lucky enough to get a room with a small balcony and we had a view over looking villa borghese. The bedroom was large enough to accomodate our 2 suitcases. The bathroom had large fluffy towels and dressing gowns and slippers were provided. We didnt' experience any problem with the shower. The reception staff assisted us to book a table at a restaurant and were always welcoming. Internet access is provided for free for 1 hour in the business centre but this is a bit slow. The rooftop bar was not open when we were there but it was free to go up and have a look at the views from the 7th floor. We didn't eat at the hotel as there are many restaurants within walking distance. Although the hotel is on top of a small hill we didn't find it difficult to walk to the major sites and back again. We would stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I debated between the Sofitel and the Intercontinental which is by the Spanish Steps before we went on our trip to Rome. I definatly made the right choice staying at the Sofitel. Yes, it is a little further from the Spanish Steps but I think that is a plus as it is on a side street which is quiet. We could leave our windows open and had fresh air and no noise from the streets and tourists on the streets. Do not worry about the linen sheets, they are changed each day and are not uncomfortable. The pillows were very hard though. There was turn down service each evening with a chocolate on the pillow. The breakfast buffet was the best we had on our two week trip to Italy. There is no internet service in the hotel. There is something on the television which is supposed to be internet, but we could never get it to work so if you are a business traveler, I suggest you bring your laptop if you have one. This hotel met all of our expectations for a quiet, restful place after a very long trip to Rome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We visited the Sofitel July 27 for three nights. The experience was truly wonderful. The doorman was so helpful and basically planned our day showing us in detail where to go on the map and what to see at each stop. The front desk was very helpful and tried to accomodate our needs. The lobby bar was lovely and I enjoyed a capuccino and the lovely waitress brought me an entire plate of shortbread cookies to munch on (not ordered). There is a food market in the subway about a ten minute walk and we were able to buy some items including drinks. The location was great as you were near both the Spanish steps and the Bernini area. One evening we ate at an amazing family style restaurant at the suggestion of the front desk. The name started with a P, someting like pompanello and the food was very good. Not a romantic type restaurant. The room was very clean and the turn down service a nice touch. The walk up the spanish steps and up the hill to the hotel in the heat was a challenge but doable. We will return again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice Hotel- not Five Stars”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel enjoys an excellent location within easy walking distance of the Spanish Steps. The staff is friendly and professional. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Here are a few observations. 1: No complementary coffee. 2: No help with attractions or entertainment events. 3: You must ask for a non-smoking room. 4: The rooftop is small with a poor view. 5: No gym/spa. 6: Only two computers for internet use. 7: The lobby is old and dated with a bland style. Overall, this is a nice hotel in a wonderful location but this is not a Five Star property. The best I can give this hotel is four stars. However, I would note that Rome hotels in general are not to the same level as NYC or London. You will enjoy this property, but do not expect a Five Star/ World Class hotel. Don’t bring travelers checks because the exchange merchants in Rome will rip you off. Best to use your credit card with a 0 fee exchange commission. Check your credit card rules before coming. In Italy - NEVER buy anything without asking the price first.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is an excellent hotel that maintains the Sofitel standards. We liked it because it was in a quite location, not on the main streets but just a short walk from the Spanish Steps. Our room was very luxurious - though not large. And this is one of the hotels that still has an evening bed turn-down service (at least our room did). The hotel on the whole is very well run and the staff are very attentive. The views from the rooftop restaurant are beautiful both during the day but especially in the evenings. The meal portions are what you would expect from a hotel of this calibre (very well made but small) - having tried one of the restaurants around the corner from the hotel (Il Picolo Mondo - I was not impressed) we decided we'd continue eating at the hotel if we were nearby. Apart from the Vatican, you can pretty much walk to most of the important ruins (colloseum about 20 minute walk) The only downside that comes to mind is that there's no gym/pool facility in the hotel. They have an agreement with an establishment somewhere nearby.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have to counter-balance some of these positive reviews. I really felt like the location was too far off the beaten path, and a lot of people raved about the location. I guess the location was good is you're looking for a quiet location where you can walk to the Spanish Steps, but my husband and were so over it after a few days. We wanted to check out all of Rome and were so tired of footing it back to our hotel every day after exploring, and there was so little to do right around the hotel. It felt big and impersonal with lots of big tour groups. Probably a great place for older travelers. (In fact this was recommended to me by a grandmother who recently stayed there.) But, if you want to be in the heart of things, this is not the place. Granted, it is nice and luxurious, but in that old school, red-velvet, gold way. Good for some, but I couldn't wait to get to a cooler, boutique hotel in the heart of Rome. Maybe this is ideal for a 30th wedding anniversary, but not for a honeymoon. Sorry Sofitel. Glad we were able to check out early.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for 4 nights with my husband and 6 other family members over New Year. Our rooms were conveniently located on the same floor and all were large (by Rome standards) and fitted out very nicely. The beds were large and comfortable and noise from the corridor was blocked out well. The location of the hotel is about 5 mins walk away from the Spanish Staps and right next door to Villa Bougeise. This was not an issue for any of us as within minutes you were in the centre of the tourist spots. Also, Via Veneto is a nice area. The staff in the hotel were all very friendly and helpful. We were made to feel welcome and bar service and room service was expedient and high quality. The only slightly negative comments that I have are regarding the bar and food prices which were far too expensive. Additionally, the temperature in the hotel and the rooms was very warm. We all tried to adjust the room temperature but did not have much success. Despite this, we had a great time at this high quality hotel and would not hesistate to recommend it.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 nights and were very pleased ( and relieved) with our choice. Rome has so many hotels in so many areas that it can be confusing and quite risky to get a hotel that lives up to it's PR. I looked at the reviews on Trip Advisor first and these certainly were reliable. The hotel is sited close to the Spanish Steps and Borghese Gardens ( beautiful for walking) and has plenty of cafes, hair salons and small shops nearby. The rooms were comfortable and well stocked with all amenities and the breakfasts were excellent ( although the restaurant is quite small so be prepared for a short wait). It was also a great plus to be able to open our window and get lots of fresh air without having to put up with traffic noise. Thoroughly recommend this hotel if you want to stay somewhere quiet comfortable with good, unobtrusive service. When we returned to Rome a few weeks later we had to stay in a hotel nominated by our tour (a Mercure) and it was horrible. If that had been our only experience of Rome we would have been very disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a very good hotel. From start to finish, the staff were friendly and helpful. The location is minutes away from the Barberini and Spagna subway stops and an easy walk to the Trevi Fountain or the Spanish Steps. As mentioned in other reviews, however, the walk back to the hotel is uphill. I didnt try the restaurants or eat breakfast as the costs were very high. There are plenty of restaurants around the hotel but most of them are overpriced. The rooms were small but the bed was great and the the bathroom very nice as well. My only complaint during the stay was that the rooftop bar was closed. It would have been helpful on their website to advertise the fact that the bar was closed as it was a major reason I chose this hotel. Other chains - like Marriott - are more upfront about these types of closures and I was disappointed to say the least when I arrived to find out it was closed (and it wasn't even cold - couldnt they have closed it in January!). Regardless, the hotel is up to Sofitel standards and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Sofitel is a beautiful hotel located near the Villa Borghese and Via Veneto. The lobby is elegant and understated, and the staff is professional and accomodating. We arrived at around 9:30 a.m. after a long flight from Denver. Unfortunately, since we arrived so early, our room wasn't available. We used the restroom to freshen up as much as we could, and left to grab breakfast and see the Spanish Steps (only a couple of minutes away). When we returned around noon, our room still wasn't ready, but they did have a different room available. After we arrived in our room, we were pleasantly surprised. It was large for Rome standards, and very well appointed. The bathroom was large and functional (Hermes bath products - a major plus!) The location is quiet and slightly out of the hustle and bustle of the touristy area. It was great for us because we don't mind a little bit of a walk, but if you have a concern with a lot of walking, this may not be the hotel for you. Overall, Rome is a very walkable city, and that was something we took full advantage of!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights at the end of a 5 week journey around Italy. We were really looking forward to a little luxury and some rest. Other reviews talk about having a wonderful time drinking in the roof top bar. Unfortunately for us we were staying in a room right underneath. We were unable to fall asleep thanks to the noise from tables and chairs scraping on the ceiling above us. I had to keep calling reception night after night to get some relief. Looking back now, I should have requested we move rooms but the thought of packing and moving room one more time seemed overwhelming. I would have expected the hotel to try and make amends but nothing was mentioned about the inconvience even we we checked out. We were not offered a room change, a complementary breakfast or even a drink. A true disinterest in the comfort of their guests. Also worth mentioning that the curtains in our room were removed the second day of our stay. What was that about??? This stay ended up being a huge disappointment. It will be hard for us not to hold it against the Softiel brand.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nicely located 5-star hotel with great beds; pricey but a solid choice for Rome”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's a 5-star Sofitel in a turn of the century building – pretty much as you’d hope and expect. I personally loved the location: near the park, Spanish Steps, and Via Veneto and a 10 minute stroll to the old town. The building façade is spectacular. The lobby area is a little disappointing but the much heralded roof terrace is in fact stunning – great view and a unique and wonderful place to watch the sun set on Rome - though €10 for a beer or double espresso detracts just a little from the full enjoyment of it. Rooms are good, if unspectacular and of fairly modest proportions. Of particular note, though, are the beds which are absolutely top notch. Service was solid. When I arrived they didn’t have my reservation, but took it in stride, gave us a room and was happy to sort the details out later. We booked at the very last minute, so enjoyed a steeply discounted price. If I paid the publish rates I ran across, the “value” rating would have been even lower. In short, a very nice indulgence in Rome – comfortable, great location and an easy hotel to enjoy. Just not particularly memorable.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from taking my parents on a 70th Birthday Trip to rome. We spent ages trying to find the right hotel for them and have to say reading TRIP ADVISOR was spot on. A quiet hotel, set in a luxurious location of rome. Plenty of excellent restaurants within walking distance as well as the spanish steps and the trevi fountain. (Better to get taxis if going further afield with older travellers, otherwise ok). The staff were absolutely magnificent, my father was in a wheel chair and we also had our 1 year old. The staff were very attentive to our every need from reception, door staff, restaurant and maid service. The sheets were fine, beds excellent, mini bar full and room service swift. I really couldnt praise this hotel highly enough. If your going on a city break, why spend well over the odds for a hotel you spend sleeping time in? Its the small things that count and this hotel delivers. Beds turned down, sweets on the pillow and clean towels twice a day. Just a tip. I booked a hop on hop off trip with Viator, the stop is just around the corner from the hotel on the corner of via veneto and 2 mins walk from the hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed there for a 3-night weekend getaway. The hotel is located just between the metro stations barberini and spagna and it´s a five minute walk from each of them. The area feels very safe, even late at night. Taxi fom Termini should be around 10€. After a warm welcome we were given a huge room by european and especially by rome standards: Twin beds, workplace, table, sofa and two windows facing the patio. Bathroom is huge too and got a powerful shower and nice amenities. The Minibar (Beer 7€) is expensive, but they got a very nice bar next to the lobby which is a lot cheaper (4,50€ for a beer coming with a selection of nuts and crackers). The very nice rooftop terrasse is open till 22:00h and kind of an insider tip. There is no bar upstairs, so it´s no problem to bring your drink from the bar up there (or even your own bottle of wine, I guess). Breakfast is huge and plentiful, especially by italian standards. Overall a true 5-star hotel, even if they only got 4 stars premium. We received a warm goodbye when leaving incl. waving and smiling. I would definetely try to book this hotel again for my return to rome. Recommended!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a 5 night stay at this hotel, which I booked on the recommedations from the reviews on this site. After reading reviews about a number of hotels in Rome we could only find this one, which was a bit more than we wanted to pay, that could give us what we wanted. We weren't dissapointed, the staff are very friendly and attentive. The room was gorgous, large and very clean. Breakfast is well worth having as there is a selection of hot and cold dishes to choose from. The sheets and pillow cases are made from linen which creases very easily, but each night when we returned to the hotel it looked like the bed linen was changed daily. A good night verse and a chocolate each added the finshing touch. We were talking to another couple at the airport who had had a dreadful time at their hotel, with stained bed covers and paper thin walls which made it very noisey so we were very pleased we'd paid the extra and had comfort. I e-mailed the hotel before and asked for a smoking room on a high floor and they e-mailed back within 48hrs to confirm my request. A note for the ladies the toiletries don't contain a body lotion so remember to take your own.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was everything I hoped it would be. It was quiet, luxurious and well run by friendly staff. The room was spacious, had a very comfotable bed, had all the usual toiletries plus lots of extras such as slippers, bathrobes, shoehorn and even a small stool in the bathroom. The buffet breakfast cost 25 euros . It was not extensive but was of good quality and I felt it was fair value for money. There is an a la carte breakfast menu in English if you just want coffee and rolls. It was not always out so just ask.The bar, which was very comfortable and had an English country house feel about it (how strange in Italy) served an excellent array of free hors-d'oeuvres with drinks and was similar in price to many of the surrounding bars . A tip for getting around is to use the buses as well as metro. The 116 circular minibus terminus is on the street next to the Sofitel. It will take you all over, it winds through the city centre small streets with ease and runs about every 5-10 mins. Get a bus map from atac.roma.it website before you go as the hotel did not have any information. After this first excellent experience with Sofitel I will always see if they have a hotel where ever I go in the future.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Small, Quiet Elegance”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located adjacent to Villa Borghese, although a wall separating the two requires you to walk several blocks to get into it. Same thing with the Spanish Steps, which is about an 8-10 minute walk due to inability to walk directly there. The hotel is located almost exactly equa-distance between the Spagna and Barberini Metro stations, at about 8 minutes walking. Also located very near to the upscale Via Veneto. The hotel itself has a small feel to it, although the exterior facade promises more. The entry and front desk are understated to the point of being underwhelming. Only when you walk up the stairs to the right of the entrance do you start to experience the old world elegance. Our room, which I believe was a standard king, was small, but nice. Free breakfast included, which was a substantial buffet-type spread in an attractive room. Overall, the Sofitel Roma doesn't blow you away with its opulence, but is upper scale, clean, and quiet; off the beaten path. As such it is a little farther from the Metro and from the heart of the Centro Storico than we would have liked. We stayed at the St. Regis the last night of our vacation and were more impressed with it, although we also paid a fair amount more as well.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family (group of 13) stayed for four nights at the end of September at the Sofitel and overall we were very pleased with our stay. We booked here based on the high tripadvisor rating and we certainly weren’t disappointed. We stayed in a variety of rooms –a single room, several double rooms, a triple, and a suite on the top floor. So, we got to see a great deal of the hotel. Rooms were very clean, nicely decorated with great bathrooms. The double rooms were an adequate size – not huge but certainly acceptable. We all had a few difficulties flooding our bathrooms, due to the shower heads. My Mom and Dad’s suite had a beautiful terrace with a great view. Our room faced onto Via Lombardia and it was nice and quiet. Pros: - great doormen, front desk and bar staff - loved the lobby bar, drinks pricey but good - good variety of breakfast choices - good location 5 minutes from Spanish Steps and couple of blocks from Via Veneto, able to walk to all sites. Cons: - no concierge - restaurant was in the basement (not keen on that), staff there were not the friendliest. - trip back to the hotel at the end of the day is all uphill - sheets felt like you were sleeping between tablecloths. We would return to the Sofitel.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Positives: Good, safe location. Room looked great, bathroom spacious with nice touches (robes, marble, nice toiletries). Bed very comfy. Some of the service was good. For example when my wife accident broke a glass in the bathroom, there was someone up there to clean it up within 5 mins. Negatives (i.e. stopping me from giving it 5 out of 5). There was no way of changing the temperature in the room i.e. the airconditioning didn't work. I was first advised to turn it off as it only pumps warm are at this time of year. That didn't really work, so we just has to keep a window open. They had also sold the room as having "perfect soundproofing". This was not wholly correct as our room was connected to the next room with an interconnecting door. The sound of the loud TV and the the loud family next door was quite intrusive. We knew about breakfast being 25E per person, but that doesn't stop it from being extortionate. We had breakfast in a nearby cafe. And finally I remembered when we home that our deal included a "box of chocolates in the room". We never got these. While this is no big deal in itself, I think it is one of a few little lapses in attention to detail which means this hotel cannot be rated as any higher than 4/5.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at this hotel straight from the airport around 9am (overnight flight in from NYC). Of course we did not expect a room to be available to check into so early, so we left to explore the streets. When we came back around noon, a room was in fact ready for us, which was really nice given how exhausted we were from the flight. The customer service continued to impress us; we received a lot of sight-seeing recommendations and restaurant recommmendations from the front desk. The lobby is stunning, and our room was beautiful, exactly what you see in the pictures on the website. Very classy hotel. Unfortunately breakfast was not included in our basic room rate, as it was in the other hotels we stayed at during our Italy trip. The wifi in the room was not free, but there is free internet access in the business center. In terms of location, the Sofitel is in a fancier neighborhood, a lot of restaurants within a few blocks, and about a 10-15 minute walk to see the sights (Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, piazzas, etc), with a small hill on the way back. There were a lot of hotels that were closer/on top of the famous sites and squares; if you prefer not to walk then skip the Sofitel, but if you want some luxury and don't mind the walk, this is a great choice for hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 4 nights booked through Greenbee we had a good deal getting 4 nights for the price of three. Because of the high cost of breakfast and drinks we only used the hotel as a sleeping space (breakfast 25 euros, coffee in the bar 5 euros) We had booked a superior room but it was not very large but adequate for 4 nights. The bathroom was a fair size with all you need including 2 shower options. The huge bed was very comfortable and the linen was very good, the towels were thick and fluffy not all hotels of this standard give you the linen you expect. The desk staff were helpful recommending a local restaurant for our first night and booking top rated (tripadvisor rating of course) restaurants on other nights for us. They were also helpful booking Galleria Borghese. The hotel offers complimentary internet access in a quiet back room. The hotel is reasonably quiet for Rome and the double glazing cuts out all the traffic noise. The air con worked very well. There is a small cafe on the way to the Spanish steps which offers a Roman breakfast i.e. pastry & coffee/tea for 7 euros for 2. Be careful if you are going to the Vatican museum the cafe opposite the entrence grossly overcharges if you have to use it ask the price as they will treble the cost if they think they can.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I recently stayed at the Sofitel in Rome for just one night. We were currently staying in an apartment in Rome but were unaware of of a loud rock concert to be happening for the entire day and night right by our apartment. In addition to this I had come down with a mild case of food poisoning from earlier on our vacation and needed to rest. We decided to get out of this area and searched for the perfect place to rest and relax and pamper ourselves. After much searching and comparing on the web we decided on the Sofitel. For Rome, it's location is super much better than many of the other luxury hotels in the same area. It is on a relatively quiet street with views of the Borghese Gardens. When we arrived we were treated impeccably and had amazing service from Mossimo at the front desk and everyone else we came into contact with. We also had a very special evening in there lovely restaurant. While it was practically empty, we found the service to to be so endearing and thoughtful, Ramona and Francesco did a wonderful job. The food was wonderful and they treated us and the presentation as if it were the most important thing in the world. We had a great time and will definitely stay with Sofitel again in Rome or other cities we travel too. Thank you Sofitel for a wonderful one night retreat.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I took our traditional February trip to Europe and we chose the Sofitel Roma because of prior great experiences at Sofitel’s throughout Europe (Amsterdam especially). The desk staff was responsive but a little cool when we first checked in. They did warm up eventually and we received some wonderful recommendations from one of the female desk staff (forgot her name, but my wife says she looks like a young Demi Moore.) The room was large enough with a nice view and small balcony (6th floor). However, I understand that the 7th floor has the best views and there is a terrace up there, we never got a chance to look at it. Shower was somewhat awkward as it had a large rain type shower head that never heated up to much and a hand held shower head that was intended to supplement the rain type head. Location was good, but not quite central. It was an easy and quick walk to the Spanish Steps, the Borghese Gallery, and to the shopping districts, but it was a long haul to the rest of the tourist attractions. You can walk to the Forum, the Colosseum, and the Vatican, but it will take a long time to get there. The hotel is very willing to call a taxi and they take your information down when the taxi comes in case you lose something in the taxi. Overall, it was a very nice experience and I would recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our first trip to Italy, and actually, our first trip to Europe, and we picked the Hotel Sofitel based upon the reviews here on TripAdvisor.com - we were not disappointed. In fact, it was so beautiful, and so wonderful, we didn't want to leave, and would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to everyone. We arrived at the hotel late at night, around midnight Italian time, and they escorted us to our room, and it was beautiful, with high ceilings, and a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was gorgeous, and I enveloped myself with bubbles in the tub every day. The buffet was perfect, with lots of different cheeses, and fresh fruit, and was included in our hotel room price, and therefore saved us some money. Even room service, which we ordered on our first day in Italy upon waking up was impeccable and delicious. They provided us with maps of the city, and highlighted where we were in location to everything else. The hotel is located in a truly wonderful, residential part of the city, just a few blocks from the top of the Spanish Steps. We walked everywhere and Rome was just an incredibly warm, inviting and vibrant city. We will definitely be going back, and will absolutely, positively stay at the Sofitel. Their service was wonderful, and their entire staff was always warm and friendly. Grazie Hotel Sofitel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sofitel Rome Villa Borghese meets all the demands and needs of either a business or a leisure traveller, when visiting Rome. The first impression you get when arriving at the lobby is very pleasant. The front desk staff, acted very professionally and classy, and the lobby itself was beautifully decorated. When i got up to my room, i noticed that it did not have the view i was expecting. When i shared this with the reception, they immediately provided me with 3 different rooms to choose from, as i did. I have to say that they acted instantly. The room was elegant, very clean, and the bed as comfortable as it gets. The breakfast was what you would expect from a five star hotel. Covers every possible taste, in a luxurious environment. The Terrasse Restaurant up in the seventh floor is rumored to have the best view in Rome. Well, guess what: it does. I also want to stress out the politeness and helpfulness of the waiter (Mirko) who satisfied my every request and with whom i had a very nice chat. Great food, excellent atmosphere... The check out was not as speedy as though it would be, because of a messed up computer system, that overcharged me. Fortunately it was quickly resolved, i payed the proper amount, and was on my way. This incident in no way overshadows this magnificent hotel and the great human resources that it possesses. I will be visiting again, and i strongly recommend it to anyone who can afford a little luxury.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for a week for my partner's big birthday. The location is great, Rome is much smaller and easier to walk than I remembered. We could check in early and check out late. The room was fantastic - we were on the 6th floor, so we had a private terrace with a table and 2 chairs and a sofa. The best part of the hotel is the rooftop terrace on the 7th floor - dinner there was amazing but not cheap; but you can go there for drinks. We went there nearly every evening for cocktails as the sun went down over Rome. On Wednesday there was a DJ playing up there - really good. We wanted to go out for a plush dinner on the birthday evening, so we went to the other 5 stars - de Russie, Intercontinental, Hassler - to have a look at their rooftop/outdoor restaurants -which were not great. At least the Sofitel's is so that you can sit outside, not sit inside looking out. The other hotels were quite brash - lots of cabinets in the corridors selling glittering objects. The only slight downer is that no one wished my partner happy birthday! I ordered a birthday cake for dessert in the restaurant; a friend sent a bottle of prosecco to our room., but the hotel ignored it. I was in Hong Kong for my sister's 40th and the hotel gave her a bottle and cake. I just assumed that the Sofitel would be as attentive, especially as we are in their loyalty scheme. And there was a complicated way of getting wifi. But putting that aside, this is the only 5* hotel in Rome which we saw and liked.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the hotel September 19-24th. We spent a lot of time prior to booking our room researching locations. We decided that the Sofitel was the best choice. We booked six months in advance, directly on the Sofitel website. We booked an internet special where we paid in full right away. It actually worked out for us, since the US dollar has declined. The hotel is small, as most European hotels are. The staff at the front desk were pleasant. When we made our reservation, I indicated we were celebrating our 10th Anniversary. We must have got upgraded to a larger room (looking at the other member postings of pictures). We were on the first floor in the corner. We had a very large room with a King size bed situated almost in a separate room, with a TV. Headboard had buttons to turn on and off lights in the room, with separate reading lamp. There was a very large living room with couch, table, sitting chairs, and a desk and another TV. The decor was very similar to that of a Ritz Carlton I've stayed at. Bathroom was nice, I had read several reviews about no shower curtains, not able to close the door etc., We had no problems. We couldn't be happier with our room. Breakfast was very good. It's a typical Eruopean breakfast with deli, bread, pasteries etc., Rooftop patio was amazing. I read about it on this site, and we checked it out right away. Amazing views, and a great way to end the day with a nice glass of wine! Bar is very nice, excellent service. Approx., 5 mins from the Spanish steps. We were very happy with our room and stay and the Sofitel Rome. I agree with the comment about the lack of Concerige services, but that is the only negative comment I have.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights for a birthday break, and the quality of the hotel made the trip for us. I've stayed in other places in Rome, and the quality is usually less than you get in the UK or US, but not at the Sofitel. The desk staff were friendly, helpful and unobtrusive. The door staff got to know you very quickly and helped make the place feel very safe and secure. The rooms are immaculate, with luxurious touches everywhere. The bed is one of the most comfortable I've ever had in a hotel - as the guy on reception said "it's like a nest". Great, clean bathroom with regular towel and toiletry top-up. In short, everything you'd expect (but don't always get) from a 4-star hotel. You're within a short walk of the Spanish Steps & its metro station (5-10 mins), though on the way back this is uphill, which might be a problem for some. 5 minutes in the other direction and you're on the Via Veneto. For me, an upmarket location in a quiet but accessible part of the city really makes a city break great. The rooms are big by Rome standards, but not enormous. The breakfast is fine - nothing great, but a convenient start to the day, with pastries, coffee, juice, a good selection of cold meat and cheese and a small hot item selection too. We didn't eat in the restaurant as there are plenty of choices nearby. Other guests didn't seem to use it, but the Sofitel takes advantage of it's hilltop location with a stunning roof terrace. Order a drink from the bar, head up in the lift enjoy a gorgeous pre-dinner half hour up there with views over St Peters and most of Rome! Chances are, you'll have it all to yourself too. This is the only hotel we'll stay at in Rome again, and is excellent value for money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After having read all the comments about sofitel rome I booked through the website of sofitel a double room. The truth is that I found myself in a small but luxurious room that didn’t go beyond my expectations.. For 214 euro per night (I stayed three nights) they would definitely give me a much bigger room and surely with a nicer view [they gave me a third floor room that had balcony through which you could visit the other rooms in the same floor (???)-unacceptable..]. I keep asking myself why I haven’t lied to the staff of the hotel, saying for example sth about birthday, as I have understood upgrades you without any other question… I went for the third time in Rome and the truth is that all I wanted this time was to go shopping and get the best out of the stores that had sales 70-80% (!!!). Although I bought lots of things I didn’t have much space to place the bags in the room… The breakfast was o.k., but coming from greece where we have maybe one of the best cuisines in the world, I wouldn’t say that the breakfast was 5 star.. An omelete, eggs, ham, bacon, croissants, and cheese… I wouldn’t say luxurious.. About the places to be for dinner, I was suggested 3 different from the staff in the hotel.. Avoid the restaurant ‘Le grotte’ that they proposed, near piazza di spagna.. Having tasted dishes in more than 2000 restaurants in all over the world (because of my profession) I wouldn’t suggent it if you would like to eat sth special.. Maybe, prefer ‘piccolo mondo’ which is nearer to the hotel… And try to book for ‘piperno’ that they proposed, but couldn’t book.. As they said. Rome is one of the loveliest places I have never been in my life so far, and I would be glad to give information to anyone who would like an extra hand..</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just returned from a wonderful stay at the Sofitel. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The room was gorgeous…really large, immaculately presented and a wonderfully comfortable king size bed. The bathrooms were enormous by European standards and offered a good selection of beauty and grooming products if you wished to use them. The buffet breakfasts were also a definite must if you stay here – they had such a huge selection of beautiful fresh food so there’s really something for everyone’s taste. And the best part was, unlike many hotels who only offer processed, highly fatty, sugary foods and cooked breakfasts, there was a really good selection of healthy breads, cereals and fruits. The staff were also incredibly friendly and helpful, always only too happy to help, offer local advice etc. The location is ideal – about a 5 minute walk from The Spanish Steps and 10 from the Trevi Fountain. All the other major sites aren’t too far either – my husband and I opted to walk everywhere rather than get public transport and found everything very accessible. The colleum was only a half hour’s walk and the Vatican maybe 45 minutes. It might be a bit far for some, but if you’re young and fit you won’t have a problem walking around Rome and seeing all there is to offer. The hotel is also in what we felt was the nicest, cleanest part of Rome – it was definitely geared towards the up market tourist sector and there was a load of lovely restaurants nearby –and there’s something for everyone, there are the more prestigious, expensive restaurants and also a large selection of very affordable places to eat with great food. And if all that’s not enough the rooftop terrace is lovely….the perfect way to look over the rooftops of Rome at the end of the day.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel. Husband surprised me with a trip to Rome and this hotel made the trip even better than I could of imagined. Hotel location is perfect, in a quite little street which is perfect after a hectic day of sightseeing around Rome with the crowds! About a 5 minute walk to the Spanish steps and a 15-20 min walk to the Pantheon and Piazza Novona. Rome is a very easy city to walk around so we didnt use a taxi once during our stay, loved going back to this hotel after a day out. Roof terrace has amazing views over Rome - very expensive for a drink though - we paid 15 euros for two small diet cokes - but the whole terrace atmosphere and view is very beautiful. We had a deluxe room which was massive for a city hotel, huge bed which was very comfortable plus a little seating area and table and then a massive bathroom. the room was spotlessly clean, although was a little surprsied as there was some marks on the carpets/ the bathroom looked a little worn in places and for the class of hotel I didnt expect this.Also no tea/coffee making facilities in the room so every morning we had to order Room service for a tea and coffee. However do not let these minor points put you off. This is a very classy hotel overall, very classic Roman feel with a modern twist on decor which we really liked. Hermes toiletires in the bathroom and turn down service every evening offering fresh towels etc. We have stayed in some stunning hotels around the world and this hotel definately is up there with them. We didnt eat in the hotel, the restuarant was in the basement and did seem a bit dark and soul-less down there - but there are sooo many places to eat in Rome you will not starve! Overall if I went back to rome I would not hesitate to stay at this gorgeous hotel again.</p></li>

<li>Roof terrace has amazing <span style="background-color:#808080" title="p=0.999">views</span> over Rome - very expensive for a drink though - we paid 15 euros for two small diet cokes - but the whole terrace atmosphere and view is very beautiful.</br></br></li>

<li>We didnt eat in the hotel, the restuarant was in the basement and did seem a bit dark and soul-less down there - but there are sooo many <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.998">places</span> to eat in Rome you will not starve!</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were expecting more from our stay at Rome's Sofitel. We stayed for 4 nights while on a family vacation. We had to book 2 rooms and got rooms next door to each other. My children were in one room and we were in another. One of the rooms had a loud air conditioner noise that they could not fix right away so they gave us another room down the hall so my husband and one child had to sleep there which left me alone in my room...not ideal. The prices in the hotel restaurant/bar were ridiculous. We got back to the hotel late one night and the local bars were closed and we wanted gelato so we went to the hotel rooftop restaurant and even though it was not closed yet they obviously wanted us to take it back to our rooms to eat it which we did....it was over 60 euros for 5 small scoops of gelato. It was so overpriced. The concierge booked us a private tour of both the Roman Coluseum and the Vatican, one each day. On the second day, we had booked a 3 hour tour and after about 1.5 hours the tourguide told us that he had to leave after just 2 hours. We were not told by the Sofitel that the guide could only do 2 hours. Frustrating. The worst part of the stay was that they were doing painting in the area right outside our rooms. They got there early in the morning and the smell of paint was all in our room. Since we had our kids next door we were walking back and forth between the rooms and had to walk around scaffolding and paint buckets....totally unacceptable if you ask me. They should have painted areas that had vacancies or purposely not booked rooms near where they had to paint. We just felt that the hotel was not up to par at all. They did end up taking one night's stay off our bill b/c we had to leave our room that one night b/c the room was noisy. I would not recommend this place at all.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I read both the undiluted praise and the write-off moans on this site about the Sofitel Roma, and fall inbetween - but definitely on the more positive side. I was on my honeymoon and, having written to the hotel in advance, they offered various services. One of these to book us two tickets to the opera at slightly lower than the usual rate for Stalls seats - which we used, and it was great. I asked for flowers which they forgot, but was not annoyed as we were earlier arriving than we should've been - and they gave us a free bottle of Prosecco instead. The staff, such as a very nice concierge called Ludovic (I think) were all great and very keen to be of service. The bed was massive and so absurdly soft it was a bit like sleeping on a cloud, though I think our room was upgraded a bit due to the honeymoon email. They also have a catalogue trying to sell these special beds to you! On the negative side, the food etc. was very expensive - and some/all of the rooftop terrace was booked a couple of times for functions, which unfortunately coincided with when we wanted to use it. However, Rome can be quite expensive (sometimes 5 or 6 Euros for a Diet Coke!) and you can book terrace tables when they're not being used for functions, we just didn't bother. I did not understand the complaints in this site about the air conditioning, as we thought it provided a very chilled and welcome relief from the baking 30-40 degree celcius Rome heat - perhaps it made a slight churny sound, but barely noticeable to us. Overall I would recommend this hotel, especially if you can afford to splash the cash - but even if on a budget as we were, the pleasant staff, great location and luxurious comfort make it a great option. We will probably stay in a more basic place next time, but for a honeymoon I don't think we could've chosen much better.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was the latest in a series of city breaks the wife and myself were taking around Europe. The Sofitel Roma is on a hill above and behind the Spanish Steps. The Hotel is located in a quiet residential area well within walking distance of main city streets and squares but there is a steep climb back at the end of the day. The Villa Borghese is nearby and well worth an early evening stroll. There are restaurants in the vicinity but we preferred to dine in the various squares in the city. The reception area is large and welcoming with adjacent spacious lounges furnished in elegant style. Our room was a delight decorated in warm colours with plenty of storage space, a good bed and overlooking a quiet street. A very high standard of cleanliness was maintained with little noise intruding from within the building. We dined out at night but used the basement restaurant for breakfast and this was the only disappointment. The room is not very exciting and whilst the buffet is varied it lacked imagination. I also have a thing about people leaning over uncovered food to serve themselves. There did not appear to be a "cook to order" service so eggs, bacon and sausages were left in covered tureens. This food was always cold and unappetising. Table service was average and in all our time we only saw one waitress smile. In contrast reception, door and portering staff were all friendly helpful and efficient. Reception organised a personal guide for our Vatican tour and this was well worth the expense. Make sure that you view the city from the hotel roof terrace and of course visit the Vatican museums and St. Peters Basilica, the sculptures and art work are incredible. Our trip was just out of season but the Closseum and Trevi Fountain areas were always crowded and we felt less impressive. We loved Rome and and this is a good hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I found a great deal on the Sofitels website giving us 3 nights for the price of 2, buffet breakfast and a late checkout...What a deal. I immediately made a booking looking forward to finishing our Italy holiday in style! And we were not disappointed. We were presented with a gorgeous room on level 6 with an amazing view over the Villa Borghese gardens....a great way to start the day looking over the green of the gardens to the sites of Rome beyond! The room was beautifully decorated and the bed really sensational...the best I have ever slept on and I had the best sleeps of all my time in Italy. The bathroom was great with a lovely tub and fabuluous rainhead shower where you dial up the temperature you require. Hermes products were replenished each day by the cleaning staff who were super efficient. The room was cleaned each day whilst we were at breakfast - lovely to come back to a tidy room! The breakfasts in the basement were really a highlight and a fantstic way to energise for the day. Everyting you could want really, coffee made to order, juices, cereals, pastries galore, smoked salmon, cold meats, wonderful breads and eggs cooked to order. The concierge staff were very helpful, particularly the man at the front door who had wonderful suggestions for our sightseeing. The location of the hotel is great (only 5 minutes downhill to the Spanish Steps) although a bit of an uphill walk from the centre at the end of a long day. If you have time spend a few hours in the adjacent Villa Borghese Gardens and walk to the lookout over Roma - fantastic. The sights of Rome are too many to mention. Our highlight was the Collessum and Palatine Hill - an amazing experience on a warm November day. We also bought the tourist bus pass (red bus 15 euro 24 hr or 20 euro 48 hr) which was a great way to explore the city and also do the loop at night to see all the sights illuminated. Enjoy your stay at the beautiful Sofitel...you will not be disappointed!!!!</p></li>

<li>The <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.999">location</span> of the hotel is great (only 5 minutes downhill to the Spanish Steps) although a bit of an uphill walk from the centre at the end of a long day.</br></br></li>

<li>We also bought the <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.996">tourist bus</span> pass (red bus 15 euro 24 hr or 20 euro 48 hr) which was a great way to explore the city and also do the loop at night to see all the sights illuminated.</br></br></li>
