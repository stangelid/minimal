<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Park Hyatt in Chicago is a beautiful hotel in the BEST location in the city. Overlooking the historical water tower right in the heart of the Miracle Mile - right next to the best bars and restaurants. The service is great and the staff very friendly. Our view was of the water tower with the lake in the background on both of our stays. Room Service is very good too - and while it is expensive - it's not as crazy as some other 5 star hotels I've stayed at.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was not my first choice of hotels in Chicago. For one it was a bit out of my price range for my lodging budget. The staff didn't seem to be that out going. When i went to my room I was really expecting more. I did however sleep well, their beds are very comfortable. In the morning I went to take a shower and the towels in my room looked used. They were dingy and thin. If i find myself traveling to Chicago again and this is my last choice I will stay there again, but I would prefer to stay elsewhere for that kind of money.</p></li>

After the show we were going to get room service for the kids but the only options on the kids menu was a hot dog and chicken fingers. We opted for another restaurant for the kids. Other negatives wer the siren noise during the night, the $45 valet and wallpaper coming off the wall.

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Park Hyatt for two nights on business. Although a little more expensive than the other nearby chains, it was well worth it (and they offer a AAA discount). The room was good sized (I had the least expensive room), very clean, and very smartly laid out. Separate tub and shower, quiet, and comfortable.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Park Hyatt for a meeting in Chicago. I was sick (sinus infection) and I lost my wallet with my ID, credit cards, ATM cards and cash. I was miserable. The Park Hyatt employees helped me get cash (so I didn't feel helpless) and I went home early. The day I flew home my wallet was recovered but the person didn't want to take the time to mail it. I told them to drop it off at the park hyatt. When the park hyatt received it they called me and mailed it to me express! Thank you! :-) My room was awesome! I looked down on the water tower. I would definitely stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's a nice hotel, but whether or not its worth it really depends on the price you pay. For upwards of $400, not really worth it (you should stay at the Eylsian instead). A nice and quick check in process. But slowed down by the fact that there are only two elevators for the hotel. Concierge service was sporadic. The woman who pressed my suit was prompt and fast, but I had to call three times to get someone to shine my shoes. I did not have a nice view, although I imagine half of the hotel does have them. So just depends on what you get at the time. Overall it is luxurious, but not amazing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Park Hyatt Chicago in January 2010 with friends for a long weekend. Hotel was in a perfect location to catch city tour, shop on Michigan Avenue and accessible to a variety of restaurants. At the time we were there the restaurant was being renovated so we ate breakfast in the lounge off the lobby. Not ideal but it worked. The complimentary car service was a nice perk for dinner reservations further out. Rooms were clean and comfortable. We were impressed with the size of the bathroom and design. Would certainly consider staying at the Park Hyatt Chicago again and would recommend to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A great hotel- rooms are modern, with a nice large bathroom with separate shower and tub- good location -close to stores, restaurants. Most important was the friendly service. Everyone said hello, asked if we needed anything, and did their best to make the stay so nice. There are a number of deluxe hotels right around the park hyatt but this is the most modern of them (if that's your taste), and the service couldn't be better anywhere else. Just make sure if you reserve through the 800 hyatt number you ask for the park hyatt as there are a few hyatt hotels in chicago and i almost reserved the wrong one.</p></li>

Great location. But, the room is just average, with a weird door opening from the tub into the bedroom. No coffee maker in the room and none in the lobby. 1 desk chair and one easy chair -- difficult for in-room dining. The worst feature was the lighting. Difficult to find switches and very dim lighting even in the bathroom. Great view of the Water Tower, but extrememly dirty window and plastic plants that scrape the glass in the wind. My husband loved the bed and pillows.</p></li>

The rooms are modern, comfortable with great views of the lake and downtown. Also they are large enough to accomodate three women with tons of luggage and shopping treasures! The bathroom is spacious resulting in the three of us dressing for a night out at the same time. My only slight complaint would relate to the heating of the room-we could not adjust the temperature down for the night resulting in some discomfort. The restaurant is a great place for a cocktail and appetizer in the evening.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed in Hyatts across the US and Europe. I have generally found the Park Hyatt's to be the best of the chain. This Hotel lives up to that expectation. Centrally located near the water Tower off Michigan Ave it comes with a very high standard of service. The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable, although I would guess they are coming towards the end of their life cycle. However they are far from shabby and have many nice touches like candles in the bathroom and abundance of toiletries, dvd player etc. Downside is that it is expensive but what you expect considering its location and standard of service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Be aware, the Park Hyatt Chicago is located very near a hospital and a fire station. If your room is on the Water Tower side of the hotel, you may be hearing sirens virtually any time day or night. They were frequent, loud, and annoying during our stay. The hotel staff did offer to switch our room when we realized the situation. Unfortunately, we had already unpacked and completely settled into our room. In hindsight, we should have changed. The noise is significant and especially a negative in the evening. If this would be a concern for you, recommend asking about your room location and its possible siren factor when booking or checking in.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is quite amazing. Great location; it's right next to the water tower with lots of shopping to be done within the vicinity. Many eateries and attractions are nearby making it very convenient for first time visitors. The rooms are beautiful and well-appointed with quality furniture and decor. Granite accents embellish the room with a modern touch. Bathroom is ginormous with deep soaking tub and shower. Even the toilet has a separate room! Staff at this hotel are very pleasant and friendly. Karen, the chef concierge, was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. She definitely made our stay very enjoyable. So stay here! It's a gorgeous property with great customer service!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I usually stay at the Sofitel Water Tower, but at the suggestion of a Chicagoan friend, stayed here. It was fabulous! Definitely will return. Same for my cousin, who lives large & usually stays at the Peninsula. We were both completely bowled over by the level of service. Spotlessly clean, beds & bedding that were divine, phenomenal view & location, quiet, a comfy reading chair, free wireless, a great bath tub for soaking, choice of morning newspaper, superb staff & quick room service. The hotel restaurant, Nomi, is sophisticated & pricey but outstanding. Honest, I don't usually use so many superlatives & I am not a plant. I simply could find no fault here.

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The rooms in this hotel are very large and luxurious. The entryway allows one to enter without people in the hallway seeing much of the room, so there is more privacy than most hotel rooms. The closet opens from two sides - one from the bedroom and one from the bathroom. The shower and tub are located behind a glass door in the bathroom, there is a double vanity sink, and the toilet is in its own separate room. Toothpaste and a toothbrush, as well as the typical amenities, are provided for free. My only negative comment about the room is that the two beds were small. There is a lap pool with several lanes and boards and fins. This is a great hotel for those looking for luxury and are willing to pay for it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Beautiful hotel in epicenter of Mag Mile across from Water Tower. Very large and comfortable room with contemporary design that's easy on the eye and the body. HUGE tub...big enough for two. Good room service (dinner) and also excellent breakfast in NoMi Restaurant (try the French toast). Reception efficient and kind. Only niggle was housekeeping. Everything was spotless, but we left room at 9:15 a.m. and came back at 3:30 and it wasn't made up yet. Compared to other 5 star hotels, thought this was well priced. Suggestion: Go to RL GRILL, the restaurant tin the Ralph Lauren store across the street. It's terrific! The perch was the best I've ever had! Great "clubby" atmosphere. Reserve ahead and dress nicely.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Park Hyatt Chicago and would certainly return again (in fact, we are in late January). Although the room was not huge, the furnishings were top notch (the bed was amazing) and the bathroom was large and luxurious, with a jumbo bathtub (separated from the bedroom by a sliding door), separate shower and spacious, double vanity with granite countertops. One nice touch was a bowl of apples placed in the room upon arrival (all were eaten) and free bottles of water during turndown. Great for a romantic getaway (our purpose), but we're certain a business person would be equally satisfied. The lobby and public spaces provided an oasis from the busy Michigan Avenue just outside the door. Great location!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Park Hyatt Chicago for 2 nights in September and had a very pleasant stay. The hotel is right in the heart of Chicago and has great views over the Water Tower and Lake Michigan. The room (Deluxe King) was high quality with one of the most comfortable beds I've ever experienced. The bathroom was also luxurious, with its own mini-TV and separate shower. There's also a screen between the bathroom and bedroom allowing you to bathe looking out over Chicago if you desire. The hotel service was very attentive (if a little formal) and the facilities were top-notch. The restaurant and bar were also high quality. There's a fairly high price tag on rooms in this hotel, but you do get what you pay for. It was a real treat to stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Enter the hotel and you quickly realise, my stay will be a good one. Reception, fast and efficient meaning we were in our room very quickly and after travelling for 12 hours this was welcome. The room, a Park View double, was large, comfortable and well appointed with a very comfortable bed. A large bathroom with one of the biggest baths I have ever seen and a separate double headed shower. I used NoM1 the restaurant/bar numerous times during my stay and found it an excellent place for drinks, snacks and dinner. Throughout my stay the hotel staff were friendly, efficient and always charming in their attention to guests. The hotel itself occupies a prime spot on North Michigan Avenue just beside the Water Tower so ideal for all Chicago has to offer.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is truly amazing. First off, the location is probably the best in the city. Just blocks from the lake and within close proximity to the best shopping, restaurants, and recreation. The staff is wonderful (the only complaint was the concierge seemed a little snooty) and attentive. The rooms are amazin. Wonderful tubs and great (although a little small) showers. The best part of our room was the window weat. A deep seat in front of the large window where both my wife and I could sit for hours and read or watch the city go by. The work out facility is easily the best in the city (at a hotel). There is a LCD tv at every machine, cold towels to relax, a wonderful lap pool and spa amenities everywhere (robes, slippers, etc). We wish we could have stayed longer!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband & I went back to Chicago to visit the family for Christmas 2011. After one week, we decided to head into Chicago and spend our last 4 nights downtown. The hotel was very welcoming when we checked in and boy, did we have a lot of baggages to load up since we'd been shopping all day. The hotel room was very comfortable and warm, the bed as well was a god send since we had been sleeping pretty rough since we arrived. The staff were helping with their recommendations and everything was within walking distance or a short cab ride to where we wanted to go. I liked the location of the hotel right on the river and slightly off the city centre so it was more peaceful. Will definitely come back next time we stay downtown and will recommend to family members as well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My third stay at this property and definitely not my last. Computer glitch in booking process was honored (via phone confirmation) prior to my arrival. Upon arrival, they did not have any availability for the type of room stated on my pre-printed confirmation so they upgraded me...to their absolutely amazing and gorgeous Lake Suite, in all of it's 1400 square feet glory. When I walked into the room, I was speechless. The upgrade aside, the staff and service are always unmatched here. The views are stunning, especially those facing east, the property and furnishings beautifully understated without feeling too minimalist. Most likely will be the best stay in any hotel, ever for me. Thank you to the staff at the Park Hyatt for an even more memorable time than my last stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is extremely nice and very romantic. I believe I was just in a standard room, but it was incredible. Extremely spacious, electronic shades, luxurious in every way possible. My favorite part of the room was the bathroom which had a huge tub inbetween the room and the bathroom itself. Linens were unbelievably comfortable and I dont think I have ever even noticed linens before in my life so they were definetely something special. I requested a Lake view but was told they didnt have any available. If you can get a lake view take it. The staff was courteous, but I was told that I would recieve a bottle of wine as an amenity which was never delivered. Looking back on it I am not sure if I was supposed to be offered the wine inthe first place, so I didnt downgrade them for this.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Park Hyatt is fantastic for anyone looking to relax and experience what Chicago has to offer for upscale travelers. Itâ€™s right on Michigan, central to shopping as well as dining on Rush Street. The hotel is very chic and modern, with a small lobby and very quiet guest areas. The rooms are fantastic, with unobstructed views of Lake Michigan and extremely comfortable beds. Bathroom has great view as well, with huge tub and great glass shower. NoMI is a must- on the 7th level with a wonderful outdoor patio as well as a formal dining room that leans out over Water Tower Place. Sunday brunch buffet is worth it. Hotel has limited business amenities, as well as Spa services; I would recommend it primarily for leisure travelers who are looking to spend most of their time enjoying Chicago.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First of all, I am a Hyatt Gold Passport Diamond member and PHC offered no recognition or amenities or breakfast and certainly no upgrades. That surprised me when I first checked in the hotel. Later I asked about it and found out that somehow the system messed up and showed me as a Gold member. I know it happened sometimes but it's still unacceptable. No apologies for the mistreatment either. At night when we got back to the hotel after a late dinner, hotel security asked if we were hotel guests and asked for our room key card. I think that's rude but hotel said that was normal. I have never seen that before really. Also there is a renovation going on so service is very limited. Room is nice and location is perfect but service is under par. I would rather stay at Hyatt Regency Chicago and get a better treatment.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was my first time visit to Chicago. I stayed in Chicago overnight before, due to flight cancellation, but never intentionally. My husband and I had just started dating at the time and it was our first weekend/date/vacation. We arrived very early in the morning and the staffed found us a room available for an early check-in. While they were looking for a room, they offered us a mimosa in the lobby. The hotel had the typical Park Hyatt luxurious decor, classical and impeccable but cold. The room was very comfortable and spacious with a splendid view over the city. We had room service one night and the food was excellent. We did breakfast and the restaurant and the food was very good as well. The gym facilities were nice and I found everything I wanted. I would say it was everything one would expect from a Hyatt.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Let me first say that I absolutely love the HYATT properties whether it is Hyatt Place, Grand, Regency or Park Hyatt's. However, having stayed at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo and in Shanghai I felt the Park Hyatt in Chicago was lacking something. Considering what one is paying for the room, I think tea and coffee with some cookies should be standard. EVERY Hyatt or for that matter any Hotel I have been in has complimentary tea and coffee in the room. Overseas visitors especially from Europe are used to having tea and coffee in the room. The staff are incredible. Service excellent. Although, I must point out my omelette came with egg shells...I did not create a fuss because we were someone's guests for breakfast. Parking costs are EXTREMELY high $49.00 per 24hour period. I think there should be a discount for hotel guests.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice Hotel with a Great View”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Park Hyatt is definitely a 1st class hotel. I was in room 1606 and had nice view of the Water Tower and Lake. The room itself was spacious and well appointed. It included free internet which it should. Rate I had was $239 plus parking $45 more. ROOM Great bed, flat screen TV, nice desk and little sitting area next to window. Really nice compared to the Drake where I have stayed in the past. Bathroom is awesome, with a great bathtub and separate shower area. Double sink with nice amenities. LOCATION On Michigan avenue, with easy access to shopping and there is a Walgreens across the street. Many places to eat nearby, and the hotel resturant NoMi is fantastic. GYM Hotel gym is nice with lot's of equipement, steam room, and locker room. Overall, I'd recommend the Park Hyatt. Really nice stay, only wish I could've stayed longer.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I used to live in Chicago for 10 years so staying at a hotel in my town is a little strange. With the exception of the Westin on Michigan, I don't know what the other hotels in Chicago are like and cannot make a fair comparison. With that said, the Park Hyatt itself was very nice, but I was a little disappointed in the rooms b/c growing up in Chicago, I always heard people talk about how fancy the rooms are. My husband and I got a king looking west with pretty decent city views. I'm not sure the room is worth the price, but if you want to be close to the shopping on Michigan and a cab's ride from State Street, this is an fine hotel. Nothing will blow you away, but then again, the hotel gives you nothing to complain about. The best part of the stay for me was the food. Our cheese and wine tray was superb, and the breakfast at NoMi was excellent.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose the PH for it's reputation, location and prior experience with the chain for a family weekend stay. Check in was quick and we were in the rooms fairly quickly. The room sizes were large and we had a beautiful view of the Water Tower. Our complaint was with the service. We have always found the Concierge service at PH (and other top tier hotels) to be one of the key ingredients for a successful vacation. We were disappointed repeatedly in this case. We felt that the knowledge and suggestions of concierges were either poorly informed or just plain bad. This was in reference to restaurants and sightseeing. Also, when calling for any sort of help (wake up call, room service, etc), the phone often rang several times with no answer. We can accept these sorts of things at lower rated or cheaper hotels, but for the money, this was just plain disappointing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 3 nights over 2006/7 NY. Rooms: The rooms are rather small for American standards. Our room didn't have a bath, only a walk-in shower and it was a small bathroom for 2 adults and 2 young children. It was a wonder we all actually fit inside the room - there were 2 queen beds. We had to put our luggage on the floor as there was just no space. When we mentioned about the lack of bathtub for our young children, the hotel said they would follow up, but never did get back to us. Restaurant: We only had breakfast at the hotel. I recommend the Park breakfast only - it was very very good. Room service: No kids menu. Location: You can't beat the location of this hotel. Service: It was alright, nothing to rave about. Generally, this hotel is catered for adults and business travellers. Not kids friendly at all. Great for the single traveller on business.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We brought our two Granddaughters (ages 3 & 5) for a 3-night stay, and it was just a perfect experience all the way around. From the valet parking, bellman, concierge, all staff - an absolutely terrific time! Superb accommodations were top notch. My Granddaughters just LOVED how they never had to open a door every time we left the hotel or came back (I was thankful they said "Thank you!" every time!). Our room had a balcony overlooking Water Tower - views were spectacular! If you bring young children, be sure to bring life vests for swimming - the pool is 3'8" throughout. Thankfully I had called ahead and we brought them. All the staff made a big fuss over the girls - and when housekeeping came (she was FANTASTIC!), she laid out the girls' nightgowns on the beds & put their stuffed animals very neatly propped up on the pillows! Too cute! STAY HERE! YOU WON'T BE SORRY!</p></li>

The concierge was very help to my husband and get an anniversary present shipped to the hotel without my knowledge. The staff was very friendly, upbeat and warm. The rooms were very nice and just our style. Our views from our window were wonderful of the Lake and the Watertower and the John Hancock building. We were on the 13th floor in a Grand Deluxe king room over looking Michigan Avenue. The location couldn't have been better. We had drinks at the Signature Room Lounge in the John Hancock Buidling to watch the sunset (nothing as beautiful as the Florida Sunsets we have here). And the food, service and VIEWS from the NOMI Restaurant were great. I don't know why the restaurant doesn't get better press. It's very romantic and breakfast was gorgious sitting at the windows looking at the lake.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My daughter and I stayed in a Park Suite for four nights. From check In to check out our every need was not only met but was anticipated. We were addressed by name each time we encountered any staff members throughout the hotel. Our room was always kept clean and was extremely comfortable. We used the laundry service for overnight dry cleaning and it was returned the next morning as expected. My daughter used the spa and was very impressed with their services and their products. I used the gym and pool. The equipment was all updated and functional. The locker room was extremely clean and well stocked where robes and slippers were provided. We lunched at NOMI on their outdoor terrace. The food and service were excellent. I would like to compliment the management on their staff and services. I anticipate ( and look forward to ) another visit to he Park Hyatt Chicago in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If we are in Chicago again we will definitely not hesitate to stay at this hotel. It is unbelievably quiet & very clean. Each & every member of the staff we fastidious & polite. We took advantage of the use of the house town car twice which is not only a savings but more comfortable than taking a taxi. We ate at Nomi for breakfast every day as this was included in our stay. The food was as good as the best breakfasts we have ever had in our travels. Had cocktails out on the patio of the restaurant one afternoon which was very relaxing. I can't express how attentive the wait staff & hotel staff were during our entire stay. Everyone working the concierge desk was very helpful. The location is perfect & in walking distance of many attractions. And did I say CLEAN, CLEAN, CLEAN..which is a big pet peeve of mine. I never got to meet the manager but hats off to him for developing & training a fine staff!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a very nice hotel with great service. I stayed here with my family for a weekend getaway. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful. They were very customer service oriented. We had a room with a view of the Water Tower and Lake Michigan. Terrific view. The room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was large and the separate walk-in shower was a nice feature. The gym/workout room was as good as any I've seen in a hotel. It also included free weights which I rarely encounter in hotels. The pool was large and kept at a comfortable temperature. The steam room was also nice. The location of the hotel can't be beat. It is at the far north end of Michigan Ave. close to Water Tower. It is convenient to shopping and lots of great restaurants. Finally, my family loved the hot chocolate in the lobby on a cold January day. A nice touch. I would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Park Hyatt in August for 3nights. It was my second time in Chicago so I knew where the Hotel was located. Its right accross the street from the Watertower mall and the Hancock Tower and only about 5min walk from the lake. The Hotel itself is lovely, and the staff friendly. It has a very serene feel to it, and you hardly see another guest..even waiting for the lift! We didn't eat or drink in the Hotel so can't comment on that. There are so many great restuarants located close by. We had a room on the 16th floor which was a corner room so lots of light from all the windows. The bathroom was huge..as big as some rooms I've stayed in. It had a huge walk in shower and a large bath big enough for 2 with 2 large windows also a small tv on the wall which you could see from the bath! Overall we both really enjoyed our stay here and would definately stay again if it is within budget as it can be quite pricey!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Whenever we come to Chicago we stay at the Park Hyatt and so far we have never been disappointed. Except for this time. My husband took me there for my birthday - the hotel staff was nice and friendly but our first disappointment was the breakfast. For the last 4 years they always had a buffet but now you had to order from the menu - the prices are just ridiculous!! For 2 slices of toast, just 2 slices of regular toast with nothing else they charge $6!!!! Not that we cannot afford it - but this is just insane. When it came to my birthday dinner at the famous Nomi restaurant, they did not acknowledge my birthday. Last time I even received a gift from the hotel but this time - nothing at all. The food was less than average - but I will describe that in a different review. Will we ever go back? For a room rate of over $ 400? I do not know. I am willing to try other hotels. The Park Hyatt to me - this time - seemed to be a big rip off!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had heard nothing but great things about the hotel prior to our one night stay. In fact, upon checking in, the very nice female checking us in informed us that the CPH is their Flagship property. I had requested a suite prior to check-in, but was told there was none available ? This despite the fact that the hotel seemed virtually empty while there, 03/26-03/27. Room was nice, great view. Bathroom amenities were average. You could hear voices from the adjoining room very clearly, # 1517 Bathroom towels were not what you would expect for a 5 star, looked and felt cheap, thin. As a Diamond member I have stayed at much nicer Hyatt properties, Grand Hyatt Berlin and Grand Hyatt Sao Paulo to name a few. Also, they misspelled my name twice, on the welcoming envelope, and in the welcoming letter. Would stay there again probably, but they need to take some lessons from some of their International properties. Not worth $400--$500/night...</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We've been staying at this gem of a hotel for the past 10 years and just keep on coming back for more....The Park Hyatt Chicago is a classic, like a Cartier watch or a Mercedes, understated, yet elegant, timeless, yet powerful, small, yet stunning in all details. Rooms with Water Tower views are a must and we never get tired of sitting by the windows and gazing outâ€¦to the tower, the lake, the bustling intersection below, the signs & lights of the surrounding buildings. It's meditative and addictve all at once. And then...THE BATHTUBSâ€¦.I think we would choose this hotel just for their luxurious bathtubs! Add the phenomenal food from Nomi's with their world class wine & champagne selection (Nomi delivers to your room, even if itâ€™s just one glass of Champagne!), the amazingly comfortable beds & linens that would flatter any emperor, the enticing bath products from Master parfumeur Blaise Mautin....and you got heaven on earth. Canâ€™t wait to return!</p></li>

<li>We've been staying at this gem of a hotel for the past 10 years and just keep on coming back for more....The Park Hyatt Chicago is a classic, like a Cartier watch or a Mercedes, understated, yet elegant, timeless, yet powerful, small, yet stunning in all details.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I cannot find any negative or inadequate thing about this hotel. I am always travelling on business, and never have I stayed at a property that exceeded my expectation at all levels as this place did. From the moment you walk in you get special personalized service from the staff. The lobby is spectacular (check out the art collection as it is pretty amazing), the checkin painless. The rooms are to die for. They are bright, clean, stylish and very functional. The bed and pillows were so amazing I wanted to sleep more than ever. The Eames chair, the huge tub and the fixtures are out of a decor magazine. The bathroom opens up into the room and you can enjoy a bath while watching TV or looking out the window! They give complementary shoe shines and pressing nightly. The staff know exactly how to give a combination of superb service and give you personal space. Nomi, the restaurant is amazing (esp. breakfast!) and has a gorgeous view of Michigan Ave. And the location can't be beat - right in the heart of the most gorgeous area of Chicago...shop 'till you drop!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from 4 nights at the Park Hyatt - Chicago. We had a standard room on the 13th floor with an excellent view of the Watertower and Lake. Pros: The rooms were excellent. Clean, Modern and very well thought out. The extra large soaking tub (and separate shower) were very nice as well as the small TV in the bathroom. Also, the location of the hotel was terrific along with outstanding service, food and a nicely equiped Gym on the 7th floor. Cons: The coffee. Really its my only gripe of a nearly perfect hotel. On five occassions the coffee was served lukewarm, weak and had an odd flavor. It was consistently bad via Room Service and in the otherwise wonderful NoMi restaurant. Otherwise you will NOT go wrong in choosing the Park Hyatt in Chicago - definitely among my favorite hotels. I'll also note that we originally booked at the Four Seasons just across the street - we went there for cocktails and although it's a lovely hotel, it seemed a bit dated and worn along with what seemed to be a very uptght clientele. The Park Hyatt had a more relaxed yet still upscale vibe.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">To start, I'm not sure where the people who write negative reviews are staying normally, but this hotel was typical of the class of service and luxury I've seen and experienced at other Park Hyatt properties (e.g. Tokyo and Buenos Aires). The location is excellent, right off Michigan Ave and is central to many restaurants and museums. Check-in took all of 3 minutes and the service was very respectful and professional. I was upgraded to a corner room and loved the furntiure, layout, bed, and shades. The toilet amenities were excellent and the room was designed to keep you far from the hallway, lending to a very quiet night. Room service was prompt and I can only say that this place is well worth the money. A few criticisms. There is no coffee maker in the room. Also, the staff of the rooftop bar are in dire need of an attitude adjustment. They make bar staff at W hotels seem friendly. Seriously, while the group at the bar is a bit of the "see and be seen" type, the staff doesn't need to join in and act as though they are above the guests. Still, it was a great place to hang out.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I grew up around the Chicago area and traveled to the city often for work or play. I often admired the Park Hyatt from the outside, but never considered staying there. Recently I was traveling home after a cross-country drive, and my girlfriend and I decided to stay here. I'll never stay elsewhere when I go back! The staff was amazing. Karen, the Chef Concierge, went out of her way to make suggestions for things to see, places to eat, and tours to take. She made reservations at a local Italian restaurant for us that was top-notch. They treated us like royalty from the moment we entered at both the hotel and the restaurant. The hotel car was a nice touch in making for a special night. Our room was a corner room on the 18th floor. It was immense with a wonderfully comfortable king bed. It had everything needed for a comfortable stay, from a large bath and seperate shower to a modern television and sound system. The location cannot be beat. Centrally located, it's walking distance to the Magnificent Mile and Grant park. Restaurants all around make for a foodies dream location. I'll definitely be back soon!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a 4 night stay at the Park Hyatt. We had a superb holiday. I always think that the way you are treated at check-in is often indicative of how the hotel service will follow through. Here it was faultless. I mentioned to the gentlemen on reception that the holiday was a treat to me from my husband to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. We were upgraded to a beautiful suite on the 15th floor overlooking the Water Tower and Lake Michigan. We were escorted to our floor and introduced to our butler! Champagne was waiting on our arrival in our room. We travel a lot and stay in good hotels but have never known politeness, consideration and kindness like it. We asked the concierge (Karen) if she could recommend a restaurant. She not only suggested a great one and booked the hotel car to take us; she then secretly called the restaurant to tell them about our celebration so that they looked after us when we got there. I find it difficult to think of anything else that could have been done to increase the level of service. My only worry now, is how are we going to beat this holiday when we next go away?!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After 3 days of a nonstop convention, we needed a break from the sea of people and some luxury. We stayed here May 22, 2011. The location is hard to beat, it is on the corner of Michigan avenue and Chicago. We arrived at around 11;45 am, and our early check in was no problem. The front desk clerk was friendly and professional. I did not sense an attitude even though I look young and was on a Hyatt point stay. We were given a room overlooking the lake and old water tower. The view was so pretty, that I could have spent hours on the built in window seat. The room was very spacious and clean. The bathroom was amazing. It was about the size of 4 or 5 standard hotel bathrooms out together. The tub was large enough for 2 large people comfortably and there were candles and aromatherapy bath salt to help you relax. The glass enclosed shower seemed nice and had multiple show heads but I did not try it. My partner loved the TV and phone in the bathroom. The internet was free and I had no problems with the connection. Room service was delicious and the "park breakfast" was a good value for the money. I will be back and highly recommend treating yourself to this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My 18 year old daughter and I stayed 4 nights Feb. 21-25, 2008 at the Park Hyatt , Chicago. The location was great-we had a view out the bathroom window of the American Girl store and Ralph Lauren store(a great lunch!) A view of the charming Water Tower too. We booked directly thru the hotel because all booking sites said there were no rooms avail. We paid $415 first nite, $373 next 3 nites-AAA rate. I couldn't believe hotel costs in the middle of Feb.!! More than we pd. in NYC last summer! As a comparison, Ritz Carlton was $495 per nite. Don't forget the 15% tax! The Hyatt did have very nice bathrooms; dbl sinks, huge tub with candles provided, separate toilet room, lots of fluffy towels, robes. We were on the 5th floor which was quite noisy. We learned that the firehouse was a block away. Yikes! A siren all the time! Maybe a higher floor? The lobby is chic and dark-a good lobby for celebrities to sneak into. The staff is attentive. Some more negatives; The room did not have black-out curtains in lieu of cooler, more modern shades??? The TV was not a flat screen, but was encased in a mod cabinet??? Location, location, location-that's the justification for the price?</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned for a three night stay at the Park Hyatt. My husband and I went away for a weekend sans kids and loved our stay. This was our first trip to Chicago and I did much research on hotels. I chose this one because of TripAdvisor recommendations and I'm a Hyatt Gold Passport member. Our request for a high floor was honored by the hotel and we had a water view of Lake Michigan. I was disappointed that our room did not have the opening between the bathroom and bedroom that was advertised on the website but it did not spoil our trip. The concierge was extremely helpful and provided some nice dinner suggestions. You must try Cafe Spiaggia. Absolutely the best meal we've ever had. Wonderful! I would recommend this hotel and it is a great location. Convenient to all the shopping. I would also recommend the Chicago Architecture Boat Tour. It was a great 1 1/2 hour boat ride on the Chicago River that really showed the great architecture of the city. The only negative I would have was the carpet was in need of cleaning. For the cost of the rooms I felt the carpet could have been newer or at least clean. It showed wear and tear and many spots. Overall the rest of the room was great.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have become a huge fan of Park Hyatt Hotels since my last few great stays with them. Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental don't have loyalty programs, so when I go on business trips I'm motivated by getting the points. Something about getting a free night stay with two or something got me to check out the Park Hyatts. And I'm glad I did. This hotel has a spectacular, modern lobby. Fantastic spa. We had a great view from our room (see picture). The tub was super deep and they gave really great eucalyptus salts that were awesome after a long day of meetings. The room service menu had a great selection of sushi. Breakfast on the 7th floor was really nice with a great view. Criticism: the wifi at our room (1605) was non-existent. I don't know why. And also - be VERY specific on getting directions to the entrance the building is the huge water tower place and if you go to the GPS marked location you'll for sure be lost. Ask concierge on your way in specifically how to find the entrance, we circled around for about half an hour. Other than that, it's great. You have a semi-great room experience with the master bath opening into the living room. We loved it. Oh - sheets could've been softer.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I strongly recommend this hotel. My recommendation and review is based on a number of visits to this hotel. The location is perfect. It is located within walking distance to the best stores and restaurants, museum etc. If you book a room or a suite facing Michigan Avenue, you will have a magnificent view of the Water Tower and Lake Michigan. The spa and swimming pool is great. The rooms are very nice (what you expect from a Park Hyatt). The service in this hotel is past the level of a 5 Star Hotel. The staff is very courteous and friendly. Given the number of excellent restaurants nearby, choosing a restaurant can be difficult. However, one of the very best restaurants in Chicago is right in the Hotel. NoMI is a fantastic restaurant. The breakfast at NoMI is more than a breakfast. It is an experience also. You will have the panoramic view of the Water Tower and parts of the lake and Michigan Avenue. The setting is wonderful. The food quality is superb with a wonderful service. I have rated this hotel the highest, since I have not seen any flaws after so many visits. If you are a Diamond member of the Hyatt program you will be astonished about the treatment that you will receive. I wish you all a very pleasant stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One of the best Luxury Hotels in the world. Â  Stayed in a Executive suite for my wife's birthday. The service and staff was excellent, from the moment we stepped out of the limo the staff was at our beckoning.Â  It was almost scary how well the staffÂ catered toÂ your every need, my wife was very pleased with theÂ Hotel and its decor.Â  The location was the best, walking distance to the FamousÂ Water Tower,Â John Hancock building, and all of the high end shopping one can handle.Â  We have been to severalÂ Five starÂ hotels in the past around the world fromÂ the Caribbean to Europe and excluding the 90 degree weather we have to put this hotelÂ at the top of our list.Â  We would definitely look at staying at other Park Hyatt hotel locations, I also became a Gold member for future stays.Â  Their was only oneÂ problem, and this would not stop me from giving a great review nor would this stop me from staying at any one of their locations again.Â  The futuristicÂ entertainment system looked great but did not work, the battery on the universal touch screen remote did not workÂ also andÂ would not hold aÂ charge, also my newÂ I phone would not work with the aux jack provided.Â  All said I was little disappointed but overlooked.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Park Hyatt could not be located any better. It is in the perfect spot for sightseeing, nightlife, etc. The pool and restaurants are amazing. The rooftop bar should not be missed, assuming the weather is cooperative. The rooms are beautiful and spacious, with a gorgeous bathroom setup. Unfortunately, not all is well with this hotel. I would guess that this hotel does not receive many 20-something customers. For the caliber of the hotel and the value of the Park Hyatt name, I thought the service was seriously sub par. It might have been because I was younger, but I was continually looked down upon when I was entering the hotel. The 50 year old couples were catered too exclusively, while I was left to open doors for myself. My expectations depend on the price and caliber of the hotel. If this had been the Sheraton Chicago Towers, the service would have been on point. But, Chicago has numerous 5 star options. The Peninsula, Ritz Carlton/Four Seasons, Trump, and even Omni are all comparable properties and consistently show strong customer service skills. I recommend this hotel for those that fit into their target demographic. For those of us that work hard and like to splurge during our youth, there might be better options.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Park Hyatt for a three night getaway in February. No need to repeat all the accolades here - we agree with all of them. We can clarify the confusion about sliding doors - the double rooms have a two-person separate shower, no sliding doors. The king rooms have a sliding door between the bed and the tub, single person shower. A couple of minor quibbles - we also found the bathroom lighting a bit dim - there is no lighted make up mirror so it is hard to see well and close at the same time. The TV is mediocre with an acceptable, but not wide range of channels. And, being chocolate addicts, we missed having a mint or truffle on our pillow at night! Although we preferred the privacy of our room, if you want large, ornate public areas, you'd be better off elsewhere - there is very little public space - a library and a small sitting area. We only had breakfast at Nomi - nice food but pricey. We did not use the spa at the property, choosing instead to visit the larger venue a few blocks away. You can find that review elsewhere on this site. You cannot really go wrong at the property - the location, room comfort, and omnipresent, friendly staff are as good as it gets in Chicago. We had a wonderful time and would certainly return!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Park Hyatt is an absolutely fantastic hotel. I booked there not quite knowing what to expect - ie standard cookie cutter rooms and mediocre service - but this was far from what we found. It is an art deco building located on the miracle mile right next to John Hancock tower. It has been fully refurbed and the rooms are terrific with all the mod cons, but with a great art deco theme and stacks of character. We booked into a deluxe room which was enormous with incredibly large bathroom. It had a bay window seat which was lovely and a great view over the city. The bed was the comfiest I have ever experienced. We actually booked on our return to Chicago because we were so impressed with everything this hotel had to offer. Staff were super friendly and willing to help you find anything you needed. There is also a town car for guests use with a fantastically friendly driver. There is coffee/tea and lemonade in the library for guests enjoyment during the day/evening. Free internet service etc. etc. Tiffanys, Saks, Ralph Lauren and all the big stores are literally on the front doorstep. I will stay at this hotel without hesitation when we return to Chicago (which is a fantastic city). I have already recommended it to a friend who is going there.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A group of 20 professionals goes to the Park Hyatt hotel lounge based off a recommendation, for an after show drink. We are told to split up at 2 different tables on the clear opposite ends of the lounge. Then I am told by an eastern european waiter "You didn't honestly think you could walk into this place on a Saturday night, with a group of 20, and get a table w/o a reservation, did you?" Now, let me get this straight.........you're whining that a group of 20 just came into your bar, in a desperate economy, when you are charging $6+ for beer, and $15+ for cocktails?????!!!!!! I have lived in Chicago my whole life, and you can guarantee I'll never step foot into this lazy excuse for a high-end lounge, in the heart of Chicago's Mag Mile, again. Oh, and when I left the lounge (w/o ordering anything) there was a huge fight of about 20 gang-bangers beating up a guy on the door step of the Park Hyatt while hotel staff just stood around watching, until the Chicago Police showed up. Nice and safe if you're a family staying there. I have stayed at MANY Chicago hotels, and have NEVER seen this ever! Stay away from this hotel, unless you'd like your evening ruined by excessively incompetent, and rude staff! If I could give it ZERO stars I would have.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Location, Clean, Friendly Staff”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Park Hyatt Chicago over labor day weekend. We reserved a larger room with a view of the Water Tower. I would definitely recommend this hotel for the location, friendly staff and the fact that it is not grossly overpriced. All magnificent mile shopping and restaurants are conveniently right outside the hotel. Our room was clean and comfortable. We especially liked the blackout shades and sheers were motorized with the switch next to the bed. My only complaint is with the space configuration our particular room- doors in the bathroom opening into tight spaces or other doors, or closet doors with mirrors not staying open. The L-shaped couch next to the bed being a bit to large for that space and extended a bit too close to the side of the bed. These are just things that could have easily been avoided because there is enough space in the room for better layout. But they would not deter me from staying at the hotel again. We had appetizers at NoMI on the 7th floor one afternoon which was very pleasant and we received good service. We asked the concierge for a mexican restaurant recommendation one night and from the few given we decided to try Mercadito in the river north neighborhood, which was very lively and had great food and service. Overall I would recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Park Hyatt should be at the top of everyone's list. The experience was great; from arrival, through check-in, the room, the view. And it was the staff that made it all come together. It is a bit pricey, but we used a Hyatt Gold Passport award to cover one of the rooms, so it averaged out OK :-) I can't say enough about the staff. The desk clerk escorted us to the elevators when we checked in. The doorman and concierge had plenty of suggestions for dining. When we stopped by the restaurant (NoMI) in the morning to get some coffee to go, we were told they didn't have disposible cups, but the greeter called down to the desk to make sure they were still serving complementary coffee, even though it was later in the day. On the way to the pool (located in the spa) we were welcomed numerous times and my teenage son even commented on the hospitality. And the spa locker facilities are very nice. And no extra charge for pool and gym. The rooms were very great and the view spectacular. See my photo showing the Water Tower, Michigan Ave, Contemporary Art Museum, and Lake Michigan. Sunday morning we got a Chicago Tribune and New York Times delivered to each room. The location is perfect, especially on a cold December day. Right off Michigan Ave, near shopping and restaurants galore. My highest recommendation!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am currently in the middle of my second stay here at the Park Hyatt Chicago and this experience is better than the first. I used my upgrade certificate and my only gripe ( a small one at that) was that I neither received a high room or a room with a view. However, the suite (Park Suite) is amazing! Very spacious at over 800 square feet. 2 bath rooms, 1 of which has separate bath/shower (shower is big enough for 3 and bath is big enough for 2). The master bath also has 2 sinks and is very spacious. There is a second restroom off the dining area. There is a huge TV (over 40+ inches), sound system w/ ipod input and DVD player. Everything is smart, clean, tasteful and comfortable. I took advantage of the free bikes. I enjoyed the bath (they have bath crystals to use as well). The soaps and amenities were fragrant and refreshing. The staff all provide the best service, with friendly faces and attitudes and very attentive. The breakfast is good but very overpriced if you actually have to pay for it. The portions are a bit small as well. The gym is nice and open 24/hrs. WiFI is free for all. The pool and jacuzzi are refreshing even after a hot humid day. The property is within walking distance of the metro (2 blocks), great shopping (around the corner), probably over 100 great places to eat from casual to fine dining. With the bikes you can easily see everything this great city has to offer. If you have a chance - check it out!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a nice hotel! This provided much more value than I expected it to do (and I didn't have low expectations). Was here for a conference and stayed for three nights and here is a summary of +/- Location : fabulous on Michigan Av and actually has lake view from some rooms (incl 803). Situated just opposite Ralph Lauren and the RL Grill (which was great as well). Hotel itself : good mix between modern and classic. Standards and cleanliness was very good. Good roomy lounge area downstairs. Conference facilities : very good and the catering was excellent as well. Rooms : much larger than expected. Huge bathroom with window across the bedroom for a lakeview (room 803) which was very impressive and nice. The room itself was also very large, great bed, excellent work desk and had all the facilities you might need (excl coffee maker). Very nicely decorated, high standards and very clean. Fitness room : pretty big, well equipped and connected with the SPA (incl changing rooms). All in all it felt modern and a good place for a nice workout. Bar / Restaurant : NoMi lounge, bar and restaurant on the 7th floor. Interesting menu with good tasting food. Pretty well stocked wine list and good selection of international and local beers. Service was great and always with a smile (not the least from Stefan). Service : Excellent, not one bad experience. Everyone very curteous, friendly and professional. A well run team I think. All in all, this is an excellent hotel that I would recommend to anyone, whether going there on business, for shopping or just a trip away with the family.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Park Hyatt Chicago for two days - (Sunday, August 19 - Tuesday, August 21). I had originally booked a Terrace room, but it was overcast and rainy, so I took a Grand Deluxe 1 king on the 18th floor (this is the top floor of the hotel; all higher floors are condos). This is such a marvelous hotel. The location can't be beat, and everyone seems so very eager to help. I ordered room service twice during my stay, requested one of the complimentary DVD's from the library, had a couple of items fetched from my car (all cars are valet parked, and the guest does not have access to this garage as far as I know) and all requests were handled professionally and graciously. I also had them bring me a table fan as I like to sleep with white noise. No problem! The doormen are really great. They were always very attentive when I walked in or out the door. They eagerly offered to hail taxi cabs, offered me an umbrella, offered weather forecasts, etc. Same goes for the rest of the staff. I didn't find much occasion to use the front desk or interior staff members, but they recognized me warmly if I ever looked their way on my way out to the street. The housekeeping staff did a fantastic job as well. When I got back into the hotel from walking about the city, the room looked as it did when I first checked in. I'd like to try and make it back to Chicago when it gets colder, and when I do, i'll definitely be booking a room at the Park Hyatt. I've heard the Peninsula, FS and RC are all fantastic, but the Park Hyatt has a Gold Passport rewards program that i've been using, so I will likely stick with the PH.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">While The Peninsula and the Intercontinental "decked the halls", the Park Hyatt's holiday decor was minimal at best...practically non existent. As a receptionist explained, "It was at the owner's discretion and decision." It was our single greatest disappointment. Otherwise, the hotel was very nice. We had a problem with a noisy family next door our first day and managment immediately moved us to a higher, much quieter location. From our window seat and bird's eye view on the 18th floor we watched the shopper's below on Michigan Avenue. Michigan Avenue itself made up for the lack of holiday decorations in the hotel lobby. The Park Hyatt's central location by the Water Tower could not have been more perfect for access to shopping, restaurants, theatres and Holy Name Cathedral. While the room was very nice and comfortable, (What other hotel would dare use WHITE bed linens AND comforters?) for the price, I noticed a few "little things". Towels were worn and tired. Although I asked for face cloths, only hand towels were delivered. Wash cloths seemed to be scarce. The bathroom was huge with separate shower and a soaking tub with a small TV above the sink. But, there was no decent lighting for applying makeup. The granite vanity in front of the window would have been perfect, but the bathroom was just too dark even with the blind open. While most 5 star hotels have added LCD or plasma TVs, the Park Hyatt still has dated flat screens. Overalll, though, we enjoyed our stay. Managment and the concierge could not have been more helpful and pleasant. I just wish there had been just a little more fa la la la la.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Happy 50th at the Park Hyatt”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife surprised me for my 50th birthday with a weekend in Chicago. When she told me where we were staying, I knew about the Park Hyatt's reputation and was not disappointed. The location alone makes it a great headquarters for exploring the best Chicago has to offer. The level of service, quality of the room and amenities makes this a can't miss experience if you are willing/able to splurge. The view from the 15th floor looked east down Chicago Ave. with a view of Lake Michigan and the original water works just below the room. We had cocktails and appetizers at Nomi, the hotel's lounge/restaurant. Service was great as were the food and drinks. Good wine list. Casual seating in the lounge on couches and comfortable chairs made for a relaxing experience. We didn't use the free exercise facility, but did take a look. One of the best you'll find outside of resorts and spas that specialize in fitness. The marble bathroom with large shower and private toilet was nice. My wife would have liked better lighting, so a lighted makeup mirror might be in order. There is also a small TV above the mirror. The room features a pillow top mattress, (pretty standard at most of the nicer establishments) flat screen TV with DVD player (DVD movies are complimentary and available at front desk) and the most comfortable leather lounge chair I've used in a hotel. The lighting is mostly recessed, good for creating a relaxed or romantic atmosphere. On a good weather day and with enough energy you can walk almost anywhere you might want to explore on the Magnificent Mile or lakefront. There are many fine hotels in the immediate area, but if you can spring for it, the Park Hyatt is a good choice.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just completed a one night stay August 29 at the Park Hyatt. The place has a very upscale feeling as soon as you walk into the lobby. Everyone at the front desk is extremely professional. They were not able to honor my upgrade certificate and offered no sort of benefit for my disappointment. Check in was painless, yet it should be for the price of the rooms here. Purchased a King deluxe that promised a view and the view did not disappoint. This was a getaway weekend with my husband and I wanted to go all out and make it special. The room was very attractive, Zen-like. Huge tub that had wonderful hot water that is temperature controlled. Amazing for a nice relaxing soak. Room was immaculate with a beautiful view of the water and Michigan Avenue. Hotel is right across the street from Ralph Lauren and American Girl Store. There is a bus stop right across the street from the hotel that takes you down to the Navy Pier and travels along Michigan Avenue. You can purchase a CTA transit card on their website prior to travel. If you want to book the courtesy car a BMW you are better off doing that a couple of weeks prior to arrival throught the concierge. Ramon the driver is very professional and was very prompt in taking us to our dinner location. We dined at NoMi and the service is top shelf. The waiters are extremely attentive and professional. We had breakfast and the view is wonderful. The staff at the hotel are definitely well trained people. Service is impeccable. My husband used the gym and raved about the equipment, the personnel and yes the pitchers of ice cold water with fresh fruit in it. If you are looking for a luxury hotel this is a great bet. For a special stay I will be back in a heart beat.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “My Favorite Michigan Ave Hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Michigan Ave is graced with at least four of the best city hotels in the world. I've stayed in them all many times. I can't say a negative thing about any one of them. They all are 5 star and it's a matter on personal taste. I first stayed at the Park Hyatt over 10 years ago when it first open in its new incarnation. We stayed in the Pritzker Suite (since renamed) and were overwhelmed. We're appreciate art and organic objects. We tend to like mid-century modern decor. The Pritzker Suite was jaw dropping. For us it was the best Presidential type suite we had stayed in or even seen a picture of. I knew I had been spoilt and resisted booking the Park Hyatt because I would be disappointed knowing the heavenly suite was perched on the 17th floor. The 4 Seasons & Ritz (by 4 Seasons) are great properties but after the Peninsula opened it become my home once a month for several years. After the economic downturn I became more sensitive to room rates and went back to Park Hyatt. Well I can report that it's a 5 star product, the equal of it's next door neighbor and at a much sweeter value. The lack none of the high end amenities of a great hotel. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Cristophe alway greets me warmly by name and when I tell the bell men I don't need a car, that I'm taking the train a half block away to the airport I get a big thumbs up for being so smart. I've stayed in all the smaller suites and the standard rooms. All are great for a one or two day business trip. I think the 02, 03, 04 rooms all offer a great view of the Water Tower and on the higher floors an unobstructed view of Lake Michigan. NoMi is one of the better dining experiences in a city with some of the best chefs in the world. I love Park Hyatts and this one shines like a jewel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Park Hyatt Chicago for two nights at the tail-end of a business/pleasure trip, and we loved every minute of it. From beginning to end, the staff, service and facility were outstanding. Upon (early) arrival, we were greeted at the door by friendly but vigilant personnel - I appreciated this measure of discreet security throughout our stay. The gentleman who assisted us at the front desk upgraded us to what we later discovered was a deluxe king room on the eighth floor with unsurpassed window seat views of the Water Tower, downtown and Lake Michigan. Since our room was not yet ready, he had our luggage stored safely while we went sightseeing. Upon return, we found that our luggage had already been brought to our room. Soft music from the sound system was playing and the room was warmly lit by the soft glow of the city below. Very romantic beginning of our stay. After a long day of walking, I really appreciated the soaking tub, which was surrounded by candles and a jar of aromatherapy bath crystals. The bed, enrobed with Frette linens, was phenomenally cozy and comfortable. During our stay, we enjoyed room service (expensive), the fitness center (which is a very clean, fully equipped gym, pool and spa, with friendly staff), and breakfast in NoMi (expensive). I can't imagine staying anywhere else - the intimate, understated and boutique feel of the Park Hyatt, coupled with a well-trained, attentive staff makes this a must-stay in Chicago for discerning business or leisure travelers, couples seeking romance, or families with well-behaved children...the hotel is truly outstanding at all levels. Chicago is a shopper's, culture hound's and foodie's dream - there is a myriad of dining establishments within walking distance from which to choose, and a visit to the Signature Room near the top of the Hancock Tower for evening cocktails is a must-do.</p></li>
