<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It is in a highly convenient location near Taksim square, particularly appealing when visiting for touristic purposes. Rooms on one side have astonishing views of the Bosphorus, so it is worth to pay the extra bit that they cost. If you are not willing to do so, you can always get the chance to see them from the executive lounge or the Lebanese restaurant on the top floor.

Rooms are sufficiently spacious and the breakfast is good. Service quality is standard and there was nothing to complaint about during my stay. Location is good, nearby Taqsim square, walking distance is 5 minutes. I should mention the view, which is pretty nice. There are nice facilities, out of which I recommend to try the traditional Turkish bath.</p></li>

Good hotel overall: very good location (10 minutes walk to Taksim Square, very ok for tourism) and breathtaking view, especially if you are on the high Executive floors. Leisure equipements are great also and bed comfort was very good. The lounge offers very good snacks/drinks. Not a five however as some drawbacks : bathroom feels a bit old and having weddings/parties in the evening during week ends is not the best thing for guests' sleep.</p></li>

Very good experience. The location is not superb but good enough. Using the subway or a taxi you get into town fast and there are lots of shops and restaurants also in walking distance. The only drawback, if there way any, was that there way no space in the lobby where you could just sit and work or talk for a while, as all chairs belonged to the rather expensive bars and restautants.</p></li>

Only complaint was the noise one night. We were kept up by a rock concert for hours. When I called the front desk to complain, they didn't care....bad attitude.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hilton Istanbul was opened in the 1950s. As a piece of architecture it is nothing remarkable, but its date meant that it was able to secure a lot of space - hence a pleasant garden - with a view largely over parkland to the Bosphorus. I was there for a couple of days on business, so didn't use the facilities heavily. There were one or two minor niggles - no bath robe, lukewarm shower - but for me they were more than offset by a comfortable room, courteous service and, especially, a balcony with a wonderful view of the Bosphorus.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I normally stay at the Conrad when in town but that property was sold out for this trip. When I arrived and looked at the exterior I was quite scared of what to expect inside. What a pleasant surprise, big room with amazing balcony and great views over the Bosphorus. I loved the Executive Floor Lounge which offered drinks all-day and a light complimentary dinner every evening. Also, the breakfast buffet (I decided to eat it downstairs at the restaurant) proved to be wonderful. All in all, great service in a well-running property. I'll be back.</p></li>

Also server in the breakfast saloon recognise us and he serve us the same decaffeinated cappucino. Also for the people who would like to have a rest they created upper location at the pool area, so you do not need to stay just beside of the pool and hear the children noise.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a superbly run hotel with excellent housekeeping and competent service. The breakfast buffet is simply outstanding. Location is good too, being about a 10 minute walk from Taksim Square with lots of retauarants, shops and ATMs nearby. Be advised, however that internet access is rather expensive and the mini-bar prices are the highest I have seen anywhere. At 16TL (~USD13) for a beer, you should think twice before taking one (or visit the Executive Lounge). All in all, this is a top notch hotel and I would certainly stay there again if I return to Istanbul.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is one of Hilton's best, conveniently located for the Congress Centre and the Dolmabahce Palace in Taksim. Each room has a balcony and there are smoking rooms available. There is also a large covered, but open at the front, sitting area next to the lobby which is heated and where one can smoke and drink. The staff are fantastic - really pleasant and helpful. Rooms are large and clean, with quiet air handling. Three restaurants are on-site - a chinese, a lebanese and an international one.The executive lounge is outstanding. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

Excellent service given by it staff, with a sence of hospitality, in reception, concierge, and waiters. Great breakfast experience, but also a nice Lebanese restaurant on the top of the hotel.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed in this hotel as I travelled to Istanbul (for the first time) on business. Although it's location isn't within walking distance of the most popular tourist places, taxis are cheap and the hotel is luxurious. The staff were most helpful and always friendly; the rooms were very clean and a good size and other hotel amenities (Turkish bath, pool, gardens, etc.) were clean, available, and beautiful. The hotel's biggest asset is the view. Overlooking the Bospherous, you feel as if the view is worth the nightly rate alone. If you can afford this indulgence, it's definitely worth the expense.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My company had booked 11 rooms from 22nd to 25th September and almost every one of us had some complain. Either temperature control was not working or tea bag refill required payment. Rooms are dated with low pressure in shower, non replacement of toiletries, no change of bed sheet on third night and no cleaning of carpet. It seems that hotel does not have a supervisor to check the cleanliness of rooms. Though five star, selection at breakfast was also limited and when I ordered pan cake only one piece was provided. Thus just for location, one should not stay at this property which in my view is not of Hilton Standard and of 3.5* Moin Fudda</p></li>

The food was wonderful with a great choice and always cooked well. The rooms were cleaned well and the bathroom well stocked with all you needed. The grounds of the hotel are beauitfully kept and wonderful to walk around and get some fresh air and peace in this very busy city.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel is a bit dated, but everything works fine. Upkeep of rooms and public areas are good.Stayed on executive floor which gives you use of the executive lounge that provides excellent breakfast then afternoon tea evening drinks up to 2300hrs. This is a real plus as everything is complimentary plus free wi fi. The gym was very acceptable, the indoor pool is small but it was always empty when I was there. The service on the executive floor really depended on who was handling your request. Ceylan was really guest orientated and so helpful, but another day one of the staff told me I could hand in my mail and ask downstairs at the concierge... which I found odd.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for 4 days and were extremely happy with the stay. My wife wanted to be nearer to the main Shopping area in Taksim Square so we have just moved for another 4 nights to the slightly more noisy area of Taksim Square and will be staying at a hotel called the Marmara. I will write a review on the Marmara after our stay. But I loved the Hilton - the location is peaceful and it is only a slow relaxing 10 minute walk to the hustle and bustle of the main Taksim Square. The hilton have a large outdoor pool as well as an inside one and a gym. The water is quite expensive but we bought quite a few bottles from Seven Eleven around the corner. I would reccomend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've been staying at the Hilton Istanbul on and off for 15 years, both for business and pleasure - most recently in August for a 10 day holiday. I can honestly say that I can find absolutely no fault with the hotel. The facilities, restaurants, situation and most importantly, staff are just fantastic. I will go as far as to say that this is the best hotel I have ever stayed in in 18 years of extensive travel around the world. To the staff of the Hilton, I congratulate you wholeheartedly on your fantastic achievement. I hope to see you again very soon. One favour to ask - could you contact the Intercontinental hotel in Dubai and give them some direction on customer service provision. They really need your help !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was charged 500+ euros per night for staying here during the '09 World Bank conference, which is the most I've ever paid for any hotel room. The hotel is clean and well kept but clearly has seen better days. Many of the staff were friendly but some clearly lacked a service mind, especially the receptionist who checked me out. Worse of all, the hotel double charged me for the rooms, charging both my company as well as the personal credit card I provided them - one whole week later they still have yet to resolve the problem (After having called them at least 5 times, and written to them for the same amount of time.) To avoid such exorbitant prices and the hotel's ridiculous billing problems, I would stay elsewhere.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Arriving at the Hilton just after midnight, along with three business colleagues, we were unceremoniously told that the hotel was in fact overbooked and none of us would be able to stay at the Hilton. This was despite having firm reservations (booked through one of the biggest global business travel agents) and room rates of over Euros 280 per night. Consequently, we had no option other than to get into a taxi and hope another hotel could accommodate us. This was very disappointing from a chain as prestigious as the Hilton â€“ especially as they didnâ€™t make any efforts to pre-warn us, or our travel agent, of their overbooking situation. I hope fellow-travellers will use this review as a cautionary note for the Hilton Istanbul!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is on a great plot, an oasis of relative calm amidst the hubbub of the city. The building is functional rather than pretty on the outside, but with a balcony for every well designed and comfortable room, the views out are wonderful, which is the important thing! Moon rise over the Bosphorous most memorable. Bed especially comfortable with excellent linen, lovely quality toiletries in the bathroom too. Reception, concierge and bar staff were all attentive and friendly. Shame that the outdoor pool was not yet open - sunny Easter weekend and all that, but it and the rest of the grounds looked nice. Lack of free wi-fi a surprise at a Hilton, but all the cafes and bars we visited had it, so no hardship. In summary, recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here with my wife who was on a business conference. In many ways you can't fault the place, big room, largely excellent service, lovely breakfast, stunning views of the Bosphorous, close to Taxim Square etc. However, there are a few things to nit pick at - internet use is extortionate whether in your room or in the business centre which is probably playing on the captive largely business clientele on expenses, a small beer in the bar is Â£6, a coffee is Â£5. I appreciate it is 5 star but come on, is that really a justification for prices triple those of any number of establishments nearby? I've given a high score because there are so many excellent aspects to this hotel, but some of their pricing policies leave a bit of a sour taste.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">By accident we were there for 2days. 80% of the guests are business people. We had a room with sea view on the Bosporus, it was great. Personnel is very friendly. The interieur is a little bit old fashioned but as its one of the first big hotels in Istanbul it has its special charme, i like it anyway. The hotel has a spa space and in-and outdoor pool. I was only in the indoor pool, I dont know how the massage and hamam is. The breakfast is intercontinental with a big variation of bread, pancake and fruits and bircher mÃ¼sli and of course turkiish breakfast. The only disadvantage is that they have not a shuttle service to the airport, but its just 300 metres where the Havas (aiport shuttle) bus stop is closed to Taksim meydan. (10 YTL) Taxi is approx 40 YTL</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have been regularly staying in this hotel for the last 3 years and am almost addicted to it. I like the view from the executive lounge, which itself has become very charming, particularly after the renovation. There are 6 computers for free usage, but that sometimes leads to lot of noise as children play games etc. The location is just superb, just walking distance to Taksim - which is the hub of all late vening activities. The hotel looks can sometimes confuse one, with its 'hostel' kind of appearance. But once you are inside, I think everything is perfect. The pool is superb and so are all the sports and other activities. The indoor pool is very small though. I would definitely recommend this hotel to all business executives and individuals alike.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice hotel very sophisticated and with a real retro 1950's feel. The pool area is very nice and fun for the children. The exec. club was quite good and especially good for breakfast, they would make things like french toast to order. Service was generally good in there.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent four nights whilst attending a conference. The Hilton was Istanbul's first five-star hotel (built in 1968, I think) and there is no way to hide her age -- though both the rooms and public areas have been renovated several times, and are impeccably well-maintained. Staff was invariably friendly (every single encounter in the hallway produced a smile and a greeting) and also efficient. Business lounge is excellent, with free internet access and color printing in addition to great views of the Bosphorous. New Lebanese restaurant on the 9th floor is quite decent, though naturally you get the same quality and style of food for less if you venture outside the hotel. Also a good health club and spa. All in all, I was very happy and would not hesitate to book here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I traveled as part of a group for 2 nights and had a great overall stay making use of all the hotel facilities (outdoor pool, terrace bar, spa, concierge..). Having stayed in many Hilton 4* hotels, you could really notice the difference the 5* rating gave, such as turndown service, complimentary water and daily fruit bowl (wow the cherries!). The room balcony was unexpected and really made the best of the location and the superb Bosporus views plus a bonus listening to James Blunt live (concert taking place in the arena opposite). Only negative, the hotel is very popular events venue and having many outdoor areas, can be a little noisy (events tend to go on late in to the small hours). Having said that, watching the fire-eaters perform for a party and the amazing Bosporus views made up for that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel at the end of March 2012. The hotel itself was great. We were upgraded to an executive room and had a beautiful view on the bosborus. Room was large and was okay. Executive lounge was also very good and had a nice choice of drinks and some snacks. Hilton staff was always very helpful. All in all a very good hotel but... be careful with booking at weekends and in warm months. We stayed there over a weekend and on Friday and Saturday there was a disco in front of the Hotel that was playing very loud till 2 or 3 a.m. Fortunately I have a good sleep but when you have a light sleep then you will for sure have some problems with falling asleep. To get sure you will not have any trouble with the disco noise book a room with no bosporus view and enjoy the bosborus view from the lounge.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lovely hotel, not the most modern or new but had a charm of its own. Most importantly, service was excellent, the food at the hotel too! I travelled with 2 kids under 4 and the management and staff made my holiday memorable indeed. Would certainly stay there again. Even the staff at the hotel shops were really helpful and didn't try to rip you off! Things cost a little bit more but were better quality than some local places. Quite a central location and some places that were easy to walk to. Hotel helped plan our tours and recommended places to eat that were nearby and quite good. There is an excellent Chinese restaurant at the hotel. At the Turkish restaurant, i had the best rice pudding i've ever tasted and I did try this at many places as the kids love it. Well done Hilton, you live up to your reputation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is an old hotel. In the lobby were old photographs of VVIPs, dignitaries and Hollywood movie stars, who came for the official grand opening and those who stayed in the 1960's. The grounds are expansive, with the swimming pool area, the tennis courts, the gym, the spa, the jogging/walking 'track' and gardens, separate from the main building. All the F&B outlets face the Bosphorus, which is great. Our room was very adequate; unfortunately the wi-fi was not complimentary. Taksim Square is nearby. Service at Front Office, however, was unimpressive. Staff there could not provide us with certain information we require, nor did they make a special effort to help us obtain the information. It was left to us to find it by chance a day later, and that was from a fellow guest. Overall we find our experience at the property impersonal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We traveled with our 2 kids to Istanbul and stayed at the Hilton. I fell in love with the city! What a wonderful place to travel to. I'm so happy we took our kids. They learned so much and really enjoyed being in Istanbul. The Hilton was a great. It is not the most glamourous hotel in Istanbul, but it is of a very good standard. We especially loved the photos and information about the history of the hotel. It made the trip just a bit more special. My kids braved the pool even though it was unseasonably cool during our stay. The pool was nice and the chairs comfortable. We had dinner in the top floor restaurant and it was absolutely delicious and the service was spot-on. I highly recommend it. Concierge service was hit or miss. Some of them go out of their way to help, and some don't really listen. You'll quickly learn which one is which.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were really impressed with our stay at the HIlton Istanbul. The room had an amazing view of the Bosphorus and was very tastefully furnished. The staff was extremely helpful and went out of their way to assist us--and this is truly remarkable since the place was packed with dignitaries for an international conference. The location near Taskim was great for getting around the city (with a short five minute walk to the Metro for touring the city) and the restaurant on the top floor had some of the best Lebanese food I've ever had in my life. The ad in the elevator boasted of having one of the best Hilton lounges and it didn't disappoint--which is shocking since such boasts are usually an indication of the opposite. The views, selection and staff in the lounge were all amazing. Perhaps the staff from the UK and US can visit to see what service should be like.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A very warm welcome and an upgrade later, we found ourselves in a very comfortable room with a spectacular view of the Bosphorus and the Bosphorus bridge. If the view during the day wasn't enough, the night view was just breathtaking. The room is comfortable and clean and so is the bathroom. There were two big events in the hotel while we were there with loud music but it wasn't too much of a bother. The only downside was the wifi which wasn't complimentary in either the room or the common areas. In a five-star hotel like this one, it's quite a downer. The hotel is old but didn't feel mouldy. The hotel is a comfortable 5-8 minutes walk from Taksim Square, the metro line and the Havas Airport shuttle service. Overall a good base to explore the newer parts of Istanbul. The outdoor pool is nice, the indoor however is not exciting at all. Overall, we'll be happy to go back there.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here a few weeks ago and overall the hotel was good. The amenities were good, breakfasts ample, service - both in respect of the room and the front desk - of a very high quality. The views were lovely and the Bosphorous view rooms were worthwhile and relatively ecoonomical. I do think that the hotel could use some upgrading/refurbirshments as it is a bit tired and certainly not of the same standard as other Hiltons we have stayed at. Our room was certainly satisfactory but there was a strong smell of perfume in the room, coming through the vents and the air was dryer than usual hotel air, which made sleeping less comfortable. The one key drawback is the location, well outside the key attractions. If you are here on business then fine, but one must take a taxi if you wish to go to Sultanahmet etc. Next time in Istanbul, we will stay on the Asian side, closer to the attractions.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We decided to return to Istanbul Hilton for our second visit and to celebrate a New Year in such an amazing city. Although we had planed to return earlier in the year when the outdoor pool was open I am afraid to say Sorrento and Barcelona won the day !! Saying that this hotel does not disappoint...from the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty and received an upgrade to a lovely Bosphorus view Executive room which gives guests access to one of the best Executive lounges within the Hilton portfolio. Credit must go to the whole Executive lounge team, they are truly amazing, and so professional in their posts, nothing is left to chance, every little detail is attended to without you really knowing. We again made full use of the lovely Spa within the hotel and we had yet again another wonderful stay. I would thoroughly recommend the Hilton Istanbul to any traveler visiting Istanbul. Enjoy your visit, we shall be back !!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Unfortunately this hotel needs a very urgent refurbishment! There are so many very new and classy hotels in Istanbul so if the hotel management wants to stay at the top of the game they need to take action! Everthing in the rooms (except the new tvs) especially bahtroom look shabby. We stayed here first 10 years ago it was quite nice then but nothing changed unfortunately since 10 years.. We stayed at the ''executive'' floor. The staff was nice and friendly other than that it fails its purpose. The food served there is very poor and strange combination (actually in the hotel in general the food quality is very poor ). Also very limited alcoholic drink varieties. Again the whole place looks like it is from the 50s still!! The cleaning needs improving as well as I had to look at the same hair in the bath for 3 days till I told the customers services about it. Overall not worth the money. I felt like staying in a 3 star low quality hotel..</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I typically stay in Hiltons when I travel; this is my first stay here and there are just a few things that make it "almost" a Hilton: 1. old 19 inch CRT televisions instead of a nice, large flatscreen; 2. thin, scratchy towel instead of the big, fluffy ones; 3. definitely NOT a typical Hilton mattress. All that said, this was a nice place to stay. I was on the executive floor, so access to the exec lounge was appreciated, with a great view, free food and drinks, daily newspaper, and a concierge. The health club in the hotel is very nice and well-equipped, and there are full spa offerings. There are several dining options within the hotel, but like ni most other Hilton's, they are overpriced for what they serve. Internet access is outrageously priced, but you can use the computers in the business center for 15 minutes at a time for free. All said, I would stay here again, but they do have a few areas to upgrade in order to be a "real" Hilton.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The best thing this hotel has going for it is the private balconies with Bisphorus views, where you can relax and watch the ships gliding between Asia and Europe, and watch the lights on the bridge between the continents at night. I would highly recommend getting a room facing the Bosphorus, unless you are blind. The executive lounge is also very good, and the atfernoon buffet is great The location is useful for shopping, but somewhat off from the main tourist attractions. Note that it is not out of the centre. One of the big mistakes many visitors make about Istanbul is that they believe it has a centre. It doesn't, it is simply too big for that. Instead it has many, and Taksim square close to the Hilton is one of those that will give you a taste of what Turkey is. A good experience is to walk from the Hilton to Galata tower, and then take a taxi back. To see the Blue mosque and the other attractions at Sultanahmet simply take a taxi in the morning.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is an older hotel that has tried to pick up its image recently and has partially succeeded. There are many top quality 5 start hotels in Istanbul, of which the Hilton is one, but it lacks the charm of many of the others and is just a notch off being what it sets out to be. The rooms are adequate, if not exceptional and the views are nice, especially of the Bosphorus if you are lucky enough to get a facing room - I was not. I was stuck at the back and next to a building site that clattered and banged all night, keeping me awake. I am told that work should finish by the end of 2008 but if you visit before then, be warned. Staff are friendly, with a couple of exceptions and food is adequate in all restaurants, if not being spectacular like is available in some places in Istanbul. In summary, its OK but you can do better for the price - try the Hyatt or the InterCon or the Swisshotel, for example as similarly priced but probably a bit better alternatives</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for a night over the Easter weekend to sight-see in Istanbul. The hotel is very well positioned overlooking the City and close by the sights. There's a metro and tram to take you to all the main places and the property is located in a nice area. We were welcomed very warmly by the front desk team and allocated a large room with a good sized bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and the next morning the concierge was very helpful pointing out the key city sights and helping us get our day underway. We were upgraded to an Exec level room and took breakfast in the Exec Lounge. This is a nice space with good views across the Bosphorous but the breakfast was not among the best we've experienced with Hilton. Everyone we encountered at the Hilton Istanbul was friendly and helpful and we wished we'd just stayed here instead of moving to the Conrad as we did because that turned out to be a less than positive experience. We'd happily recommend this hotel without hesitation for a stay in Istanbul.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Club level in this hotel is so spectacular, I keep going out of my way to return to Istanbul to enjoy it's fabulous experience. The huge club lounge is on the top floor offering spectacular view, good food and unlimited alcoholic drinks (including champagne) throughout the day. It's hard to pour yourself a drink at the self service buffet as the incredibly funny and friendly staff is always there to help you out and do whatever to make you feel special. I was staying here with a friend for 3 days and we hardly managed to leave the hotel property. The fantastic outdoor pool was back in business and this must be one of the best hotel pools in the world. Hilton Istanbul's signature is it's incredibly friendly and professional staff where-ever you go, from housekeeping and security to pool boys to hotel management. Rate's vary greatly throughout the year and seem to get very steep while getting closer to Summer, but I feel the hotel continues to offer value for money at almost any price. You won't regret your stay here.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Im a Honours Gold member so got upgraded to Exec Floor and stayed here for two nights for my birthday. The room was very dated - particularly the carpet which was worn. This was an Exec room so I cant imagine the standard rooms. On the positive side the room was of a reasonable size as was the bathroom, the view over the Bosphorous was lovely and balcony with opening patio doors and small table and chairs was great. The service was generally very good. The executive lounge was very good and did not have a restricted hours for serving alcohol - ie beers/spirits were available until 11pm over the weekend. The Exec lounge is large but did get quite busy and agin it had lovely views over the Bosphorous. The hotel is large and the pool and pool area were large and almost resport like although it was very busy during our stay (August). The location of the hotel is ok, its about a 10/15 minute walk to Taksim Square which is a main transport terminus and also where there is an airport bus. Overall we had a good stay and Istanbul is a fasinating city.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of five stayed at the Hilton end of August, second time in Istanbul. Great choice. We were given two connecting door rooms on the 5th floor, Bosporous side. We even got a very attractive offer for the 2nd room for our kids! The rooms are spacious, the beds very comfortable with lots of pillows. Room carpet a bit dated. Excellent service and breakfast! Unforgettable views from our balconies! The Bosporous calling for you, the sky ever changing colours, the bridge to Asia beautifully lit. Huge gardens... We tried the heated indoor pool (needs to be a little updated) and the hamam (a totally relaxing experience). Walking distance from Taksim square and the Dolmabache Palace. Easy taxi ride to Aghia Sophia and Topkapi palace. An excellent stay in Istanbul with only 2 drawbacks. The ripoff by certain taxi drivers (we almost missed our flight home due to one of them) and the remaining of a "restoration" ladder inside Aghia Sophia that seems to be there for ages. What a pitty for such an architectural monument... We'll be happily back in an exciting city and a beautiful hotel!</p></li>

From the airport, we took a taxi, and by a meter, it costed us ~45TL.

Always ask them to go by a taxi meter. otherwise, they will always try to rip you off. since we have 2 kids, we always used taxies. There were only few taxi drivers willing to use the meter. all others tries to rip you off with extra charge. Be very careful!! Executive lounge: very nice view with many drink selections. one of the best lounge I ever been to. Room; quite old, but well maintained. It is big ebough for all of us. Pretty comfortable. hotel; a bit outdated. restaurant and bar are quite expensive. Swimming pool is nice. Staff; nothing special, but did not bother us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Istanbul Hilton is a favourate destination for me for the last seven years. I look forward to my stay all year long. The property is superb, in the middle of the city you have the feeling of being at a resort. with it's extensive gardens, spacious pool area and outdoor spaces. During the last trip unfortunately I was disappointed. The air conditioner regardless of setting kept blasting cold air. There was a constant annoying voise apparently from the bathroom exhaust fan. A long red hair strand was across the bathtub when we checked into the room. One morning as I reached under the bed in search of a pen that was dropped, I noticed that the floor underneath had not been cleaned from previous guests. Our drinking glasses were not changed. These problems were brought to the attention of guest services but not was apparently corrected. I also found the service in the executive dinning room very inconsistent, from having to look for a waiter to being ignored and another time being greeted and attended to. I'm hoping better supervision and coaching will keep the hotel's standards high.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location is good: in the middle of parklike grounds, very close to Taksim Sq. They have a nice outdoor (indoor as well) swimming pool area ( a big advantage during the hot summer days)...but Oh Boy!... those extra small bath towels must be the original ones from the opening year of the hotel (1955). The hotel has a lot of potential, but it is obviously badly managed. The room standard is low. The bed quality and especially the bed linen is below average. The standard of the club floor service and the club lounge is low. The standard of the (very limited) buffet breakfast, served in the club lounge is low...and when a plate in the buffet is empty, don't expect that it will be refilled in a long, long time. There is simply no reason to pay any extra for staying at the club floor (executive floor). The cooking at the Roof Restaurant was only acceptable, nothing more. Everything (except the location) is very mediocre in this hotel. Such a pity, as the hotel has great possibilities. Three points because of the location and the outdoor pool. If You don't value the outdoor pool , go elsewhere!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at Hilton Istanbul from Aug.29-Sept.1, 2011. I got a realy good family rate so can't comment on the value of the room. My room itself (2nd floor) was huge, including a king-sized bed, flat screeen TV, and large patio/terrace. The gym and outdoor pool were both nice and modern. I went to the Iftar dinner at the Bosphorus Terrace Restaurant which was about 80 Turkish lira for a full buffet dinner, I thought the food was great. I also had the breakfast buffet breakfast in the same restaurant every morning which was nice but also included free in my family rate. The Al Bushra restaurant is also a good option for dinner as it has a nice view and good food. The location of the hotel is very central to Taksim square and the tram lines. If you take the shuttle bus from the airport, it will take you about an hour to get to the Taksim square stop and the hotel is about a 5 min walk from there. This might not be an option for people with small children and/or lots of luggage though. My only complaint about Hilton Istanbul is that I would expect a hotel of this class to offer free wifi internet, the cost for connecting in room is quite high and even the per minute cost in the business centre seemed unecessary. Would defintiely stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for six nights in late October. The weather was really quite awful - raining and cold every day. However, the hotel staff and restaurants made my stay extremely enjoyable. I ate with a large group at the Lebanese restaurant and it was truly superb. The buffet for breakfast and dinner was more than ample in its variety and deliciousness. On my last lunch there the sun broke out and I was able to sit on the patio and enjoy the view of the Bosphorous. My room was large and quiet - I had colleagues who said that they heard the call to prayer every morning at about 5:00 a.m., yet I never heard anything. The staff was extremely helpful and attentive - I discovered that I left my passport on my desk when I went out for the day and I called the front desk and they went to my room, grabbed the passport and held it at the front desk until I returned that night. I had not packed an umbrella and the front door man was kind enough to check one out for me for the day. While the hotel was about an hour from the trade show I was working, it was only about a 15 minute walk to some very exciting night life and restaurants. I have no complaints at all and bought some scarves for my family in the shop in the lobby for only slightly more than I would pay at the bazaar, without any of the hassle. I would absolutely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked an Executive Plus room for 2 nights at the Hilton in Istanbul, I went tot his hotel because recommendations from friends who stayed here before We arrived after an evening flight around 01:00 at the hotel. Our taxi was checked and we had to go through a metal detector when we entered the hotel. So security was fine ! The check in went very fast and got high room with view of the Bosporus. The room was a bit dated but had a good view and one of the biggest beds I ever saw in a hotel. The air conditioning was not working at all and even when it was set on cold, it blew hot air ! The next morning we had breakfast in the executive lounge on the top floor. The lounge had also a beautiful view of the Bosporus but only when the weather is good. The breakfast itself was very good and had a very great choice of fruits, breads and drinks. Also the service was very good. In the evening the lounge was full. The snacks were always empty and not filled by also the service was not good and tables were full of plates and glasses. The lounge has a few computers guests can use but at most times they are occupied by others. We had room service one day and we enjoyed the food but not everything was hot. The location of the hotel is very good and just minutes of the Taksim Square, taxiâ€™s are available at the hotel and relatively cheap. All staff members are friendly and helpful !</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have been coming to this hotel every year for the last 10 years, and it was always good to me (of course, I am a Diamond Hilton Member). Still, the location is fantastic - one block (400m or so) from the Taksim Sq where the shuttle buses from the airport depart/arrive every 30 min. The Bosphorus views are stunning. This hotel has a 1.5km running track, indoor and outdoor pool, hammam, dry sauna, steam room, exercise room, numerous restaurants, superb executive lounge and a very good hearty breakfast. A balcony in every room. The staff alone at the Hilton Honors reception merits 5 stars - all speaking perfect English, extremely helpful and accomodating, eager to help and resolve any problem. Room service is impeccable with everybody I met speaking English and a courteous service with a smile on their faces - a tremendos feat for the Middle Eastern hotel. Air conditioners are whisper quiet. All rooms were kept sparkling clean by the cleaning staff. There is a nearby store open almost 24 hrs (next to Roberts coffee) where you can buy simple sandwiches, wine, liquor, water, sodas etc. Taksim Sq of course is open 24/7 and full of restaurants or street food vendors. Can't recommend it enough! One word of caution, though - when getting a taxi from the hotel, make sure that driver drives you the shorter way to the Ataturk airport (40 TL) as opposed to the longer one (70-80TL) - they love driving you around :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Family holiday, got 2 rooms bosphorus view at the 4th floor. The hotel is very nice, the rooms are big, beds and pillows are very comfortbale. There were no linked rooms available so we took two adjacent rooms. The bathroom is top quality. The bosphoris view is well worth it. Staff are frindly and helpfull especially room service. Breakfast in the bosphorus terrace is excellent, also restaurant staff are very nice and friendly. Hotel location is convineint, 10 minutes walk from taksim square, and taxis are available at the hotel all the time. Only issues is that agree with other reviews that there is a noisy night club on the bosphorus side, although didnt seam much of a problem to us, the other thing is that the breakfast gets busy after 9:00, and it seams staff are not enough to cope, other issue with the breakfast there was no change through our 6 days stay and food was international style, nothing specially "turkish" (but turkish cofee was very good though). temperature in the rooms is very worm at night, which can disturb the sleep. One problem we had at check in, the rooms booking starts in the afternoon, we arrvied at 8:00 PM where one of the rooms was not ready yet, we went to the ready room to find the cleaner still there and the toilet flush still sounding after cleaning the bathroom...I didnt like this as a start. In general we enjoyed our stay, happy to recommend it, and will be happy to stay ther eagain.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had an excellent stay at the Hilton Istanbul in the week leading up to Christmas 2008. We booked our stay using Hilton points for a standard room. Upon arrival, we were informed we had been upgraded to the executive floor. The front desk person escorted us to the executive lounge on the 9th floor to complete check in. The process was smooth and everyone went out of their way to be helpful. The lounge was large and spacious with an excellent view of the Bosphorus. We wound up having a full breakfast their each day as well as a late day latte. The service was excellent and the food very tastey. Our room was standard, but spacious and well done. The hotel is one of the older top end properties in the neighborhood, but very well kept up. Despite the winter chill, evening tea on the balcony while taking in the view was wonderful. The fitness center was better than expected. I so often find even with premium hotels, that the fitness equipment is lacking or in disrepair. The work out room was compact, but well equipped. They had 6 treadmills, 7 elipticals, several stair steppers, bikes, and a selection of free weights. All were in working order and a full time staff member on hand to help out those who required help. The conceirge was very helpful. They aided us with dinner plans, and booking several private tours. I generally see Hilton as a 4-star chain, but I would support their claims to 4.5 to 5 star for the Istanbul property.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a HH Diamond I was upgraded to an Executive room with a balcony looking toward to Bosporus. There is an express lift from the lobby level to the executive floors. The room was very large with nice beds, the dÃ©cor was classic and fit the hotel well, the bath was also good for a hotel of this age, the room was very well maintained and for some reason you start to think about who might have had this room in the past. This hotel has a very cool history and just celebrated itâ€™s 55th year. I will not get into the history of this hotel but if you have an intrest in Hilton hotels and Conrad Hilton do a quick search on this hotel. This hotel is old school but in a cool way, when you walk in you feel special. You can see and feel the history all over. I did get to meet with some of the PR folks for the Hilton cluster in Istanbul and they are very proud of this hotel, and itâ€™s history. It shows when a staff and management have pride in the hotel they work in, my stay was perfect! Good VIP treatment with a nice upgrade, choice of breakfast in lounge or the restaurant. A very well run lounge with a large staff to serve you food and drinks, along with a lounge front desk for check in and hotel service needs. Overall very pleased with this hotel, it was a very rewarding â€œrewardâ€� stay, the location is good, the staff is helpful, the rooms are big and clean, and the Ex lounge is one of the best. The Hilton historical part of it all makes it unique.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hilton for a "girls' week-end" and had a great time. The hotel is about 10 mins walk or 5TL in a taxi to Taksim Square. We enjoyed the location as it was close enough to the bizz but far enough away for a peaceful stay. On the evening we arrived, the hotel was full and we were put in a smoking room but the next day got it changed, with no problem to a non smoking room with a wonderful view of the Bosphorus. The room was spacious, clean and had a lovely balcony. The fridge in the room was very welcome for keeping drinks cold. Staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful. Kemal at the concierge's desk arranged reservations for meals and the Chinese food in the Dragon restaurant in the hotel was fantastic- it was the best meal we had in Istanbul. There was an extensive choice at breakfast with a wide variety of juices, including fresh pomegranate or melon juice. The chef would cook eggs or pancakes, and if something wasn't available, the staff would get it. The Executive Lounge was one of the best I have been in. It was open until 11.30 pm with drinks and snacks available all day. In the evening, there were hot hors d'oevres from 6pm-8.30. Bulent and the staff looked after the guests very well. The pool area and health club looked very nice. Unfortunately we did not have time to try the spa or the Turkish baths. We had a very enjoyable stay in this hotel and would have no hestation in returning to it. We had a most enjoyable stay in this hotel</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It is becoming a custom for me, my wife and our 3 children to spend the last 10 days of every year and welcome the New Year at Hilton istanbul. we stayed from 21 Dec 2011 till 3 January 2012. We often fly to Turkey, and we stayed in many good hotels, but I can rate Hilton Istanbul, one of the best. The location is excellent and give a central ground for discovering the magic of Istanbul, a marvellous city, that I adore and love to visit all the time.The hotel staff are very helpful, and cooperative and very much assissting, and speak good english as well. The head of Conceige 'Yigit' and his team are very gentle and generous in terms of offering complimentary services in the hotel, and tour guidance. As Hilton HH member, I'm upgraded to executive floor, rooms with beautiful view of the Boshorus. The staff offers all the required assisstance possile, I can name Ceylan and Malak, and all others. The executive lounge is well taken care off, great servcie, tasty snacks, great food, local and international sweets, and hot and cold beverages are served. Breakfast has all the varieties that you may expect from 5 Stars Hotels. The room itself is very comfortable and has all the required amentities that is expected from a 5 stars hotel. Also, its worth noting that the guest service attends quick to any request when calling from the room. The house keeping is great and neat. We know, we will go back again and certainly, I recommend this hotels to the travellers who seek luxury, style, and relaxation</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A few things are dated, but overall a very good experience. I spent a week here for business. The location can't be beat, a short walk from Taksim Square and accessible to subway for farther flung destinations. The furnishings are a bit worn, but housekeeping does a good job keeping things neat and clean. One strange thing was my King sized bed featured two twin sized comforters, rather than one full comforter. Also on the downside were a tiny television, and fairly crappy internet service (@$30/day) both slowish, and sporadically lost connections. On the upside, the A/C worked extremely well, which I have not found to be the norm in Turkey, even at higher end hotels. I would advise reserving a Bosphorous view room if you can afford the extra Euros... the views in that direction are spectacular, and the rooms feature an actual open air deck where you can sit and watch the moonrise over Istanbul. A very unique hotel feature. Fitness facilities are in a separate spa (no extra charge for admission) including a huge outdoor pool area, and tennis courts. I didn't get a chance to check out the treadmill as I ran outdoors on this trip. The hotel is also on a lush grounds which permits some limited walks without even leaving the facility. Breakfast is quite a spread, if you want the big Turkish breakfast w/ Olives, cheeses, borek, etc, you won't be disappointed. I also ate at the Veranda bar one night, looking out over the Bos. Prices were not as terrible as one might expect. and food OK. View is unbeatable. C</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Amazing Staff - Personal Feel for Large Business Hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hilton Istanbul is a notable business hotel. My wife and I spent two personal days at the hotel before flying to Antalya for a week of meetings. Not only did the hotel offer outstanding facilities for our stay, but we were amazed at the personal attentiveness of the staff. While I'm a longtime Hilton supporter, the level of personal attention here was more comparable to a boutique hotel. Of the three Hilton properties in Istanbul, this is certainly the most conveniently located. It's just a short walk to Taksim where you can get public transportation. And there's always a bevy of taxis on que at the hotel. We reached the hotel in under an hour by taxi from Ataturk (very heavy traffic) and it was only 40 minutes out to Sabiha Gokcen. We had a number of situations during our stay to interact with staff. This is a longstanding hotel (actually, I think it was the first five-star in town) and you can tell that the staff stick around. Service was high level and very personalized. While it is an older hotel, it has been updated and upgraded. It is super clean - virtually spotless - and has also done a decent job in staying modern, which is hard for an older hotel sometimes. If you're in Istanbul on business, this should be highly considered. If you're there as a tourist, it offers you consistency of a well-known worldwide hotel brand that you can't get in Old Town. While it's not located in the historical part of the city, Taksim was actually a more exciting and vibrant part of town for nightlife. It was a great stay!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Truth - If I was going to Istanbul for a holiday, I probably would not stay here. It's more suitable for those on business or attending a conference at the convention centre next door. It is quite a distance to most tourist sights, although Taksim Square is a fairly quick brisk walk down the road (not to mention Istanbul's first ever McDonalds if you're interested in that sort of trivia). I did not choose to stay here. My trip to Istanbul was an "oh we might as well" circumstance as a family member was attending a conference. Plus, I felt far removed from the 'charms' of Istanbul as we did not get a Bosphorus facing room. My parents did though and the view was undeniably lovely, day or night. I have no complaints about the service. The staff were friendly right through. When someone in our group of travelers found a cockroach in their room, they even gave us another room at no extra charge! By no means is this hotel cockroach ridden though. It is clean and comfortable, but the rooms and bathrooms especially are in need of an upgrade. The look is undeniable dated, as opposed to "old-fashioned charm". I also had breakfast on the executive floor and while I heard that the regular coffee house' buffet spread was enormous, the selection on the executive floor was exactly the same every single day, so that got old very quickly. All in all, the Hilton is a decent hotel, but even they did upgrade their rooms, I would probably stay somewhere a little more central to the touristy sights. But if you're a regular or are there for business, why not?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from three nights at the Hilton and it was a good stay. The staff were helfpul and polite throughout the stay. I did request a room upgrade (I was paying 275 Euro's a night plus tax after all and being a Gold plus member I expected a better room) but as it was full they declined but offered me access to the executive floor lounge and included a free breakfast in the deal. I'd recommend not staying on the front (garden view) as the IMF building is in the proces of being built and the angle grinders can be heard most hours of the day. The building work is delayed and the workmen are on it all hours trying to get it done for 29th September. The restaurant choice is good enough with a Bosphorous restaurant, Chinese Restaurant, a Terrace Bar/Restaurant and a small sports bar. The Fitness centre has enough machines to work up a sweat in too and there's a spa to help you relax too if that's your thing. In terms of location it's fine, within ten minutes walk to Taksim square and ideally located for the ICC congress, I was working at the new IMF building and it was ideal for that, althought the jobsworths on Security made life hell getting into the building and made what should have been a 5 minute walk a 15 minute walk. I tried to book this place during the IMF and they quoted me 1000 Euro's a night, now I like this hotel but it's no way worth that. It amazes me that a hotel of this Calibre can charge the earth during a conference. I mean aren't they meant to promote tourism and industry rather than rip people off? I'll let you decide if the hotel is worth twice as much as the Hilton ParkSA down the road!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After booking a boutique hotel that tuned out to be youth hostel, I was glad to say to the taxi driver "take me to the Hilton". The hotel is expensive for booking on the spot, also they requested a further charge of 45 euro's as the room had a view. Although generally, unless you are bedridden, or you want to spend hours looking out towards a better hotel, football stadium, and a river backdrop forget it. The over charging is not only limited to the views. The mini bar has to be the worlds most expensive one. As two cokes, the smallest Toberone available to man comes in at amazing 35 euros. The indoor health club is adequate, along with the indoor pool, although you have to wear a swimming hat for the pool which makes everyone look like extras from the scifi series Space 1999. A good outdoor pool and tennis court give this dated hotel a bit of muscle. The location for the hotel is good, with Tasim square around the corner. Forget the talking bus with terrible commnentary, opt for a taxi to the Blue Mosque and hire a guide. Be on your guard at all times and be very aware of a nice looking bar near the hotel called Bazim City, it may look nice, but you will get a nasty surprise when you get the bill, unless, of course you are a Turk. Do not be tempted to stray off the main roads around Tasim after dark. It is not safe The hotel bar on the ninth floor has some solid entertainment, with bar prices to match. The Breakfast is good, but the usual scrum occurs around 9am, so get there early or late. The hotel is clean, the security is over the top, the location is excellant, it is good for sports, you cannot do much wrong staying here.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This luxury, older, but well maintained hotel, has many advantages over its competition. Although some hyper-expensive properties have sprouted near its enviable location at the best spot in the city center, they all lack the expansive grounds and balconies in every room, which the Hilton Istanbul has. There is a small price difference for a room on the Bosporus side, which is well worth it. The view of the water, the Asian side of the city across it, and the Big bridge are stunning. Having a delectable meal from room service in front of that view is a wonderful experience. The rooms are not quite as large as those in newer, more expensive hotels, but nicely furnished, and equipped with all the accoutrement that one would expect from a 5-star hotel, like the well stocked minibar, coffee maker, iron with ironing board, internet hookup, generous bath amenities, freebies on arrival, etc. The daily breakfast, which was included in the price was magnificent. The Turks really know how to cook, and the ones at the hotel outdid themselves. I could go on and on, but needless to say that our 4-night stay left us wanting more. What impressed us the most was the friendly, pleasant and respectful service we received from everyone we encountered among the large staff of the hotel, from the multiple, spontaneous greetings that met us each time we entered the building, to the impeccable room service. When upon arrival I inquired about the "mattress softener" on the pillow menu (all free of charge), a staff of 2 was in my room within seconds. I have traveled around the world, and stayed in hotels that are much more expensive, but I feel that the service in this one was the best.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at the Hilton Istanbul recently, looking for a short romantic and sunshine break. Short and sunny, yes; romantic- we didnt sleep very much but it wasnt because of romance! The hotel is surrounded by music venues and nightclubs, running until 0400hrs most nights we were there! Some reviews recomend various rooms but to be honest, we moved rooms three times and there wasnt any better than any other, so sleep wasnt a great option. Be warned. However, the hotel itself is lovely- the rooms and decor are respectful of its history as the first Hilton in Europe, the facilities are great, and the staff very friendly and helpful with advice of where to visit etc. The executive lounge provides food and drink throughout the day- quality is good, variation less so, but all in all a nice interval before going out. The hotel has a couple of restaurants- we tried the famous Lebanese one and the Dragon Chinese; both very good but in terms of value, the Lebanese wins. Eating near to the hotel is varied and considerably cheaper, but it depends on how far you want to go. Outdoors pool is large but sectioned off for "cabana" guests so dont be fooled into thinking that you can do some serious lengths! Also at the weekend there are some locals that feel that it is their right to move your stuff if you leave the sun lounger for more than a few minutes, and the pool staff wont stand up for you. Ignorance is worldwide so its not specific to here but it was a real problem. Keep your Kung Fu skills up to date as some of the locals were absolutely obnoxious. We used Hilton Honours points, so it was a good break despite the issues; However I dont think that I would recommend it at the advertised prices</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very comfortable, but expensive and service was only okay”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The good: The place is very clean, the beds/rooms are very comfortable and furnishing/renovations are generally new. I also appreciated the little details such as a pillow menu, and a bathroom mirror that doesn't fog up after a hot shower. The hotel is also very close to Taksim, which is a great place for tourists to be as there are many shops to go see. Also, it is close to subway that connects to other attractions such as Grand Bazaar, and Blue Mosque/Hagia Sofia, etc. If you like to eat, their breakfast is great. They have a lot of variety and quality is quite good. The Bad: Front desk service is not that great. On our first day, we came in early (our fault) so our room wasn't ready which is reasonable. However, the person told us it will be ready for in an hour so my wife and I walked a bit to town and came back in an hour. Our room wasn't ready and front desk did not know whether anybody was even assigned to clean it. After some back and forth, they finally contacted somebody and an additional 30 minutes later it was cleaned. Throughout our stay, I found front desk to be relatively slow in serving its customers even though I see staff idling at their stations. Maybe it was just a bad week for them, or maybe my experience was an exception - who knows. Regardless, one thing I did not like was the fact that wifi was extra. How can a world class hotel charge for wifi? Fine, charge them but donâ€™t charge an arm and a leg. It was so ridiculously expensive I donâ€™t think much people uses it. If given another chance, I will do some more research for another hotel in the same area. If the hotels I see in the same area have the same comforts then Iâ€™ll switch, but my experience wasnâ€™t so bad that I will give up the comfort/breakfast that Hilton has.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “overwhelming view - partly inattentive staff”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">the incredible and overwhelming stunning view on the Bosporus is just wonderful, perfect, amazing. Seeing the sunrise over the asian part of Istanbul is totaly great. My room was very clean and nicely equipped. Very attentive staff at the reception desk with easy and fast check in and check out. Fast internet connection. Having a glas of wine or beer in the bar, sitting outside in the warm night of Istanbul and enjoying the lights of this wonderful city, I guarantee, you do not want to got to bed. During the three days I stayed there, there were unfortunately some topics I think some improvement would be for sure not difficult or expensive but very helpful to make a stay in this hotel a perfect experience. As I said, the staff at the door, the bar and the reception desk was wonderful, attentive and nice, not so the service staff in the executive lounge at breakfast or in the evening. Interestingly there was no "good morning" or "how are you today?" I found the behaviour of the lounge staff in fact quite inattentive. One day I was only asked for my room number without any other comment. Please note that I am used to Asian hotels and likely the standard is Asia is higher than in Europe. Also it was my frist stay in this wonderful city in Turkey but with this background I have to say anyway that I found the breakfast selection was not very rich (small fruit plates were mostly empty and not refilled) and the selection of afternoon deserts were also very small and plates not refilled. No flowers in the bathroom and I missed a shaver and toothpaste. Given the price of the room these in fact minor issues attracted my attention, otherwise I would not raise it. I hope itÂ´s not unfair that I compare this hotel with Hilton hotels in Asia but doing so and in due consideration of the price level I rated "only" good.</p></li>
