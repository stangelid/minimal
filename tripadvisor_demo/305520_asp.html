There is no obvious con; however, it can be improved especially at old-looking lobby and improper ceiling condition. The room I stayed is newly renovated in traditional chinese style. The black colour interior makes the room quite dark. Also, at least one universal electrical socket should be provided in every room as a norm for business hotels.</p></li>

The only black point would be that at the Intermezzo bar they did not know how to serve a Vodka Martini, it took about three tries and they still did not get it right.

Completely incompetent concierge. Rooms ok, but very thin walls; forget sleeping if one of the neighbours takes a shower. Breakfast is not in a breakfast room, it is in a part of the lobby - exteremely loud and uncomfortable. There must be other and better 4 and 5 star hotels around Orchard Rd. Avoid this one.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is OK and provides decent accomodation. The pool area has a bar but doesn't provide any snacks or meals. Reasonable access for getting around Singapore. Staff OK but not particularly helpful. We had asked for connecting rooms as we have 3 children but had problems on arrival and initially were offered rooms not even next to each other. We ended up with rooms next to each other but not connecting but it took a lot of discussion to get there.</p></li>

The main flaw with the hotel is that it lacks atmosphere. It main customers seem to be business people staying for one or two nights. Not a typical holiday hotel.

They gave us a free baby cot which was very useful. Location of the hotel is its greatest advantage. A bus stop is by its side and an MRT Station is within 5-7 minutes walk. All attractions are close by which was important for us since we were carrying a baby in a stroller. Housekeeping was good. We got a nice view and a room on the 12th level. They have a small kids area and a good size swimming pool.</p></li>

We paid a little more for the room (not the basic room) and was well worth it as we were treating ourselves. The room was quite well fitted our with modern styling, flat screen tv, relatively spacious. The bed was wonderful with a soft matress & pillows.

Rooms are modern, bathrooms are marble and no signs of disrepair. Room service is good. No wifi but ethernet internet connections. Location is good for shopping, but if you want to head to Raffles and Chinatown - its a bit of a trek by foot. For those who use the gym - its impressive in comparison to other hotel gyms. Overall - its good value for money. I travel for a living and stay in 4-5* hotels around the globe and this is above average.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Faulty room keys a real letdown”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a good location on Orchard Road. The new rooms are well appointed. The defective room keys are a real bother, though. During our three-night stay, we must have had to change keys five times. We weren't the only ones. Staff confessed these keys to be repetitive problems. The breakfast buffet got a bit tiring after the second day. The hotel would do good to inject some some variety here. Our son got sick and soiled the bed a couple of times at late hours and housekeeping were quick to address these issues. Overall, not a bad stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel in good location on Orchard Road and short enjoyable walk to Orchard MRT station. Breakfast good though could do with a little more variety maybe change a couple of items some days. Rooms good size comfortable and very clean. Staff friendly and very professional at all times. Had dinner in the chinese restaurant food and service very good standard and thought price okay as well. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and had no problems would stay there again. E-mailed them before going requesting a non smoking room with a view and had room over looking swimming pool which was okay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel has a great location if you are in Singapore for the first time and want to primarily explore Orhard Road Shopping. The rooms have been refurbished what feeld like 1-2 years ago and are slightly worn - but only slightly. We had one problem - we had to ask multiple times for an hypo-allergenic pillow and doona. The staff appeared to have real difficulty in understanding what we needed and in the end we got more down pillows - not hypoallergenic.. A small glitch in an otherwise good overnight stay.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room is kind of small, clean enough but the carpet is a bit sticky. They have a fitness center with 4 treadmills and 2 elliptical equipment. But the cleanliness of the fitness equipment is questioned, I can see some spots like drying sweats. And don't use the Yoga mat, it's so dirty that I think it has to be thrown away. The fitness center is open at 7am but we can ask them to unlock it earlier. To reach Ion Mall, it needs 5 minutes walk. The hair dryer is the kind that gets too hot easier so we need to wait for couple of minutes to cool down before we continue using it.but they have iron, suitable for business trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The worst phone system I have encountered in any hotel in the world, and I always thought Singapore hotels would deliver amazing service. You cannot get connected to anyone -- concierge, front desk, room service, guest --- for several minutes -- as the meaningless voice when you dial keeps saying "Thank you for calling the Orchard hotel...to return to the operator, press zero" and then goes into a loop doing this whether you press zero or not. This is true whether you are calling for service from the room or calling from outside (in my case, from overseas). We chacked out 5 days early because of this. Simply infuriating...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Clean & tidy, I stayed on the executive level, pool is good. Not worth paying the extra to upgrade to executive floor for the few benefits. 1) Free cocktails between 6-8pm, but is all waitress service, 1 girl serving & the service is slow. Food is buffet type, and is nothing special. 2) Laundry to the value of S$18, however by the time u have put your T shirt & socks in you are over the level. expensive if you stay more than a few days. Handy for the shopping on Orchard Road & Orchard towers 2 mins away The room needed a bit of maintenance, knobs missing off the cupboards, sink cracked etc, not what u expect from a hotel of this calibre</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel is at the beginning of the Orchard road. If you are into shopping... this is the pace to be in. The room was comfortable and the washroom amenities were good.The view from the room is also good if you take the upper floors. The lower floors offer no view. The room service is prompt and the food quality is better than average unless you are trying to compare it with Michelin rated restaurants. The Italian restaurant in the hotel is highly recommended. There is a hard rock Cafe at a walking distance if you are one of the rockers... but the music was not at all rocking. There are many fine dining options available. All in all a value for money.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A well located hotel at the start of Singapore's Orchard Road shopping district. It is a 400m walk to the nearest MRT station but a walk that has lots of hotels, shops and people to make it interesting. The room was well furnished and it felt like it was recently renovated. It was comfortable, clean and had all the necessary amenities to make it pleasant. The only downside during my stay was the charge for internet access. While wifi is available throughout the hotel, it comes at an exorbitant $28 per day (without taxes). There is a slight savings for the 3-day plan but it is shocking that in this day and age, it is even being charged at all in a hotel of this calibre.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Singapore is an Asian city with comparatively less quality hotels for the price you are paying, so I was not expecting much. Orchard feels rather old, and lobby is dim. But compared to other business hotels I have stayed in Singapore, it wasn't any worse. The location of the hotel is good if you fancy a morning run around the hotel area, and to a nearby park and through some very nice residential area. Hotel is also on popular Orchard Road, so you can go out on a nice stroll to the shops and restaurants in the evening. Service is also good. Great friendly staff and efficient service. I would recommend this hotel for probably business rather than a hotel to stay on a holiday.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Okay, I had to stay in Singapore at the Orchard Hotelfor a few weeks while on layover. It was fine at first, but it would have been better with a kitchenette. Not wanting to spend a lot of money on dining out all the time, but also not crazy about fast food, it was hard to eat health in the room. The hotel has a pool and a men's spa includes with the room rate. We had to bargain a bit to get the breakfast included with the room rate. There's plenty to do fairly close. Lots of shopping, bars, and coffee shops. There's a tour desk set up in the back of the hotel on the 1st floor. The MRT subway is only about a 5 minute walk and from there you can pretty much get to anywhere on the island.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for a few nights on business, and it was fine for the purpose. In terms of visiting Singapore for leisure... unless you just want to hit the shops of Orchard Road, you might be better looking elsewhere, as the non-stop shopping/consumerism of Orchard can get a bit much every time you step outside the front door. However, it's still cheap to get taxis wherever else you want to go, or you can take a walk up the road to the Botanic Gardens for some peace & quiet. The buffet breakfast for the exec rooms had far less choice than would be expected for the size of hotel, and was a little disappointing. The pool area is fine if a bit characterless for cooling down after a day of humidity in SG.</p></li>

It's under going reno right now but we didn't notice it. It's got a very nice foyer, great facilities (gym, pool, hospitality room for late check outs, kids room and putting course), good breakfast buffet (with daily Vegetarian option, great for us) and very good staff. The only downer for us is that, as Honeymooners, there wasn't much and the room was on the small side. Having said that, the room was nice and cleaner, with a cut bathroom to boot. It's good stay for families (especially if you have kids) however I think it's probably best as a hotel for business travellers. Still we enjoyed our stay there. Ka.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent three nights here on business and hotel was OK but if you're not in to shopping it's not really convenient.Much more interesting to stay at a boutique hotel near one of the ethnic districts. The botanical garden is within walking distance and very interesting, you can also have a reasonable, delicious breakfast at the cafe by the welcome center. The hotel offered many buffets none of which were that good. Down Orchard Road there is a department store can't remember name but not that many dept stores in the area, but anyway you can sample all kinds of interesting local goodies while the local girls giggle at you. Kind of fun in a town I thought quite boring, no soul left. Too busy being modern.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for 3 nights and found nothing special about this hotel, except the good location. My room was located in the main building and in a pretty worn condition. I found some mold in the bathroom, perhaps still acceptable, but I would recommend some thorough cleaning. Stains on the armchair were clearly visible as well as many scratches on one wall of the room. The positive thing was a very helpful concierge. On one afternoon there was a long queue of customers at the front desk and only 2 check-in clerks on duty. I had to wait for almost 20 minutes. The check-in staff also made a stressed impression to me. I already stayed in many hotels in Singapore for vacation, but I can only judge this one as average.</p></li>

The suites are fantastic.......fantiastic....tv at the end of the huge bath..enticed my first hotel bath in many many years..the rain shower was heavenly....... Finally in Singapore got some value for money....but overall SIngapore seems to gauge how much you have in ur pocket when u arrive and leave you with 50 cents when you leave.... Living in KL am shocked by the difference in price ....but little if any in quality, in fact prefer Kl or indeed Bangkok., both have character and far more fun place to visit..........and 1/3 of the cost, maybe 1/4.......</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located at the Shopping freak Orchard Road, this star property was excellent. The employees were very courteous and helpful. Signature room was where stayed those three beautiful nights and as per Singapore standards, the room Took My Breath Away - it was marvelous. Elegant bedding and a great restroom. House keeping was remarkable too. When you are staying at Signature room, your complimentary breakfast is at the top floor of this sumptuous hotel unlike other rooms which have their Buffet breakfast at Lobby. Buffet Breakfast had something for everybody and coffee machine put up there deserves lot of accolades. All in all the stay at Orchard Hotel along with the warmth of Singaporeans made my trip a real pleasurable one.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 2 nights at this hotel (being stuck in Singapore due to the ash cloud in Europe). We got this at 199 singapore dollars from wotif.com (wot deal). The rooms were clean and the bed very comfy. The hotel had a gym and a pool which was great, and the location was at the end of Orchard road - so close to shopping. When we checked in we could take advantage of the internet deal and the breakfast deal - both quite expensive (20 dollars per day for internet! - These days I expect this to be included in the hotel room price) and breakdfast was 20-26 dollars per person - however you could go down the street and get a coffee and scrambled eggs for 5 dollars so we declined the offer. Good value for money and we would stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">travelled with our young son and we enjoyed the pool and really appreciated the hospitality room and play room on the last day as our flight was evening time. There were renovations going on but didn't bother us, and our room was one of the renovated ones which was fine too. Everything worked in the room and the lady room attendant was very friendly, more so than the front desk who were a bit average in their manner. Breakfast was good in the executive lounge, but we preferred the coffee shop breakfast for the second day. Good variety and taste. Always annoyed that some hotel still charge for internet. This day and age it is not a luxury anymore! Room cost everywhere in Singapore is always too expensive, but all in all a pleasant stay and would stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in the Orchard Hotel twice, both for 1 day/night. The staff at the entrance & foyer, are top notch. Nothing is too much trouble, and they are more than happy to accommodate your every request. The foyer itself, is centre pieced with a fascinating clock and marbled floors. The lifts are fast, and above, they are in very good condition. I have lost count of the hotels I have visited with nice foyers, but when you get into the lift, buttons are hanging off and the lift is grotty. Not at the orchard! Everything is gleaming clean. The only complaint I have, is the size of the room. It was a little bit small, and the toilet has a huge round window that looks right out to the bedroom. Just as well I was alone!!!!!!! That aside, the content of the room was all very good, clean and well presented.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here on for 5 days. A group of us were in Singapore for a week-long training course and our company picked this hotel for us. I've stayed in other hotels in Singapore (ie., Shangri-la, Ritz-Carlton, Fullerton) so compared to these 3 hotels I felt that the Orchard Hotel was just so so. The room was clean but service was not great. The concierge forgot to call a taxi for us one morning even though I had requested a taxi the night before. The same thing happened to someone else in the group, so a word of advice... if you're staying here next time call your own taxi! The breakfast buffet was average, nothing spectacular and I had to flag down waitstaff to get me some coffee. The location was right on Orchard Road, within a 5 minute walk to Wisma Atria. I guess if you're in Singapore to do lots of shopping this hotel is ok.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is one of those hotels that really stand out in my mind, in all my years of travel. The hotel, welcome, check-in, restaurants and food, hospitality, rooms, entertainment, staff and all round service was nothing short of remarkable. The location was perfect, walking distance to the High Flyer and the mall was part of the hotel. Three floors at that. The kids were free to explore the hotel and mall with the assistance of the very accomodating staff. The rooms were extremely spacious, very well furnished, and very very clean. On our last day we had to check out and our flight was at 2:00am in the morning, the night manager accomodated us with our luggage and we were able to take a shower in their hospitality room. I cannot explain what a pleasant and rememberable holiday and stay it was. I will highly recommend this hotel anytime.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked through booking.com and the rates was good with breakfst is inclusive. Since we arrived early, the fronkdesk staff has allowed us to check-in at 12pm. The hotel is located at the end of Orchard Road and walking to Orchard MRT is around 10-15minutes..It may be less than that if you don't have to carry your kids...The breakfast was good and they do served pork, so for Muslim travellers, you may need to know this. The only bad experience we had during our stay was that upon our return to the hotel after a long day trip, our room was not cleaned eventhough we've put the sign to request for the service. Therefore, we've to call the housekeeping but eventually no one came. So we have to personally look for the cleaner to get them clean our room. What a waste of time, and since we were too tired, it really pissed us. Other than that, the overall stay was just OK.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Been quite a few years since I had stayed here and I have to say, I was pretty happy with my stay. There is no need to go into details for room quality as I am adding some photos for your own decision. The hotel had updated a couple of years ago and these photos are for a deluxe room (I was staying with my kids aged 5 & 7). The pool is nice without anyone else around. There is a fun chess game (ground) if you are interested. The gym is of a normal size (but I am not keen on working out in a gym without windows). The lobby cafe is very popular with the lunch crowd, always packed with people. I will stay here again esp. 'coz of the location (convenient to Orchard MRT as well as variety for shopping and dining in the immediate area). Note : forgot to mention, the room does look nice and comfortable but dont expect 5* quality (e.g. the wall decor comes off the wall easily)</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here on a 3 night stopover going to Australia and 1 night coming back. We had two very pleasant stays, with a warm welcome each time. The rooms were clean and well equipped, although the room on the first stay (13th floor) was bigger than on the second stay (6th) for the same price. Carpets in both rooms were a bit shabby and there was a slight musty smell that you might expect in a high humidity environment. All staff were very helpful. We didn't eat in the main hotel restaurant as it was a bit expensive and found places to eat elsewhere. There is a Subway and a western/Indonesian cafe within the hotel building, where we had a meal that was rather disappointing. There was a small, quiet shopping arcade here, including a tailor where I had a suit made to measure (in 2 days if you want), at an excellent price and very well made. All things considered we would certainly stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 nights. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the refurbished hotel was actually pleasant and large, when we checked in. Apart from the location and the large rooms, there was nothing else special about the hotel. Pros: - Great location - Big room - Good service from the bell boys at the taxi stand Cons: - Air con was too loud - Air con kept fluctuating to be VERY COLD or just blowing normal air - Pillow barely had any contents to have a good night sleep - Standard blanket barely had any contents to have a good night sleep - Wifi was not free - I am not sure if the entire floor is non-smoking, but we had a non-smoking room but our neighbors were all chimney smokers. So we could smell it in the corridors and also if we are inside our room, standing near the door. Would I come back? Only if they had an internet special for under $200 a night. Otherwise, there are better places out there.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Orchard hotel is beautiful with very attentive staff. The daily buffets are a feast. Entertainment is good. My only warning is to watch out for deceptive add ons. I was encouraged when checking in to accept a $60/day executive upgrade. This was to include free soft drinks from the mini-bar and daily laundry up to $18/day. Also, access to the Executive lounge. Well when checking out I had been charged for drinking canned green tea from the mini bar and for cleaning services. It was explained that green tea was not considered a soft drink. And all of the daily laundry charges added on were because dry cleaning was not considered a laundry service even though it was under the $18/day allowance. Needless to say I was not pleased since at no time was there any mention that dry cleaning was excluded from the package or I would be charged $6 additional for each can of tea. So overall it was a nice hotel with very misleading promotions.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent a weekend at Orchard Hotel. I had a warm welcome from the front desk upon arrival. Our room may have been recently renovated as it looked brand new. Lots of activity in the lobby of the hotel at night--it must be the great bar and band! I paid $200 USD per night through agoda.com and it included breakfast and 2 movie theater tickets. They have a nice pool and I enjoyed sitting outside watching my kids play and swim while I drink my pina coladas and mojitos (thanks Donalde)! Breakfast was of good quality and I enjoyed the Indian food in the morning. Don't worry: there are Western and Chinese options as well! I got an excellent rate at an excellent hotel. For $22 Sing you can arrange a child's check-in: it includes ice cream, a teddy from Hamley's (a British FAO Schwarz-like toy store) and lots of little extras. It must be booked in advance and I wish I knew about this before I came as it looked like something my nine yr. old would have loved.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I got nothing much to say but simply fantastic! The rooms are spacious and clean! (Although the only downside for me is that there are not much international channels available to watch, mostly local channels only) I had a great time plunging in their huge and cozy swimming pool! The hotel staffs were all very nice & accommodating, always ready to welcome you with a genuine smile on their faces. The hotel is located right in the heart of Orchard Street, Singapore’s shopping borough and a place where you can easily grab a snack along the streets coffee shops & restaurants or get a bus or taxi should you need to go on a stroll around the city. In general, I would say that they represent value for money! But of course if you are on a tight budget you can get much cheaper hotel but the comfort and facilities that you get is not as guaranteed as the one’s like Orchard hotel has to offer.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent three very comfortable nights here for a conference held at the Shangri-la up the road. The Orchard was the overflow hotel, and though it wasn't quite up to Shangri-la standards, it's a fine four-star that fulfilled its function admirably. Rooms are clean, bed are soft and - and this is important - the bedding is very, very nice. I was on the club floor, so I can't speak for what happens elsewhere in the hotel, I was quite impressed with what was offered to me. The breakfast on the club level, and downstairs, was plentiful and more than adequate - right up to the standards one would expect at other hotels of similar standards in Singapore. My only complaint, and it's an important one to me, is that service on the front desk is painfully, almost comically slow. Check-in and check-out took much longer than it should have, and I blame that on an inexplicably slow staff up there. But this is a good hotel, with a good location, and there's no reason to hesitate to stay there.</p></li>

<li>The <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">breakfast</span> on the club level, and downstairs, was plentiful and more than adequate - right up to the standards one would expect at other hotels of similar standards in Singapore.</br></br></li>

<li>Check-in and check-out took much longer than it should have, and I blame that on an inexplicably slow staff up there.</br></br></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked two nights at the Orchard as a stopover en route to Australia. Specific requests were made for an early check in as we arrived at 07:00am following a 12 hour flight. The receptionist simply was not interested in this and advised us that a three hour delay was the best they could offer. There was no duty manager available to assist and despite repeated requests there was no way past this lady. We did eventually get a room at 09:30 despite a considerable number of people checking out whilst we waited. Surely Orchard management must be aware that the Orchard is widely used for stopovers and they must be more accommodating. After the initial problems we had no further cause to complain, the room was fine and very clean however watch out getting out of the shower as the bath side is considerably higher than normal and slipped getting out of the shower. The included buffet breakfast was excellent and the location convenient to shops and restaurants, the Hard Rock cafe is just across the road.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On the average the hotel is comfortable, food in the dinnner buffet is average and a bit pricey. I stayed for 2 weeks and when I decided to extend they didnt even accomodate my request for a bit of extension to check out late since I was working the whole day. The fact is that I was transferring to another room and the front desk people didnt even offer to transfer my things to my new room. They wanted me to check out physically and transfer my things to the new room. There was no courtesy given to me being a long staying guests. They should train their front desk people to think on their feet .When I got angry, the front desk girl just didnt say anything. In their dining hall room too, when u leave your table to get additional food in the buffet, they just take away your unfinished food plates. Theres evidently lack of training among its staff and employees. Internet is expensive and not free. Its best to reserve online with travel sites than reserve with the hotel, its very expensive (S$400) compared to S$200 online.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have been to Singapore on many occasions and on this occasion we only had a one night stop-over so we wanted to make sure we were right in the heart of the action and this hotel is certainly one of the best located as everything is within walking distance. Location is about where the positives end. We arrived at the 2.00 allocated check in time and had to wait about 25 minutes to get attended. We then did all the check-in only to be told that our room was not ready, it would be around an hour wait. I asked the check-in staff what time check in was and she replied it was 2.00pm. To which I then asked why our room wasnt ready. All I got a blank look of "I dont care" along with being told there is no room available at all in all of the hotel. I ended up asking for the manager who was extremely good and gave us an upgrade to allow us to check in immediately. The "upgraded" room made us wonder what the room we had booked was like as it was very ordinary in terms of size and decor and the terrible mattress. Another issue was that every time we needed to get attended at recption, the wait was at least 15 minutes.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Singapore was the last destination for our 7 day trip to malaysia and singapore. The city' charm already made us quite enthusiastic for the visit. Orchard road being the heart of the mesmerising town was our perfect choice for the stay. Our agents made our bookings in Orchard Hotel. Hotels location gives it a premium advantage ,as situated just next to the orchard road one can really explore the markets and showrooms within a walking distance. Within close by vicinity one can find restaurents like starbucks coffee, sub way and other big stores which not only provide you with basic requirements but other clothing brands also. There was also one very good indian restaurent which was probably run by Bombay offee House. Even the metro station is quite close by so one can opt to travel to places like china town and mustafa from there . Talking about the hotel aminities the interiors and room was really good. Room TV had video on demand facility.Also as we went close to Christmas eve hotel lobby was really a beautiful view. Food was also good and hotel also accomodates -TAJ restaurent on one of its floor. Overall the experience was excellent .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I originally booked a superior room (lowest rate) and the photos made it look worth it's rate, though photos of hotel rooms are seriously deceiving. I checked in and the hotel room was tiny, the ceilings were low, I felt claustrophobic so we upgraded to a superior room which was pretty spacious. The only problem we had about the room was that the closet door wouldn't slide shut (and the light inside the closet won't turn off--the closet is right next to the bed) but we called about it and it was fixed right away, so yeay! Room service food is OK, not fabulous, pricey, but good enough and worth it when you don't feel like walking a small distance to the center of Orchard road. Yes, a small distance, the Orchard Hotel is located at the far end of the Orchard Road shopping centres. Overall, service is good, superior room is tiny (don't expect to get what you see on the photos online), deluxe room is worth it and it only cost us about 32 SGD to upgrade from superior to deluxe (cheaper than booking the deluxe room online). Probably won't go back unless all my favorite hotels on Orchard are fully booked, nothing wrong with the hotel, just personal preference :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked a deal through Wotif. Hotel is in a good location but that is the only positive I can think of. The room was small, worn at the edges. Bathroom was even smaller and there were strands of long hair that did not belong to me despite the room just being cleaned. The staff are civil, its not service. At check in, I asked a member of staff basic questions which she could not answer. She proceeded to ask the front office manager presumably who granted a response but made no attempt to look at me or acknowledge me despite being inches away. The next mroning, an early departure meant I was down very early. Reception was empty. Duty person checked me out and that was it. I had to ask for help with taxis to which he turned on a light and then said you need to wait. He was not rude or anything but all in all, given their supposed 5 star rating, this was quite a gruff response. I would not recommend this hotel unless you can secure a really big discount. Have had much better elsewhere. There seems to be a problem with the 4 star / low end 5 star category in Singapore. It seems you either splurge and get the best or its budget and no frills with little in between.</p></li>

The second we pulled up outside the hotel we knew had made the right choice, our bags were taken form us while we checked in, we given a breakfast deal whilst we checked in, breakfast everyday for £7.50, it was the most delicious breakfast ever loads of choice to suit every taste. When we checked into the room we was suprised not as small as we thought it was goning to be, fantastic views, a lovely bathroom which had a cute little blind to pull down other wise there is no privacy!!!!!!!!!!, a safe and a good size wardrobe with ample space. The hotel does have a lobby bar, but we did not use this. The hotel has a shoping mail attached to it, which has a subway attached it plus a few resturants. The pool was fantastic, half an olympic size pool and gym with lockers, sun beds and a bar which serves drinks and snacks. The locatation of the hotel is outstanding right on orchard road, with shops bars and resturants literally on your door step, it has a planet hollywood and starbukcs 2 mins away. All in all we would not stay anywhere else in singapore.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our Christmas was spent in Singapore. Last minute booking at the Orchard Hotel was carried out in an excellent and efficient way. Our twin room had the additional third bed (cot) provided . The hotel was completely full but the staff were so helpfull under the conditions , well maintained as one would expect for a four/five star hotel. One drawback was the crowded reception and the dining room being filled to capacity at breakfast. However they provided additional breakfast facilities on he first floor to cope with the capacity. The orchard hotel for those who dont know is reasonable cost wise but has the great advantage of being at th top end of Orchard Rd and Tangling Rd. Excellent location for the "shopaholics" Sentosa Island can be reached easily within 20minutes (Taxi) or by Cable car which is a must do experience. Not failing to mention the world famous Singapore Zoo , and Night safari we actually spent 12 hours there with my children all very enjoyable even in the rain but...be warned exhausting !!! Universal studios also a must see but avoid any holiday period it is far too crowded often a wait of one hour for the attractions...advised to get "fast track passes (at 50$S)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Although it's on Orchard Road, it's not really amidst the shopping action. That shouldn't worry too many people, and it is only a short walk past the Thai embassy to Scott's Road, the MRT, Wheelock Place and ION shopping malls. The porters seemed to be there really to direct traffic only - not very keen to grab your case from the taxi. The check-in queue was a little chaotic, but the check-in itself was pleasant and easy (I didn't realise you could check-in at the club lounge if you book a club room). The club room was large, clean, and reasonably appointed. There was a small window only, but the view was a construction site, so nothing was missed! Breakfast was disappointing, and you are much better off seeking all the wonderful, wonderful food outside. The club lounge is great if you ever find yourself waiting for the cleaning service to finish with your room. The Nespresso machine makes the best coffee in Singapore... The gymn is also well appointed, and the pool deck looked very pleasant. A bit of a surprise at night was the group of girls on the corner of Claymore Road - and No, I didn't want a good time... Overall this was a reasonable hotel for the price on Orchard Road, but get your breakfast elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel has been partly renovated so be sure to book a room in the new Claymore wing or one of the club rooms. It is a fairly standard four star business hotel, the lobby has seen better days and so the bar on ground floor. We book a room on the Claymore floor and it was new and it had all the amenities you would expect. Also it comes with free wireless Internet connection which is nice. The location is very convenient but honestly I do expect more in terms of service from an Hotel of the Millennium chain or generally from an hotel in this price range. I booked online stating our arrival time and that we needed a cot traveling with a child, we arrived around 9pm at the hotel, I asked for the cot during the check in and I was told the cot was there, when we arrived in the room there was no cot and we had to wait almost 1 h for housekeeping to send someone... Staff is nice but most of them have basic English or /and seem very inexperienced. If you complain with them or ask for something they will smile at you very kindly but no one will do anything about it. There are many hotels in the same location as this one, I was unimpressed by their service and we so many options nearby I think I will try another hotel next time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My friend and I had booked Orchard hotel through a travel package with Asia Luxe. It was the lower tiered hotel, but since it had decent reviews compared to the others, we decided to stay here. Centrally located, about 5 minute walk (3 long city blocks) to the Orchard MRT stop, this hotel exceded our expectations. Check in was easy. Our hotel was in the newer section. The room was perfectly air conditioned, neither too hot or too cold. The bed was more firm, but comfortable. We could not here the crying child from inside our room (though we could here him in the hallway). The room and bathroom were clean. Good water pressure with 2 different settings for the shower/tub. Mini fridge, free bottled water, hair dryer, toilettries were included. The workout room was decent with several cardio and weight machines. Pool seemed to be a decent size but we did not use it. Buffet breakfast - included with our booking - was great and pretty much had a little of everything for everyone (American, Chinese, Indian). Check out was easy as well. Pros: Great breakfast, good workout room, location, comfortable room/bed. Cons: No free internet (was quite expensive, but can't remember the price), view was not so pretty from our room, slightly on the smaller side</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Orchard Hotel for four days and on the whole had a good experience. The hotel is right at the end of Orchard Road and therefore it is in a great location as you can simply walk down the long strip and ensure that you have not missed anything! The hotel is particularly popular with people on business and I encountered a lot of people who were staying at the hotel for business purposes. The pool area is on the third floor although with the hotel's prime location you may struggle to find the time to use the pool! The rooms although fairly small, are modern and newly renovated. There is a coffee shop in the lobby with a lovely bakary attached. The Hotel also has it's own little parade of shops attached although I would advise you not to exchange your currency in the currency exchange shop attached to the hotel as the rate is not as good as it is outside. There is a nearby convienience store which offers a better rate of exchange. There is also a Subway, an Irish Pub and restaurant attached to the little shopping mall to the hotel. On the whole I would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a comfortable and centrally located hotel which is reasonably priced compared to some of the more well known chain of hotels situated on Orchard Road.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found our room to be quite clean and comfortable with air conditioning that worked particularly well. I loved the strong hot shower and extremely comfortable bed with down comforter. Unfortunately, our room was located next to the elevator and was noisy beginning early morning. Make sure you request a room away from the elevator. This hotel is located at the end of Orchard Road, and a relatively short walk to the Orchard MRT station and the shopping malls. If you have little luggage you can take the train to and from the airport for just a few S$. A cab will cost about S$25 and take about the same amount of time -- 40 minutes door to door. (The MRT is an unbelievably cheap and convenient way to get around the island and extremely easy to use.) I have two complaints about this hotel. First, their business center internet charges are S$15 for 30 minutes which is laughably ridiculous considering we found a nearby internet café that charged S$3 per hour. In addition, there a small mini-mall just across the street that is absolutely teaming with hookers overflowing onto the street after dark. I did not expect them in this neighborhood (right next to Valentino no less) and taking an evening walk was like running a gauntlet. For this reason, I would not take kids to this hotel.</p></li>

<li>A cab will cost about S$25 and take about the same amount of time -- 40 minutes door to door.</br></br></li>
<li>(The MRT is an unbelievably <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">cheap</span> and convenient way to get around the island and extremely easy to use.)</br></br></li>
<li>I have two complaints about this hotel.</br></br></li>
<li>First, their business center <span style="background-color:#d0d0d0" title="p=0.999">internet</span> charges are S$15 for 30 minutes which is laughably ridiculous considering we found a nearby internet café that charged S$3 per hour.</li>

<li>In addition, there a small mini-mall just across the street that is absolutely teaming with hookers overflowing onto the street after dark.</br></br></li>
<li>I did not expect them in this neighborhood (right next to Valentino no less) and taking an evening walk was like running a gauntlet.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent 3 nights in this hotel Feb '12 whilst visiting our Singapore plant for 2 days. This is a very well located hotel with exit directly onto the fantastic Ochard Road. There are a large number of staff (some of which it is difficult to figure what they actully do?) so the level of service is generally very good. My colleague got a free upgrade to an exec room, he was lucky. My room was quite shabby to be honest. The carpet had several pulls in it, the furniture had worn paint patches and one of the plug sockets had a pin stuck in the live terminal, meaning it obviously could not be used, but was also potentially dangerous. The room "keys" are completely useless. I had to have mine reprogrammed 3 time in one day. "Have you had it anywhere near a mobile phone or credit card?" was the question from the young lady on reception. "Yes.........." . Probably 90% plus of all their customers have both of those offending items, so as a system it is not a very robust one. We had the buffet breakfast, in which the hotel has abviously tried to cater for as many tastes as possible. This was not completely successful from my point of view, as the "egg chef" did not recognise what constituted a properly cooked egg. Did not go hungry, but did not really enjoy it either. As with most places in Singapore the bar prices are ridiculous - over £7 for a pint of Heineken!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Orchard Hotel on 8-10July. The check-in was smooth and fast. The room was very clean. Can improve with air ventilation on the smoking floor (was abit stuffy on the corridor & lift area). I am not too sure how old is the hotel but it seems to be quite new to me and everything seem to be in working condition. The location of the hotel is considerably good. Although the hotel is located at the tip of Orchard Road, you can actually reach all the shopping mall / food outlet in few minutes by foot. Hard Rock Cafe, Tony Roma's, Modesto’s, California Kitchen, etc is just outside of the hotel, roughly about 5minutes walk. You will find 7-eleven next of the hotel. Generally, the staffs that we met during our stay (front desk, concierge, f&b staff) were friendly and courteous. We actually had breakfast (buffet) at the coffeehouse for both days. On one of the day, the coffee house was full hence they have actually opened up a temporary breakfast area (i suppose) on the 1st floor. Although the range of food is slightly limited, we were happy that we didn’t have to wait at the coffeehouse. There were sufficient foods to fill us up before we head out for the day. Getting a cab is very easy at any time of the day, especially with the help of the staff at the lobby. Overall, I was happy with the hotel, room and services. Would definitely recommend it to anyone.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am toying between a 3 and a 4 for this one but have marked them down. Although I have only stayed here a couple of times, both times it was in the suites on the executive floor, which have great decor in the bedroom and sitting room, whilst the executive floor service is very personal and attentive. What I don't like are the bathrooms - very dark as it is all black marble and an odd layout which means the loo has a glass door and is directly opposite the shower - not ideal if you and your other half like a bit of bathroom privacy! Plus they are also quite badly lit - difficult to put your make up on! On both nights I was actually woken up by the hideous smell coming from the drains - not sewage, but DRAINS. We asked for someone to look at it after the first night but it was still pretty niffy. The problem is that this is quite an old building so the drains for the bathroom are quite open underneath the flooring. Basically when you let the plug out of the basin or bath, you then hear it all dribbling away under the shower drain. Kind of annoying. But maybe, ironically, this is just the suites? The breakfast restaurant is a bit of a bunfight but the food is pretty good. Location is a good balance for tourists, between the Botanic Gardens and Orchard Road. But hmmmm....if I was making the decision myself...(my Other Half arranged this one), I'd probably try somewhere else.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location: Decent enough if you are into shopping. Located at the start of Orchard Road. To reach Ion Shopping Mall, it may take you a 10 minute stroll. Room: The room feels a bit dated - at least 10 years old. A wee bit run down with some apparent lack of maintenance (or the lack of budget for it). And when we arrived at our room, my wife was pretty disgusted at the stains in the bathtub. If that wasn't bad enough, she discovered that the room door didn't have a security latch, there were awful looking stains on the phone and the table next to the bed. Ok, no one messes around with my wife when it comes to this sort of "hygene" and "safety" issues. She made a complain and the hotel promptly (within 10 minutes) send the bell boy over with new key cards for the new room. BTW, the bell boy was one pleasant bloke and it kind of made it up for this inconvenience. Service: was within expectations. Overall, I would recommend this hotel ONLY for the following reasons:- (1) Its slightly cheaper than the other hotels located in the better part of Orchard Road. (2) If you don't mind paying more for a nicer hotel but the hotel rooms have been booked solid, (3) You are curious about this hotel and would like to try it as an alternative. (4) it has a decent looking lobby with a mini clock tower at the centre. Now, that's pretty cool until you suspect that the time in the clock may be a bit off.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We descended upon Singapore for a girls' weekend. Needless to say, spirits were high and to some extent, expectations were riding high too. Upon arriving at the Orchard Hotel past 6pm due to a delay in our flights (and to make matters worse, a quasi turbulent flight) we were looking forward to getting to the hotel, chuck our luggage, freshen up and head out. However, we were thwarted by our rooms being not ready. The queue at the reception area was long and from what we could gather, there were also many other irate customers whose rooms were not ready. The front desk personnel who checked us in was also unsympathetic and clearly, did not believe in service with a smile. Having said that she did inform us that she would upgrade us to the club level with club facilities. We were then invited for the evening cocktails and was told that once our rooms were ready we would be informed. We waited for what seemed like an eternity and finally one of the rooms was ready. At around 9pm, we were informed that the 2nd room was ready but when we got to the room, the configuration was not what we requested for. To cut a long story short, we eventually got our room at 10pm. The stay for the rest of the weekend was pleasant. If the hotel can get their check-in procedure nailed, it would be a perfect hotel for a stay in Singapore. Location wise, it is great. The Sunday dim sum (yumcha) was fabulous. The hotel is slightly busy in the lobby but hey, we can't have it all....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We brought the Wotif Mystery Price deal over the internet which ended up being the Orchard Hotel located in Orhard Road. The deal also included breakfast, free broadband & a laundry service. We were only staying overnight so we only wanted a reasonably priced hotel in a good location which the Orchard Hotel is perfectly located for shopping & entertainment just minutes from the major shopping malls, restaurants & Central Business district. Check-in – we arrived around 9pm so we didn’t experience any problems with our check in. Room – Our room 1615 was your typical hotel size room with a king size bed & a small couch & coffee table. The room was decorated in a heavy tone which made the room appear dark. A large TV, mini bar were also supplied. Bathroom – a large dark marble bathroom with a walk-in shower & separate bath. The bathroom was very spacious with a good makeup mirror. Dinner – We arrived late & were hungry so we eat at Hua Ting Restaurant which served Chinese cuisine. The food was totally overpriced & we thought to be very average compared to other restaurants in Singapore we have tried. Breakfast – Was included in our deal – it was sufficient but nothing to rave about. Overall – We had a comfortable night stay & thought the staff to be efficient & friendly. The hotel is reasonably priced compared to some other hotels in Singapore. It’s located in prime spot just minutes to everything. However, having stayed at numerous other hotels in Singapore I do prefer others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'd been to Singapore before in 1994, but stayed in the Oriental. That hotel was very good, but geographically, a bit out of it. The agent recommended this place, and on arrival despite the lack of welcoming staff and doors being opened for you, the lobby looked the part. It is attached to the hotel shopping arcade, which like so many in over-subscribed Singapore is a run-down ghost town. The room: Refurbished in contemporary theme, but with chunks knocked out of the woodwork and a dirty carpet. Kind of an Ikea vibe going on and unfortunately quality of fittings to match... We were told it was recently refurbished, but it looked rather hammered. Only supplied 2 bath towels & no hand towels. Our room loooked over 2 building sites and the refurb of the pool area. Pool: Shabby. Ancient loungers, ice cold water and looking onto the side of a building, hence little sun. They did however, site the 'putting green' overlooking Orchard Road, which was bathed in sunshine. Go figure... The biggest choker was breakfast. £12 each for a poor quality, limited choice buffet, in an ambience of cheesy plastic marine life. How they can charge 10% service charge on a serve yourself breakfast is beyond me. Location: If you like shopping & prostitutes, no problem! As soon as dusk arrived, it was Hooker central outside. Both my Wife and Daughter felt anxious coming towards the hotel after shopping, being looked up and down by some very dubious characters. In conclusion, we would definately not recommend, or stay in this hotel again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “dont stay at the orchard hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I work for an international shipping company. I have been staying at the Orchard Hotel Singapore for around three months now. This has given me enough time to evaluate the hotel and may I say that it is the worst hotel that I have ever had the displeasure of staying at. Please allow me to give an example, on 31st dec 07 at around 530pm I received a phone call in my room from the guest relations officer, informing that I had to relocate rooms because they claimed they were doing "rectification" on that floor, keep in mind this is new years eve. Disappointed I moved to another room on another floor. I went down to reception and spoke to the guest relations officer who ensured me that the rooms were undergoing "rectification" and that nobody would be staying in the room that I once occupied. So it was to my surprise when I called the room from my newly appointed "smaller" room and to my surprise there was somebody staying in there. The guest relations officer blatantly lied to me. The gymnasium is poor in relation to some of the equipment. The treadmills require servicing only one of them gets upto the speed that you select. the decor in the rooms looks tired, fixtures in the rooms need repair. Fire exits are blocked on occasion by room service trolleys or boxes and the doors that should provide you with a somke free escape are rotten at the bottom. The thermostats in the rooms that I have stayed in dont work. When I checked in they reserved 1000 dollars on my credit card without my knowledge. Overall A poor hotel with tired staff.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “What you'd expect from a large hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in the Orchard on return journey from NZ/Aus. Had two nights on the way out and one night on the return. Hotel is large and very busy, business travellers, airline crew, delayed flight passengers and many stopovers. Staff were friendly and the rooms were clean and well maintained. We were travelling with 3 children which the hotel couldn't really cater for. We had two rooms one double and one double with extra bed, on both visits we had to request the extra bed on arrival as it wasn't already set up. A little frustrating as we arrived late with jet lag and the kids were desperate to get to bed. It also meant that we had to split the family up, one adult in one room with a child and one adult with the other two in a different room. The food at the hotel was ok. Buffet style and what you'd expect from a large hotel - nothing special but plenty of alternative places to eat down the road. Location is good, right at the top of Orchard Road so if you enjoy shopping malls, you'll be in heaven! A couple of things which did impress us, my husband left a jacket at the hotel on our way out and 5 weeks later it was waiting at reception for him on our return trip. The pool was quiet and plenty of loungers and towels. Drinks very expensive though. A hospitality room and childrens playroom (very basic) were available for use after checkout but you had to share facilities with everyone else waiting for late flights. Overall, not a bad place to stay for a night or two but wouldn't recommend for anything more than business or 'stopover' accommodation.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Been here three times on business trips. Solid and sober rather than flash-opulent or dripping with breathtaking design. The well-trained staff are colour-coded for reception, meals & porterage. Everything works, but if something does not they are onto it asap. Well located for the endless Orchard Road shops. If a business traveller, take a screen break from your laptop and walk towards Tanglin Mall (a sort of Brit/Aussie bolt-hole) or to the Botanic Gardens in 15 minutes. Even the standard ‘superior’ rooms are well equipped. The 'de-lux' double rooms are larger but have the same facilities: big widescreen TV and bronze-tile bathroom. In the refurbished standard rooms there’s a bizarre transparent round window between the bathroom/toilet and the bedroom and although there is a blind for this window it’s a very odd bit of design. Internet connection for these rooms is an extra cost - very high. It’s included in suites. Orchard Cafe menu is international (with burgers) but also a sprinkle of Asian favourites and the cooking is good and the service attentive. Breakfast buffet at $28 seems expensive but has so much to offer you could skip lunch. (For $8 basic eggs/toast/coffee try Rockys, just out the door and turn left). The pool area is quiet and relaxing although it’s a city hotel so the view is just more high-rise concrete. The hotel banquet area gets a lot of weddings, so the locals must know something. The only real drawback is that there are no opening room windows. Even with the heat and humidity I think European visitors would like to open a window maybe once a day for a while.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Singature Club Rooms are Very Nice”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at the Orchard Hotel twice. Once in September 2006 for 12 nights, the other in October 2006 for 5 nights. In the first stay, I stayed in a 'Signature Club Deluxe' Room in the Orchard Wing. These rooms are very well decorated (though almost to the point of almost being over the top). The bathroom is great (including a TV over the separate bath), and the bedroom has a couch and LCD TV. In addition, the room has many conveniences including push button lighting and automatic curtains. All in all it was a pleasant stay, though I must say that colleagues who stayed in the 'ordinary' rooms were not as impressed with hotel. While I didn't see their rooms I suspect there is large degree of difference between their Signature rooms and their standard rooms.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">this is my 2nd time in singapore in less than a year. we then stayed in Golden Landmark hotel but this time we treated ourselves to a higher class hotel. we enjoyed our stay in OH. the only problem we encountered was upon checking in we have to wait for an hour coz the rooms are still being made. no worries since we arrived lunch time so we decided to tour the hotel and found ourselves several restos in the orchard shopping arcade (which is like a mini mall within the hotel) for our lunch. we then proceeded to the orchard wing (orchard wing has elevators separate from the claymore wing which is on the other side). we later found out the rooms have different looks and amenities. even if our rooms were both standard one room has: 32" wall mounted LCD tv, see through toilets with separate shower/bathtub, more storage for luggages, pool view, 4ft high mirrors. the other room we had: 21" LCD tv, no separate shower/bathtub. but then again, no worries for us. the hotel is around 10 minutes walking distance from the orchard mrt. but we didn't mind coz along the way you'll pass by several shopping malls, 7-eleven, grocery/convenience stores, money changers, pharmacies, restos, etc. if you want a hotel really near the orchard mrt you better stay at the more expensive Marriott Hotel which is literally just across the mrt station. we toured the city most of the time by mrt (so better buy that EZ card) coz it's faster/cheaper and at times we use taxi cabs. the hotel is just walking distance to the shopping malls along orchard road. contrary to what the other guests have mentioned, the staff were friendly and helpful. they have wide selection of foods for breakfast buffet but during our 4-day stay there the buffet menu spread was never changed. i will definitely stay here again if i come back to singapore.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice Singapore Christmas at Orchard Hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this hotel due to its location (Orchard Road) and because there was some sort of special deal for staying more than 3 nights. On check-in date, the affable duty manager Mr. Quam immediately attended to me when he saw that the normal check-in queues were getting very long, being Dec. 23 and very close to the peak day of the year. In addition, most of my room-related requests were all accommodated. Our rooms were done in very classy taste- one in ming blue, and the other in celadon green. Very comfortable and pleasing to the eye. Warning, however: if you stay on the 17th floor, make sure you DO NOT get a room right below the Signature Lounge. One of our rooms was unfortunately located below the lounge (on the 18th) so I, being a light sleeper, would be awakened as early as 6am by footsteps clack-clacking on the wooden floor above my ceiling. If only the lounge floor were carpetted, this would not be a problem; however, I was told that the design of the lounge calls for a carpet-free flooring. I was also told that other guests have complained about the noise as well. Other bad things: they charge a "service fee" of SGD 5.00 if you ask for a bucket of ice. On Dec. 26, they forgot to replace my bath towels and I had to call 4 times before they finally brought new ones. On Dec. 27, we waited 1 hour for our luggage to be brought down to the lobby. This is very undesirable; one could actually be late for his/her flight with this kind of slow service. One of the Filipino bellhops at the driveway had an irritating air and pretentious accent but the other Filipino bellhop was very pleasant and amiable so he was the one who got a generous tip from us upon checkout. Other than these, we had a nice stay (overall). Location is very convenient and in a quiet area of Orchard Road, but is beside restaurants, drugstores and groceries.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed @ the Orchard Hotel on several occasions in the past whilst visiting or passing through Singapore and have found it to be very good, not excellent but very good. However, on my last stay they seem to have dropped the ball. I stayed in an Executive room in the Ochard Wing which is the room grade I normally choose but based on my last stay, I think I'll explore other accommodation options. Firstly, the room tariff has increased to SIN$400 per night + 10% service fee + 7% GST. I think the Orchard is becoming a little expensive. Secondly, the executive checkout wasn't functioning (so I was told) when I tried to check out and I was told to go downstairs to the main desk. This didn't worry me unduly but one of the things I like about the Executive Club is that you don't have to wait in line to checkin or checkout. After waiting for 10 minutes to reach the front of the queue, I was told by the staff member that I could have checked out upstairs. When I stated that the staff member upstairs told me to come to the main checkout because of a problem, he didn't look very impressed and neither was I. Lastly, on each occasion that I've previously stayed @ the Orchard, I've sometimes tipped for excellent service and sometimes not if I thought it wasn't warranted. This last visit was the first time that I've seen staff on 2 seperate occasions obviously stand there waiting for a tip and not being at all backward about it. On a previous visit I had asked about the service charge on the room and had been told that tipping was not necessary as the service charge covered this aspect, and besides "this is Singapore and it's not considered to be polite". If you consider that the service charge on my room was SIN$40 per night, that's a lot of tipping value that's supposed to be distributed amongst the hotel staff. I like the Orchard but they need to pull their socks up in my opinion.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel was well situated at the top of Orchard road, a busy shopping street near the heart of the city. My family and I met with a greeting from a member of staff who swiftly relieved us of our luggage. The hotel had a beautiful reception area and whilst the reception staff were very helpful the check-in desk was one of the slowest I have ever observed. My family and I waited in queue for some time and for anyone suffering jetlag any wait becomes a considerable one. We were greeted warmly at the front desk only to be told that the rooms we had booked were not ready but we were able to leave our cases with the hotel whilst we explored the city for the next few hours. Returning to the hotel at about two in the afternoon we found that only one of the two rooms we had booked had been made available. It was not until 7pm that the second room was ready. The second room however lacked the extra bed we had requested for the extra family member and it was another few hours before a third bed could be supplied. Despite the disorganization with getting the rooms, I must confess that the standard of the rooms was generally excellent. The linen was clean and the room was stylishly furnished. They were well stocked with bath robes, slippers and bathroom toiletries. On the whole the accommodation was extremely comfortable. The only aspect to the rooms make up that I can reflect upon with less than praise was that one of the glasses left in the bathroom was dirty with an obvious orange residue. Perhaps this was overlooked in the hurry of getting the room finally ready. The Orchard Hotel has an indoor swimming pool and gym for its guests. The pool facilities even included a mini waterslide which the kids enjoyed enormously. Overall the Orchard Hotel is certainly agreeable. From arrival to departure it is a stylish and classy resort with an air of cosmopolitan charm. Though tailored more to the average business traveler, anyone heading to Singapore and seeking accommodation ought to consider a stay at the orchard hotel.</p></li>
