Like the decoration and atmosphere. Really appreciate the free unlimited Wifi access in the room. The only negative points were the small and dirty outdoor jaccuzzi, and the breakfast not included is quite expensive. But overall was a good experience</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visited in August, they come across as a boutique hotel. However, the rooms are really tiny. We had a room with no windows.

This hotel is pricey and best avoided. Choose another hotel for the same price any day!!</p></li>

Very nice decor, in fantastic shophouse in a quiet street in what is becoming a very trendy neighbourhood. Only downside, some rooms have virtually no window.

The room was small, but for a couple was just fine. The bathroom was good sized and had nice featuers. The room was clean! Didn't spend time in the lobby or bar per se, it looked like a scene.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a distinctive hotel, and not at all bad, but I think many travelers will not be entirely satisfied with its offerings. The rooms are comfortable, but small; the location is near Chinatown, but not all that exclusive; the lobby is dreary, and not welcoming; etc. The staff does appear professional and the restaurant is excellent. There are several other good restaurants within walking distance. I don't plan to return and I certainly don't agree with another reviewer that the hotel is "one of the best in this city."</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Scarlet is a nice small hotel with good service and in a good location. We had an executive room with a window, however, the room is small and not well suited for a stay over 2 to 3 days (or with more than 1 to 2 adults). The hotel is very close to food street in China town and the subway is not far away. Our room had a stale smell from the carpet and we felt the cleaning could improve. Our room whilst good was starting to show the signs of wear. We were on the 3rd floor and there was some traffic noise which was a little sleep disturbing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Well positioned near Chinatown and in walking distance of a MRT station this is a great little boutique hotel. You get a super-friendly welcome from seriously accommodating staff. The room we stayed in was not large but it was truly comfortable, although the street noise was a little high if the windows are opened. Maybe you can request a room away from the street. There is an excellent restaurant on the roof (but it's perhaps more fun to eat in Chinatown) and the breakfast menu is excellent. Will we go back - certainly, every time we visit Singapore.</p></li>

It’s extravagant kitch…with over the top froufrou décor - great fun. The staff were extremely hospitable without being intrusive or condescending. Rooms were good size. Very clean bathroom, good quality linen and everything I needed. I took room service for breakfast which was surprisingly good – coffee was excellent! The bar and restaurant areas are cool, cosy and intimate. A touch of Parisian style in the middle of China town, I’d certainly recommend staying here to my friends/family.</p></li>

This hotel is on the edge of Chinatown in Singapore. It is also an easy walk to Clark Quay. The rooms are a bit small but they are quite and comfortable and always clean. The bathrooms are very nice. The staff is always helpful and courteous. Breakfast can be expensive but worth doing until you get you bearings and find other places for your morning meal. Don't miss out on the roof bar for that cool evening breeze with a friend and a cold drink. Priced right I will stay here again. Cheers</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Been staying in Scarlet for 2 times. It is a very unique designed hotel with good service from portal to manager. stayed in lavish and splendid suite and these suites are gorgeous! If you want, you can request the hotel restaurant to set up a private dinner in your suite with extra charge. The location is near China town and within walking distance. Easy to get local food. There is a food court opposite the hotel. At the back of the hotel, Ann Siang Road, there are boutiques and shops selling some very special designer items, pastries shop, bars and lounges. Short distance by taxi to Orchard Road.</p></li>

The bed was comfortabe and the room clean and modern. Good AC Flat screen TV with english channels The internet was hard wired, worked well and was free. Wifi in the lobby Good location. Windowless sounds bad, but it makes the room very quiet and you don't have to worry about the sun waking you up in the morning. We did not buy the expensive breakfast, but there were not any good options close by the hotel for breakfast which was inconvenient. Friendly, helpful staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went there for the New Year's and booked this because I was looking for a "non-chain" hotel. Loved it. The staff is wonderful and the experience is personal. There suites are to die for but if they are not in your budget, try the rooms with balcony on 2nd and 3rd floor. They also have an open air Jacuzzi next to the "Soda". The restaurant serves very tasty food and the breakfast is great too with all the choices of cheeses. Basically it's a buffet + 1 dish from the a la carte. The bar is chic. The neighbourhood is really cool. It's where the hip locals hangout. Reminds me of the uptown Notthing hill.</p></li>

The location is fantastic if u want to get a different feel for Singapore. opposite to marina sands! Don/\t bother with the bar or breakfast. especially breakfast - yuck. plenty of good bars close by. best place is the PS cafe - less than 1 minute walk. the spa is also very grotty.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wow! We started our three week trip in South East Asia in Singapore and spent 5 nights at the Scarlet. Beautiful, perfectly appointed room, incredible atmosphere throughout the hotel, impeccably trained staff, and ideal location. Plus, for cheap and delicious meals, the Maxwell Hawkers Center is just across the street! (If you don't have breakfast included at the hotel, don't buy the very pricey buffet -- it is delicious, but way too expensive when you can eat wonderfully for $2 across the street)I would absolutely recommend the Scarlet, and hope to get back to Singapore, in large part to get to stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'm writing this a year late, but I still have only the best memories of our stay at the Scarlet. Service was prompt and cheerful. The food was lovely - those bread rolls, our set menu at lunch, room service steak and nasi goreng! Our room was tiny, but we hardly found it inconvenient as the bed was comfortable and everything was clean. I loved the ambience and the little touches that tied in with the Scarlet persona, from cheeky word play to warm red interiors. It was great coming home after a day of sightseeing or shopping to a drink or two at the rooftop. Never felt cheap, always classy, and worth it all the way! ;)</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here on a business trip to Singapore. The hotel is one of the smaller ones though very nicely done inside. The staff were very helpful and welcoming with a painless check in. The room was a little small though perfectly acceptable with good amenities. Breakfast was fine and the restaurant looked nice but given it was 4 minutes walk from Chinatown and a vibrant night market and street food, why eat there? It was also a pleasant 15 minutes walk to Clark Quay with lots of nightlife, riverside eateries and attractions. I would stay again (and am about to do so!). For around £100 a night I thought this was good value.</p></li>

After a number of phone calls to discuss, finally upgraded to suite - which was excellent and spacious, with a great balcony. The hotel is in a great location, and the bar and restaurant were good - breakfast was excellent. We will be returning in about a month - hopefully the check in will be smoother this time!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spend 3 days/nights in the Scarlet hotel during the F1 GP and I must say that I only felt pleasure. From the beginning to the end I have been taken in charge by the very friendly and professional staff with a high class standard. The rooms have a lot of character and are amazing.Top class bedding, TV and internet. The location of the Scarlet is really nice in the heart of the very pretty Chinatown. We have tried the top roof bar and the restaurant which are of very high quality. Really a great and unique hotel with a high standard which should absolutely be recommended to anybody who goes to Singapore. Not easy to find a hotel like the Scarlet.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A fabulous, quirky hotel in the best location. Smallest hotel room we have ever stayed in and next time will definitley pay to up-grade to a bigger room. However, the quality and location more than compensate. Would much rather stay here than the big, souless Orchard Road hotels (where we made the mistake of staying on our way back through Singapore). A few minutes walk to heart of Chinatown with night market and Smith Street food stalls. Also, opposite the Maxwell Road hawker centre - best place to eat in whole of Singapore for cheap, good quality, fresh food and spotlessly clean. Rooftop bar is a must for pre and post dinner drinks. A great start to our trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a proper boutique hotel that I would definitely recommend to others. From check in to check out the service we received was exemplary. We expected the room size, however, we were impressed that they had utilized the space so well - very luxurious. The breakfast was very well presented and good, both bars worth visiting especially the roof top one. We've been to a lot of good hotels internationally, many of which have been boutique ones and we thought it was as good as the Soho Grand.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I must say this is one of the best boutique hotel I've stayed in. I was here with a few friends for 3 nights to eat, shop and party till we drop! We booked this hotel due to recommendations from friends' who've stayed here previously and thru few featured articles in conde nast and other vacation magazines. We were attended promptly by the friendly array of staff. The room we booked was a deluxe and it was clean, comfortable and equipped with a selection of amenities. The rooftop lounge, Breeze, was awesome to hang out and this hotel is only a step away from Singapore's yummiest food court and Chinatown! Will definitely come back and recommend ! Thanx Scarlet !!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Scarlet Hotel is located in Chinatown on a quiet street one block off the main drag. The staff is super helpful with touring advice, restaurants and local attractions. The hotel is one block from Club Street, which is a chic restaurant and club venue. The MRT subway entry is nearby giving you ready access to the whole city. Our room was ample size, free TV, modern bath (shower, no tub). A breakfast buffet is extra at US$20. The ride from the airport is about 30 mins and about US$20. The rooftop restaurant is pretty but a bit pricey. There is a fitness center and outdoor hot tub. A daily newspaper (The Straight Times) appears each morning. Hotel decor is sumptuous.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A beautiful boutique hotel with friendly and helpful staff - especially the concierges- who knew our names even though we were only there for two nights. The rest areas and the bars are very intimate and rich in decor. Our room was very clean, tastefully decorated and had lots of individual touches like the fresh flowers in the bathroom. The bed was comfortable and even though our room faced out onto the street noise was minimal. Breakfast was a delight, take time, go down early and enjoy!! This hotel is on the edge of chinatown, the market is at the end of the street and there is a streetfood market on the next street adjacent to the hotel every evening both well worth a visit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Scarlet for 3 nights at the start of our honeymoon. We could not fault the service we recieved from the staff at all times. The rooms are on the small side, but they are beautifully designed and for 3 nights or so, the space is fine. The breakfast is wonderful, again with excellent service but also with superb food, with nice touches as some laska, and dim sum served on the side. The rooftop bar is a lovely little oasis, the drinks are pricey, but then this is true of the majority of Singapore, however they did have a happy hour period too. All in all a excellent hotel, great location, personable service and and the most wonderful air conditioned reception area!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having heard rave reviews on this "trendy" hotel, I decided to book it for my first trip to Singapore..boy was I wrong! The rooms were TINY, the bed was right next to the door and the bathroom was like a broom closet. There was no where to put luggage, or to walk around, as the hallway outside is also small and dark. The bed was comfortable enough, but like others said, the check in was delayed and there wasn't any real food service that we could easily access. Not comfortable. And the hill walk next to it is a nightmare, plus alot of cab drivers didn't know where it is exactly, so we had to haul that stupid internet map with us everywhere. Should have stayed somewhere else, anywhere.......</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent boutique hotel right on the edge of chinatown that's perfect if you want something with more character and value than the big 5-star places. We booked an executive room which was lovely and furnished with everything from large shower and bathroom to comfy robe (the standard rooms looked a little small). Location was great ... 50-metres from the bustling food hawkers' centre with a colourful array of terrific, cheap food, and only a minute or two from the other main restaurant streets of chinatown. It's an easy 20-minute stroll to the more upmarket Clarke Quay and riverfront area. Don't bother with the rooftop bar unless you're into expensive drinks and bar staff who are too cool for school.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The staff we dealt with we are very courteous, and happy to help as much as they good. We were taken to our room upon check-in and given a free drink from the mini bar, and shown around the room by the receptionist. Our room was quite small, but we used it only for sleeping so this didn't really concern us. The room was clean and tidy, and had all the usual necessities. The hotel also has a rooftop bar where you can sit out and eat dinner, or just have a drink. Our package also included breakfast which was a good spread and included Asian and western food. The Scarlet is a little bit out of the main city, but is within walk of numerous train stops, and the harbourside. Overall we really enjoyed our stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is being sold as a boutique property and meets most expectations. The bar and the overall look is pretty edgy. The service was prompt and efficient. Front desk was keen to assist us in planning our day out. Neat clean interiors fitted with most commonly expected amenities including a DVD player. They also have a set of DVDs available which you can rent for free. The only issue being the room size. Though comfortable ... its small. Do not plan if you are traveling with your family (2+). It’s a bit cramped. It is located in Chinatown area. Well located and connected (but then nothing's really far in Singapore). Food court and Chinese eating joints are very close by. China town market is v good for bargian hunters.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed at the Scarlett a few times back in 2005/2006. It's still my favourite hotel I've ever stayed at. Ever. It's 5-star in a beautiful-unique-different-than-every-other-5-star-big-city-hotel. If you're wanting luxurious this is it! It's romantic, so business conferences should go elsewhere. Best Parts- the toiletries! I know, an unusual thing to list first. But they are amazing! The fabrics used all over the hotel are rich, luxurious, and just utterly beautiful. Rooms are huge and all unique, so if you don't like the layout of the first one you see ask for another. So-So parts- if you want a bathtub you have to go above the basic room. I love this place....every 5-star I've stayed at since all over the world has been compared to the Scarlett. So far, nothing has beat it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had originally booked a standard room with no window for a short two night stay but got upgraded to a suite ( you can imagine my excitement). It was beautifully decorated, comfortable and enough space to spread out your luggage and belongings. The service was great, staff were always polite and helpful. The hotel is in a very convenient location, close to China Town and the business district and a short walk to Chinatown MRT station. It is also next to what is arguably one of the best hawker centres I've visited in Singapore- Maxwell Food Centre. You must try the Hainanese Chicken rice! The hotel is also situated right next to Ann Siang Rd & Ann Siang Hill where you will find funky boutiques and a great cafe called Shots. Have a wonder around- there are also lots of a cute little restaurants.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our room in the hotel was without a window as well. We had no idea that we had previously ask for a window. But when we arrived there and we saw the room we immediately asked for it but we did not get it. Anyway, the lack of window was not the worst, since we have been given a room with a strange ceiling, which was made of glass(???) probably and when at night the rain began to fall we woke up in a horror as we thought that we were under attack because of the terrible noise the rain made on the ceiling. the second night we got used to it. The buffet breakfast is very good as well as the room for freshin-up when you have checked out hours before and you have returned to collect the baggage. That room was a great and a very useful surprise!! P.S. I have not understood the criteria for some hotels to be named "boutique"hotels</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great place for a weekend in Chinatown!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had two nights in Singapore and loved it here. We had previously stayed at a couple of large comfortable 5 star chain hotels -- and they were fine. But we loved this one for being right at Chinatown which we thought was a good place for venturing in and out. The hotel itself was smaller than the big chains, and we found the service friendly and personal the whole time. We stayed one level up from the basic room -- it was actually big and very comfortable. It did not have a window but for us here, that didnt matter -- and staying in Chinatown meant that we werent looking for a river view or staying in the room anyway. So I understand the problems of some of the other reviews if you do find yourself in small windowless rooms -- all that we can say is that we found we had a very good room in a great location at a good discount price.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Scarlet is full of character. A small, boutique hotel, it has friendly staff who catered for all our needs. Upon check in, we were assigned a room without a window - beware of these if you like some fresh air! We returned to reception and we were immediately swapped into another room. While the rooms are on the small side (I prefer to call them cosy), there is plenty of room for a short stay. The rooms are very well fitted out and come with free internet. The bathroom only has a shower and was starting to show a little wear - a bit of a refurbishment maybe necessary in the not too distant future. The hotel is in a fantastic location and there are some very cool, local restaurants and bars within easy reach. The hotel also has a nice roof top bar for a singapore sling at sunset. Breakfast was included and most food options were available.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We know this hotel from traveling books so we decided to try it. It is indeed a special boutique hotel like the SAFF but even better! When we get in, we feel so relaxing. The lobby is like a night club where you think you will have a great time. The club street is just behind the hotel so we feel the vibration of the music and kind of worried about our sleep quality. Luckily our room is very far away from the front desk so we didn't feel anything at all. The soundproof is really good. Our room is facing the elevator but I can't hear any noise at all. The room is small but we spent whole day outside and get good sleep at night. The location is perfect. The famous Maxwell Food Center is just less than 5 minutes walk. There are plenty of Asian food for us to try and the price is surprisingly low! We will come back to this hotel next time if we have chance.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for one night and were not very impressed. The hotel is a design, boutique hotel, but it is dark, seems already a bit worn and does not feel very welcoming. We stayed in one of their window-less rooms, which felt a bit like being in someone's basement and was quite overpriced for a small room that felt very tight and did not offer much comfort. Besides the fact that Singapore is quite humid, the lack of windows in the room and the bathroom might explain the smell of humidity in the room. The hotel was recommended to us by friends who stayed there some years ago, but I have the impression it might have been hip at the time and now it just looks worn. The 7-Eleven and the food court that are right next door turned out to be quite convenient, but for a short stay in Singapore, I would choose a more central location closer to Orchard Road.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One of the most beautiful hotels we have ever stayed in. Everyone should at least spent one night in this hotel. Anyone sensible will at most spent one night in this hotel. Beauty in its purest form,every detail artfully crafted, a real showpiece. A pity though that the rooms are tiny. And when I say tiny, i really mean tiny. Perfect for an overnight stay or a person alone. A no go for a multiple days stay. The rooms are so tiny, you don't want to spent any moment not sleeping in them. If you reserve a room, specify you do not want a windowless room, unless you have a fascination for dungeons. Two negative experiences during our stay : - I forgot some personal effects in the room. Called the hotel three times, was promised a call back every time. Call never happened. - Beautiful open air restaurant at the top floor. However, massively overpriced and simply bad service</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at The Scarlet Hotel in Singapore for 3 days on our way to Australia & 1 day on way back. Bliss after a 13 hour flight from the UK. Staff very friendly & went out of their way to make us feel comfortable - including having our room ready at 8am in the morning. Rooms superb, bed comfortable & room immaculate cleanliness with all the freebie toileteries. Don't forget to have a drink (or dinner if you are feeling extravagant!) on the roof top of the hotel - what a view! Try the Maxwell Hawkers centre just opposite the hotel for brilliant local food. Chinatown a few mins walk away. The MRT (tube train) just around the corner so very convenient for getting about. Local buses quick, cheap & bus drivers happy to let you know where your stop is. One pointer - taxi drivers don't seem to know the Scarlet Hotel that well, so have the address to hand when you hail a taxi.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was our 2nd stay in Scarlet. On both occassions, it was to celebrate my husband's birthday. I guess this hotel is not for everyone. If you are very particular about room size, surroundings, nice view from the windows, convenient parking, pool and facilities then Scarlet is not for you. On both occassions, the front desk staff brought us up to the room and even carried our bags. After unlocking the door, they navigated us around the room. Being a boutique hotel, the hotel have compensated by providing a great service and a comfy room perfect for a romantic night stay. The beddings, the furnishings and the lightings definitely adds to the mood. On both stays, we received a personal-size complimentary birthday cake. We were definitely not twice bitten therefore not twice shy. Will look forward to staying there again for a romantic night's stay. Cheers, Marina + Johaness</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked a night at one of the premier rooms for my girlfriend's birthday. Really Chic. Was a tad disappointed at first though coz the premier room that i saw earlier at the ground floor was quite a fair bit bigger than the one that i got. (I was later told that all the rooms are different) Nevertheless, it still looked very nice and had a balcony (which the bigger room did not, though there was'nt much of a view) A few gripes which concurred to some of the other reviews i read though. First of all, the aircon was really rather noisy. Also the soundproofing isn't all that great, so you can generally hear some sounds from the floor above. Despite that, i still think the scarlet's worth staying. The service was great and the decor excellent, from the corridors to the reception desks to the restaurant. There's even a nice rooftop bar which offers pretty nice views. We enjoyed ourselves there.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Travelling from Australia to Asia or to Europe, Singapore is often a stopover point. Previously we have always ended up at a massive hotel, including some of the ones listed in the top rankings of trip advisor. The pricing of these is a bit silly if staying for less than 24 hours. This time we were looking for something a bit boutique. The Scarlet was perfect for an overnight stop and excellent value. The staff were very acommodating. The food markets across the road are also good to grab a late night snack amongst the locals. The rooms are TINY. However the fittings and finishes are great and the ambiance is pretty cool considering the rest of Singapore (from what we have seen) is a little teflon coated. The only down side was the water pressure in the shower, the simple breakfast and the only window in the room was a skylight. Notwithstanding we would DEFINITELY stay here again for a one night stop.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from an 8 night break in Singapore. My husband had stayed a few times at the Scarlet on business from 2009,and always said it was a hotel i would enjoy to stay in. We booked it for Oct 2011 as part of my birthday treat. The hotel is situated in chinatown and 5mins walk to MRT so getting around the city was really easy, even getting to the zoo using MRT and public transport buses was stress free. The hotel has a lovely relaxed air about it the staff were polite and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived ( we looked anxious i am sure as our luggage had not arrived on the same flight as us ) they had our room ready for us at 9.30 am and not 2pm as quoted in the tarriff. We had opted for a premium room and we were not disappointed , it was spacious and light and decorated to a high standard. The bed was very comfortable . Hope we get the chance to travel to Singapore again and stay in the beautiful Scarlet</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were really disappointed with the hotel stay. It is our 6th yr anniversary and my hubby decided to check in the premium room as a surprise for me. He even brought his camera hoping to take some photos for us. In the end, we did not even bother to take any pic. 1) The toliet door was damaged. 2) there was a dead crockache in the toilet. In the morning, I spoke to the housekeeper. She came in, saw the crockache and went on saying like hey there is a crockache. Then she left the room and went ahead with other room service without doing anything. I was so disappointed. And my hubby commented that the crockache is still alive. There were ants all ard it. I wanted to take a photo and post it online but i realise that there is seriously no need to do that. Because who will wanna take such photo !!! 3) we also order room service. Seriously, it is overpriced and the food is only so-so. Overall, the celebration was spoilt by the bad stay in scarlet</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Charming hotel - Shabby room”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Scarlet itself is a charming hotel in a great location in Chinatown with easy access to downtown. Our room in particular was a little worse for ware in need of a paint job and a shower refurbishment. We paid for the smallest room available so while the room was teeny- they really made efficient use of the space. I was impressed! We had a cute balcony that opened up the room a bit so it didn't feel as enclosed. The bedding is wonderful and you will get a deep and restful sleep - guaranteed. The bar/restaurant are very hip and happening as is Club street nearby. We spent 2 nights in Singapore and 2 nights on Sentosa and paid the same price for both hotels. The Scarlet was definitely the loser in the value for the price. That being said, I did poke my head into other rooms as they were being cleaned and they looked NOTHING like ours. They were spacious and beautifully appointed. So when staying here, make sure you know what room you are selecting:)</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading mixed reviews on this hotel, I decided to take a chance and book anyway, and never regretted a thing. The hotel is a little out of the way compared to many of the larger hotels, but that adds to it's charm. The decor inside is fabulous, a rich mix of dark colours interspersed with bright red. Check in was simple, with the added touch, that the person who checks you in escorts you to your room, pours you a drink and shows you around. We were staying as part of our honeymoon, and were treated to a big plate of fresh fruit and strawberries dipped in chocolate. The hotel is right on the edge of Chinatown, and within easy reach of 2 MRT stations and easy access to a taxi. The food was exceptional, if a little arty, and the restaurant and staff were brilliant. The concierge (huge bloke) was always on hand to give you directions and advice and tips as to where to visit and how best to get there. A very quirky, very fun and very friendly hotel!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place was really lovely! My boyfriend and I booked a room at The Scarlet for two nights before going on to Bali and I was so glad we did. The hotel is small, but the staff are really competent and the attention to detail excellent. The plus points: breakfast is great! The location is excellent; right in a really pretty area of Chinatown with lots of interesting places to eat and shop within walking distance. The rooms were very clean and furnished beautifully, and the staff were attentive and nothing was too much truble. The prices were reasonable and the free internet in the room was a big plus. The bad points: The only bad point really was that the room was very small, and after reading other reviews I think this is the case throughout the hotel. However, the space was really well designed, our room had a lovely balcony and it didn't feel cramped; just compact. However, it was not really any smaller than the average hotel room in London. My advice is to give The Scarlet a go!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a lavish experience worthy of a far greater price. After staying in many hotels in Asia over the past 18 years this has to be the friendliest luxury hotel ever. The interiors design and colours are mood evoking and stunning to be amongst. The breakfast not a vast choice but totally satisfying with service at its best. It is truelly a boutique hotel where every detail has been thought about. To be able to have access to a shower 6 hours after checking out before going to the airport for free is such a great add on. The room was imaculate and roomy enough. The bed was perfect and the quietness hard to believe. Being able to stroll into the character parts of old China town and check out the trendy small night spots and shopping made life easy and exciting. No wonder its an award winning hotel. I will definitely return next year to this same beautiful hotel. Treat yourself to such opulance. You wont regrett. No photos as the online website shows it so well. Its every bit as good as it looks.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in the Scarlet Hotel for two nights and we thought it was a great alternative to the faceless business hotels in the city centre. I must admit the rooms were small, but we felt they fell into the "perfectly formed" category of that particular descriptive term. We loved all the small touches in the room which are never usually present in a larger establishment. We particularly liked the CD that is left in each room with tunes representing the "feel of the Scarlet Hotel". The inclusion of a DVD player was also a bonus. The staff were incredibly kind and helpful, but what we liked most of all about this hotel was its location. China Town is a great place to be in Singapore. There are loads of dining options and interesting markets to wander around in the evening. The hotel is a 2 min walk from Food Street where you can try out lots of different cuisines at brilliant prices (including German sausages). Also a 2 min walk is the bus stop for the Singapore bus tour. We felt it was a great place to be based, and will definately return on future visits.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We generally like to avoid larger, chain hotels and prefer smaller boutique hotels such as the Scarlet. It has a jacuzzi, a couple of bars/restaurants, and a gym. So the Scarlet was really suited. What a great first impression of Singapore - on arrival at the Scarlet Hotel we received genuine, friendly, helpful service, and were really impressed with the room. We asked for a quiet room on booking, so they put us right at the end of the hotel - had a great sleep, the bed was super comfortable. The rooms are actually quite luxe, and I have to rate the shower as the best I've ever experiened at a hotel. The previous review to mine is really accurate. Free high speed internet = bonus. The Scarlet is opposite Chinatown, and next to the Maxwell Foodcourt - pop over there for authentic Asian food, we paid less than $15 for dinner for two, and picked up some beers for the Jacuzzi later. ~$18 cab to the Singapore Zoo. The rooms are smaller, but we we expected this, we booked a room with a balcony so the size is not so noticeably. Overall an excellent experience that I would recommend - business or couples.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel stay was the result of a search for a hotel in Singapore that was not a concrete tower but also was reasonably priced. The search resulted in a booking that was well priced and at an establishment that was a little out of the way, in a quiet area and had very good facilities. We arrived after a long flight from Barcelona early morning (0700hrs) and our room was not available. After a few hours wait during which we had breakfast and a walk around the area we returned dead tired and were offered a superior room to that booked. This room was very well appointed and very quiet. We found the staff most attentive, the hotel facilities excellent and the location very good being near to Chinatown and other attractions on that side of the city. It is close to some boutique restuarants in nearby streets that are quite expensive and a fair walk to Clarke Quay where the resturants are also very pricey and charge for the most trivial items that are gratus at most others eg. serviettes etc. I would stay there again and enjoy the surrounding shopping and local street resuarants where great food and beer is available at low prices.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Scarlet is a fantastic small hotel. We booked an executive room through Expedia and asked for a room on the second floor to guarantee a window as apparently some rooms dont.The staff were friendly, the rooms clean and the toiletries options were endless. There is an outdoor jacuzzi pool on one floor which was big enough to cool down after a hard day shopping.The restaurant upstairs had a superb view over Singapore, but the food had a European influence and we wanted the local fare. The bar downstairs was very comfortable and 'cool'. The cocktails were a bit expensive for the quality, but we still managed to sip a few during happy hour.... :-) The location for us couldnt have been better and it was directly across the road from one of the best hawker centres in Singapore.(Queue up with the locals for the chicken rice from Tian Tian stall....) It was also a 4 minute walk to the touristy shopping streets of Chinatown with again more food and great buildings. There is a seven eleven underneath so you can buy anything from shoelaces to instant mashed potato should you need it....We liked it so much we booked it a second time on the way home..</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went into staying at the hotel with a grain of salt after reading a few reviews about how some of the rooms were a tad small. We were pleased when we were given a decent sized room with windows (we had booked an executive room). We arrived in the wee hours of the morning and the staff were helpful, so we begun with a good impression. The room itself was lovely. I loved the decor and as we had arrived early in the morning (6am!) we immediately went to bed and found it easy to sleep with the black out curtains. The bathroom was also lovely! The location was great, right in the middle of Chinatown. We found ourselves wandering around each day and always found something to entertain us. Food was always available, yummy and very cheap. The hotel was also close to temples so it was easy to do the "tourist thing". The hotel also had free adsl which was good as we had brought our laptop. The free net is not wireless though. I could not fault the hotel whatsoever. I'd recommend it to friends/family (and advise to book the bigger room) and I would stay there myself again. I travelled and stayed there when I was 22 weeks pregnant and it was extremely comfortable for me.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Scarlet Hotel is aesthetically a joyous experience. The entrance alone is wonderfully unique, and the staff are impeccably mannered, as seemingly most people in Singapore are. The executive room (303) with a balcony was quirky, beautiful, clean and romantic, with a colonial and homely ambience. The lighting was warm and cosy. The shower was hot and powerful. I couldn't have liked it more. Perhaps the only 'cons' were related to the small size of the hotel, rather than a deficiency in it as an organisation - Namely, the lack of a pool (there is a rather cold outdoor jacuzzi) and the tiny size of the gym (very limited free weights or racks for serious training). Overall: Highly recommended - I can only speak for the balcony room I had, but it is a serene, 'value-for-money' experience in a hotel that successfully attempts to be sensual and luxurious in an entirely unique fashion (unlike most standard 4 or 5 star 'chain' hotels). The staff were courteous and helpful. The location 'out of town' in the southern Chinatown area is much more authentic than I imagined, and the local food markets are simply the best place to dine in the warm open air at affordable prices.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great boutique hotel in excellent location”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights last October on our way back home from Europe. The room was small but beautiful and functional; the bed was very comfortable. Most importantly, given our jet lag, the room was very quiet and we had no problems sleeping in till noon. As you would expect in Singapore, the service was excellent. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. There are many nice little touches - such as delivering a full ice bucket to your room just in time for cocktails each afternoon. We did not eat at the restaurants, choosing instead the very cheap and cheerful Maxwell Road Food Centre just across the road for most of our meals, but the downstairs and especially the rooftop bars are great. The location is perfect - Chinatown is an interesting area and - interesting for the gay travellers - it seems to be a bit of a gay enclave too with several friendly gay bars in the area. There is an MRT stattion just a short walk away which can whisk you downtown and then an easy connection to Orchard Road, and it is a relatively direct and very cheap taxi ride to the airport. We had a great stay at this fine hotel and would happily stay there again. We were very satisfied</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have read some great and some very negative reviews of this hotel so needed to add to them! The hotel is tiny, but I already new it would be as it quite clearly states SO on the website that it is a collection of tiny little shop's. It set just outside the city centre in China town which was for us absolutely perfect. I have also seen that someone said they had to wait after 4pm to check-in. We arrived at 7am and would quickly checked in and helped to our room. The rooms are as small as we had guessed but so well planned and finished to the very highest standard. If you want the size of a big hotel chain, then stay in a big hotel chain. If you want to walk into a truly glamorous, opulent and perfectly designed 'boutique' hotel where people know your name and are able to recommend local restaurants, The Scarlet fits the bill. We stayed for 3 nights as a stop over to Bali on our honeymoon. The size of the rooms means that I wouldn't recommend it to people stying for 2 weeks, but most people don't stop that long in Singapore. We will without question be back to The Scarlet the next time we stop-over in Singapore, if not for the hotel ambience, but for the roof top bar's Singapore Slings and the Eggs Benedict in the morning!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A Sophisticated Boutique Hotel for Non-tourists”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Scarlet is a sophisticated boutique hotel for non-tourists. It is everything I expect in a world-class boutique hotel: location reflecting the character of the city, small number of rooms (not a corporate compound), personalized service, interesting architecture, intentional interior design and unique feel, useful luxurious amenities, attention to detail. The service was personalized. There was someone to open the doors for us, smiled and greeted us as we walked in. They were courteous at the front desk and whenever we called from our room. They offered us to walk in front of them and insisted that we always leave the elevator first. The location was perfect for us, within easy walking distance to two MRT rail stations (Chinatown or Raffles Place) and also convenient for taxis or buses. Also across the street was the legendary Maxwell Food Centre which had the best (and cheapest) "street food" in the entire country. Pros: VERY comfortable beds, Free fast interenet access (other hotels charged $10 or more per day), very nice slippers (see photo), close to MRT and Maxwell Food Centre, free newspaper daily, complementary water and Limonata drinks on our first day, hardwood floors in the entry. Cons: rooms a bit small (but no smaller than average rooms in Singapore)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading a number of reviews on trip advisor we checked that our room had a window, which it did, a very big one. when walking in the room we realised what everyone meant we could litrally open the door and flop onto the bed. The bathroom was very small but was very luxurious. We did have a few problems with ants on our first day but after mentioning it to the staff by the time we came back from a spot of shopping they had cleaned the bathroom from top to bottom again (we had only arrived a few hours before) and put down ant killer which then when we went out for dinner they came and sorted again. We ate one night in the restaurant the food was lovely and very special though nothing traditional, if you want it traditional food, go to one of many of the food markets the food is good and exciting. The location is the best in the city for culture and variety no street full of shopping malls but beutiful streets and the buddidst temple at the end of the street is a perfect way to start the day. The front desk were fantastic at helping out suggesting iteneries and sorting out taxi's, even when we came in burdoned with shopping in the pouring rain they were so helpful even taking the shopping up to the room for us! Overall great Hotel, fantastic service though small rooms</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Another great stay at this hotel created from a Chinese heritage building right in the heart of Chinatown and close to countless fantastic restaurants and bars galore. I'm a regular here and the reason I keep coming back is the warm welcome you always receive at this hotel, the great service and the wonderful location. Now, some of the rooms are pretty small (this is a heritage building) but you trade this for the location and an affordable price for this standard of hotel. Free broadband in rooms and wifi in reception. I was feeling very unwell during this trip following a visit to India, and the staff could not have been kinder.

All the continental buffet is still there, although better range but the hot buffet is replaced by an upscale breakfast menu- I had poached eggs on onion brioche, bacon strips, poached spinach with hollandaise drizzle. There was also poached fish, etc. They're really making the effort to make it a special experience. Of course, you can still have straight bacon eggs etc if you want! Do not hesitate to book this lovely hotel either for business, leisure or a layover between flights. You will not regret it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has an exquisite posh touch to its furnish and I was really looking forward to staying at scarlet.... The room that we had was on the second floor and the bellman was the first person who warmly greeted us.. checking in was hassle free and the front desk staff brought us to our room, she asked us if it is our first time at the scarlet and introduced us to some of the nightlife places around their hotel. The room was not extremely big but it was spacious and with window as requested, clean room with comfortable bed. Our room was very clean and neat, really liked the interior of our room as it was very quaint & stylish. The hotel had complimentary wired internet in the room which my girlfriend used her laptop.. We asked for some cutlery as we brought some supper back and the staff delivered to our doorstep within a short time. We went up to the roof top bar for a drink after our supper before midnight. It was a lovely view and not too crowded on a weekday. The waiters were responsive and friendly. My girlfriend told me that she felt home at scarlet. It was a very enjoyable stay and I would definitely recommend my friends to stay here.. just because the location is fantastic, service is commendable and my requests for my room was met... Can't wait to come back to the scarlet again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">OK, The Scarlet is maybe not so perfect but so charming i tend to forget the wrong details. We stayed there in March 2006 and we have been very surprised about the difference of this hotel. There is no comparaison in the world with this ultra sophisticated decoration. We have stayed in the Splendour Suite and it was large and comfortable with an adorable terrace perfectly romantic for an evening cocktail. Bathroom is of the best quality with a lot of amenities and there is a very warm atmosphere. About the staff, all of them are trendy, helpful and quite smily and i don't have any complain about them because they really want to make the customer happy of the stay. Breeze and Bold are two nice places for a cool drink with hype people and again this unique atmosphere but the breakfast at the restaurant is simply terrible with very bad food quality and a service not really professionnal. However, once again, congratulations for the decoration. About the other problems of The scarlet, just be careful not to make a reservation for a room without window because there are several rooms like that and not only in the lowest category... Take some ear plugs because the soundproofing is not the best. If not, the other things are really satisfacting and there is a real charm absolutely exquisite and i'll return there often because i love difference.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for two nights in November 09. We had booked a deluxe room. The member of staff who took us/suitcases to our room pre-warned us that having a deluxe room meant you had a window, but the down-side was the room was small - he wasn't wrong!! It is the smallest room I have ever stayed in, however, it was decorated to a very high standard with a lovely bathroom. The hotel itself is full of charachter and if you are looking for something a little bit different, this is it. It is described as a boutique hotel and you can see why. The decor is lovely and attention to detail is extraordinary. The breakfasts were lovely and it was a very nice atmosphere in the restaurant. Although it is a help yourself buffet breakfast, it is as far away from 'canteen buffet-style breakfast' as you can get. Throughout the hotel there is piped relaxing music and the whole place makes you feel totally chilled out. The staff are excellent and they will re-confirm your flights by online check-in and printing out your boarding cards for you. The roof-top bar has a lovely atmosphere, but the restaurant was quite pricey for the quality of the food. The location of this hotel is great - 5 mins walk from the MRT and right near china town and not too far from Clarke Quay. All in all it was a lovely classy hotel and I would certainly stop here again if I ever returned to Singapore.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">At first the front desk told me that only premier rooms were available, at S$300+++ per night. I took a premier room, but I was shocked that at this price range, the room is in the basement has no windows! I went back to the front desk and requested for another room with windows, but were told that none were available. Then I asked for a full refund. The staff asked me to wait for a few mins. Then she returned and told me that they have an executive room at S$215+++ with windows. It was quite clear to me that they were trying to sell me a more expensive room in the first place. The executive room was very small, but at least it has large windows and is very bright. But the room is clearly meant for one guest only. There is only one toothbrush, and only one complimentary drink. The bed is too small for 2 person, and very hard. Don't believe the photos you see on their website. The hotel is not as nice as the photos. Don't expect anything close to 5-star, more like 3-star. I feel that the front desk should inform the guest about the premier rooms having no windows, and that the executive room is meant for one guest only. The service seriously needs to be improved. The location is good, right opposite a very famous food centre with lots of cheap food, and near the interesting alleys of Chinatown. But I would not recommend anyone to stay in this hotel, due to the poor service and uncomfortable rooms.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Scarlet first came to my attention because of its beautiful décor. The façade, entrance and lobby all look extremely stylish, and the color palette (red and black) just adds a sense of nostalgia and elegance to it. My room is also classically styled. You really have nothing to complain but its size. Apart from physical layouts, it is also worth mentioning that the staff there provide good services. It is so obvious that they want to make everything right for you, and that kind of attitude makes all the difference. One example I can share is that I had to check out early due to my flight. And before I even asked, the Receptionist found out which terminal I should head to already. I found that very thoughtful and useful. Now, move on to the not so positive side. Like what I said earlier, it is true that the rooms are not spacious. And it is not guaranteed that there will be a window in your room, which makes it somewhat claustrophobic. The air-con can be VERY loud sometimes. I consider myself very easy to fall asleep, but even I found the noise quite disturbing. When I visited Soda, (the alias for their jacuzzi, I love they give names to their facilities) I was shocked that there were no clean towels around. It is fair to say that this hotel has some charming traits as well as minor flaws. However, with its reasonable tariff, I still think it is a good choice for people who plan on visiting Chinatown with a reasonable budget.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Before booking, I was looking for location first and foremost. I knew I wanted to avoid the generic big hotel chains of the Orchard Road area since I'm not interested in shopping. I usually don't lend much credence to self-assigned star ratings I was looking for and expecting something more spartan, but in fact the Scarlett hotel is very luxurious. It is truly boutique hotel I would recommend it most for couples on romantic getaways. Since Expedia was selling the "Executive room" at a discount, it was cheaper than the lesser "deluxe". The room was huge and had a little desk, fridge, and all the amenities (and DVD player with free rentals at the front desk). The room was absolutely spotless (how very 'Singapore'!) and very quiet. I remember a traveller review lamenting the long walk to the lobby (as the hotel is built length-wise). Well I got the very last room at the end of the last corridor on the second floor! It is not that bad, but because the hallway is not in a straigh tline, you may get the impression that you are stuck in a maze. But the distance from the room wasn't a concern to me I since I spent all my time in Singapore walking and using the SMRT transit. And the hotel's location is perfect for the MRT as it sits right between Chinatown MRT and Tanjong Pagar MRT (the one to Changi Airport). A 5 minute walk either way. Since they are on different lines, you get more options. Staff were extremely courteous and very efficient (very short wait at checkout).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A superb and quirky hotel, bigger than I expected. The reception area was so opulent and cozy. The chap who checked us in was incredible, we were staying one night and had an early start in the morning, he arranged for us to have breakfast at 6am instead of the usual 7am start, he also advised us that the trains to the airport would not run at that time and said that they could arrange a taxi for us...at least we did not waste our time walking to the station to find that we couldnt get a train. The receptionist in the evening even helped us check in for our flight and print off our boarding cards..excellent customer service. She also advised that prebooking a taxi would be more expensive than just calling for one in the morning of departure - which the morning receptionist did for us without any bother. We had an executive room number 215, it had a window and the room was fairly roomy. People mention that the rooms are small but this one was fine. Beautifully decorated, lots of little extras to make the stay perfect. The room had a room safe, umbrella, slippers, drinking water, tv. The bathroom had lovely toiletries, hairdryer, even a loofah...the only thing missing was hand towels, we had bath towels but no hand towels which seemed strange. The drinks in the bar were expensive but there is a 7/11 shop down the road if you wanted to take them back to your room instead... On the whole a fabulous hotel, great location by chinatown and excellent helpful staff...would definately stay here again, wonderful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am told by my cab driver that The Scarlet botique hotel in Sinagpore is always booked out. If so, how lucky was I to get a room at this fantastic property. It's located in Chinatown and admittedly there isn't too much in the way of malls or western eateries in the area. Leaving that behind I have to say I was so impressed with the entire stay and I mean literally from the time I stepped out of the cab. My bag was taken from me and I was welcomed into the funkiest lobby I think I've ever seen. It reminded me of what it might be like to be in a jeanies bottle. The guy who showed me to my room also showed me how everything in the room worked and actually spent time making sure I felt comfortable with all the amenities. Remember they're not working for tips in SInagpore so this was REAL service, straight from the heart. I happened to mention that I like a firm pillow and sure enough minutes later there was a knock at the door and a firm pillow arrived. My room was small, plush yet functional and very comfortable. I had a heavenly night's sleep and awoke to take breakfast just down stairs. Again, funky decor, friendly staff who were attentive yet understood I was still waking up. $13 bucks for a teriffic set menu which had a bit of everything on it. Great coffee and comfortable seats. I have to say I am used to staying in the usual consumer brand hotels because of my job (150 nights a year). The Scarlet was out of my regular pattern however it paid off and I loved the personal service and attention to detail. If location isn't everything give this place a go, they are very cool!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Best described by a previous reviewer as "really want to love this hotel, but just can't" and I would echo the sentiment. On the facade it's a sleek, sexy looking hotel, with bundles of character on the exterior, funky lobby, and some very quirky touches. The deep reds, blacks and gold give a very ornate true boutique feel, which is lightly transferred to the bedrooms. The rooms are small...expect it. If you reckon you'll be lucky enough to get a good sized room, forget about it. We had the Premier Executive and the Executive on our two visits, and they were both pretty small. Anything more than two suitcases and a hand luggage and you will be climbing over the suitcases to get around. The rooms are tastefully decorated, with average mod cons. The bed however is as good as the concrete on the side road below the balcony - possibly the hardest bed I've ever slept on, but if it takes your fancy, you're in luck. The bathrooms are very nicely decorated, however only had a bathtub in the Premier Executive Room, and the sliding door is somewhat see-through. Be wary : Some of the rooms do not have a window, but only a skylight. We were lucky enough to get a balcony on both occasions. The staff are generally ok, however we were unfortunate to have what seemed to be a new starter, who couldn't find our room at 11.30pm. The breakfast selection is average however with the Maxwell food centre opposite the hotel it may well be worth sacrificing the hotel breakfast for a roti canai ! Overall good location in Chinatown, a clean and unique hotel - just dont expect a comfortable room is you are taller than 5ft 5"</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “The Scarlet Hotel --- flirtatious and teasing”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have always been intrigued by the Scarlet Hotel from its flirtatious website design, so I finally decided to try it. We booked directly with the hotel and got a better deal than other internet sites. Location wise, it is very good, just a few minutes to Chinatown station. Nearby are also good restaurants including the popular Maxwell Hawker Centre or the other several eateries near the station. There are also souvenir shops for those last-minute shopping, you just need to bargain. In general, Chinatown is a good base in Singapore for its unique feel and accessibility. The hotel is a converted shophouse, so its layout is not the usual hotel’s. It’s a bit of a maze going to the rooms, but I think it adds to its charm. The rooms are very good, in fact, we had a fairly-sized bedroom and it didn’t feel cramped. Rooms are well-appointed and I particularly liked the bathrooms with its Victorian-era fixtures. Some rooms don’t have windows so make sure you specify this when booking. On our arrival, I was particularly amused with the hotel’s flirtatious furniture pieces, dark reds, velvet and black --- exactly the “ambience” its website suggests. Check-in was fast and front desk staff was courteous. Somebody guided us through the narrow hallways to our rooms, which is good coz otherwise we won’t find our rooms!  Our package didn’t include breakfast but this is not an issue coz we can easily find restaurants around the hotel. The hotel also has a rooftop restaurant which is good for a night cap, prices are a bit on the high side though. I highly recommend the Scarlet hotel for the different experience and for its reasonable rates.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my second trip to Singapore but my first staying in this hotel. It's not part of a chain, that I'm aware of, so it was just so beautiful and unique! The theme is black and scarlet red, and it's in everything, from the decor, the uniforms, even their computers are red! It's gorgeous! The service is unbelievable. Instead of just handing us a key and sending us to our room, the lady (her name is Yna, wonderful lady!), walked us all the way there, opened up the room, showed us everything in the room that we probably wouldn't have known about if she hadn't told us, and other services offered in the hotel. We had a Premium Room and the computer desk was actually a few steps up, which was cute, but helpful if someone is sleeping and you want to be on the computer, so you don't disturb them. The bathroom has a completely see through shower, which was interesting. Nice big flat screen TV, free bottles of juice, comfy bed. The room wasn't huge but we didn't really care. It was very nice and very clean. The lobby is decorated so beautifully, little alcoves with couches and things, all in the scarlet and black theme. My fave was this "poodle" statue thing with a lipstick leash and necklace and Chinese slippers. It was all beautifully decorated but with a sense of humor - just so unique. I loved it. And it's a block from Chinatown, so it was easy to get to all of that shopping. The closest MRT is about a 5 minute walk, not too bad, but I would suggest a taxi if you have luggage. Anyway, the prices are very reasonable - especially for Singapore which is notoriously expensive. So we were pleasantly suprised at how great the property and service was. Totally recommend this place!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Smacked in the middle of Singapore's historical area, near Chinatown, a row of old shophouses are restored and cleverly transformed into a swanky boutique hotel. Stepping into the lobby and reception area, it is hard not to notice the use of rich colours, & bold mix of textures & materials. From the velvety lounge chairs with lavish upholstery, fancy wallpaper and elaborate chandeliers, The Scarlet spells OPULENCE. Everything is carefully chosen to seduce our senses. It's warm and dim ambient light creates a sensual and mysterious atmosphere, making The Scarlet ultra-sexy. The same luxurious feel is extended to the bedroom which features a sloping roof. My Deluxe room has a big comfortable double bed, dark wood wardrobe, big sturdy writing table complete with a high back chair. But what I loved most is the small double doors that open up to the balcony. The balcony offers a view unique to Singapore – the back view of a row of old shophouses with spiral staircases that forms an interesting arrangement. The hotel has 5 suites, each uniquely designed to carry a different personality, namely, Splendour, Passion, Opulent, Lavish and Swank. It also offers facilities like a Jacuzzi named Soda, a Gym named Flaunt, a bar named Bold, and restaurants named Desire and Breeze. Breeze is an alfresco dining area on the rooftop, perfect for an evening of chilling under the stars with the paranamic view of Chinatown spread below you. The scarlet is also the perfect place to stay if you want to get lost in the trendy old streets of Club Street and And Siang Hill. A stone's throw away is Maxwell Food Centre, which is a Singapore food galore. For photos, click http://www.lucia-haven.blogspot.com/</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">8am and a basic taxi with a friendly driver whisked us to the Scarlet hotel. After a long flight from London, entering the hotel was a joy. It is the epitome of boutique, an series of old shops opened up inside to create a long flowing hotel. The elegant entrance with water feature and believe it or not, scarlet coloured decor is a real welcome. The room wasn't quite ready (understandable at 8am) but the staff were very professional, took our bags and we headed up the stairs for breakfast in the restaurant. Breakfast is a small buffet with fresh juices and pastries whilst you can also get cooked dishes also. From what I remember, prices were not overly expensive nor a bargain, just what you pay for a hotel breakfast. Despite the reviews on this hotel that the rooms are interior with no windows, it really doesn't matter. The ceilings are lovely and high with massive sky lights and the bathrooms are great. Fluffy robes and small hospitable touches including many different English language tv channels make this hotel perfect for the stop over to Oz. We grabbed a few hours much needed sleep after checking into the room at about 9.30am. Very comfy beds, sanctuary like environment. The architects have done a great job opening out the space into a flowing, enjoyable hotel. The bathrooms in the lobby were also excellent and I believe, a good indicator of the cleanliness and quality of a hotel in general. The rich, dark decor with heavy coloured floors may have made the space seem confined but clever use of mirrors and windows have played a useful role. Mornings bring a free newspaper and I was sad to leave the place. In a nutshell, for £80, this is the definite place to stay in the oz stop over flight.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My initial interaction with the hotel staff was exasperating. I tried to book this hotel while in Bali but the internet connection was slow. So I did a walk in and the hotel staff gave me a different rate than the posted internet price while insisting it was the same price as the one I saw on the internet. I informed them their price was 8 or 9 percent higher than the listed internet price. They insistently responded both prices were the same. I asked them which price would I pay and why do you have two different sets of prices for the same room. The hotel staff responded, by saying their price includes the hotel exchange rate applied to the bank the internet price does not include exchange fee. I told them, "I'm not paying cash so why would you quote me the cash rate in the first place? Don't most customers pay by credit card as well? Then why would you quote me a higher price when most likely I am paying by credit card. You should ask the customer if they plan on paying by cash or credit and then quote them the correct price based on their payment method, not automatically quoting the hotel exchange rate price." They simply responded with a muddled look. I asked to speak to the manager and even he didn't understand their faulty logic pricing. Nonetheless it was too late and I was too tired from Bali to go to another hotel. The rooms were well appointed. Furniture and bedding appeared to be of high quality. The bed offered support and comfort. Crisp, clean sheets with a high thread count kept me warm at night with the AC on blast. Outside of the initial frustration with the hotel pricing, the hotel staff provided accurate and helpful information to a tourist who had left his Singapore itinerary at home.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “stylish but tiny”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a stunning hotel with beautifully furnished lobby and rooms. The rooms were quite tiny, but also clean and well furnished and had everything we needed including a safe, flat screen tv, umbrella, and very nice toiletries. There was a balcony which looked onto a parkade. The only downside was the room smelled like smoke even if it was a non-smoking room. The jacuzzi was very nice and we enjoyed relaxing on the patio. The hotel's location is great. We didn't eat at the hotel but had dinner at a well-known singaporean restaurant a few blocks away called Blue Ginger. Fantastic pork satay and chicken curry. We went early so we got a table without a reservation, but you would probably need one after 7. There are some upscale clothes and home decor shops nearby. Nearby attractions including a Hindu temple, Buddhist temple and the Chinatown night market. There is also a Kaya toast restaurant a few blocks away which is a nice place to try the local specialty for breakfast. This hotel is within easy walking distance to an MRT (subway) station from which you could access Clarke Quay, Boat Quay, any of the downtown attractions, Raffles Place, Little India, etc. I had a bad experience getting money exchanged at the Bank of China two blocks from the hotel. Not only did the teller try to short change me, she also refused to exchange some US bills stating they were "too old". I had gotten the money from a Canadian bank a week before and they looked perfectly okay to me! The exchange rates (for buying and selling currency) were posted on the wall so it was fairly obvious that I was not getting the correct amount. After I pointed this out, the amount was corrected. I would advise tourists to be alert for this type of thing.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Excellent location not worth poor service and unclean, cramped room”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel on 7-8 October, and whilst the location was excellent afraid every other aspect was poor at best. In wanting to convey my feedback to the hotel, I completed the feedback form when I checked out and detailed my experience. It is in fact the first time, I have never received even an acknowledgement for completing the feedback form from a hotel, let alone an explanation as to the hotel's shortcomings. Guess this is a reflection of how important this hotel views its customers. The hotel's concept is unique, sort of a boudoir, and I thought the boutique nature would be a welcomed change from the usual business hotels in Singapore. However, the rooms are very small and with the hotel's concept, feel cluttered. I had paid extra from a room with a balcony, which I would not recommend as it was more of a ledge than somewhere to sit out with a view (I have confirmed all of the rooms with a balcony are like this). Upon being shown to the room, I called reception if I could change to a room with some view, even if it was without a balcony, and was flatly told 'no' (most hotels would at least check and see if there was no availability). The general cleanliness of the room, I found below average and I would imagine this is due to their cramped size, making it difficult to clean down both sides of the bed. I also noted the duvet smelt damp and requested that house-keeping change it before I returned from dinner. Unfortunately, they didn't and I couldn't get anyone to do so before I had an early night before an important business meeting. Given Singapore's excellent public transport, I wouldn't even recommend this hotel on the basis of its location. The lack of even an acknowledgement after providing feedback to hotel just shows their apparent lack of customer service.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having read the reviews on trip advisor I was fairly confident about this hotel but I must have missed something because having just come back from a 1 night stay I certainly wouldn't be going back. I don't want to be too negative. It certainly wasn't awful and the location is pretty good as it is so near Chinatown although the street that it is on is pretty lively at night ( including the hotel itself) and so you will get lots of noise outside - and we stayed on a Monday night so I dread to think what it would be like on a Saturday night! We may have been unlucky with our room but it was the tiniest room imaginable. I upgraded to an executive room with a balcony as I had read some of the reviews about size of rooms but our room was absolutely tiny. I don't remember the last time I stayed in a room so small! The balcony overlooked a car park so whilst it was large it was too hot and depressing to use it. I would sooner have had the space that the balcony took up added to the room. We both had large suitcases as we had just come back from 8 days in Bali and we could hardly fit them in the room. The room itself was OK but nothing special - trying hard to be stylish but with such a small room simpler might have been better. However the bed was very comfortable, the airconditioning was good and the internet access for free was excellent. We didn't use the bar, restaurant or have breakfast so I can't comment on those which a lot of people seem to really rate so maybe if we had used those it would have improved my experience. The staff were good although a bit overily fussy and check in took forever for some reason. All in all I think this hotel is very overrated. It is all style and no substance but if you like that kind of thing I am sure you will enjoy it. I wouldn't stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here with my partner in May 2007. We asked for a room with a window and got the most horrible room with a so-called skylight that was hidden up behind a wall, so the light that came in was barely noticeable (i.e, the room was practically pitch black and you couldn't see where the tiny chink of light was even coming from). The room was horribly claustrophobic and over-dressed. When we stated we had asked for a window, the Reception woman who showed us to our room just wasn't interested. In the morning we complained and spoke to a different Receptionist who moved us with no problems and we had a window this time. Breakfast was nothing special in the over-dressed breakfast room. But on the last day there appeared to be a work conference on and there was a sign at the bottom of the stairs leading to the restaurant indicating it was closed due to the function. When we asked where we were supposed to have breakfast, which we had paid for in our booking, the same unhelpful Reception woman just pointed outside and told us to go and find a restaurant outside somewhere! My other half complained at this point and suddenly we were allowed into the breakfast room and there was no function on inside. But we just felt awkward and that we had to hurry. We would never stay here again. For the most part, things just seemed too much trouble for the staff. The narrow corridors wound on forever and were very claustrophic - if they had a fire in there, goodness knows how you would get out in a hurry, particulary from the 'basement' rooms (where we were put initially). The rooms were over-dressed, gloomy and stuffy as was the hotel and for the most part, its staff. An uncomfortable experience. For the record I have never complained about a hotel before, but this one was not nice, considering it was supposed to be higher up the range.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good (but not amazing) quirky boutique hotel in colonial part of Singapore”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Scarlet Hotel twice in December as we went through Singapore to go the Koh Samui for a change (rather than Bangkok). First time we stayed in a suite for a couple of nights which was lovely - decent sized room with separate lounge and long balcony with outdoor fans - boutique style decor (our room was slightly over the top) with veiws over the hawkers market opposite and terracotta roofs which is very different from staying down on Orchard Rd and for this reason we would stay here again. On the fringe of China Town and not far from Orchard Rd if thats where your heading. The hotel is lovely and kind of quirky with a lovely roof top bar. Breakfast is good - nothing amazing but nothing to complain about. The gym is tiny (think home gym) and the staff are friendly (although I must say they messed up our booking). Second time we stayed for only 8 hours and took their most basic rooml which I feel I should warn you about. This room was under ground and didn't have any windows . The door only just opened to clear the bed. The room was very small and just functional but difficult if there are two of you with a suit case each (forget it if you are a heavy packer!) - the most space was in the shower! I really wouldn't choose one of these basic rooms if you like space and fresh air - I am not claustrophobic at all but I kept wanting to open the door to the hallway (where there are also no windows on the basement floor). I would recommend this hotel if you are staying for a couple of nights only in a room with a balcony and if you like boutique hotels only - lots of cute little one of local designer shops around and cute little bars - very nice area but not in the modern part of Singapore. Good if you are a young couple or a bit of a fashionista, but not if you like space and service and if you want to be in the heart of Singapore.</p></li>

<li>First time we stayed in a suite for a couple of nights which was lovely - decent sized room with separate lounge and long balcony with outdoor fans - boutique style decor (our room was slightly over the top) with veiws over the hawkers market opposite and terracotta roofs which is very different from staying down on Orchard Rd and for this reason we would stay here again.</br>
