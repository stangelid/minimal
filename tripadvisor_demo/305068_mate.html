Due to re furbishment of hotel we were given an inward facing room. This is ok if you want peace and quiet ,but view is of a blank wall. Swimming pool is also out for repair. I would class this as just an average city hotel situated in an area handy for sightseeing and not noisy even although construction work on the building and road outside is taking place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Top hotel I can only agree with most other reviewers - a top hotel, perfect location, first class service and a great range of restaurants. I would just offer two tips from our experience. Firstly, the extra for a harbour view is well worth while. Secondly, the extra for the Executive Club probably isn't. This is a mezzanine area offering breakfast, evening cocktails and newspapers etc included in the price. It's OK but probably not worth the price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">YES! Is this worthy of being in 1000 Places to See? Yes, probably. Very expensive, but all in all wonderful.Great location - fantastic setting overlooking Hong Kong Harbour. Some highlights include: sitting in whirlpool with view of Harbour, and having a drink in bar watching light show (every night at 20:00).Rooms were good considering standard of hotel.Location is great and convenient (nearby to ferry terminal).It's expensive, but worth the experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When in Hong Kong stay nowhere else Probably one of the best hotels we have stayed in for location and spectacular harbourside rooms beautifully furnished. The lobby bar has a huge glass wall overlooking the comings and goings of the busy harbour. The breakfast buffet is the best I've seen and don't forget to treat yourself to dinner in Spoon.......Alan Ducasse famous restaurant for fabulous food and those spectacular views. Stay at this hotel once in your life-time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Best Hotel Ever The service here is wonderful! One morning the shuttle for the train left a little early and the bellman ran after it. It is beautiful and kept up in an impecable manner. Many of the employees spoke english. Two days while we were there, there was a typhoon warning. The desk agents explained what we should do and that if we needed help just call them. As we came back to the hotel, the doorman greated us at the street with an umbrella and warm towel, it was delightful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">a wonderful experience in Hong Kong This has to be one of the best hotels in Hong Kong. We stayed there for 3 nights in February. We had booked a room with a harbour view and we were certainly not disappointed. The view was spectacular and we could have spent the entire time just looking at the everchanging harbour scene. The Club facilities are out of this world, food is excellent as are all the services. The staff were wonderful and the Pool area is to die for. I would go back tomorrow!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Some insights- the good and the not so good We started our China trip at this hotel and were spoiled. A wonderful hotel with great service and a must try buffet breakfast that is out of this world! While you're chowing down on breakfast, enjoy the panoramic view of Victoria Harbor, it's simply the best!The rooms are quite large and spacious. The only thing is that the rooms are getting a bit old. But still very clean and well preserved. This is a resort like hotel with outstanding service. Definitely worth every penny!</p></li>

This has got to be one of the best hotels i have ever stayed in based on the service alone!The harbourside contemporary room with a view was breathtaking. The room has all of the mod cons that you rarely see in other hotels- Bose surround sound, Ipod docking station and sharp aquos lcd tv.Location is the best, with everything on your doorstep, you even get discount at the adjoining shopping mall!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stunning views I may be biased as they gave us an upgrade to a junior suite and a bottle of champagne as it was our honeymoon, but this was a brilliant hotel. The view of hong kong harbour is the best I've seen from anywhere in hong kong.The suite was lovely - with a jacuzzi bath and steam room in the bathroom.The staff were extremely friendly and the food delicious (though not cheap!)The location was good - a short walk to the Star Ferry, Harbour City, Nathan Road. The hotel itself could have better sound proofing - but overall a great hotel.</p></li>

The view is perfect, service impecible, fantastic pool with an infinity whirlpool that must have the best view in Hong Kong overlooking the bay.The rooms are excellent with great bathrooms and the extra for the Harbour View rooms is a must.Apart from the price it is difficult to find fault although it is not a great place for those with disabilities as the lift does not go down to the breakfast room and there are stairs to be negotiated to the pool area.</p></li>

Taken straight to room on 16th floor to check-in and stunned by the unbeatable view of Hong Kong island. The room was superb with probably the best bed in the world! Made to feel really special as this was part of a Far East trip to celebrate a 50th birthday. The Guest relations staff led by Mina Virda were fantastic and considering we have been to the Far East 4 times in the last 2 years we can thoroughly recommend this hotel. It is also a very short walk from the Star Ferry and is ideally placed.</p></li>

Staff are friendly and helpful, cleanliness is exemplary, rooms and bathrooms are spacious, well provided and comfortable (should add, have only stayed in harborside rooms).

Out room was amazing with a sunken bath, large bed, and unbelievable view.The jacuzzi on the 3rd floor is amazing as well.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who visits Hong Kong.</p></li>

There was no mention of the hotel undergoing renovations on the website when I booked the accomodation If I had known we would not have stayed there!! For very little extra you can book the Summer Package at The Peninsula Harbour View room with breakfast and two massages included and no noisy renovations. I wish we'd done that.</p></li>

Lovely bed and wonderful bathroom with sunken bath and great shower. Staff extremely helpful  friendly. Would definately recommend this hotel for a luxurious break NB: allow plenty of time if planning to travel on the peak tram at the weekend - We queued for 60 minutes to get onto the tram Saturday evening to access the peak for a meal and on our return waited around 30 minutes, but well worth it!Also, make sure you request a non-smoking room if required, as there are smoking and non smoking floors in the hotel.</p></li>

<li>Would definately recommend this hotel for a luxurious break NB: allow plenty of time if planning to travel on the peak tram at the weekend - We queued for 60 minutes to get onto the tram Saturday evening to access the peak for a meal and on our return waited around 30 minutes, but well worth it!Also, make sure you request a non-smoking room if required, as there are smoking and non smoking floors in the hotel.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great and expensive On a long business trip, I first stayed at the Intercontinental as we didn had time to look for a hotel and I am member of Intercontinental loyalty program.With my associate, we took 2 rooms with harbour view. Waow!! splendid! The only annoying thing is that you have hotel cleaners passing in front of the window every hour. It is a bit disturbing.Apart from that, the staff is very kind, the room is great and quite large, bathroom is excellent and toilets are behind a closed door.Yes, it is a bit expensive, but if you want to be at ease and are ready to afford it in HK, it is worth it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location My wife and I stayed at the hotel for two nights in March 2007. We had booked using points and were delighted to be upgraded when we arrived. We were also able to book in at 10:30 in the morning. The room was spacious with a walk-in shower and bathtub. We also took advantage of the Club Intercontinental which provided a beautiful view of the Hong Kong skyline. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive. The hotel was immaculate. Although undergoing some renovations which our room overlooked, we were never bothered by the noise. A great place to stay with one of the most scenic views of Hong.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Amazing Views and Great Service The view is spectacular - stay in a harbour view room it is absolutely worth it. The service here is also fantastic by all members of staff. Actually felt like they really did care that you enjoyed your stay at the hotel (not often the case).The Chinese restaurant here is very good for upscale and fairly pricey dim sum. The pricey snacks in the lounge are also good, and the cost reflects the value of the view.Not sure if I would stay in TST/ Kowloon again. Really hated most of it, particularly being touted constantly for tailoring/ knock off goods, etc. But if I did it would be here for the view, and the service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Truly memorable! Arrived as very weary travellers to be greeted by name from our coach and then sraight to our room, where check in took place with tea. Great start! The harbour view room is a must and is truly an awesome view. The room other than that was spacious with a fantatstic bathroom. Choosing where to eat within the hotel was difficult as there is a great French restaurant and a fabulous chinese restaurant as well as seafood and others. The lobby bar gave us yet another chance to sit back and enjoy the views of the harbour. The rooftop pool is not to be missed simply for further scenery and the fact that you can watch the world go by below you!</p></li>

It is true that the room decoration and furniture is in a pretty poor state, however the view from the lobby bar are amazing. We stayed in a junior suite and had a wonderful view over to Hong Kong Island. The food was good and the service was exceptional. A good location for exploring Hong Kong and getting the star ferry to HK Island. The infinity pool is anice touch with great views over HK Island. The staff could not have been more helpful and directed us to good restaurants when we wanted to eat out. I would stay again in the future especially when the room have all been refurbished.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Still the Best in HK On a recent trip to HK, we had the opportunity once again to stay at the Intercontinental. I really don't understand why this hotel is not in the top 5 hotels in HK. Perhaps its age? Since its remodel I think the hotel is better than ever. The views are still spectacular, service is impeccable and the rooms have now been updated with the latest technology. What could be better. Well this past trip we stayed in a Suite with a view of the entire harbor. The room was beautifully appointed and included a jacuzzi tub, with its own harbor view. The tub was so big that 8 people could swim in ! Needless to say we didnt need the infiniti whirlpool on the 3rd floor, one day we will get there.</p></li>

The room was small but had a fantastic view of Hong Kong harbour and was very luxuious with all the amenities you needed (especially the bathroom) and great room service. Staff were helpful and pleasnat and the pool and gym were good.The drinks in bars near the hotel were expensive but much better deals can be found on Hong kong Island, eaisly acessible via a 10 minute walk from the hotel to the underground. We stayed for our honeymoon and even though staff didnt find out until we arrived they sent up wine (much apeaciated given the cost of a good bottle of wine in asia) i would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stunning Stunning Views... I did a lot of research to choose a hotel for 4 nights in Hong Kong on our way home from a month in New Zealand. I came up with this one and never regretted it. The views from either the hotel lobby and baror any harbourside room are simply the best in HK as the hotel isliterally on the edge of the water. You thus have an uninterupted view of the everchanging traffic on the water. Also and this is important. HK is a really busy urban environment as we all know. But staying here you can simply exit the hotel and walk along the waterfront and be away from the constant bustle that is everywhere else. Breakfast was great, food otherwise nothing to speak of, but hey HK is full of restaurants.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Best hotel in Hong Kong Amazing! I have been to HK many times and stayed in many hotels and this was bar none, the best experience ever. The service was extraordinary, the rooms impeccable.When I made the reservation via Intercon's website there was no option for two beds, only king bed, but when we checked in they asked if we wanted two beds and provided us with a two bed room. The views cannot be matched and the rooms are fairly spacious for HK.The only, only complaint is that due to construction it is a bit confusing to figure out how to get from the hotel to the MTR and the staff did not seem totally clear on how to get there so we did take a few detours before finding the MTR. Fairly minor.Also, lobby bar is great.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great room with magnificient harbour view I stayed 2 nights between China and Singapore.HK hotels were full and the only choice given to me by the Hotel Information agent at HK airport was Suite 1201 at the Intercontinental. (US$500 perr night, I think)Room - Very spacious, with a magnificient viw from the bed.Breakfast - Was not included in the US$20 price of the room! That was exagerated. Don't forget to discuss that at booking time!Service - Excellent.Location - Not too far from the train transfer from the airport or from the ferry to the island. Maybe 200 meters walkikng distance. It is a little long with a heavy bag, but OK if you are in shape.Business center and internet - Excellent, but this is HK and it is not free.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great to be back! This remains my favourite hotel to be in Hong Kong. Not quite the class of the Peninsula, or 'where it all happens' at the Mandarin Oriental, but with fabulous views, lots of space and impressive service. This time, I was particularly impressed at the pool to be offered a pool 'concierge' to wake me up at a certain time, or prepare drinks, provide cold towels etc.. Despite being cold, I was given a portable fan. Wonderful touch! Great breakfasts. Only negative was the door-man, when I left, made it quite clear that he expected a tip. All he did was open the door! I had just generously tipped the porter and do not expect to be made to feel uncomfortable when leaving a fine hotel of this exceptional calibre.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Best hotel in HK I had not stayed at this hotel since IC took it over a few years ago. My return was wonderful. The view from out floor to ceiling windows of Victoria Harbor was unmatched from any other hotel in HK (and perhaps in any city in the world). We could almost touch the boats. The walkway in fron of the hotel is great for jogging. The Star Ferry is close by for a trip to Central and we did some of our Christmas shopping in the nearby malls. The best addion is Spoon, which I consider to be the best western retaurant in HK. The service was great and the guest relationship manager sent up a bottle of vintage chamagne for our anniversay. That made the trip memorable and I expect to stay at the IC for my future trips to HK.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Simply enjoy the view and hospitality I was in Hong Kong for a brief vacation alone. Stayed at InterContinental for two nights and out of surprise they gave me a suite on the highest floor, 16th. Although not with full harbor view, still a very enjoyable stay.The room is huge (actually a small defect for a lonely traveler as it amply the loneliness), newly renovated, equipped with big Sharp LCD TV and everything you need on the road (to name a few: an iron).Great service, friendly faces. A guy knocked over his drink and wet the sofa chair. The servers quickly swtiched a clean chair for him.Never miss a drink or two at the Lobby Lounge where has the most magnificent view of the bay I'll say, as the hotel is located at a great spot right besides the bay.</p></li>

We went there in July 2006 for our honey moon trip in Asia and we were really welcome by the whole staff. The harbour view room is wonderful and allows great chill-out in front of the bay. Great service, rooms are perfect, It smells very good in the whole hotel. Swimming pool with a marvelous view, Nice beauty center, We went twice during our trip, the first in a superior harbour view room and the second tim in an executive suite. The rooms are great, clean, well designed... The Bar is really pleasant. We really recommend and will definitely go back. I tried a lot of hotels in HK and this one is the best for me. Very good for a romantic trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">World class performance! We stayed in this hotel in a harbour view executive room for two nights on a combined business/leisure trip. I have to say this hotel ranks in our view as one of the best in the world - maybe even the best. Service is outstanding, from the porter that awaits you at the airport right down to the butler that brings you a fresh cup of chinese tea shortly after your arrival. The location can't be beaten, simply close to everything relevant in Hong Kong. Compared to the ever-famous Peninsula, that is currently surrounded by building sites, we feel that the Intercontinental offers much more value for money. There are some terrific restaurants in the hotel, such as Spoon (Alain Ducasse) and Nobu, both world-class. Overall a fantastic experience, score 10 out of 10.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Outstanding Customer Service! My Partner and i stayed here for just 2 nights, whilst on a round the world trip. This hotel stay was on the last bit of our trip and we wanted to end it on a high. Wow! what service! The warm welcome and attention to detail is amazing and the staff are so very attentive. The hotel was quiet, relaxing and pure luxury. We had an amazing large harbour view room, we didnt once put the tv on but just kept looking out of the window at the amazing view! At eight o'clock each evening the harbour lights up to an amazing laser light show. Breakfast is buffet style and is very delicious with fantastic choice. I chose this hotel from the highly recommended reviews of other trip-advisor travellers, and they were so right! We would definately stay at this hotel again.</p></li>

Just staying there one night, I can tell you this hotel is amazing. Our room was beautiful, the service was top notch, the location was perfect( right next to Canton road where all the shopping is), right next to museums, good restaurants ( including 2 very upscale amazing restaurants in the hotel, Nobu and Spoons) Everything about this hotel was 5 star. If money isnt an issue, this is the place to stay. Was delighted with everything about it!PS- if you stay in Hong Kong you Must take the bus to Stanley Market. It is the 'Miami' of Hong Kong, with outside restaurants right on the water and a very fun and large market where you can get gifts for everyone back home!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic view We loved our stay at this hotel. Unfortunately it was only one night but we loved every minute of it!We were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was great. Heaps of room, a lovely view and a fantastic bathroom. The bed was huge and had lots of fluffy pillows. The TV was nice, although positioned right in front of the view (the main reason we chose this hotel). The location is good for shopping - right at the bottom of Nathan Road - although we ended up heading to Causeway Bay for shopping. We loved being right on the water at night though - great view of the light show and so close for a walk after dinner. The restaurant was very nice (although turned out to be very expensive) and again, we loved the view. The staff were very nice and the butler service to draw a bath was a really nice touch.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Views, the best from the outside you couldn't guess what expects you. Regular building without any particular atraction despite being on the waterfront. By the same second the doormen open the doors for you, you will be flabergasted with the lobby view. Wiith 2 floor size glass you have a great view of Vitoria Harbour. The kind of view, you just want to sit and be quiet. For all this you must request an Harbour View Room, unless you be happy only with the lobby. Big rooms, nice and cosy beds. Confortable pillows. Electric blinds. Extra modern sound system. Spacious bathroom room. The breakfast is also with the same view and the food is great. Nice shoppig area inside hotel. 2 famous restaurants NOBU  Alain Ducasse. And is just a 5 minute walk from Tsin Sha Tsui Star Ferry Terminal. Great location and a great hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stunning Views We stayed here for the first leg of our honeymoon and what a fabulous hotel. The rooms are spacious, spotless, all ameniities you would expect, including ipod dock for Bose sound system. We got an upgrade from a plaza view to harbour view suite with jacuzzi and steamroom for less than a third of the published price when I explained to the reception we were on honeymoon and my wife was upset we didnt have a harbour view! (We were also offered a standard room with harbour view at no additional cost!)We ate in the Nobu restaurant, one of 5 or 6 within the hotel which was first class. The conceirge was very helpful on more than one occasion and all the staff were extremeley polite at all times. The pool area is lovely and has two infinity spa pools overlooking Hong Island across the harbour!A truly wonderful stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hong Kong Room with The View I recently returned after a one week stay at the Intercontinental Hong Kong, this place shows the rest of the world how to run a luxury hotel. As Ambassador Club member we were meet at the airport and whisked into the night after a 18 hour flight directly to our room for check-in. Great touch after a long flight. The View is by far the best in Hong Kong, the nightly laser/light show is not to be missed. The Buffet breakfast is probably one of the best in the World, The dinner is also impressive. The Bar with the View is amongst the best in the world for view,service,facilites,live music. It is convenient to everything. The pool and spa is world-class also. If it sounds like I am impressed by this place-you are correct. The steak house restaurant is great, and I am from Texas-where we know beef! Over-all this place rocks...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfection The views from the hotel are probably the best possible to see the harbor which is everchanging and fascinating to take in. The service was very attentive, they remembered my name, how I liked my room prepared during the two weeks I stayed there. There seemed to be no request however simple and small that was too much trouble for them, and I noticed large events were gorgeous. The hotel is a wonderful place to eat, spend time in, return to after a hard day work or sightseeing as the location is very easy to transport to and from. The view from the immaculate and hygenic whirlpools, pool and lounge areas where you can also order food and drinks is wonderful, intersting, romantic, engaging and everchanging. As a solo woman traveller I felt completely safe, cared for and attended to as well as if I had been travelling with a companion in the dining areas etc.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Definitely HK's BEST! I stayed in Intercontinental Hong Kong for 2 nights and it was so fantastic! Perfect location for shopping, walking down to the shopping centers and all the boutiques there. just right next to the harbor. If you'd love to enjoy cruises passing by just outside your window, you might wanna book a harbor view room, which is so good! the view is so fantastic especially when it comes at night. you won't forget the view that the room has! well, staff is ok, nothing special, maybe it's because they are having great numbers of travelers staying in. but i found the staff is quite ok. rooms are big enough. oh, u should not forget the whirlpool here. try it at night! fantastic view at night. outdoor whirlpool. u might also wanna try the dinner at the cafe. pretty pricey but worth it though for the view. well, the hotel is pretty pricey but it has the best that HK can offer.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lovely hotel We always try to stay here when visiting Hong Kong, because the views over the harbour are wonderful, and the service is so good as well. We were greeted outside as soon as our car pulled up and led straight to our room to check in. We needed a room early and one had been made ready for us. We chose to book use of the Club lounge, which offers an excellent breakfast buffet, afternoon tea with sandwiches and cakes, and evening cocktails and canapes, which are all marvellous. The staff are also happy to make pots of tea at any time, and welcomed us back as soon as we arrived.The rooms are a good size and the bathrooms are excellent, with separate walk-in showers. The Bvlgari toiletries are very high quality.Only criticisms - the rooms have been refurbished recently. They look lovely but don't have quite enough storage space for two people's things, and we also found the bed uncomfortable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Never Again! On reading BENLEE123's review of this hotel, I decided to take the plunge and book into this hotel over the holidays in a HARBOUR VIEW SUITE as suggested. The room was dated, our harbour view was one little side view. I basicly fell for BENLEE's comments because he/she stated that their favorite hotel was the Four Seasons and so is mine. Better than the FS, NEVER in a million years. We fled the buffet down stairs, however the conciege managed to secure us a table in the Steak Restaurant which was nice. The views are not as spectacular as other hotels in HK and after our stay in this hotel I would never book the IC in any country in the world again. I will stay with Four Seasons knowing that they will provide me with the best service and will compliment my vacation with Four Season style. When I tried to move locations the FS was booked, but we managed to stay at the Grand Hyatt HK and that was much better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Best Place to stay in Hong Kong Stayed at the Intercontinental for business, based solely on a desire for Priority Club reward points, and found myself extremely impressed! After looking at other hotels around town, I am convinced this is the best in terms of value and service.The location is excellent, being a 10 minute walk from a ferry port to the island. This ferry port is rarely busy, since most of the traffic and tourists use the main ferry port. That alone is worth the stay. Short walk to the subway inland.Small shopping area directly across from hotel. Foot traffic is busy here, but not overwhelming like the rest of Hong Kong can be. I felt safe walking around the area at night, but did get quietly propositioned by hookers twice.Rooms are immaculate, and the service is exceptional. The lobby bar is great and I had several impromptu business meetings. The views of the harbor from the hotel rooms are beautiful!Highly recommended!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Highlight of Hong Kong visit We have recently returned from a five day stay in Hong Kong at the Intercontinental and feel the experience at the hotel was the highlight of our visit. The views of Hong Kong harbour from our room were spectacular and watching the activities in the harbour highly entertaining. The room itself was nicely decorated and the marble bathroom was certainly large by most hotel standards and had every possible amenity. We signed up for the Intercontinental Club which was well worth the additional charge as it offered and excellent breakfast, tea service and drinks with hors d'oeuvres before dinner. The manager of the club was very helpful with recommendations for shopping, and sightseeing or whatever question we had. The restaurants in the hotel were uniformly first rate. Service was uniformly highly attentive and spoiled us for other hotels and restaurants. The Intercontinental in every way earned the rate charged.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Without a doubt, the best! We have just returned from honeymoon in HK, Oz and Bali. We stayed in all 5 star hotels/resorts, and without a doubt, the IC Hong Kong was the best hotel experience. We had expected great things from the hotel, given all of the reviews we had read before going. We were in no way disappointed. The service is world-class, the views and amenities fabulous. The food is incredible. There is very little that I can add by way of additional information, in comparison to what other reviewers have posted. However, when a hotel pool (which has outstanding backdrop views) has staff to bring you a small tray with a cold water spray pump, face towels, a do not disturb sign and a wake-up call request form, before your backside even hits the sun lounger, you know you are onto a good thing. I could not recommend this hotel highly enough. While the rates are relatively steep, you certainly get what you pay for, and more (we were upgraded to a harbour view suite).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Satisfactory I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights from 1 May. My room was on the 7th Floor and was not a harbour view. The view we got was a construction they are doing on their pool/ spa floor.But the room was very clean, very nicely maintained, and big enough for two of us. Since the main concern for me is cleanliness, I was very satisfied with the room.Also the concierge was very helpful in booking our tour to Macau. He was very friendly and very professional.The only fault I found with the hotel is staff at the bar in the reception floor. We went there to have a glass of drink at late night. Tthe view from their big window looking out to the harbour was spectacular but could not see any smiles on the face of staff working there. Maybe they were too exhausted from a busy day, but with the price we paid, we'd have appreciated more friendliness!The location of the hotel was perfect, very close to Nathan Street where you can find mostly anything. Overall I was very satisfied with my stay at the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the View but Service was not Great No view like it, there is no doubt... but we had to struggle to get it! Booked a Deluxe Harbour View, and expected an upgrade being an Ambassador Club member. Was offered a jr. suite in the corner of the 2nd floor, old room and certainly not the view I came for... lots of sighing as we pressed our point. Finally found a room on the 17th floor but demanded an extra fee for a renovated room which I had booked- I paid it unhappily and will write to IC about this, really absurd. However, the room WAS fabulous, double sized with terrific amenities. The bath was wonderful, plan on replicating it at home. Food was fabulous, by all means do include the buffet as it the best I saw in 42 days of travel around the world. The jacuzzis were very nice and the lobby bar was great, if difficult to get away from the heavy smokers. To sum up, hotel was lovely, service was good once I got past the check in desk difficulties, and all is forgotten once you see the harbour spread in front of you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Must be the best hotel in Hong Kong... Stayed here in November 2006, on our first visit to Hong Kong. We'd originally chosen another hotel, but changed to the Intercontinental on a recommendation, and proved to be thr right choice. Room was stunning (Deluxe Harbour View), on the 11th floor, with massive bed and fantastic view, straight onto Hong Kong Harbour. This makes it worth the money alone!!The lobby is fantastic - a great place to sit for a drink. Service was simply impeccable, check-in was completed in room, we were met at the door by the staff who knew we were arriving, and simply whisked through the whole process without any hassle. Concierge was terrific, with reccomendations of restaurants, and booking, and giving of directions, with no hassle.Visited the Peninsula, and preferred the Intercontinental for it's location, and general atmosphere - less stuffy and formal than the Peninsula, it seemed to fit the city better, being younger, more progressive, and generally more modern and stylish.Couldn't fault it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Impeccable, Simply Impeccable I stayed at this hotel for a week last year...my experience was amazing! The staff there is highly trained and ready to meet your requests at the drop of a hat. Try calling the front desk and asking for extra pillows..you will literally hear a knock at your door minutes later. The breakfast buffet was the best...they have the freshest fruits! Enjoy a cup of tea to end the night at the Lobby Lounge and enjoy the fantastic view of the harbor..it's breathtaking. Spoon is a great restaurant probably my favorite...order the set dinner menu..you won't be disappointed but definately stuffed at the end! Yu is great for fish but i heard it's about to close soon because Nobu is moving in. OHH!! the gym for you workout fanatics is incredible....the minute you step on a machine there will be someone there to bring you a towel and a bottle water..the spa is great too! Ask for Judy...she can give a great deep tissue massage! I hope this helps...it seriously is the best hotel in Hong Kong...even the locals would agree.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Expensive View Hotel is very expensive - you are just paying for the view. This is a great view, but we would go cheaper next time. The room was clean, large, with great bathroom facilities, all the little touches had been thought out and noticed, room service very prompt and efficient. The only downside, was the reception area/lobby/lounge, as there are alot of non-residents coming in for afternoon tea, and it doesn't matter that you are staying there and would like a table, or need a drink, you have to get to the back of the queue and wait. After searching the hotel for another bar area (it was only 4pm) and getting nowhere with the staff we left and went out for a drink instead. Also have to say that when you leave the hotel and wait at the main doors for a taxi, don't expect the 10 or so staff to acknowledge you whatsoever, even though its there job to get you a car or taxi. Just to point out we were staying there for 4 days and each day was the same.... It鈥檚 very disorganized. Now we have done it we will stay elsewhere in future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Breathtaking Harbor Views We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights at the tail end of a very exhausting two week SE Asia trip. This was the icing on the cake. The views of the harbor are spectacular! We booked a standard room, but because the hotel is doing renovations and the initial room they assigned us was loud, we were moved and fabulously upgraded to a 1.5 bath multi-room suite with a harbor view. The breakfast roomservice was amazing with HK Island in the background! We highly recommend the spa services. The massages and facials, especially. You can also book some private time (alone or with a partner) to use their sauna, steam room, and hot tub. A nice way to relax. The pool and 3 smaller pools overlooking the harbor are spectacular. We were only disappointed that it poured rain most of the time, and so we did not enjoy the pools as much as we had wanted to. We ate at Spoon which also overlooks the harbor. It was a nice treat. The hotel also stored some of our bags while we roamed SE Asia (we landed in HK first) which was really nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fabulous hotel We have just returned from our honeymoon where we spent 5 nights at the IC Hong Kong. We had arranged the limosine service from the airport, and when we arrived we were taken straight to the car. Arrival at the hotel was even more impressive. The driver had telephoned the hotel in advance to let them know we were on the way. When we arrived at the hotel we had a row of people waiting for us outside, congratulating us on our marraige and we were taken straight to our room bypassing check-in.The room was gorgeous with breathtaking views. We had a bottle of Moet and strawberries set out beautifully for us, and each day we had fresh fruit, green tea and bottled water delivered.We didnt eat in the hotel of an evening but had cocktails and snacks in the lobby bar. We took advantage of late check out which was very handy as flight home wasnt till midnight.All in all a fabulous hotel, with fabulous serviceOne last thing.................there is always a lift available any time of the day as soon as the button pressed. no waiting for 5 mins!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Superb! Well, I'm typing this in our junior suite at the Intercontinental and I really cannot work out what the recent negative reviewers were looking at. Perhaps they stayed in the 'other' Intercontinental in Hong Kong - the Grand Stanford... can't comment on that because we've never been there.We arrived here on Tuesday 30th Jan 2007 and straight away were hugely impressed. The hotel limousine collected us from the aiport and we were ushered in to the hotel, some 45 minutes later, as if we were royalty! The view from the room is magnificent, the food is excellent - especially in the steak house - and the overall service is polite, courteous and faultless.Expensive? A little - but then you are in one of the leading hotels in a major city of the world, so you would not expect 'bargain break' rates. Compared to the Intercontinental in New York, this place is streets ahead in every way.Ignore the 'nay-sayers' - some people actively search for stuff to complain about... and they must have spent a whole lot more time searching than enjoying themselves!Terence Watts</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic views, fantastic hotel I stayed at the InterContinental Hotel in Hong Kong at the end of May and again in mid-June. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay on both occasions. Upon arriving at the hotel you are greeted with sweeping views of Hong Kong by a check-in staff that is very efficient and welcoming. The rooms are nicely furnished with flat screen TVs and reasonably spacious, with bathrooms that have a separate shower and bathtub. The restaurants and bars at the hotel are very high-end. Although I only ate breakfast at the hotel, the restaurant serving breakfast had a HUGE buffet (western  Asian breakfast foods), with tables that overlooked the harbor / skyline. Eating breakfast while staring out at the Hong Kong skyline was a great way to start the day.If you expect to spend most of your time on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong or plan to go to Hong Kong island but don't expect to stay out partying until the wee hours, I highly recommend this hotel. However, if you plan to go out late at night to bars/clubs, the commute back to the hotel at 2-4am can be a bit challenging (taxis don't like to make the trip), so you may prefer to pick a hotel on Hong Kong island.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Outstanding InterContinental Stayed at this hotel for three nights. Upon arrival at the airport in Hong Kong, if you haven't booked a transfer you can go to the hotel desk which is located within arrivals -they take your luggage to one of their cars which whisks you straight to the hotel. On arrival, we were directed to reception who took us straight up to our room on the 12th floor to complete check in. A few moments later, a pot of Jasmine tea was in the room as a complimentary welcome drink. Room was very large with a lovely double bed, and a seperate shower and sunken bath.We ate dinner two nights in the hotel, and lunch on day -the Steak restaurant is excellent, with fantastic beef and excellent service. 'Spoon' the French restaurant was also good, with lovely waterfront views, although the menu wasn't really to my taste. We ate lunch in the buffet style restaurant -but don't let the word 'buffet' put you off -the choice was mind blowing and you could also eat off the a la carte menu which was extensive.The pool area was spotless with an outdoor bar to get drinks or snacks from. Throughout the stay, the service was always excellent.All in all, I'd definitely return!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent hotel, spoiled by check in experience I booked my stay through AmEx Platinum Fine Hotels which brings a number of benefits including room upgrades, free breakfast, late check out etc. I travelled throughout Asia on the program and got upgraded to a suite in every hotel.Before I arrived at the InterContinental I checked the room availability and saw that they had rooms and suites available at every level so I was looking forward to getting another nice upgrade when I checked in.Instead they gave me a very ordinary, non-harbour facing room and when I questioned the check in clerk, he offered to give me a harbour view room for an additional HK$600 per night, a not so generous offer that I declined.Other than the sour start the hotel did a fine job. The staff were courteous and helpful, the food was good etc. The harbour view from the lobby (and harbour facing rooms!) is unbelievably spectacular.I few small quibbles. Charging over $20 per day for internet access when you charge over $400 per night for the room seems cheesey, when even $100 per night motels offer free internet access. Also there was no make up room card in the room and my room was never cleaned before noon on ech day of my stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">be wary of the 'Spoon' restaurant: overpriced and poor cooking We booked ourselves into the Spoon restaurant for my Birthday and despit my husband informing all staff that it was a special occassion, not one person extended any congratulations.We booked ourselves into the sexy sunset dinner - times for which were misadvertised in the local paper where. We literally had our food thrown at us which, we would not have minded had it been any good. The scallops to start were stone cold and very undergarnished, the garden as a main is little more than a bowl of steamed side veggies that in any other hotel you wuld have as a side dish. The tuna was well cooked but was a VERY bad piece of meat. Dessert was terrible - all I can say is thank god for the decent wine lovely company and stunning views. It is the only thing lifting this restaurant out of the doldrums. Beware - it is very overpriced, 拢140 all in and that was at 40% of the normal price. Avoid at all costs and, instead, make use of the drinks facility in the lobby where the views are equally as stunning - but it is much kinder to your wallet and stomach!As an alternative for a special occassion I canot recommend the Peak Lookout restaurant enough. It makes spoon look like MacDonalds!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very Good We stayed here for 3 nights and we had a fantastic view over the water. Just couldnt stop looking at the view. One morning we opened the blind and a cruise ship was going past, felt like it was in the room. The view at night is very nice.We ate in the oriental resturant one evening this was very good.The breakfast was very good, so much to choose from, pastries, juices, cereals. fresh fruit, dumplins, hot food including bacon eggs ect. cheese breads and lots more.On our first day we went to Aberdeen and took a boat along the river to see the sandpanners very good. Then we went to The Peak one of highest parts of Hongkong a very good view of the city from here, we went down by the tram which was good. After this we went to Ocean Park to see the Giant Pandas. Its very hot here so drink lots of water and try and keep out of the sun.On the second day we went to Stanley Market, this was very good and worth going to lots of stores and some good things to buy if you look carefully.We also went along Nathan street lots of shops but you do get bothered a lot by people trying to get you to go into there shops which I didnt like very much but still worth haveing a look.Also went on the star ferry across the water which was ok.Really enjoyed Hongkong and would love to go again one day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Outstanding waterfront views and location Having stayed at HK Peninsula on last trip, we decided to save a little money on this trip and stay at Intercontinental because we had a larger group that required three rooms.Excellent decision. While we appreciated the history and ambiance of the Peninsula, we did not like the lack of views. The Intercontinental is now our first choice for several reasons. The views of downtown Hong Kong are impressive and hit you immediately as you walk in to the hotel. For HK first timers joining us, first impressions mattered and they fell in love with HK right away.We were upgraded to a suite. No reason was given and we didn't ask. In fact, we were not even told and discovered it only upon entering our room. We did book three waterfront rooms for four days, so maybe that was enough to earn a suite? The suite was not just a typical junior suite either...it was a true three room suite with bedroom, living area and dining room. We never did order room service, but the dining room had the best views and it would have been a great decision to dine in the suite.Breakfast buffet was better than Peninsula as well...so overall, we now feel that Intercontinental is better choice and would rate it better. One other advantage...it is connected to a large shopping center.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">beautiful hotel - very bad customer service experience The Intercontinental was a BEAUTIFUL HOTEL, in a great location and amazing views of the Harbor. Unfortunately, this great experience was seriously poluted by a very negative customer service experience.I was told that room I reserved (King Size / HK Harbor view) and confirmed via phone 1 day prior was not available, made to wait with my wife and our luggage in the lobby for approximately 45 minutes, arguing with numerous employees. The room was in fact available the entire time, and finally given to me 45 minutes later after arguing with numerous employees only after I demanded an available suite for the for the same price. The person on duty did not want to give a suite away for a lower price, and then finally decided to give me the room I had originally booked (King Size/Harbor view). I am not used to this kind of service and getting into verbal confrontations with employees at hotels of this caliber/price range, and this experience gave me a negative and uncomfortable feeling to the entire stay. To date, all Intercontinental Group was offering was an upgrade on a future stay. Not in my opinion the best way to win back a customer that they most likely lost.Other then this experience, the hotel property was beautiful, and the location/view beautiful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Best hotel in the world?! I have stayed here on business a number of times over the last few years (before their rates and my travel budget fell out!) and i have always been very impressed. So much so that I even book it for our honeymoon and it didn't disappoint. My wife was blown away by the place and it was perfect for the 3 days we spend in Hong Kong.The restaurants in the place are amazing, Spoon and Nobu in particular are probably 2 of the best restaurants in the world let alone Hong Kong. The breakfast buffet is also amazing with a ridiculous amount of choice that caters for worldwide tastes.The rooms are very well appointed with large flat screen tv's, ipod docks, Bose sound systems, Wifi and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. They are also on the whole very spacious particular if you go for the junior suite with dressing room! If your budget can stretch to it go for a harbor view room - what a view - it has to be one of the best in Hong Kong and for a city renowned for its views thats saying something.The location is also good, just a short walk to the star ferry in Kowloon. One of the real highlights has to be the pools. 2 infinity pool (at bath temperature) offer great views out over the harbor - the perfect place for an evening beer!Would i recommend it? Definitely, without a doubt.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Best Location in Hong Kong I stayed at the Intercontinental HK (used to be the Regent)for the second time in March 2006. The first time had been in 1985 and it was just as incredible as I had remembered....maybe even better!!!!! While most people think of the Peninsula Hotel (across the street!) as having the best location, I disagree. All of the 'harbour view' rooms at the Intercontinental have floor to ceiling windows facing the most incredible view of the very active harbour and the Central district across the water. The 24 hour butler service was amazing, the concierge was always helpful with reservations, directions, etc. Have the hotel pick you up at the airport....well worh the US$100 after the 16 hr flight from JFK (on Cathay Pacific, of course!) The rooms are magnificent, restaurants too. The breakfast buffet is one of the best in the world! It is lacking nothing!!! Tea in the lobby is a must too! Hong Kong is an extremely easy city to navigate.....the MTR system is clean, efficient, safe......DO use it. And the TST stop is just a very short walk from the hotel. Yes, the hotel is very expensive, but very worth it. My only complaint is that they charge US$20 per day for internet connection. That seems ridiculous! Would I go back to Hong Kong? In a heartbeat! Would I return to the Intercontinental? Absolutely!</p></li>

I struggled with the cost initially but who knows when I will be back in Hong Kong so why not splurge! (I did spend a lot on airline tickets so why stop there) As stated before, the views are the BEST. Book a harbour view and you will love the views from your hotel window. The rooms and beds are very comfortable and nice with Bose Sound systems (we had Ipods and loved this system for in room music) The lobby also has impressive views of the harbor and he laser show at night. The food and drink int the lobby are expensive but I don't think anything compares to high tea or a cocktail while watching the harbour activities. The location is also excellent. The Intercon is attached to a shopping mall with great stores and a grocery store. Also attached is the MTR station which takes you anywhere you want to go and is very easy to naviigate (skip the expensive cabs and experience this transit system). A quick walk to the other side of the street for more shopping great restaurants, massages etc. and walking distance to the Star Ferry to cross to Hong Kong Island. Must see Victorias Peak and plan to spend some time there - lots of shops/restaurants at top. The hotel concierge is excellent and a big help. Hong Kong is fabulous!!! Enjoy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Easily the best hotel we have ever stayed in! We stayed at the glorious InterContinental for 4 nights as part of our honeymoon in Hong Kong and were absolutely delighted with our stay.Check-in was smooth and efficient and we had been upgraded to a junior suite. Champagne was also provided on arrival, as well as strawberries and melted chocolate which was a very nice touch. The view from our room was almost hypnotic - you could watch the constantly changing vista for hours!The service from all of the staff members was excellent from start to finish, and the concierge was particularly helpful. We also called in to the Peninsula Hotel for afternoon tea and were very glad that we had chosen the IC, as the staff there were dismissive and slightly surly. Although the Peninsula may have a better reputation, they do not have the same attention to detail for service, we found. We also called into the Mandarin Oriental for lunch, but we found it to be less modern than the fabulous InterContinental.Drinks in the bar in the lobby, overlooking the harbour view, were a fun way to round off an evening. And the great views from the infinity pool at the spa were a lovely way to relax from a day's sightseeing. The InterContinental really is an oasis of calm in busy Hong Kong.Highly recommend this hotel - we will not stay anywhere else in HK.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Faultless. Enjoyed our stay at Intercontinental as a stopover en-route to Australia. At the time of choosing the hotel we spent a great deal of time selecting the hotel with the best view. Upon walking into the Lobby area, we were hit by the most fantastic floor to ceiling windows and breathtaking view of Hong Kong island by night. Check-in was painless and efficient, very friendly staff. As for the room, well... I had booked a Deluxe Harbour View Room - and spent many an hour trying to find pictures of them on various websites. I need not have worried, it is probably the only time I have ever walked into a hotel room and had no other thought than 'wow!'. There is no other way to describe it.Looking for somewhere to eat on the first night of our stay we decided to go for the Hotel Buffet and were seated quickly. It was soon after sitting down that we realised the price given to us of HKD 400 each was quite expensive as all we really wanted was a snack. The bar on the ground floor level was much better suited for this and more reasonably priced with a very casual menu. Perfect! Overall a thoroughly enjoyable stay at the Intercontinental. I can't fault the hotel, and do not understand how it is not rated higher on the list of Hong kong Hotels... almost for the view alone! The hotels rated higher must be very very special indeed!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overpriced and under renovation We stayed 1 night in a Harbour view room. It's true that the view is amazing, really fascinating so that's a good point. The room itself is nice but would need some redecoration. It's not at the level of Four Seasons for example. You can feel it has lived many years but still, it's OK. It's just not a good value for the money you pay (in our case we paid 3800++HKD/night without breakfast).The breakfast was 560HKD for 2 !!!!! it was a very nice buffet but it's really overpriced for a breakfast. The service wasn't good, you have to wait for your hot drinks and the waiters seem unhappy to be working here... Overall the service isn't good, it's very impersonal.We tried a massage at the Spa, the massage itself was really great. The settings are under massive renovations so it doesn't look good.All the facilities are under renovation, so you should better take this in consideration. It's supposed to last until June.We went to Nobu for dinner and were very dissapointed. The service was a disaster, not only at our table as we overhead other customers complaining. The food is Okay but really nothing special and the prices are really high...So overall, once you enter this hotel you know you'll spend a great amount of money for something that is not so unforgettable.It's a pity as the setting is really unique.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic harbor views Recently visited HK for a long weekend. While on the Kowloon side, the Intercon Hong Kong is worth a visit. We arrived quite late and the check was immediate and hassle free. Spacious room overall, comfy bed, new, flat screen tvs with Bose surround sound, large bathroom. Amenities are Elemis - the Intercon standard. Huge window looks out across the harbor providing you with wonderful views - day and night. Excellent service - very attentive, friendly staff. Helpful concierge. Lobby lounge faces downtown HK with massive floor to ceiling windows making it a great place to have a drink while taking in the magnificent skyline. One of the best hotel gyms I've been to in a very long time. All new equipment, huge variety and plenty of space - you do not feel at all crammed. Large pool - with great bar service - and wonderful adjoining infinity jacuzzi open til late evening - again looks out at the harbor. For those wanting to travel across to Central, it is a ten-minute walk to the Star Ferry so very easy to pop back and forth. Also, taxis are quite affordable and the best option late at night. I liked the hotel because it is not stuffy and for a large hotel, it doesn't have that large hotel feel. If you stay at this hotel, you must book a room with a view. It is worth the extra money. I have stayed at many Intercontinentals and this has been my favorite to date.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful hotel to make our Honeymoon perfect Wonderful Hotel, the corner suite was out of this world, the view of the Harbour was unbelievable.This was an exceptional room. Many of the days we stayed in our room into the afternoon and were never disturbed but a courteous note left to buzz when we left so they could make the room up. These corner quites are great as at the end of the corridoor you have your own personal foyer that only 1 other suite shares.Food in the Hotel was OK, however we found the food throughout Hong Kong to be a little different from what we were used to elsewhere, I feel this was more to the European Palate.Do get the eyewitness guide to Hong Kong and discover those places off the beaten track. We found Kowloon City Garden an absolute find, it's not visited much by westerners and is an absolute find.Just walk around this city for hours on end it's amazing, the hotel is right next to a shopping plaza (Yes Tony and Guy is opening there soon for those who like to get their hair done when on a long holiday!)Stunning location, great staff and just a perfect start to our Honeymoon.We received complementry Champagne and Strawberries with Chocolate sauce, my Husband hates Strawberries, but loved these!This Hotel is perfect, when staying here make sure you have a room overlooking the Harbour as that's what you really go for.I can't wait to go back, and this time for longer!</p></li>

<li>We found Kowloon City Garden an absolute find, it's not visited much by westerners and is an absolute find.Just walk around this city for hours on end it's amazing, the hotel is right next to a shopping plaza (Yes Tony and Guy is opening there soon for those who like to get their hair done when on a long holiday!</br>

<li>)Stunning location, great staff and just a perfect start to our Honeymoon.We received complementry Champagne and Strawberries with Chocolate sauce, my Husband hates Strawberries, but loved these!This Hotel is perfect, when staying here make sure you have a room overlooking the Harbour as that's what you really go for.I can't wait to go back, and this time for longer!</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel I stayed in the Intercontinental at the beginning of October and was really pleased. The rooms and bathrooms are of a very high standard and are fairly big for Hong Kong. The furnishings are of an excellent quality. Service is very good, just press the butler button and somebody contacts you straight away.Hotel restaurants in Hong Kong are always of a very high standard, which they are particularly so here. However, for this reason they attract a lot of people who are not staying in the hotel, so it may be a good idea to book as they can get very busy. For this reason the hotel lobby area is usually very busy as there are people coming to drink in the lobby lounge with the amazing view across the harbour. The hotel buffet is excellent and it is tempting to be a glutton and eat three lobsters as I did.The pool area is amazing, with views across to Hong Kong island. There is one large pool for swimming and two jacuzzi for lazing around in.The location is great, in terms of views and also getting elsewhere. They do seem to have changed all the access under Sailsbury road, which was a bit confusing after my previous visit 7 years ago, but you soon find your way around and have easy access to the MTR. Tsim Sha Tsui is a great shopping area, however it becomes very annoying on Nathan Road with people hassling you to buy copy watches, suits etc.In summary, this is an excellent hotel with great service and I would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sadly, I have to report less pleasant experiences about this hotel We are frequent visitors to Hong Kong and are aware of this this hotel in an eye catching location of Kowloon. I booked a standard room there for 3 nights using my Priority Club points, and that maybe the reason of our treatment.I am a Platinum member normally treated at least cordially, but this hotel seems to treat reward stay guests as a act of charity. We where given the smallest room (according to the floor plan, only one such room exists on each floor) on the lowest floor more suitable for a single, with barely enough space to walk pass each other. I expected standard room for reward night means standard like anywhere else I stayed, but not here. We had to call for a tea tray as it was not provided in the room, a kettle was delivered with some sachels of 3 in 1 coffee. Since I do not take sugar and my wife does not take coffee, that was not much use. My wife called the next day to stock the tray with some tea, some tea bags were delivered but without milk...One would think such 5 star hotel can at least provide a well stock tea tray...makes you wonder was it incompetence, or deliberate policy to provide the bare minimum for reward night guests...The view from the hotel is excellent, but if you know Hong Kong, there are countless 5 star hotels with just as good view. Hotels need to provide more that just view/location to attract returning guests, I certainly will not.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved this hotel My friend and I had a girls week away to Hong Kong and stayed at this hotel. It was great. The location on Kowloon is good. The hotel is large and looks very dated and pretty ugly from the outside but don't let this put you off. The inside is spacious and modern. The staff are very attentive and helpful. The rooms are spacious with good views whichever side you are on. We did not pay the premium for the harbour view but we had a view over Kowloon and towards the Peninsula. The bathroom was massive with nice toiletries and lots of fluffy towels. We had the Sunday Champagne Brunch which is a must. Endless champers and all the food you could want, including caviar and lobster and the best view. The bar area is great and the view over to Hong Kong Island is just wonderful. Each night we would start the evening with a cocktail in the bar overlooking the island with all the buildings lit up and then head off to the island in a taxi. The bars and clubs are definately better on the island but staying on Kowloon is not a problem as the taxi's are plentiful and cheap. Also the spa, gym and pool were really nice, especially the infinity pool over Victoria Harbour where you can loung around watching all the harbour life. I had stayed at the Peninsula the time before but would stay at the Intercontinental again over the Peninsula as it was better value for money, the basic rooms are bigger and better and the pool and views from the bar much better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">An extremely comfortable stay! My wife and I stayed at the Intercontinental for 3 days. The service and facilities are impeccable. Our harbour view room was clean, spacious and decked out with contemporary Asian furnishings and decor.The newly renovated pool area is fabulous and we could have spent all day there. Three spa baths adjacent to the octagonal pool are maintained at various different temperatures, 18, 30 and 40 degrees. Frolicking in the various bathing areas was a refreshing break from the Hong Kong humidity and air pollution. The hotel is actually under the main departing flight path, but watching the various jets flying overhead in the late evening while lying on a pool lounge was strangely relaxing.The real highlight for me was the buffet breakfast in the morning. I've experienced a lot of 5 star hotel buffets, but this was probably the best I've tried. So much variety that even the fussiest palate is sure to be satisfied. The Intercontinental also has one of the most expensive mini-bars I've encountered and we made regular trips to the 7-11 across the road to get our drink and alcohol fixes. Actually there is a VERY nice supermarket on the fourth (4th) floor of the adjacent 'New World Center' shopping mall. Highly recommended unless you want to pay $10 for a can of coke. On the positive side, plenty of distilled water is provided by the hotel. My wife reports that the Swedish massage in the I-Spa is very nice and decent value also. We would definitely come here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Best of the best Why would anyone stay at the Peninsula?? After my recent 12th stay at the Intercon HK, and many visits to the Pen for meals, etc., that is how I would sum it up. Each time I go, I can see that the hotel has improved more each time--after seeming perfect each time. The staff are a notch above those at other hotels in Hong Kong and elsewhere--bright, friendly, attentive and on the ball. Spot on in every sense of the word.I agree with all the other reviews regarding the pool, rooms, views, etc. I would add one new element I haven't seen here--the Harborside Restaurant. It is the more cafe style restaurant, but world class in every way. Try the dinner buffet. Many items to select from, but the quality is the star here. Almost every item it's the same. Sushi? Yes, but the best I have ever had--even at the best sushi restaurants. Roast beef? Of course, but in this case, the best roast beef I have ever had anywhere. And so on with many of the items. Best I have tasted--and I have eaten at 3 or 4 of the 3 Michelin star restaurants in Paris.(the Verandah at the Pen is nice, but lame, lame, lame by comparison)At the Intercontinental HK, you are in for a treat unlike you have ever had. No disrespect to Intercontinental, but don't pre-judge this one by any other image or experience you have had at another Intercontinental. This hotel surpasses Four Seasons, Peninsulas, Ritz Carlton's and everything else.It is my wife and I's favorite place in the world.I end as I began, Why would anyone stay at the Peninsula?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Glitzy, sleek, lukewarm Stayed here for 2 days Thanksgiving weekend, harbor view room. Really beautifully decorated room, stunning view. Service was professional throughout, but not as warm as Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong or Metropark Causeway Bay Hong Kong. The hotel is very glitzy, glam, with star chef having opened restaurants there or about to...but there's nothing incredible about the hotel besides the lounge (the view! the view!) in the lobby, or the views of the harbor. It's very posh but left me cold. The Lowest Internet Rate Guarantee is misleadingly named; one can find lower rates on the internet, through Web site travel agents (not the instant confirmers like Expedia, etc.). This hotel seems much more geared to charging for everything possible than some local competitors (if you get a locker in the spa, you sign a really charming receipt that says you'll pay 400 HKD if robes and slipper aren't returned. I overheard a waiter in Harbourside restaurant tell a guest who asked for a napkin to carry a couple of small breakfast pastries to finish later that they'd have to charge extra for her carrying out more than one...TACKY!) A tourist class hotel has a business center that allows free Internet usage in bus. ctr.; IC charges $100 HKD for 30 minutes!The room size and decoration was amazing, however, and overall I had a positive experience. But you can get plenty of harbor view if you hang out in the lounge and don't pay the huge extra fees for harbor view; or, stay somewhere else and enjoy a drink in the lounge at night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Far better than you expect from an IC! Spent 2 nights in a 70 sq metre Executive Suite, upgraded from a standard room due to my Royal Ambassador status. The refurbished rooms are fantastic (bathrooms not redone but mine looked pretty new anyway). 37 inch TV, Bose hi-fi / DVD, antiques in the corner, very classy decor. The suite was triangular, with the long side being one long 30 foot window overlooking the harbour - astounding.Breakfast buffet was high quality, albeit very busy. I never tried any of the restaurants, but there are five, I think, including an Alain Ducasse. The staff are excellent here, far better than you expect at an IC. They are copying the Pen across the road, down to the white-hatted door openers and the Rolls-Royce available for hire! The IC may not have the same cachet, but the rooms must be better post refurb, the view is certainly better and it is cheaper.My only issue was that Salisbury Road is undergoing construction, so a 30 second walk across the road takes 3-4 minutes negotiating the subway, which diverts into a shopping centre before emerging! But that is not the hotels fault and is only short-term.Hint - if you staying over a weekend, join the IC Ambassador loyalty scheme before you go. Its $150 to join but you get a voucher for a free weekend night - and a night here is more than $150. You also get a one-level upgrade and a free Pay TV movie, so you can't lose. You can join via the IC website, and there are 3000 mile sign-up bonuses available for most major US airlines FF schemes - the IC forum on flyertalk[-] has the relevant URL's to quality.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Faultless service, breathtaking harbour views Perfect scores all round for this hotel. I stopped off in Hong Kong on the way back from Europe for 4 days, and will definitely stay at the Intercon again. From checkin to checkout, the service is superb, all staff smiling, enthusiastic, immaculate and with initiative, especially those in the Club lounge. You have to pay extra for a harbour view, but it is worth every cent, waking up to that amazing panorama (as the electric drapes open to unfold the drama on the harbour). I spent a lot of time sitting in the armchair just enjoying the view! After check in, Chinese tea and fruit are delivered with a welcome card. Nice touch. Bathroom very spacious and Housekeeping generous with replenishing full-size Bulgari toiletries. I took quite a load home, and won't need to buy shampoo or conditioner until next year! The gym is very impressive - for a fitness nut like me, the facilities (including a huge pool and day Spa) were heavenly, especially the extensive array of free weights (dumbells) and cardio machines. This is Hong Kong, so there is no shortage of shopping nearby. The MTR (metro, or underground train) is beneath the hotel, but quite a long trek to the platforms - something to note for the elderly, lazy or just plain unfit!Club lounge food presentations were excellent, in terms of quality and presentation. Unlike many Executive Floor or Club lounges which I've tried, this one is very spacious, and located on the 2nd floor, which is the perfect height for enjoying harbour views. Such a memorable experience, I cannot wait to return for Christmas!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The reviews don't lie - worthy of its #1 spot on Trip Advisor We booked this hotel because of its rating on Trip Advisor. We were a little nervous about this as our first choice had been to stay on HK Island at the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental. However it did not disappoint. Admittedly, at first we liked the hotel well enough but were not raving about it like the Trip Advisor reviewers. However over the course of the next 2 days it really grew on us. You cannot but help being charmed by the amazing sevice and attentiveness of the staff: * Always greeting you, calling the lift for you, anticipating your every need at meal times * Checking when you would like your room cleaned * Finding and returning the scarf I did not even realize I had lost * Concierge gives great advice and could not be more helpful - booking tickets to Macau, organising a private tour of the island * Room service is FAST and good quality - our early morning tea order arrived in less than 10 minutes * AMAZING food - fantastic buffet for breakfast and dinner and the most delicious, healthy spirulina juices every morning. Fantastic presentation of all the food and a huge variety of deserts, cakes and pastries at every meal* Fantastic lobby service - worth having tea or early evening drinks here* An added bonus for UK travellers - a direct English Sky News feed and English newspapers* The managers are very visible in looking after the guests and the staff and the fact everyone seems so happy to work here makes your stay even betterBasically, you just can't help but fall in love with the place and the excellent staff. It grows on you the longer your stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sheer Perfection Having just returned from a four day stay at The InterContinental, Hong Kong, I can only endorse the glowing reports already posted by previous reviewers.. My husband had wanted to stay at The Peninsula but having looked at the Trip Advisor comments I persuaded him to try the InterContinental instead. I admit to having had a few qualms as we drove up to the front of the hotel (not its best feature and a bit stark compared to the opulence of The Pen.) However from the moment we walked into the spacious lobby with its stunning views of the harbour and were greeted by the attentive, efficient and always smiling staff, we were totally 'hooked'. We had booked a Deluxe Harbour view room but were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a suite - again with amazing views and great facilities - (two large flat screen TVs, BOSE sound system, espresso machine and well equipped bathroom with sunken bath and Bulgari toiletries (Bliss!) It was a wrench to leave the room each day to explore the other delights of HK!) The hotel's facilities were altogether superb but the staff were what really made the stay so special. Whether in the corridors, lobby or at breakfast we were addressed by name and made to feel as though nothing was too much trouble. Incidentally, we did have afternoon tea at the Peninsula but felt that whilst the tea itself was good the hotel was in danger of seeing itself as more of a tourist attraction and Hong Kong institution rather than making its guests its top priority. The InterContinental on the other hand went out of its way to ensure we had a memorable stay. All in all, a memorable experience and one which we hope to repeat very soon!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Construction until June We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights at the end of March, using points. Due to a flight delay, we arrived in the evening, tired and hungry. After being escorted and checked-in into our rather small room for the 3 of us, we were advised that the hotel was under going some construction in various areas, including the pool from 9-6pm. We could, however use the pool next door at the Renaissance. ( We checked it out and didn't find it terribly convenient or attractive so we did not use it). The lobby area with it's bar and restaurant is very impressive and service outstanding. The entire hotel staff was professional and efficient. To us, the atmosphere felt like the hotel was geared more towards the business traveler, with just a touch of attitude. We had arrived from Thailand and gotten used to the warmth of the Thai people.The first morning, we discovered that our view was full on of the work site. We were not lucky enough to have been upgraded to a harbor view room, and although we used a hefty amount of points for our stay, we decided not to fuss to change our accommodations. Since we had unpacked and settled in, we remained in our room overlooking the construction site. As it turned out, we were out and about every day, all day, so any noise generated from the work outside did not really affect us. The view from one entire side and most of the front of the building is of improvement work being done.Overall, the hotel has a great harbor location and we had a pleasant stay. We would, however, recommend that if possible, any bookings with stays prior to the end of construction (sometime in June) should be done for rooms facing Hong Kong Island for the best experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Amazing views! We stayed at the InterContinental Hong Kong for 3 nights from December 14th. We had superior harbourview interconnecting rooms for oursleves and two children. When I first walked into the hotel, I couldn't believe my luck. The lobby and then bar lounge are all open plan with STUNNING views of Hong Kong harbour. I cannot believe that people have criticised the views and can only think they must have been thinking of another hotel! The view from the bar is like that from a movie - somehow it is unreal! Wonderful! The perfect place to have a drink!The rooms were furnished well although not in a really dynamic way. Your standard fixtures and fittings for a really nice hotel but nothing special. The bathrooms were lovely though with massive baths. Anyway, who cares about the furniture not being unique when your room opens up onto Hong Kong harbour. Every minute I spent in that room was in awe of the view!We ate in the Steak Restaurant and it was great. Pricey but then EVERYTHING in Hong Kong is expensive so don't go there if you aren't willing to pay the prices!!! The service was excellent and food fab too. The children had dinners that came in little boats that were filled with dry ice to puff out steam. What a hit!My partner has spent 9 months previously living in hotels in Hong Kong and was convinced that he wanted to go back to his normal haunt of the Mandarin Oriental. I convinced him to try the IC after reading reports and taking advice from a travel agent that The Mandy was a bit faded glory. We went to check out the Mandarin and were thrilled that we were at the IC instead!!!!!!!!!!All I can say is, pay the money for a room with a view and be prepared to spend money if you go to HK!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Exceptional hotel We stayed at the Intercontinental for 3 nights as a stop before going to Sydney and it was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in (we have stayed in a lot of hotels around the world!). After a 40 minute drive from the airport we arrived at the hotel and as we were on our honeymoon we made a point of telling them this and we were upgraded to a junior suite not easily though as we had to haggle for it! The only junior suite left was on the smoking floor which we did not want but we decided to check it out to see if it was ok before rejecting it. We were taken to our room and lead down a bamboo lined corridor and taken to the last set of double doors at the end. We went inside and were firstly shocked by how amazing the harbour view really was it was simply spectacular and as we arrived in the evening it looked even better. The suite was immaculate and had more than we could have wanted - we were even bought complementary chinese tea and fruit to welcome us. Over the 3 days we were at the hotel we visited the ispa twice and I have to tell you it is possible the best spa I have ever been to. We were treated like royalty and had several massages and treatments which were incredible. We also lounged by the pool and took a dip - you are looked after so well everywhere in this hotel. We also ate at NOBU which was also amazing - much better than London Nobu in my opinion. They really have thought of everything at this hotel and even things you would not have thought of! I would definitely recommend this hotel even if it is on the pricey side it is well worth it if only for the outstanding service, view and facilities. I would definitely stay here again - maybe on a second honeymoon...!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stay here if you can This hotel is FANTASTIC. Such a great location. We looked a number of properties to stay in in Hong Kong/Kowloon and choose this property for a combination of price, location and the room being offered. We looked at staying on Hong Kong island but having visited during the stay were so glad to have not. You get the best of the buzz of Hong Kong while being absolute waterfront and by far the best view in the house. The nightly light show is right there and you feel like you could almost touch it. You're also so close to everything. It's about 2 mins walk to the underground, 5 to the star ferry and about 30 secs from the start of the shopping. We were on our honeymooon and decided to upsize for this part of our trip (we'd been backpacking in europe) and stay in a junior suite. I'd like to see what else a 'full' suite offered as this had everything. Each suite comes with a butler service which included really nice touchs like a pot of green tea brought up shortly arter arrival which was a blend to help you acclimatise. We had a corner suite which meant the suite had a two section hallway, the main room (which had a sitting area, bed, corner desk area and views of the island and kowloon) a large dressing room, room with the bath and off this a shower room and separate toilet room. I've stayed at other places where a two bedroom two bathroom suite is smaller.The room also had all the appropriate technology components - great television with a nice bose sound system which was mostly hidden away (good sound without being intrusive - both new ideas for hotels), internet line in the desk area etc. The pool area was perfect to chill out in after a shopping/sightseeing trip and the spa treatments were great. Highly recommended if you can.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Room with a View (and a half) My wife and I stayed three nights in a Deluxe Harbour View room at the HK InterCon in early October.The hotel is large. The lobby is simply enormous and the fact that the property is connected to a shopping mall gives it a slightly impersonal feel. However, check-in is exceedingly slick, swift and personalised.The InterCon鈥檚 principal attraction is its views, which are probably unparallelled in HK - but for which you pay, of course. The rooms are somewhat dated but you forget this when looking out of the window. We found our room had a slightly musty smell, probably reflective of the location and climate, but the air-conditioning was too noisy to leave on at night. Bathrooms are adequate, with lovely Elemis amenities. The buffet breakfast provides a more than ample selection of Asian and Western food of good quality with eggs cooked freshly to order. The atmosphere is however rather canteen-like.The gym is modern, well-quipped and clean. The main disappointment for us was the spa - not only is it a little small (surprising for this property) but my wife was appalled to be told that she would have to pay extra if she wished to use the sauna or steam room before a treatment for which she had booked and was paying for.The 鈥淪poon鈥?restaurant, whilst excellent and trendy, was air-conditioned to the point of absurdity. Had we died there (which we might have done, had we not retrieved some thick clothing from our room) I reckon that our bodies would have been perfectly preserved for some years. Come with your coat and scarf.Overall the InterCon is functional and efficient but its value for money is questionable. For that reason it earns only a 4-star rating from this reviewer. It all really depends upon what value you assign to that view.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic hotel - beautiful rooms and fantastic service I booked this hotel based on the reviews from this website, and it was definitely the right choice! I booked a room for three people (paid 600 HK dollars extra for the third person), and when I checked in, I was told that I was supposed to request a cot online when I booked the room. I said I didn't realize that I had to pre-book a cot and that we needed a cot because we didn't want to sleep in a room with two queen or full-sized beds. The check-in desk informed me that the hotel was totally booked and most of the cots were spoken for because of the holidays. I insisted on waiting, and after a few minutes, they led us up to our room and soon thereafter a butler showed up with our cot. Other than this small hiccup which was taken care of right away, we had a fabulous stay at this hotel. The room (deluxe harborview) had an amazing view of hong kong. The room itself was very comfortable and large by hong kong hotel room standards. The bathroom is huge and really nice! We got welcome tea as soon as we arrived, which is also a nice touch. The only odd thing is that we did not get turndown service but it may have been because we only left the room for about 2 hours in the evening for dinner and the do not disturb sign was on before we left for dinner. The hotel lobby is really beautiful and the view from the lobby lounge is really breathtaking. We had dinner at a restaurant called the Prince Restaurant near the hotel, which a friend recommended, but I wish we had stayed at the hotel because they have tons of restaurant options which seemed popular. I would try the Harborview buffet, Nobu or Spoon (alain ducasse). The drinks in the lobby lounge are a bit pricey, but in line with a 5-star hotel. For the price (~$500), this was a great option!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One of the best hotels in the world Low rating for that hotel is a joke. I guess it's overpriced for many,so they give it 2 stars. What a shame!We spent one night on Christmas' Eve here and then 4 nightsfor New Years' Eve. Let me say this again - this is one of the besthotels in the world. Period. We've traveled all over the world andstayed in many great hotels.What makes this one special?1) Location. We stayed in room 1716 which is a suite on the topfloor with a view to die for. It's angled the way you face both frontsides of the hotel so you face both faces of the most amazingcityscape in the world. But even if you don't stay in one of the roomslike that, you can enjoy the view every morning when you takeyour breakfast downstairs, or every evening when you have yourdrink in a lounge.2) Quality. Bulgari toiletries and Hennessy XO in the mini bar.Amazing bed. Plasma TV. Unbelievable jacuzzi and shower.What should i add?3) Service. On Christmas' Eve the streets around the hotel wereclosed for celebrations - thousands of people outside.We landed and the hotel sent a Rolls Royce to pick us up.They couldn't reach the hotel so we had to walk ~20 minutes.They sent 6 people (!) to help us - 3 porters, a lady to show us the way,security people. Is this a bad service? Plus a very personal attention from the manager Elaine,who I exchanged e-mail with before we came. Suchan amazing person.4) Food. Some of the best restaurants are here. Nobu - a new sushirestaurant, Spoon - French. But the best by far is Yan Toh Heen- chosen often as the best Chinese restaurant in the world.We had our New Years' Eve dinner here - an amazing 18 coursedinner with a variety of tastes to die for. Amazing service.Jade silverware and plates. Amazing food.Plus a great breakfast every morning.This hotel deserves 10 stars.Andrew</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">great hotel back to original deluxe standard just finished a five night visit, the first time since it was a regent hotel a few years ago. i switched from the peninsula after changing travel dates and the pen couldn't guarantee a deluxe harbor view room. i was a bit concerned afte reading a few negative comments about room condition, however i was relieved to see that at least all the renovated rooms are just as nice or nicer than during the earlier times and management. according to the hotel, 65% of the rooms have been renovated, so i would be sure to confirm one of them if staying there. i think the extra money for a harbor view room is well worth it and is the only way to go. would also recommend that you book a rate that includes the buffet breakfast since it's about $40 per person otherwise... that said, the buffet is probably the most spectacular i saw in a month traveling around s.e. asia and hong kong. it does seem that the bathrooms, which are very large and have sunken tubs and a separate shower, are still the original pink and cream marble, but they seem to be in perfect condition. all in all, i really don't think you can top this hotel for location, right along the new waterfront promenade, five minutes from the star ferry, and close to all the action in kowloon. unless business dictates a hong kong island hotel, for most visitors kowloon is where you want to be. the service is up to top deluxe standards in every respect, although in the typical hurry hurry hong kong manner. the large screen plasma tv in the room was a great advantage, with a complete stereo and movie cd system built in, along with a good selection of news and business channels, although espn was in chinese. all in all, i don't think i would go back to the peninsula as long as i could get another deluxe harbor view at the intercon for about $200 less.</p></li>

Tea and fruit on arrival. Shame theres no teamaker except in the suites though, at this level I think there should be.Big outdoor pool plus wonderful infinity spa pools looking over the harbour, open til 2200 so try it after dark.Moments away from world class shopping ( the mall attached to the hotel isnt up to much but the whole of Kowloon is on your doorstep). The star ferry across to the island is minutes away.Step outside to view the light show at 2000.Best feature is the terrific lounge which is well worth the cost for the really excellent food, copious included drinks, internet access, and great people watching in the lobby below. Theres a business centre next door too.Special plaudits to the lounge manager Claudia who dealt with a minor quibble we had about service with charm and professionalism, and even sent champagne to our room with an apology which is indicative that this hotel takes its service aspirations seriously . It was busier here than usual due to a trade fair and presumably also the terrible weather the day before we arrived, so the lounge was busy which affected the food service somewhat on one day, and it was a mistake to allow a loud beachwear clad group in the lounge which detracted from the usual classy and calm feel. Otherwise this remains my favourite hotel and the one I always look forward to returning to.</p></li>

<li>Theres a business centre next door too.Special plaudits to the lounge manager Claudia who dealt with a minor quibble we had about service with charm and professionalism, and even sent champagne to our room with an apology which is indicative that this hotel takes its service aspirations seriously .</br>
<span style="background-color:#fabebe">SERVICE</span>: 0.965&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>It was busier here than usual due to a trade fair and presumably also the terrible weather the day before we arrived, so the lounge was busy which affected the food service somewhat on one day, and it was a mistake to allow a loud beachwear clad group in the lounge which detracted from the usual classy and calm feel.</br>

<li>Otherwise this remains my favourite hotel and the one I always look forward to returning to.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">View from a wheelchair Oh my, what a wonderful hotel to be staying in! We arrived from the port in a brightly coloured Rehabus specially for wheelchairs (expensive though), to be met by the Director of Guest Relations. She sat us down in the magnificent glass walled bar on the harbour's edge to check us in, with fresh juice, and within a few moments we were whisked up to our very special accessible room. Two bellboys and our vast luggage were already awaiting us.The room faced the harbour with a fantastic view and lots of room to turn. The bathroom was absolutely brilliant and I found nothing extra that I needed. But one touch of the button to call the butler would have brought anything I could possibly think of.There are four restaurants in the hotel, all good and all pretty expensive, but the casual Harbourside was impossible to reach in a wheelchair unless you were taken by a smiling member of staff through the service area, or, if you could find your way, through the Mall attached to the hotel. Worth going, if only to sample the remarkable buffet which stretched beyond belief. But, also, try the elegant Shark's Fin restaurant on the 3rd Floor of the attached Mall - delicious and good value too.The bar faces the harbour and it is worth sitting there for the 8 p.m. laser and light show which lasts for 13 minutes. There are so many things that are wonderful about this hotel such as - the lifts, warning you with a chime when one was about to arrive 30 seconds later, - the smiling staff and the service. I could go on forever! We had a hotel limousine and driver for a day's tour and that was just the best way to get the flavour of Hong Kong. But - our Hotel Loyalty Cards counted for nothing and we could not use the Club unless we each paid a steepdaily price - as we had breakfast in our room rate, it was not worth it. I would definitely choose this hotel over any of the others in Hong Kong, despite the famous names.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Exceptional in every way My husband and I always stay at Four Seasons Hotels with the exception of Hong Kong.We really believe that the Intercontinental is a hard act to follow or beat. The service surpasses any 5 star hotel I have ever stayed in.We had a magnificent suite overlooking the harbour. This is one of the selling points of this hotel. One can lie in bed at night and watch the magnificent light s surrounding the harbour, the boats and the junks that go by, it is so magnificent.The facilities of the hotel are exceptional. The gym is magnificent and very well equpped, with hot tea, free juice and water at all times. The outdoor pool is lovely when you choose to take a break from shopping.The hotel concierge are exceptional, I would say better than any other hotel I have stayed in. I really liked uincey, who really was well informed and gaVE ME GOOD ADVICE ON WHERE TO EAT AND SHOP.The hotel restaurants are the best. We ate at Nobu one night, definately the best Nobu, we have eaten at many including Las Vegas, New York. The view here surpasses all.We were going to go and have Chinese at the Peninsula Hotel one night but were told that the that theChinese restaurant in the Intercontinental was known to be much better and that all the people from the Peninsula come to them. What a superb meal we had.Breakfast buffet every morning was outstanding. The manager of the dining room knew that I loved scones, as I sat down a basket was brought to my table, which he had especially baked for me every morning. Typically these are served at the beautiful afternoon tea.From what I heard the Peninsula is nowhere near as good as this hotel. We met people who were not happy at the Penninsula and said next time they would stay at the Intercontinental.The amenities were very luxurious in the room and the chocolates were delicious. At the press of a button our butler was there to take care of all and any of our needs.I cannot wait to return in the next 6 months.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Worth every expensive penny Booked in here at the recommendation of a friend. Was initially reluctant as was considerably more - even for a standard plaza view room - than I was entirely comfortable paying. Especially, as I tend to think about Hotels as bases to explore rather than destinations in themselves. However, the Intercontinental was the most amazing experience and the facilities and location were really the icing in the cake for my trip to Hong Kong.Location was excellent - sitting in the spa pool with its infinity view and watching the star ferries cross the harbour will be one of my abiding memories of being in Hong Kong. As will drinking cocktails in Lobby Lounge which came with most delicious nuts and largest olives I have ever seen! Also, very short walk to Promenade, Nathan Street, MRT, Star Ferry, New World Centre and Harbour City Shopping and Tourist Information.Couldn't really afford to eat here! Which was not a problem as so many reasonable choices close by - including numerous supermarkets in New World Centre, Harbour City and Nathan Road, for quick snacks or to avoid raiding the admittedly costly mini bar! But treated myself to the seafood buffet in the Harbourside Restaurant one night and it was extremely good, three courses, sea food, (The person in line next to be was just filling up on lobster!!) meat courses, including excellant curry and many desserts. All you could eat and then some! Room was very comfortable - with large bed, desk, huge TV with cable, marble bathroom, with big seperate walk in shower. Always clean and everything refreshed each day. Staff couldn't have been more helpful or polite. Probably worth paying for harbour view if you can afford it - but view is also amazing from all public areas of the Hotel.If I had any doubts, had a quick trip to Hotel I had been considering in Causeway Bay on Hong Kong side on my last day and although the views from their rooftop bar were nice - I am glad I forked out the extra cash. It really made my holiday.</p></li>
