<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">not terrible The traditional rooms really need some help--very rough around the edges. The bed wasn't bad, but wasn't nearly as nice as the beds in other Westins I've visited. I'd give it a 2.5, but since that's not an option, had to go with a two.</p></li>

Room service breakfast took 45 minutes to arrive (promised in 20) with the wrong order. Bathroom was tiny. On the plus side, check in was smooth and the location is good except for the numerous homeless people situated around Union Square. Michael Mina is a great restaurant.</p></li>

This was in the older noisy section. Recent bookings for the same price were much better at the Omni,,,and the Grand Hyatt. There are lots of great Hotels in San Francisco with better accomodations.RDF, Cameron Park, Ca</p></li>

The lobby is amazing (both front and back) with a piano in the evening. We stayed in the modern block at the back, and our room didn't have a room over the square. The breakfasts are very good, but again are quite expensive. If elegance is your thing, then this hotel is for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recommended The Westin St Francis is well-located for San Francisco walking and exploring: it is located on Union Square. The tower rooms are the nicest rooms, fairly modern, and the Heavenly Beds are great. As with most Westins the bathrooms are outstanding, a cut above the rest. Easy access to Market, little longer walk to Embarcadero. The hotel is on Powell Street about 4 blocks from the cable car turn-around.</p></li>

I appreciated the heavenly beds and modern comforts while the hotel still had some old charm. Our room was quite small and had a view of a wall, but that was fine considering the bargain. All in all it was a nice one-night stay in a convenient location to walk to several restaurants/clubs. I would stay again if the price is right.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A wonderful hotel with class My daughters and I stayed at the St. Francis last week. From the moment we arrived, the staff was helpful and courteous. We were upgraded for an extra fee in the older part of the hotel. We loved the atmosphere of the room and found it charming. The location of the hotel is the best and the staff was helpful with directions and cabs. We look forward to staying there again and being in an older hotel that still has pleasant service and class.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">St. Francis is coasting on location  Obviously, great location that can't be beat... cool hotel history, too. Very nice lobby. Good breakfast in the Oak Room (but pricey). That's it! It's all downhill from there... front desk staff: SURLY  RUDE. (I've had much better service from airline staff checking in at the airport.) Historic rooms: dumpy, dingy, noisy,  musty... 2 star at best. (We heard every toilet flush as well as neighbors having sex... not good). We won't be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great building and location, but... I stayed at the St. Francis three nights while at a conference. It is a wonderful old building right on Union Square. I had a room in the old section and it was small but well-appointed. My complaints relate to the slowness of service at the front desk, a $2 charge for even local calls and the lack of any lounge area that was free. The hotel is squeezing nickels and dimes out of patrons and that leaves a bad taste. Next time, I will look elsewhere.</p></li>

Rooms are huge, and when we stayed the hotel had just put in flat screen TVs in all the rooms. The room service was also excellent--extremely speedy. I had the Kobe beef burger and fries.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location for a SF holiday! I stayed at the Westin St. Francis for two nights and despite the fact that it is priced higher than your average hotel, it is definitely worth the investment, since the location is FANTASTIC and you are staying at a Westin afterall.If you are in SF only a short while, do yourself a favor and stay in Union Square, since that's where a lot of the action is for tourists. I've been to SF several times, but this was by far, my favorite hotel experience in the city to-date.</p></li>

Apart from a very comfortable bed, the room was average. Bathroom well below 5 star standard and bring your own toiletries as the hotel offering was mediocre.Breakfast was good, very fresh cooked options, great coffee.Staff were average. Concierge not much help  sorry we can't book Alcatraz for you......... no further offer of help.Next time I go, I will try somewhere else.</p></li>

(not to mentiion tipping the valet). Internet access is $14 a day. Rooms are small, wall paper in the halls need to be upgraded, elavators are too small, and the walls in the room are too thin. It feels like your neighbors and people in the hallway are in the room with you at night. Save your money! Use the extra $49 a day to stay at a better hotel and the extra $14 dollars to shop or eat.</p></li>

We had a city view in the new part of the hotel. The staff were pleasant and the room was very nice. A bit better than a standard U.S. hotel room and the bathroom was great, quite opulent. The beds were very comfortable and the room view overlooked the city in the direction of Coit Tower. The hotel itself is beautiful (the lobby, etc) and is in a really great location on Union Square. We had a very enjoyable stay.</p></li>

The bathroom was roomy. The lights were a little dim in the bathroom but that was our only complaint. The service was excellent. Be sure to ask for a room in the tower as these are newer and more roomy. The glassed elevator will transport you up to your sleeping paradise. We will stay here on every trip back to San Francisco. It is also conveniently located to all of the stores and restaurants, all within easy walking distance. Perfecto!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Worst night of sleep EVER The first night I was put in a room in what was clearly the old part of the hotel that had not been updated. The room was old, smelly and unfortunate. The walls might as well have been made of paper. I had very noisy neighbors that kept me up all night. I called the front desk and security several times and they did nothing. I did complain and then was moved to a very nice room that was like day and night. It was larger, new and lovely. I was paying almost $400 a night and would accept that for the 2nd room but I wouldn't pay $50 for the first room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Review from a former SF local Great location if you want to go shopping. Which was actually our plan for this particular trip. Its right on Union Sqare. However if you're planning on doing more in SF, like go out, then this isn't the place for you. I lived in SF for 8 years so I like to think I know what I'm talking about. Really close to the St. Francis though is the Clift hotel. Also expensive like the St. Francis. However the Clift is in my opinion the better property as its closer to places you'd like to go out, close enough to shopping, and has a great bar within it as well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A lovely Surprise After reading some of the reviews on this site we actually tried to cancel our booking at this hotel and book into another -- How glad I am that we did not. We received a room in the old tower with a view over Union Square. The room was huge, very clean(no smell as stated on other reviews) and not at all as described by other reviewers. The staff were very helpful at all times. The only slight fault we could find was with the bathroom which was on the small side and the ceiling was slightly marked, however it was clean. We would not hesitate in using this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good hotel and location Stayed for 3 nights in San Francisco. This hotel is on union square which is an excellent location, with cable cars stopping just outside. All staff were friendly, but sometimes felt a little underdressed in shorts especially in grand lobby area. The room was clean and spacious, and the bed and shower being heavenly were heavenly!The lifts were like a theme park ride, after first 4 floors you could see outside through glass, i felt a little sick until i got used to it. Went up to top floor to take photos of views.Would stay in this hotel again when in San Francisco.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice for an older hotel. Stayed at the Westin for $119 from Priceline. For that price it was well worth it. The hotel is in a great location. I would not recommend paying the advertised rate for the hotel unless you are planning on getting an upgraded room. Our room was tiny by 4* standards (keep in mind this is a historic hotel). As other travelers have noted we also only got a full bed. Didn't bother trying to get another room since we were out most of the time. Parking was $51 with tax per day and $15 for internet (24hours). Overall it was nice for an older hotel but well below standards for a newer 4* hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good location, ok accomodations We knew from the reviews that it would be an OK experience. We booked two rooms in the tower since we'd read not so good things about the traditional rooms. Pros:Location, can't beat being right on Union Square.Decor was decent.Cons:Peeling wallpaper in one room.Mold on the grout around the tub.Parking was $44 a night.Given that it was the holiday season, we knew it would be busy and right after we got to the check-in desk a huge line formed behind us. Depending on what you're looking for, you can find more interesting boutique hotels in the area for less but they won't be right on Union Square.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location Loved this historic hotel in the middle of Union Square. The location is so great - the trolley car goes right in front of the hotel. The concierge was very helpful in planning my activities one day while my husband worked. Close to China town and tons of shopping. All the modern comforts including the heavenly bed  bath but also a very old feel from the lobby - loved all the old pictures. This place is a classic. Highlight of the trip was a bike ride from Fisherman's wharf accross the golden gate bridge to Salsalito and then took the ferry back. The concierge helped with everything including times for the ferry.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic location! For us, this hotel was an excellent location. It was close to my husband's conference, next to shopping, walking distance to China town, and even a little further (but still walking distance) to North Beach  Fishermans' Wharf. The hotel was better than average but nothing spectacular. We were there for 8 nights, with a complimentary upgrade to the 28th floor in the Tower. Glass elevator was great! Views were fantastic. Cleaning was done daily, but not consistently (ie tea/toiletries sometimes replaced). Hotel is very large and very busy, it therefore lacked a more personal touch. Overall though, it was good.</p></li>

We were bumped up to a larger room at no extra cost and were delighted to find we were in the new wing. The beds were very comfortable and the room was great. It was clean and a good size. The bathroom was large and had plenty of space. You cannot beat the location, walking distanace to everything! The shopping in the area was incredible and the cable car stops infront of the hotel, so if you have a five day pass you can jump on wthout waiting in the line at the end of the street. Loved the hotel and the area. The staff were friendly and very helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location We stayed here for 2 nights on a weekend trip to San Francisco. We were in the older part of the hotel. The room was small but had a small closet to put our luggage in, so we didn't feel the room was cluttered. Although the room was one of the older ones, we felt it was above average (but not perfect). The room was missing a smoke detector, but when we rang maintenance, they had it fixed before we returned from dinner. All things considered, we did enjoy our stay in the hotel. Although the room was older, we liked its charm and high ceilings. The elevators were a bit slow but other than that, we didn't have any major complaints about the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved It- Kid Friendly We spent two nights at the St. Francis after booking through Hotwire.com. We were in San Francisco for the Fourth of July holiday. Don't know if it was a slow time or the staff was just extra friendly, but as soon as we checked in, we were upgraded to a corner room in the Tower Building. The room was fantastic! We had our four-month-old baby with us, so we requested a refrigerator and microwave. They were brought to the room at no extra charge.Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. We were extremely impressed.My wife is VERY picky about cleanliness. She was impressed with the room, so that should tell you something!Highly recommended!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a great experience We booked online and paid a very reasonable rate. On checking in we had made a mistake and the room that we had booked had only one bed. Given that we were two independent travelers this was certainly not what we wanted. Roberto on the front desk found us an alternative and couldn't have been more helpful. He also gave us complimentary breakfast vouchers to welcome us. Our room was immaculately clean and very smart indeed. It was in the old main building and the quiet was amazing to me - being more used to thin hotel room walls. Breakfast included a great range of fresh fruit. Thanks to the great service I would come back again for sure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, but disappointing Location is this hotel's best feature - couldn't be better. We had a large, light corner room in the old section. However, the overall condition of the hotel was rather shabby - dim, poorly furnished lobby, paint and wallpaper peeling off the wall of our room, hooks in the bathroom falling out of the wall (and then just left there by the maid for 2 days), no light, paper or pen on the desk, no information about the hotel amenities (no pool?!) other than we had to pay $12/day per person to use the gym. The amenities are nicer at the Holiday Inn Express in any podunk town in America. Too bad, because this is a beautiful landmark hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was wonderful We stayed in a deluxe king on the 4th floor of the old section and it was just beautiful. We love the old pictures, woodwork and the old atmosphere. I paid a little more for the deluxe but it was well worth it. The room was very big, bathroom a little small but how much time do you spend in it. We enjoyed the view of Union Square. Our other family member stayed in the newer section on floor 25 but we loved our room and it was well worth it. They printed our boarding passes for us and everyone was very nice and helpful. We loved it and are ready to go again! I knew the double bed room would be way too small after reading. Trust me this room was well worth it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Depends on your room I redeemed some points for a room here for 4 nights. It's in a great location, right on the trolley line on union square. Initial nights were in the tower. Tower rooms are small but adequate with nice views. Air conditioning in our room was very noisy, so when we complained, we were switched to the old building, and were given a corner room (reportedly the -06 and -34 rooms are the best) and loved it. Lots of room, lovely view over the square, high ceilings - really great. I had an unusually hard time activating the internet connection ($13/d). If I were to stay here again, I'd ask for the old building overlooking the square. However, I would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Love the city, love the hotel! Stayed here as part of our honeymoon and loved it. We did stay in the old building at the front so I cannot comment on the new tower at the back, but we had the most wonderful time. The service is excellent from the minute we walked in the door. I did read a review where someone was not happy about the water pipes rattling, and to be honest it was not bad at all.Being an old hotel, I am sure it is not as polished as new top class hotels in the city, but if you are looking for a hotel which has a lot of character, and a very romantic feel, then I highly recommend it.The hotel is right on Union Sq so you could not ask for a better location!Highly recommended!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Crazy Busy but Centrally Located As you can tell from my headline, this is not an intimate little boutique hotel. The staff are very helpful and cheery considering what a zoo it is. Indeed, the hotel was fully booked the nights we were there and the lobby was like Grand Central station. Because we got there late afternoon, we ended up in rooms next to the elevator (these end in 24) in the old building. It was a bit noisy when the elevators opened up in the morning but the staff agreed to move us to the newer tower which was quieter. Also, it's almost impossible to get a bell boy because it so hectic. So if you want to bring your luggage down, check out or speak to the concierge try to do it at off hours.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">San Francisco treat My wife and I stayed at the St Francis 2 weekend nights. Our room was in the original portion of the hotel. We looked out on Union Square and all the activity going on there.When we drove up and were told We've been waiting for you it certainly set the right tone. Staff was very helpful as I was turning in a rent car close by, had to unload, check in and then take the car. The room was a little small, but not overcrowded. It was very clean, well appointed, very good tv, and has a safe. The bathroom shower was two headed, which I enjoyed, but my wife didn't, until I figured out how to shut off one of the heads.For convenience, helpful staff, well kept hotel, the St Francis is hard to beat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice weekend spent out of the hotel My wife and I spent a weekend at the Westin St Francis in Feb 2003. We were very happy with the rate booked via Expedia, however upon check-in, we were presented with an upgrade (SPG Elite) to a room with street view overlooking Union Square. Well, I believe they ulitmately put us in a parlor room with a 1 or 2 foot view of the square. The room was set too far back and the view was blocked by the building itself. The Westin Heavenly bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was large enough for 2 to get ready in the morning.The staff was fine, valet was a bit slow, and parking was very expensive ($36 per day). I would return to San Francisco, however I would probably stay at a different hotel in that area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nothing Special! I reserved an upgraded double room in the tower upper floors. Upon check-in I was informed I'd been given a single room. Since I was traveling with two children this wouldn't work! I was then given a double on a lower floor with somewhat of a view. The carpets were stained, the drapes pulled loose at the top and the bathroom door completely missing a handle. The beds were great though!The lobby is beautiful but the rooms are mediocre at best. They have a children's welcome gift upon check-in but were out of older kids bags so we were given the toddler gifts that consisted of electrical outlet plug covers, a night light and a rubber duck. Not much use to a 9 and 10 year old!The location is great and the cable car stops right in front!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Customer service does not exist here... Pay lots of money for a room in a killer location but don't expect any kind of decent customer service at this hotel.I have been here almost a week for work and they just consistently try to make things hard for me.Charging me for stuff I don't touch in the mini-bar, extra charges for internet (7 days worth for 5 days), can't answer my questions when I call front desk... and all with a bit of attitude as if they don't really want to be bothered helping at all.Is it because of the reputation of this hotel? It's booked out and popular, that's for sure... so maybe they don't have to try anymore?Westin is synonymous with poor quality and bad attitude for me... and I will make sure I avoid them from now on in any city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location and Hotel This is a classic hotel in the heart of S.F. downtown shopping district. We stayed in the newer tower which I would recommend. It is well appointed and has newer furnishings than the older tower(stayed in that one last year). I love the heavenly bedding and shower...definitely adds to the value. There is a great bar and nightlife in the main lobby. Prices are high but that's the city. I would recommend parking yourself at the Union Square garage right in front of the St. Francis. It's only $31 a day rather than the hotels cost of $50 a day. I would also recommend using the metro to get around to other parts of the city...very inexpensive....$1.50So overall a great experience. Make sure you go to a Giants baseball game too....amazing stadium with a view :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, shabby hotel The location in Union Square is perfect--central, happening, terrific shops at your doorstep (for example Victoria's Secret off the main lobby and Chanel, Macy's and Max Mara a block away), but the rooms--and I stayed in three different rooms over a 5-day stay--were all shabby and each had problems (leaking pipes, non-working phones, bathtub and shower fixture handles that fell off when you turned the water on, tiles coming off the walls, etc.). I also found the lack of a standard hotel coffee shop a shortfall; sometimes you just want a salad or sandwich in the relative calm of your own hotel. It was fun staying there because of the immediate vicinity with its cool jazz bands on warm evenings and little wine bars and coffee shops around the corner, but next time I'll opt for the Ritz or one of the newer hotels.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">New tower only ok We came for a weekend getaway. The location was fabulous especially if you are a shopper. The theatre district was right around the corner too. Far from the wharf but no big deal for us. We rode the cable car from the the wharf and that was fun. We had 3 rooms. Two were in the new tower and one was in the main building. The new tower was nice and the rooms were spacious but it was too sterile. The view was good too. The room in the main or old building was quite charming. Yes, it was smaller but it was much nicer. The view was of Union Square was more interesting. It had more of an old world feel to it. So if you want sleek and modern, go for the new tower. But if you want old San Francisco charm request the main or old building. The staff was great. The concierge was helpful, although the line to talk them was usually quite long.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not a typical Westin The location of the St. Francis is awesome and I found the staff friendly and helpful, contrary to other reviews but that's where it ends. The first room I was in faced out to the street, well come 1 am I paid for that. Drunks, garbage trucks and delivery trucks kept me up until 3 am. Then come 5:30 am, the elevator, which happens to be right behind my room, starts up. I switched rooms the next day, with no questions from the staff. I was moved into an interior room which was very quiet but it was in need of major renovation. The mold on the bathroom ceiling was especially wrong. I also couldn't believe the nickel and diming. $44 a night for parking! The fitness area, $16 a day, I never used it because of the principle of the price. San Francisco is a great city and I would love to go back but I would not stay at the St. Francis.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice Hotel but? We have just returned from a Canada and Alaska trip and stayed 3 nights in the Westin St. Francis Hotel. We stayed in the historical section, and had what was described as a run of the house room. The room itself was fine but our room was right next to the elevator shaft and we could hear the elevators going up and down all night long. If you do decide to stay at this hotel make sure you do not get a room that backs onto the elevator shaft, apart from this we could not fault the hotel at all, the staff were very friendly and efficient. I would definately recommend this hotel as it is central to everything e.g. shopping, the cable car stops right in front and takes you down to Fisherman's Wharf and all the attractions in that area. There are some great places to eat in the area around the hotel and we felt safe walking around at night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just OK I just stayed at the Westin St. Francis for 5 nights - it was an award stay, 11,500 Starpoints/night for a Grand Deluxe room.It was just barely ok. The grand deluxe rooms are basically higher-floor rooms in the tower. Ours appeared to be one of the smaller ones, and one of the few that faced west over the city rather than east over the bay, with part of the view blocked by a concrete bay.The Westinized room renovation appeared several years old and was in pretty bad shape. The walls were dirty, and all of the dark wood furniture and trim had bad nicks and scratches. The furniture in the main lobby was even worse - the cushions on the couches basically had no padding left.Service was friendly enough, but the only thing we specifically asked for (paper every day, WSJ + local paper) they never got right.Good location, but there must be better choices in SF.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fading Jewel This USE to be a wonderful jewel. What is lacking is a long list! Did they forget how to train their staff on cleanliness of bathrooms? Can they have someone touch up all the scratches on the furniture in the room? When is the last time the carpet was even vacuumed? We were hungry at 10am, went to the lobby cafe and they were completely sold out of pastries so the staff directed us to the Oak Room. Stood there for 5 minutes and a bus boy, yelled across the room (with people eating there) we're closed...come back for lunch. What the heck is wrong with their customer service? I think this is Starwood right? They should have enough money to spend on improving the overall experience here I would hope... of all hotels, this landmark needs better attention a better reputation!!!! Listen up managment...you need to get more particular- and get your people trained!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location The hotel, as everyone else has stated, is in an incredible location. We arrived from London, and found the hotel quite quickly from the airport. We were in a deluxe room in the tower - and had a great view over Union Square. Do book a tower room, as I believe the historic rooms leave a lot to be desired. We only ate at the hotel for one breakfast (we stayed for 5 days) - and the food was pretty good. The bar wasn't great, but due to the fantastic location there are a number of cooler bars quite close by.The staff (esp. behind the desk and the concierge) were extremely helpful - and the only negative was the cost of parking at the hotel - or SUV was oversized and we were charged over $60 a day to park at the hotel. But, it is an expensive/premium hotel. All in all, a great hotel, and certainly one that I would use again (in fact I'm booked to go back in a couple of months).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The very best location incredible value through Priceline The Hotel is at a fantastic location opposite Union Square both lively, convenient and safe. Much much much better than Fisherman's wharf . Great shopping close by with fanastic restaurants. Cable car and other muni transport close by. Hotel has a great lobby, ambience, very friendly and knowledgeable staff, especially the concierge that helped us book a City and Muirwoods tour. Some noise at night, but we did not mind that at all since were traveling as a couple without the kids. A fantastic deal for $99 plus taxes through Priceline. Rooms were small but we were very clean and confortable with the Flat screen TV and super comfortable queen bed. Starbucks coffee in the room. USA Today and Wall Street Journal (reception) in the morning. Twin shower heads in Marble bathroom. Westin could invest a little to do some minor painting and minor touch ups.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Over priced parking My husband and I stayed here for our wedding night, and at first they put us in a tower room. We called down disappointed because the room was very business like and cold. They put us in the historic portion of the hotel, which was much prettier and had the charm we were looking for. It still didn't have the big bathtub that the lady on the phone boasted about as fitting more than 2 people in- LOL it was nothing but a standard tub. The next day when we went to check out, we were charged a whopping $63.00 for parking ONE NIGHT in their structure. This included an extra $7.50 charge for having an over sized vehicle (Ford F250 with 4 inch lift) I was infuriated at the blatant highway robbery! When the valet drove it up, he stood there like one of the homeless people (which are swarming that area anyway) with his hand out until we gave him a buck... so make that $64.00 for parking!!!!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Beauty is skin deep............. While an impressive looking property in a wonderful location, the room was small, stuffy, clean in a cursory sense only, and stuck off a back stairwell. The view was of a brick wall, which is to say there wasn't one. The concierge was polite and helpful.Other front of house personnel seemed stressed, disinterested, or otherwise occupied rather than focused on genuine guest service and courtesy.The doorman reprimanded me for hailing my own cab while he tended to other guests. He explained it was ...his job to get the cabs, that's how we do it here.... I found his attitude and manner toward a guest of his hotel less than acceptable. Given the look and professed grandeur of the hotel, I expected more in the way of service, room amenities, and front of house courtesy. With the other options available in the Union Square area, my future SF travel plans will not include the Westin St. Francis.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Tower rooms are a big improvement - Great Location! We hadn't stayed in the St. Francis for many years. The renovation and the tower rooms are just wonderful. Service was great and it is one of the best of the Westin properties. We wanted to slip in some shopping between other activities, and Union Square made this really easy. Plus it was pouring and being able to rush back and get out of the rain was really helpful. We had stayed in S.F. Le Meridien in the financial district/embarcadero last month and did notice that the St. Francis wasn't as well equipped or as spacious, but the location is what we needed this weekend. My only complaint about the St. Francis is the parking at $49 a night plus taxes is just ridiculous. Even the expensive hotels in S.F. are less. Guests should get a break on parking. I find I am reconsidering SPG hotels for the high charges for internet access parking which add considerably to costs. Many modern hotels have WIFI .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Centrally located hotel with heritage It's a typical city hotel with 4-stars. the rooms must have been renovated recently. they all are quite spacious, have a marble bathroom, new furniture, the usual expensive internet access and a brand new entertainment system (about 100 high-definition on-demand movies to choose from). The food is not spectacular there are better value-price offerings in walking distance around the hotel. Their premium restaurant Michael Mina (named after the chef) supposed to be better, but according to the menue also in the upper price level. The hotel is located centrally right next to the union square right in the shopping district (Macy's, Nieman Marcus and a few more shopping malls and shopping streets are in walking distance). Also in walking distance is China Town and Fishermen's warf. Rates are 195 USD per kingsize double; this is the usual price range for a hotel of this class (all the others known chains were more expensive).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Consistently Improving I have stayed at the Westin a number of times during 2007, and just had my first stay in 2008. My general sense was that there are some important improvements in service. I think that they do a great job in the spa. The hotel seems cleaner and the service that I received on this trip was really exceptional. The hotel let me do a late check out which really helped me out. I was trying to get down to Palo Alto and back and was able to do that by 1 pm. I just think that they have improved in many areas. My only note in this area (which is not hotel related) is that there are so many homeless who really need some help. That is true of this part of the City in general. It always creates a dilemma. You want to help out, but it is unclear what to do, but you can not walk a block without sometimes aggressively being approached. I wonder if the City could help out or if the businesses in the area could help them out. Tough issue and challenge.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Shows its age even in the Tower Wing but quiet Friendly check in which was quick and easy. All staff we met were very helpful.Our Room was on the 20th floor and a decent size. It was in the newer Tower Wing. As with all Westin hotels rooms it had very comfortable beds. Bathrooms are in marble and were maybe the nicest part of the room. The room was cleaned extremely well. Only real fault was a reading light that was completely broken and although we mentioned it to the cleaning lady after 5 nights it still was broken and looked likely to fall at any moment.The floor was a Starwood Preferred Floor but not sure what was different. You still have to pay $10 a day for Internet!Have stayed at the Hyatt on Union Square and I found this hotel quieter. The view was decent though just a few floors higher it would have been much nicer. The corridors could definitely do with redecorating and look from a different decade. Seems a shame as the rooms themselves seem more up to date.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">GREAT! I stayed at the Westin St Francis for 5 days in early December. It was booked for me by SF friends so I didn't bother to read any Trip Advisor reviews which is probably a good thing now that I see the many bad experiences people have had! My stay didn't start off very well when reception couldn't find my booking. They even went so far as to ask me if I was in the right hotel! They finally found the booking and directed me to a room in the old part of the hotel, overlooking Union Square and the enormous Xmas tree. I'm not sure if I was somehow upgraded during the booking mix up, but the room was lovely (walk in dressing room, desk + chair, couch + armchair, coffee table etc) and COMPLETELY different to those described by other reviewers. The room was bright, quiet, nicely decorated and an excellent size. I didn't use any of the hotel facilities (eg parking, gym etc) so I can't comment on those, but I was really happy with my stay and the hotel's excellent location right on Union Square.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">An Old Classic We just returned from a wedding in San Francisco where we stayed at the historic St. Francis on Union Square. We are loyal Westin customers and were looking forward to our stay. This historic classic hotel was built in 1904 and survived earthquakes and fires. It has stood the test of time, but even after a recent renovation in 2004, it has lost some of it's romance and charm. We had a very nice large corner room with a great view of Union Square on this beautiful fall day. The bed was comfortable but not up to par for their Heavenly Bed program. The room smelled musty as did the hallways. For a major upscale hotel chain like Westin, it did not live up to it's reputation. The service was just fair. One major disappointment was to see the famous lobby piano bar has been replaced with a modern upscale resturant by Michael Mena - a fine establishment but seemed out of place for the surrounding marble and granite architecture. Overall it was a good experience in a great location but not worth the $500 per night price tag.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">NOT the typical SPG hotel, much worse! I recently spend a week at the St Francis on business; It was a fright from the moment I got to my floor. The doorman, front desk staff, and bell staff were attentive, but didn't warn me about my room... It was on a newly renovated floor that smelled of mothballs (I was told it was the new carpet), the whole 11th floor smelled so my window (which opened) was of little help. The bell staff that escorted me to my room noticed immediately that the room was not made up properly and left to collect the towels, robe, and missing pillow. The amenities were less then I would expect, I've received better at a Hampton Inn. They were happy to press my suits, but were unable to shine my shoes. Housekeeping skipped my room twice during my stay, and the hotel never offered an apology; only a they'll be right up. All in all, it was a beautiful hotel, but the room was far too small (albeit a old hotel) for the price and the door banged into the bed when I opened it.For the money, stay at the ritz or four seasons...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Does Not Meet Its Potential This is a beautiful hotel with great potential. But sadly, it does not meet that potential. My business booked more than 10 hotel rooms in addition to a large meeting room as part of a large convention. There was a last minute change; one of my co-workers couldn't go so I went in her place. We lost our deposit on that room. We still used the room!!! But because it was a name change we lost our deposit.Terrible customer service. As soon as we walked into the lobby, there was an old man telling everyone that they would not be able to check in the rooms. But when we got to the counter, they told us to disregard the crazy old man and we were able to check in. Where is management? Terrible first impression. Highway Robbery - Internet costs $15 for 24 hours and it is NOT a wireless connection. At 8 am, the housekeeper walked in without knocking and scared me to death because I was sleeping. When I mentioned it at the front desk, they shrugged it off. 8 am is a bit obscene! It's definitely not worth the amount of money spent.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Cannot believe this is a Westin hotel! We booked for 2 rooms and stayed for 6 nights in Dec 2005 after spending 3 nights at the Westin Chosun in Seoul. Although our 2 rooms are of good size, we were disappointed with the amenities provided in them. The only teacups we could find were paper cups (appalling we thought!). No wine glasses are supplied either. We did managed to get the proper china teacups and a couple of wine glasees from housekeeping. However, those were removed and not replaced when they serviced the room the next day. There was also no Do Not Disturb sign that we could hang on the door and housekeeping kept knocking on our door every so often, as early as 8.30 am. The amenities in the bathrooms was just as bad. Apart from towels, soaps, shampoo and conditioner and body lotion, there was nothing else. No shower caps, no emery boards etc ... As far as Westin goes, this hotel is of very poor standard (we are Starwood members and have stayed in many Sheraton or Westin hotels around the world). The only thing it has got going for it is the location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Beware interior rooms in historic portion of the hotel I stayed 1 night in the historic portion of the hotel. Though I ahd booked a standard room, I was not told that the room had a full-sized bed and a shower. I changed to another interior room that had a queen-sized bed but the room's condition was the same as the first one: scratched, old furniture, out-dated carpet, and furniture that had seen far better days. The HVAC wasn't working well and we spent a stuffy night - fresh air was out since the one window overlooked the interior light well. The bathroom was clean and well outfitted, in stark contrast to the rest of the room. What was perhaps the most ironic part of the whole experience was that there was a flat screen HDTV in a room full of furniture and decor that was desperate to be updated. It was the first time I ever equated the terms dump and Westin. I do hear good things about the tower rooms; my thinking is that they neglected to provide the interior customers the same quality experience other customers may receive whilst at the hotel. So unfortunate.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good start to our honeymoon! This was the start of our 3 week honeymoon. We were very excited about going to San Francisco and this hotel location was perfect! when we arrived our first room was really quite poor but my husband explained it was our honeymoon and we were upgraded to a lovely large room with a view of Union Square - thank goodness because if i was staying in the other room for 5 days I was checking out!!!The hotels location is its really only plus. Its a very dark hotel with a poor bar area - more like a Waiting lounge than a bar and not at all what i like - the bar in nice hotels makes a hotel this did not! there is nothing better than returning from your day or evening and having a lovely drink and people watching- this was disappointing. The hotel is also too large and impersonal - too many people bustling about but to be expected of a big city. Otherwise, for seeing san francisco it was great - not far from anywhere if you wanted to return with your shopping etc.I absolutely loved the city, the people, the shopping, the sights and the food and we will be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Super Location! San Francisco is our favorite vacation spot! There is so much to do there! We've stayed at this hotel three times because of it's location - directly on Union Square. This last visit, while my husband attended a convention at the Moscone Center (five blocks away), I kept myself entertained shopping at Macy's, Neiman Marcus, William Sonoma, etc. - just steps away from the hotel. I loved 'people watching' at Union Square. Art galleries, museums, etc. all just blocks away. Great dining abounds - grab a taxi and head to the Wharf and treat yourself to the BEST seafood at Somas. The tour buses picked up/dropped us off right on the door-step of the hotel. We did the City Tour and the Wine Country. LOVED BOTH!Only once did we stay in the 'old' section of the hotel. Never again. I will specifically ask for the NEW section on our next visit. While the old section has charm, the room that we were assigned to was incredibly small. The new rooms are large and oh so comfortable. We have never had any problem with service. We've always been treated very well.I would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Two different hotels in one This hotel is definately living on it's reputation and locationThe old building has big rooms with nice high ceilings, but they are in dire need of renovation. Our room had obviously not been spring cleaned for a long time, the dirt under the desk was very noticeable. The bathroom window was broken and did not open there was no fan, so the room got full of condensation with every shower.Take care not to get allocated an internal room or you will have a view of a brick wall. However the external traditional rooms have no double glazing, so the street noise is quite an intrusion.The lobby has nowhere that you can sit without buying a drink, not exactly what you would expect of a hotel this size. The breakfast was average, and we chose not to eat in the hotel, I can recommend the Daily Grill right across the road from the side entrance for lunch and dinner.The newer tower seems to have more acceptable standard of rooms, but we were told that they were fully booked and could not move us over.At $369 a night for a King Traditional room, this hotel is way overpriced.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Regal Bearing My husband and I just returned from a thoroughly enjoyable week's stay at the Westin St. Francis. We commuted from the airport on the city's subway - the BART- and walked the easy 2 blocks up from the Powell Street station. Our approach was nothing short of breathtaking as the merriment on Union Square, with its ice-skating rink and enromous Christmas tree lay before our eyes. I told my husband - that's where we are staying. He said there? in amazement. The hotel with its regal bearing was much more than he expected. In all our 8 days, the only mishap was that we were first given a double bed instead of the queen-size we had booked. Once that was taken care of we enjoyed a comfortable room and a nice sized bathroom with a tub in which to soak one's weary limbs after many days of walking. You can't beat the location. Easy to get to Chinatown, Fisherman's Wharf, Lombard Street, Castro, Haight-Ashbury. The hop-on, hop-off shuttles are right outside your door. The restaurant is acclaimed. When in New Orleans, I like a BB, but for San Fran, the Westin St. Francis does you proud!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great! Wonderful hotel for those who appreciate the charm and character of a grand hotel. Because of our Starwood membership, we were upgraded to a corner room overlooking Union Square. The sights and sounds of the square added to this location. These rooms are not for the noise sensitive, but hey, its part of San Francisco. You can hear the cable cars run, until they stop around 11PM, but you can also hear the street musicians, and watch the color on the Square. The room was very large, with a Cal King heavely bed, crystal chandelier, sitting area, wet bar and walk in closet. The bathroom arrangement was strange, upscale linens and heavely toiletries, but the commode looked like it belonged in a public restroom. Everything was very clean, but it just didn't go with the rest of the room. The clerk who checked us in mention that many of the older rooms in this area of the hotel were actually apartments until the late 1960's. Also, don't forgt to venture over to the newer tower and take the glass elevator to the 32nd floor, the views on a clear day or night are spectacular! We'll be back again next year! All in all LOVED IT!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">St. Francis, ENOUGH SAID! Best Choice in San Francisco! I did a lot of research on hotels before I booked. I was so pleasantly suprised at the St. Francis. BEST LOCATION!! (We almost stayed in Fisherman's Wharf, glad we didn't. It smelled awful, trash everywhere!!) Here is the MAIN reason I loved the St. Francis. ALL the other luxury hotels in the area, had very small entrance ways, and were squeezed in next to other shops and hotels. For travelers that are deciding where to stay, especially in Union Square, the best thing about this hotel was the location. *St. Francis was on it's own block, it was great!! *Very clean. *We stayed in the new area, 30th Floor, view was amazing, and hotel room was spacious and the bed was VERY comfortable. *Bathroom was beautiful, marble, and lots of room in the tub. *Plenty of towels. Many great restaurants near by, and shopping was endless. Just had a wonderful experience, couldn't wait to come back and tell others about the hotel, especially since I myself read so many of these forums, and it helped me decide. Plus, check their website for specials!! Great hotel, enjoy your stay!! RezaS (Heathrow, Florida)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not as bad as some/not as good as others... I stayed at the St. Francis this past week attending a conference that was at the hotel. Even though I didn't have much choice on hotels, I still checked out the reviews here in advance. Fortunately (for me!) my experience was better than average, although I still don't think I'd stay there again. I was in the old section of the hotel and had a large room on the seventh floor. The beds and shower are fantastic and it's clear that money has been spent in these cosmetic areas. The down side was that my room was somewhere by the garbage collection area so I was awakened very early every morning. The hotel is a grand old hotel and does show wear and tear.....and could definitely use a cosmetic upgrade. But it was also sold out so I guess they're not terribly motivated to change. I had some problems with the internet connection and the help desk supporting the hotel was excellent. Also wasn't charged for the internet connection..although that could have been a billing mistake that will show up later. Bottom line recommendation: the hotel's in a great area, but there are definitely a lot of other choices to try!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In the heart of SF lies a gem of a hotel!! A year after our engagement in SF, my fiance and I decided to return to SF...I guess you can say we left our hearts in SF.We decided to stay at the landmark Westin St. Francis and thank goodness we did. We had the Golden Gate Suite (I'm pretty sure that was the name) on the 31st Floor and had the most phenomenal views of SF...breath-taking in fact. The room had a marble entry with a mini-kitchen, a luxurious dining table, beautifully upholstered couches and their Heavenly bed in the bedroom. The suite came equipped with a Bose CD player. Although the prior year we stayed in a Ritz Carlton suite (and that was gorgeous), we preferred the decor of the Westin suite better. That and the views are beyond words.The hotel, itself, gets very crowded. Many tourists love coming into the hotel to ride the glass elevators to the top to get a view of SF. But overall, we knew what to expect with a bustling hotel, in the heart of SF. The hotel was very kind when we mentioned we were celebrating our engagement (a year later) and surprised us with chocolate covered strawberries. Needless to say, this was NOT our last time, nor will it be our last time in SF.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sensational After reading many reviews on tripadvisor. Me and my girlfriend left the uk for our first stop on our holiday of a lifetime. We did so going to san francisco with a worry about the westin, going off previous reviews!These worries were needless. As soon as we arrived we were bowled over by the grandness of the hotel lobby. During check in the man on the desk was very helpful, and spent time finding the best room available to house us in. We were given an end room, which had amazing views of Union square. The hotel is a historic one, and consequently so too are the rooms. Ours was huge, with of course the heavenly bed which is truely heavenly. The bathroom was on the small side but not worth a moan. You can hear the noise outside from cars and cable cars, but this is San Francisco if you dont like it go somewhere else!!!The rest of the hotel areas are well maintained and very nice. This hotel also offers the best location bar none. Cable car stop right outside. And walking distance to all the main shops. Macys, Bloomingdales etc. All in all a great stay. Leaves me wondering where have all the moaners been staying? It cant be here. Go for an end room, you will not be disappointed!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Solid, but not as great as most Westins We stayed here over the Thanksgiving holiday. Having read how other Priceline customers have been treated, I went prepared to pay for a room upgrade. For an additional $35 a night, we were placed in one of the high rooms in the Tower with a spectacular view of the Golden Gate Bridge. The staff were incredibly friendly, though we forgot our toothpaste and waited an hour for someone to bring us some extra toothpaste packets. The hotel seemed busy, however, so that may be forgivable.The location is great and the hotel does have quite a bit of character. Still, I felt that the room furnishings were average (at best) - even in the newer Tower. We've stayed at more than our share of Westins over the years and this is, unfortunately, the least of all of them. Heavenly bed, yes, but everything else looked a little tired. Ironically, when we returned home to LA we were forced to evacuate our home because of a wildfire and stayed at a nearby Four Points Sheraton that was much nicer (and dramatically cheaper) than the Westin St Francis. I think this hotel is coasting a little too much on its history and quaintness, and Starwood really needs to sink some serious $$$ into this place to renovate it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, okay room... Based on the other reviews, I would recommend staying in the newer tower if you ever stay there. The best thing the St. Francis has going for it is the location.My family and I had two rooms there on December 30th. Although I had been excited to stay there based on the location and having been in the lobby, I was less than thrilled with the room. We were in the older tower, and the room was TINY! And, smelled musty. The beds were great, as I've come to expect at the Westin, but the room needed updating. The doorknob on our adjoining room kept falling off. The bathroom was barely big enough for one person to get ready in. When we first arrived at the hotel our rooms weren't even ready, even though it was after check-in time. And, then we had to wait in line again an hour later to get our keys. Our room had a decent view of the city, and a pirate flag flying on the building below.We ate breakfast at the coffee bar - okay, but Starbucks is only a block away. And, dinner right across the street at the Daily Grill which is always good. I might consider staying here again in the new tower if the room rate is reasonable.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Boo for the Westin St. Francis I am sad to report that my experience at the St. Francis Westin was extremely substandard. To begin with, the rooms are extremely dated and run down. The bathroom was not cleaned well and there was no way I was going to take a bath in a tub that was still dirty. The bed was somewhat uncomfortable compared to other 5 star hotels I've stayed at. We had lunch at the Oak Room. The food was good but the restaurant was run down and the furniture was scratched and chipped - not what you expect at a 5 star hotel. You can eat at the main restaurant, Michael Mina, for $98 (price fix only), not including any wine. The lobby is now a more modern, Asian feel. There are no fresh florals, everything is straight lines and very cold. Way, way different from the way it used to be. High tea at the hotel is no longer offered. Parking is $50 per night and when we checked out, we had to wait to 1/2 hour to have our car delivered to us. No excuse to be shorthanded on valet parking employees when you are charging $50 per night! On an more positive note, the spa was excellent. I had two spa treatments and they were both wonderful. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, but you can make a spa reservation without being a hotel guest.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">disappointing We stayed at the St. Francis for a long weekend in January. While the history of the hotel adds to its charm, and the location is outstanding, the overall experience was a disappointment. We were in the new 1970's tower, and the room had a nice view, but was pretty drab and dull. The Westin also has really overdone it on the Heavenly promotion. Not only were the beds Heavenly, but so was the shower. The bed, in reality, was perfectly adequate/fine -- not heavenly. And the cheesy promotional slogan is a bit of an insult to the guests. After all, we're renting a hotel room , not buying a fast-food burger.The 1970's additions to the hotel are awkward. The check-in lobby has the old-world charm that you'd expect from the St. Francis, but the large lobby that opens onto Union Square has been re-done in a very stark, modern, dark, minimalist style with a cocktail lounge in the lobby area and the hotel's main dining room off the lobby. It just doesn't work and is truly a misuse of the space. The service was fine, the food was good, and the location is perfect, but the hotel itself needs a major overhaul to restore even a portion of its former grandeur. I think I'll try the Fairmont next time (no, I am not an employee of the Fairmont Corp.)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The St. Francis is getting better 10 years ago and more, we got into the habit of spending a day or two at the St. Francis with our children, over Christmas. We loved the big old rooms in the older part, and once stayed in the tower and loved that, and the prices were great over the holidays.But since then, the quality of the hotel has gone way down. My wife and I decided to give it a try once more, and I'm here to say that it is getting better. Our $199 deluxe, high-floor tower room was first-rate and had a great view. I for one was greatful for the over-priced minibar. To get a reasonably priced drink or meal you have to leave the hotel, and I regard a minibar as worth the money when I'm tired or in need of a 2 a.m. snack.Exploring the hotel, they are remodelling dozens of rooms in the older section. It's good to see they are putting some money in it at last.I agree with the comments that describe the check-in process as chaotic. It always has been at that season, but we got the room we were promised, and I'll plan to go back, probably getting a couple of rooms in the old section next time.Parking is very expensive. You can park across the street for $30 for 24 hours at the Union Square garage, though that wasn't an option for us on a rainy night</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Grand accomodation! We stayed in The Westin St. Francis as part of our honeymoon, and so had high hopes for the hotel. We were not disappointed. Upon arriving, we were upgraded to a beautiful suite with a view of the city and the bay (it's worth asking for an upgrade!). The room was huge, and featured quite simply the largest, most comfortable bed we have ever experienced in any hotel. The bathroom was very well equipped with a superb two-headed shower. Room service was excellent, and the staff were generally very helpful. The hotel has a fascinating history behind it, and it certainly felt like a great place to base ourselves whilst exploring the city. Situated on Union Square, there are plenty of excellent shops and restaurants nearby. The Cheesecake Factory (also on Union Square) is an essential place to go for a meal. The highlight for our stay in the city was a visit to Alcatraz on an Evening Tour. Haight Street was also a great day out, brimming with excellent clothes, book and music shops, and lively restaurants and bars.We would definitely stay at this hotel again, although I think it is essential to stay in a room with a view of the city if at all possible, rather than a view of a brick wall (as mentioned in other reviews posted on this site).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Westin St. Francis - Good, not great views The Westin St. Francis is dripping with history, which my husband found to be interesting during our recent 2night stay in San Fran. Unfortunately for him, being in the middle of the shopping district was not as desirable, as he noted many times, It's too crowded. Thankfully we didn't visit San Fran. to shop. We did enjoy the location, as is provided us great access to a variety of things that we would not have other wise seen. I chose this hotel, as I wanted to provide a memorable trip with views of the bay. Well, their bay and city view rooms should be just labeled city view. You can see the bay only looking through the space between buildings. Seeing that this was the nicest of hotels that we stayed at during our trip, we splurged a bit to cap off the week, we enjoyed it none the less. My husband did enjoy watching the fog roll into the city at night. Would I worry so much about trying to gain a great view again, Nope. I think I would try to save a few $$$ and see what I could get on priceline in the union square/finanical district area vs. paying the Westin's rates.Nothing bad about the hotel. It's classy, service is nice, just pricy for my taste and desires. If you like Full Service - from bellmen and such, then this is a great place for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sorely Disappointed With Its Demise Let me begin by saying that I have been staying at this hotel since I was a child, and this means I have seen it go through many iterations for over 45 years. This most recent stay was so utterly disappointing, I simply do not know where to begin. The recently refurbished lobby on the Union Square side has become this odd assemblage of Art Deco-like seating which one has to wind around just to get through. It takes some time to recognize that this is the hotel bar! Prior to this strange transformation, the bar was the lovely Compass Rose, which now houses a restaurant. The lovely jewelry store on the right was going out of business, and other shops that were a delight over the years no longer exist. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest, so check-in is never a problem anywhere in the world, and is still fine at St. Francis. The particular evening I was there, the lines to get up the tower to my room were extraordinary, and the wait excessive. I will say that the rooms are still decent and the beds comfortable, but there is something that has simply gotten lost overall: the sense of a bygone era, of attention to detail, of feeling that the individual matters. I am so sorry to see the demise of a crown jewel of San Francisco and reluctantly am going to stay elsewhere on my return to the City.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Only if you get a deal Stayed here for 1 night after seeing a show and not wanting to drive home. Got a deal through priceline at $100, but found out it was only a full size bed for two adults without a view and in a tiny room! After much calling, bought an upgrade for $70- ended up getting a prime room on the 30th floor with a spectacular view of the bayand coit tower. It was worth it in the end, but the room usually goes for over $300- never would I pay that much for it. The room itself was nice, but still small even though it was on the Starwood preferred floor. The marble bathroom was nice, though still small. The bed was KING and comfie. Room service was expensive- $8 for cereal. Went to Sears food on Powell for their signature swedish pancakes- sit at the counter to avoid the wait. The history of the hotel is amazing, but the main foyer was not as cool as I had hoped. Miss the old tea room- now just another posh restaurant. It seems smaller now than when I visited years ago. Overall, we had a good time, but I would never use priceline again and would never spend more even for such a great view- we spenyt so little time in the room. You can find other hotels in the area that are even cooler and less expensive. The location is great, but there are an incredible amount of hotels in the area, so look around. Enjoy the city!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very disappointed I booked a Union Square view room several months ago but when we checked in we were told no rooms facing the Square were available but they offered to upgrade us to a Jr. Suite (great but it still didn't face the Square). Very noisy rooms both from the hallways and the street bands that played until late, late in the evening. I finally called security who in turn called the police to break up the corner band. Old musty smell in room, clothing hook in bathroom broken. No complimentary water until asked for. Parking for 2 days a little over $80., the Heavenly Bed was so so. Their 260 thread count luxury sheets didn't hold a candle to my at home 1000 count. When the heater kicked off it was like someone slamming a door right next to your head. This went on several times during the night. Our hallway smelled of Marijuana and when leaving the Oak Room after a mediocre meal 3 street teens with skate boards were walking through the halls reaching up with their boards and breaking the chandelier crystals. Mr. Berlin an employee of the hotel was most gracious and I think one of the only good things going for the St. Francis. Over rated and over priced. Our favorite is the Ritz Carlton but there are many little boutique hotels in the Square area far more appealing then the St. Francis. We stayed once but never again-..</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">can't beat the location on union square my wife and i just stayed here for an extended weekend getaway. i got a great deal on priceline ($125+tax per night over the memorial day weekend). overall, the hotel stay was nice. the rooms were small, but not unexpected for an old hotel such as the st. francis. the rooms were a bit different than your standard anonymous modern hotel rooms (think chandeliers, tall ceilings, decorative wall moldings). the beds were indeed comfy thanks to the westin heavenly beds. the dual shower heads were a welcome relief after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. the hotel staff seemed friendly enough. my only complaint regarding the room was the noise. thankfully our neighbors were not loud and obnoxious, but i could definitely hear them talking and coughing very clearly through the walls. you can't beat the location of the hotel. it's facing union square on the powell street side which means walking distance to shopping and the cable cars. tons of walgreens drug stores around for any last minute needs. also convenient to many muni-bus lines which can take you to some great neighborhoods where some of the better restaurants are. it's also walking distance to the farmer's market at the ferry terminal building (around a 20 min walk). overall, a great stay at a great price from priceline and wonderful location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Terrible experience We arrived for my husband medical conference. Flew from Ontario, Canada, and finally arrived at the Hotel at 10pm, exhausted.We waited in line for 20 plus minutes, then were given a  historic room. Hint ( RUN!) if they say that, as that means you get a room where the servents use to stay. It is a TINY room, and when you open the door, it hits the bed. The door won't open all the way. There is one small window, that looks smack onto a brick wall. The washroom is very old, and terrible. We paid top dollar for this room, so I immediately called to complain. We were told the Hotel was full. There was nothing they could do.The next day, we asked again. Stil no help. I even asked if we could stay at one of their sister hotels. No luck there. So we walked around S.F all morning, in search of another Hotel ourselves. No luck. Everything was booked for this medical conference.Finally that afternoon I asked for another room, again, and they were able to find us one. The second room was large, and quite pretty. Had a view. Still old and in need of renovation, but nothing at all like the first, and both rooms were the SAME PRICE. Imagine that?Then when we went to check-out they added another $20 telephone charge that we didn't use. I had to wait in line for another 20 minutes to get that sorted out. After a lot of talking, we managed to get it taken off of our bill.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Could have been better We recently spent 3 nights at the Westin St Francis  while we did enjoy our stay I felt there were a few things that could have been better. We received a very warm welcome on our arrival  it all looked promising. We had just arrived from a very long international flight and had an extremely tired baby who needed to sleep. I had previously emailed and called from Australia to confirm a cot would be in our room on arrival. The girl checking us in advised it was not there yet but would be sent up immediately. After at least half and hour it still had not arrived so we decided to take her out for a walk. On our way through reception we asked again  were assured it would be sent straight up. An hour and a half later we returned - still no cot! We finally rang exasperated and pleaded for one - finally it came about 20 minutes later. Not quite good enough  something so simple should not take 3 requests.Other than that, the paint was pealing off the ceiling in our bathroom which was surprising and not up to standard for such a property.This is an extremely busy hotel so not the place to stay for a quiet relaxing time, however it is in a fantastic location and we were able to walk or take the cable car everywhere. The room was spacious and comfortable  other than the pealing paint it was very nice. Staff were mostly all very friendly  overall we did enjoy our stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">very nice The Westin St. Francis is a nice place for the price you pay, but there are some downfalls to that price as well.I was immediately irritated with the guy that unloads suitcases from the car, he was a very arrogant European man that continually reminded arrivers that they were staying at a 5-star hotel, but there was nothing 5-star about him. He was very abrasive and quite rude to some of the arrivers.The people in the lobby were friendly as we stood in the queue to check-in, but they were very fake friendly, and more irritating than anything.Our room was very spacious and clean and the bed was very, very comfortable. The room had everything that we needed to feel at home during our stay. My favorite part was the dual shower-head, making it a great shower experience with twice the HOT water available. Another thing that I really disliked was the availability of breakfast. The hotel offers a $20-something breakfast buffet in one of the restaurants. Personally, I find nothing appealing about paying that much money for a big spoonful of eggs out of a vat. There are several diners close to the hotel that offer a much better breakfast for nowhere near the cost. I traveled to this place with my boyfriend on a work trip, so we didn't foot the bill, but if I had the money to spend on this place myself, I'm not sure I'd go to the expense. If you have the money to spend, it's worth it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">ok, not great. Having been a native San Franiciscan for 10 years before moving away, i always enjoy returning to the city when time allows to refresh myself in what to me is the greatest city in the US. Unfortunately, the St. Francis, while a jewel 10-20 years ago, has been rather disappointing. The lobby continues to be gorgeous and there is no better place for people watching. the new Michael Mina's restaurant is also fabulous, and worth a meal if you can put it on your expense account. however, the hotel service is terrible. check in took 25 minutes, with some 30 people waiting in line for 2 deskclerks. the concierge wasn't helpful at all (we were looking for a restuarant which could accomodate a party of 15) and the rooms weren't all that clean when we finally got to them. the old tower rooms seem to be falling apart and in need of renovation. the fluorescent lighting doesn't do justice to the beautiful mouldings on the walls. the new tower feels sterile. maid service sometimes doesn't clean the rooms until the late afternoon - so you come back from sightseeing and your room still hasn't been made up.the only unbeatable amenity is the location. if you can walk an extra 5 minutes, the four seasons, ritz carlton, fairmont, or palace hotel will all give you better service for the same (or nearly the same) price. st. francis is basically a 3 star hotel in a 5 star location for a 5 star price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not So Grand Old Dame I was assigned to a tiny room in the old (original) building. The corridor and room gave off an offensive odor that I associated immediately with uncleaned carpeting. After having difficulty sleeping due to the smell and getting little satisfaction from housekeeping, I undertook my own efforts to eliminate it with a fabric spray cleaner. It took and entire container to do the trick but it succeeded in getting rid of most of it. I later learned that thesw small, least desirous rooms are the ones assigned to guests with animals in tow. There were no drawers to store clothes and no coffee maker in this standard room. The pricey coffee bar in lobby asked $2.75 for a small coffee. You an do much better a block down Powell at Starbucks. It seems that management intends to get as much revenue out of this aging dame before re-branding it to a 3-star property. It's so old and has been re-habbed so many times that another attempt could not succeed in meeting Westin standards. Most of those guests staying in the old building (as opposed to the newer tower) appeared to be on package tours from the Pacific room or other international locations, or others who booked discounted rooms.It's a shame because, with a little effort directed at cleaning carpets, the entire experience could have been much different. If you are checking the Westin website, these rooms can be identified as those with no view.'</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A grand classic with a new twist The Westin St. Francis is one of the grand old hotels that has kept up with the times without sacrificing its old feeling. It is perfectly situated right on Union Square. Of course that also means taxi horns to lull you to sleep if you get a room fronting on Powell Street. I've previously stayed in rooms in the old section of the hotel and found them dark, noisy, and small. This time we opted for room in the newer addition and found it more in line with my expectations of a Westin. This blending of the classic old lobby, restaurants and bar, with the newer bigger and nicer room worked perfectly, although initially it almost seemed like heresy not to stay in the original older building.Westin was the first chain to adopt a deluxe signature bed and their Heavenly Bed is so nice I bought one for my home bedroom. The bathroom was recently updated with new fixtures. Our room had a wonderful view stretching from Nob Hill to the Bay Bridge. Ask for a higher floor if view is important to you.The more expensive a hotel is, the more likely they'll charge for things like internet access that are free in lesser hotels. I'd really like an explanation of this principal, because it comes across as nickle and diming their customers, trying to grab every cent of potential additional profit. Westin as a chain apparently encourages this and I wasn't at all surprised that the St. Francis wanted $20 a day for internet access.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Beautiful hotel, perfect location, friendly staff We enjoyed our stay at the St. Francis. The location, right on Union Square, was fantastic. We were able to walk to a Giants game at ATT park, took the cable car from Fisherman's wharf to right outside the hotel, and we had a tremendous variety of restaurants and stores within walking distance. It was also surprisingly easy to drive in and out of the area. The valets were very friendly, a good thing considering the extremely steep ($40 a night) parking fee. The room was what you'd expect from a Westin. If you've stayed in a Westin before, you know that's a good thing. Comfortable bed, pleasant decor, great shower. We didn't eat in any of the hotel restaurants, nor did we order room service, so I can't comment on the food. We had a bad experience our first night, as the fire alarm went off at 3 in the morning. After being jolted awake, we waited a little bit, and though the blaring alarm went off, it was followed up by a recording instructing us to evacuate. After the second time this played we decided to play it safe and leave. 17 flights of stairs later, we ended up back in the lobby to hear some firefighters saying we could go back up. It wasn't fun. When I checked out, I asked the clerk about this, and she comp'ed our room for that night. It would have been nice to not have to mention it, but all I had to do was mention it, I didn't have to actually ask for anything.We would definitely stay at the St. Francis again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Superior Hotel in Upscale Union Square After spending several nights in a competition hotel up the street, I finally had to throw in the towel and say, enough is enough. I walked down the street to the Westin St. Francis and walked directly up to the front desk and talked with a very friendly clerk. I explained my situation and asked if there were rooms available. I am a government employee and was on official business, and explained as such and asked if there were rooms available at the government rate. The clerk was more than helpful and was able to assist me. I explained that my family would be joining me on my last night and asked for a family friendly room. She said she would put me in a special room that she thought I would like. Needless to say, I was put into a HUGE room that was way more than adequate and way more than what I am used to while traveling on business! My only regret was that I hadn't stayed in this hotel the previous days!The staff at the Westin St. Francis were all more than helpful in helping us and making special accommodations that I had requested - a cot, a refrigerator, etc... The only down side of this hotel was the parking rate - at $49/night, I was a little discouraged. If I were traveling on my own, I would have looked for parking elsewhere, but since I was being reimbursed, it was alright.The bed was more than comfortable and it was the best night sleep I had gotten in almost a week!The only thing I can complain about is that my conference didn't last longer!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Reasonably nice, but not entirely up to Westin standards It's hard to be too critical given that our room rate (pay for two nights, get one free) worked out to about $105 a night for one of the small rooms in the older section of the hotel, but when they said without a view, they meant it. The window looked at a brick wall and the lack of morning light was really disconcerting. Internet access was a whopping $15/day, which seemed unreasonable given I can get free wireless at podunk hotels in Eastern WA (we travel for softball). The room decor was charming (blue walls, lots of crown moulding) and the huge LCD television actually had HD channels available, which was great. The bathrooms in the old section (built around the turn of the century, so it's understandable) were TINY - my husband and I couldn't brush our teeth at the same time. The location is excellent, just a few blocks from a BART station (only $5.35 from the airport, much cheaper than even the shared vans) and close to buses and the streetcar and the cable car runs in front of the hotel. The staff was very helpful, particularly when my husband got sick in the middle of the night. Overall I'd return, but not for the usual rates unless they merited a larger room with more light and free or cheaper internet, since we always rely on our laptop for excursion planning, flight check in, etc. One other helpful feature is that they will store your luggage if you have an evening flight, of which we took advantage and made our last day there a lot more enjoyable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ranked only # 94 on Trip-advisor for a reason. I stayed at this hotel for a night in late November,2006. Despite my best efforts to upgrade my room (which I was more than willing to pay more for) I was told this was not possible so I was assigned to a standard room. It was room #1043. I paid $306.88 including room tax plus $51.30 to park my car for the night. Upon opening the door, I could not believe how small the room was. The room could not have been bigger than 10'X12' -probably smaller. The bathroom was less than 4'X7'. The full size bed barely fit. In fact, when you open the door to the room, it misses the bed by only an inch or two. I asked the bellman if there were more if these miniature rooms at the St. Francis and he replied quite a few, but most business travelers know better and refuse to book them. I've stayed at my share of grand old hotels in New York and throughout Europe that also have some tiny rooms but nothing compares to closet-sized standard rooms at the St. Francis. As other reviewers note, the furnishings are tired, and the property sorely needs upgrading. This is truly regrettable because the staff are attentive, the hotel is in a great location, and the lobby and common areas are charming. I'm amazed that Westin is still willing to license this property considering its condition. Certainly there must be other properties in San Francisco far more worthy of their brand. Unless you can be assured of a decent sized room, and you don't mind the torn and tattered look, I suggest you book elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location, location, location.... The touristy part of San Francisco runs from Fisherman's Wharf where you can jump on a boat to visit Alcatraz all the way down to Union Square where all the major shops are. The Westin is based right on Union Square and is a short walk from the tram terminus, the shops, great restaurants, Chinatown etcThe staff were excellent and very friendly with the kids. Check in was swift and this is where the will you/won't you like this hotel lottery kicks in...the rooms. Some are great (ours was) and some are smaller then your bedroom closet. E mail ahead and get confirmation of a good spacious room on a higher floor (22nd floor and higher for the views) in the Tower block and you'll agree with all the positive reviews. Get given a broom cupboard and you'll agree with the negative reviews.Some tips for SF:1/ Book way in advance for the Alcatraz tours as they sell out quickly. Buy through alcatrazcruises as they run the boats and are the cheapest. Night time tour is good2/ Take a jumper/jacket even in the middle of Summer. It's cold out there in the bay3/ Ride the trams. $5.00 for a single journey. Take the old trams along the F route from Fishermans Wharf to see the non touristy parts of San Francisco 4/ If there's only 2 of you then wait at the traffic lights for the trams to stop and the driver may let you onboard. Queues at the start points can be lengthy5/ Don't get sucked in and eat at the breakfast restaurants recommended in the guidebooks. You will queue for an hour for the same breakfast as you can get at any place</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">dramatic location  After making a San Francisco hotel reservation through Hotwire 鈥?and paying just $125. -- I was excited to find I鈥檇 booked the St. Francis. Right on Union Square and flanked by Saks Fifth Avenue and Tiffany  Co. on one side and Macy鈥檚 on the other, there is no better hotel location (at least for shoppers  tourists) in The City.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great stay at historic hotel! We stayed at the Westin in August of 08. We were given a room on the 10th floor of the old building at the front of the hotel (facing Union Square). We had a partial view of Saks, Tiffany and Co. and other stores on the sqaure. Check in was very quick and the bellboy who took our bags up was extremely informative and friendly. He turned the thermostat down for us, showed us how to use the menu guide on the tv, explained where everything in the hotel was and the how to get to the cable cars, etc. Concierge very knowledgeable. We passed by a wine bar a few blocks from the square on our first night, and when I couldn't remember where it was (or its name) the next day, he knew exactly where it was and whipped out a map with a marked route to get us there. The hotel staff in general are very helpful and polite. We were lucky in that we were given what I guess is a larger room with king bed. Room was probably 20X12. The room was painted in soothing shades of creams/tans with white woodwork, coved ceiling and lots of crown moulding, a crystal chandelier, and large flat screen tv. Bathroom was small, but in great condition and well appointed. My husband's a triathlete, so we visit the gym in every hotel we stay in. He was very impressed with the gym at the Westin. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for location and historical charm. It seems other reviews complain about things like room size, small bathrooms, outdated decor, etc. This hotel is for those that enjoy the charm of historical buildings. If you're looking for a huge master suite type bathroom and olympic sized pool, go somewhere else. Only downside was paying $14 a day for internet and $16 a day for the gym. However, I scored a $189 a night rate through expedia, so didn't feel like we were overcharged on our stay. Great experience at the Westin!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Enjoyed our stay The Westin St. Francis is located right off of Union Square, a prime location in San Francisco. There are a lot of restaurants nearby, and you're just a couple blocks away from the Powell Station of the MUNI, which allows you access to many other San Francisco neighborhoods. You're steps away from Chinatown, and you're along a cable car route to take you down to Fisherman's wharf. You just can't beat the location.My best recommendation would be to request staying in the towers of the hotel. Our first night, my husband and I were assigned to one of the more traditional rooms in the older area of the hotel. It was so tiny, there was only a double bed and not even room for a dresser. Because I'm pretty short, the shower was so small and the shower head was nonadjustable, I had to literally stand with my nose against the marble wall to get the water to hit my hair. It must have been the older construction or the high ceilings in our room, but I had a hard time sleeping that first night because our neighbor's pipes shrieked every time they turned on the sink or flushed the toilet.The next morning I called the front desk, and they cheerfully moved us to one of the rooms in the Towers for the remainder of our stay once one became available. This made a world of difference. Our room was three times the size, we had a king bed, dresser, enough floor space to do back flips if we wanted to, and a large and comfortable bathroom. And of course, the room was quiet and free from the noise of our neighbors. The staff was very considerate and helpful. I would definitely recommend this hotel, and will stay here again if in San Francisco. I cannot, however, comment on rates of the hotel. My husband was there for a conference and his medical program covered the cost of the hotel. If it was coming out of my own pocket, I may have considered something a little less pricey.</p></li>
