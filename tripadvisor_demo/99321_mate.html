I asked the lady on the phone to make sure we could cancel. I just tried to cancel and they "offer" a policy of no cancellations. I know what they're offering and I don't like the smell of it. Am pursuing other means to get my money back. Don't book here if required to pay up front.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 3 nights this trip and found this to be a very convenient location for the theater district, restaurants and the park. Having the use of small kitchen in the room is beneficial and the rooms are large enough to not feel cramped. There is a very good business center in the complex. The hop-on/hop-off buses will stop at the corner one block away if you have already gotten tickets.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Manhattan Club for a girls' weekend. We went for shopping and theatre, and this place is a great stay for both. It's within walking distance of Central Park, theatres, and 5th Avenue. It was surprisingly quiet, the suites were spacious, and 5 women were surprisingly comfortable in a one-bedroom suite. I even found the other residents friendly and helpful. Nice bar/restaurant on a top floor.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am an owner at The Manhattan Club. It is a terrific place to stay and the hotel is nice and the staff is professional and couteous. If you are thinking about purchasing a timeshare at The Manhattan Club, buyer beware. The resale value is less than 10% of the amount you will pay if you purchase directly from the onsite sales/marketing staff. The reason is that the annual maintenence fees range from $1,800-$3,000/yr. Read notes from Aug. 4, 2010 owners meeting at tmcnyowners.com.</p></li>

The room in no way resembled the misleading picture on their websight. When you book, they charge your credit card and consider it non-cancellable. After taking 1 look at the dingy room, we refused to stay and then spent 4-6 months fighting with them to get the charges cancelled which they refused.

The layout of the room worked out well, as it allowed me to leave the bedside lights on without disturbing those on the sofa bed. Our room and bathroom was clean. Furnishings were modern and not worn. Housekeeping staff was great. We had no problems waiting for the elevators. The bar/lounge at the very top floor was a nice retreat. Best feature of the hotel is the location. Only issue was the heat in our room.</p></li>

The apt 1705 was on the corner of the buildind with 2 sides and 3 windows overlooking the 7th Av and the 56th Street. The apt was warm and cozy, two bathrooms, one bedroom, livingroom, and kitchenette. At the last floor there's a business center (free use of computers) and a big bar and common livingroom where you can find free newspapers and free cofee, tea, and biscuits from 11am to 4 pm.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Used my timeshare in NYC for the first time. Excited to have a full week in NYC, pre paid....first room was not renovated, had an old fold out couch. Bathroom had peeling paint, the old tub....not sure if it was mold, but around the tub looked icky. They brought us a cot to use until they could change our room the next day....had them waive my entire daily fee for the week it was so bad....second room, much better layout, and new couch. Renovated bath....after the room change, I was very happy. In the end, it was a great week!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Manhattan Club: I stayed with my friend-owner for the US Open and was greatly dassapointed. The room is big but furnished poorly, old spotted sofa, leaking aircondition from the ceiling, the toilet is not for a 'big' person. Staff is half-friendly. Elevators are just terrible, over slow, wait up to 15 min. There are additonal elevators offered to guests: trashed, dirty, and smell... due to no airconditioning at that area. The only positive is location and roomy space. But for the same price of ~$400-500 Hilton is much better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here through RCI timeshare exchange for 7 nights in Sept 2007. Was a bit worried about mixed reviews of accommodation but all I can say is that it was fabulous. We had a 1 bed suite with 2 bathrooms, lounge area with kitchenette and separate bedroom with king size bed. Room was at rear of hotel so rather dark and no view but who goes to NY to look out of the window? Location on 56 St is amazing, so close to all attractions. Daily Maid service @$25 per night was well worth it. I would go back time and again if I didn't live so far away Karen</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Manhattan Club for 7 days. Location was great as was the room/studio unit. In general we had a great stay but it was marred by the rudeness of the staff who were rather condescending and abrupt - in particular one of females working at the reception area was so rude that her manner bordered on insolence. We would recommend staying at the Manhattan Club as it is in a great location, easily accessible, clean, rooms are great and well maintained however we would warn people to expect rudeness from the staff .

Room size is great for two, had an inside room so there is no view. $25 a night for housekeeping was a bit much but it saved tipping every time you turned around. Nice to come back to the room and have it cleaned every day. Didn't use the partial kitchen much but it was nice to have a microwave and small fridge. Concierge service was very helpful with directions, tickets for shows etc. I would pass on the timeshare presentation, just not the way to kill 1 1/2 hours.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As others already commented the MC has a great location for Broadway, Central Park and the Museums. Thank's to NYC efficient transportation system you can easily move around the city with no effort at all. The suite is a little bit small but nice and cozy. Very compfortable bed. The bathroom is not the best since it lacks space around the sink and doesn't have a hand set in addition to the shower, which could have a better flow. Staff are freindly and helpful. You get a small kichinette with micro wave oven, coffe maker, refrigrator and supply of coffee. It is a very good choice for RCI exchange.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A last-minute booking but well worth it! Stayed here from 30 July 2009 for 10nts. Spacious rooms & friendly staff. Bath & Body Works amenities. The beds are quite heavenly. Nothing much to say about the lobby and the elevators though, but it's no biggie. We especially loved the business centre on the 26th floor - 5 computers readily available for guests to use, and you can print, too. Times Square is just a 5minute walk. Close to lots of shopping like GAP, Daffy's, etc. Subway is almost next door (57th Street) - Columbus Circle is less than a 5min walk. Very close to Central Park. We really liked this place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I had a trial ownership and decided to use one of the nights to be able to be in the city for the fireworks for July 4th. We did arrive early because we had a meeting with the ownership program at noon. While our room was of course not ready that early we were able to enjoy snacks in the lounge upstairs. Our room was beautiful and it was quiet even though we were closer to the elevator. Another awesome experience and everyone at the Club was very kind. We have several more nights left and we are anxious to use them. Central Park is close by for a romantic carriage ride. Several excellent restaurants are nearby as well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros: Great location!! We had a nice room with two baths, two wide screen TV's with full cable AND moviesand were able to bring in food to eat in which was nice. Right near Central Park. Go and enjoy stay. BUT.... Cons: Street noise is very bad bring earplugs. Slow elevators Be forewarned: they are timeshare and they are going to try to lure you in with a "free gift card" and take up an entire day of your vacation time trying to get you buy into the timeshare. They call and call to get you to see their presentation. Do not be fooled they are overstocked with product. Avoid the timeshare presentation of the Manhattan Club like the plague.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in a studio for 4 nights. Location of property - fantastic. However, I would not stay here again. The room was plenty big for two people, but I hated the air conditioning/ heating set up. When we were there, the hotel was set to "HEAT". I wanted to put on the A/C; however, that was not possible! It was warm and stuffy in the room and all I could do was open the two windows 4" up. I called the front desk and they said the hotel was set to HEAT only. What an archaic system. Also, the water pressure and volume of water in the shower was dreadful - not good for women with long hair. The kitchen was nice and rooms were cleaned well each day.</p></li>

Suddenly at 4:00 P.M., all the rooms were ready. We got caught in a terrible rain downpour and were soaked by the time we arrived at The Manhattan Club at 2:00 P.M. we kept checking to see if we could get into our room to change into dry clothes: however, that was not going to happen.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed two week nights in March, 2012. The hotel staff was helpful in getting places and in making suggestions for things to do during a short stay. The bed was comfortable and the showers had plenty of warm water. We didn't use the microwave or sink, but it was night to have the refrigerator for keeping drinks cold. We were not too far from the elevator and were concerned that a constant bell ringing would keep us awake, but the bells were either disconnected or very quiet so it wasn't a sleeping problem at all. The location was great, right near Carnegie Hall (undergoing some renovation) and a short walk from most places we wanted to see. I would stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Manhattan Club was better than we had expected after reading TripAdvisor reviews. We stayed in one of their newly renovated Metropolitan Suites on the second floor. Though the room was small, everything was clean and new. A small kitchenette area with a microwave,sink and refrigerator was a plus. The bathroom was modern and a reasonable size. The bed was excellent. The elevators ARE slow, but not impossibly so. (We walked from the main floor using service stairs, but one of our party was on the 15th floor.) The staff at the front desk and concierge desk were consistently pleasant and helpful. Overall, given the extremely high prices of midtown hotels, this was a good choice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This time share/hotel is in a great location on W56, between 7th and 8th Aves. Close to Central Park, Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center. The elevator wait daily was horrible. The persistent phone calls from time share sales staff wanting "90 minutes of your time" was very bothersome. Bellmen and front desk staff were very indifferent. there is a lounge on the 26th floor, open to members and hotel guests alike. Michael, one of the bartenders, was an asset to this property. If you are able to secure a great room rate, don't mind long elevator waits and can handle your room phone ringing when trying to relax, then go for it. Otherwise, I say find a reputable hotel that has a repuation for customer service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Manhattan Club March 7 - 10. We had a great time. The location could'nt be better!! We had a one bedroom 2 bath penthouse suite on the 28th floor. The unit was very clean, spacious, & nicely decorated. Not one complaint. If you have the opportunity rent a penthouse suite, its worth it!!! Our bed was so comfortable!!! Nice Bose stereo system in your suite, 2 plasma tvs, small kitchenette with all the essentials except there is no stove but who wants to cook when you can wak to all the fabulous restaurants. Parking is only $28/day which is'nt bad but you can't take your car out or you have to pay again. We used cabs to get around to places we could'nt walk to like a couple of the museums, etc.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room in the Manhattan Club was a generous size compared to other rooms that I have stayed in. There was a double bed and a double pull out couch. The room had a kitchenette that was equipped with disposable dishes and utensils. The bathroom was very modern and clean with a huge walk in shower, the only thing it lacked was a bathtub, which did not bother us. This is a timeshare, which we were aware of. We were contacted about an info session but as soon as they realized it was two women without spouses they were not interested in talking to us. Come into this century Manhattan Club! The location is great very close to Central Park, subway and a easy walk to Times Square. An excellent stay and we will definitely return.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's all about location, location, location. Manhattan Club was a perfect location and in walking distance of almost everything we wanted to do. The one bedroom unit, which had 2 bathrooms, was perfect for a couple but would have been a little too crowded for 4 people. The beds were very comfortable and the unit was quiet. We have a great week in New York City. We did not like the fact that we paid upfront through RCI and through our time share, then Manhattan Club wants to tack on a "hospitality fee" of $25 per day. My definition of hospitality is entertaining guests or visitors with liberality and goodwill. So, now we have to pay people to be nice to us?? We had a great vacation and enjoyed the location. Would we go back, of course.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in the city overnight for dinner & a show. Got a great deal to The Manhattan Club through Bloomspot.com (great deals). Pulling up, the valet took our car & offered us help with the bags. Check in was a breeze. We requested a room next to our friends so had to wait until it was ready, no big deal, only 10 minutes. What a great surprise to see the size of the rooms for an NYC hotel!!!!! Nicely appointed, clean, well stocked with coffee, robes, etc. Wish the bathroom had a vanity instead of a pedastal sink - leave no where for your products when getting ready. Only complaint would be thin walls. Unless there were really loud guests! haha! I would go back in a heartbeat! Great location, right off of broadway and close to everything!</p></li>

We arrived early and our bags were Totally unimpressed with the suites and the price. When we indicated that we were not interested we were asked "why did you come"? Well you called us weekly for months and you offered Broadway tickets plus some was our answer. Clearly the "top seller" was not happy with us. Was actually somewhat rude after learning our decision. Anyway the perks were great. Got to see Phantom of the Opera, Central Park and everything else within walking and subway(first time to NYC) The room was small and rather drab. The elevators were dreadfully slow. Would not recommend unless a fantastic deal can be obtained. Location is great.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for a week booking through RCI. Whilst it was a little pricey, i think it was comparable to other hotels in the area. It was clean and well appointed, having the junior suite we had a small kitchenette and lounge area. Great for those nights you want to stay in -more like a home than a hotel. We were called up by RCI to attend an information night but if you tell them your spouse is not with you they are not interested. The location is fantastic -it is just round the corner from the subway station (N, Q, R line), and a very short walk to Columbus circle, the department stores on 5th Ave. Times square is also walkable (20minutes). We took a taxi to and from LGA -one trip costing close to $40 exc tip and the other slightly over 30 (exc tip). It is very traffic dependant.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not my first visit to NYC but it was for my two friends who were with me. This was a trip to celebrate our each turning 60 this year. When I made the reservation I was excited to have a suite and the pictures on the website certainly showed enough space for three adult women. You can imagine our surprise when we walked in to a standard sized hotel room. The only thing that made it a suite was the couch that made into a bed (another bed would have worked instead of making this each night) and the micro kitchenette. We were cramped and barely had room for our clothes let alone the souvenirs we bought! Staff at the desk were not overly helpful, the doormen and maid staff however were very friendly and helpful. Will likely go back to the city, don't think we'll stay here again though.</p></li>

It was a open plan with living area with sofa bed and small bathroom with no window so got very steamy & stuffy.Our air conditioning didnt work and the heat was horendous when we opened the window for fresh air it was noisy. There was just enough room to get the sofa bed opened out in the living area, when opened out it was almost touching the fridge & units and the couple that slept on it ended up sleeping with the fridge door opened to try cool down. The carpet in the suite& the corriders was worn and tired. The location was good but everything else was really dissappointing especially when it was fairly expensive the pictures were very very deceiving. Much better to stay in a hotel</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had been there in Nov 2008 and had loved it, so returned for a 1 week stay and had an almost corner unit in the 18th floor, wonderful view: broadway, central park, skyline...The most beautiful thing at the Manhattan Club is that you can feel at home, the 1 bedroom unit is roomy: living room (with sofabed), kitchenette, 2 bathrooms... a luxury in New York!

<li>We had been there in Nov 2008 and had loved it, so returned for a 1 week stay and had an almost corner unit in the 18th floor, wonderful view: broadway, central park, skyline...The most beautiful thing at the Manhattan Club is that you can feel at home, the 1 bedroom unit is roomy: living room (with sofabed), kitchenette, 2 bathrooms... a luxury in New York!</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A very convenient location for Times Square and all Midtown destinations and less than one block away from the subway. We had a one bedroom suite which was just right for our family of four. The walls however seemed quite thin (or we just happened to have very loud neighbours) as we could clearly hear what was being said next door on a couple of occasions. Yes, there was a $25 a day hospitality charge, however there was free Internet, coffee, tea and popcorn was replenished daily and if you were around, free hot drinks and cookies in the member's lounge in the afternoon. Before arriving we received at least four invitations to the RCI presentation which we duly ignored. On site we received one written invitation and one call about this. We declined and were left to enjoy the rest of our stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Well placed hotel undergoing change. We were offered timeshare whilst checking in! The 'remodelled rooms' are small but have above average decor. The main drawback is that many rooms face inwards into a central shaft that lets in barely any light so your room is in permanent darkness. If you stay at this hotel make sure you get an outward facing room. Staff range from helpful to inefficient and surly dependant on how busy they are. Lifts are programmed badly so you have to wait forever unless you are prepared to use the staircase. Not feasable for elderly or those with young children. Despite all this the hotel was crowded with out of town guests coming into NY for Christmas shopping and the shows. If you can get an outside facing room and resist the timeshare sales spiel it is worth staying here</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In New York rooms are generally small because real estate it so expensive. So imagine our surprise and pleasure when we were fortunate enought to get a timeshare exchange. at the Manhattan Club, regardless of the size of the room. Then imagine our delight when we found our one bedroom apartment had a sofa bed which made it a 4 person accommodation so had two bathrooms. As there was only the 2 of us this meant we had a bathroom each!. We had a kitchenette with microwave, coffee maker, firdge and dishwasher plus our rooms were serviced dail. We also had access to gym, large louge with bar which operated form 4.30pm and business centre where printing of documents was free. Also free interent wifi throughout the building. There are more positives I could add from our perspective but realise that I am now prejudiced! Great value, great service and I would go back anyday.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just got back from a weekend stay at the Manhattan Club. It was very nice--I stayed in a one bedroom suite, with one bedroom, a living room/dining room/kitchenette combo with a sleeper sofa and two full bathrooms. The suite we had was clean and comfortable. The bathrooms were really spacious, and we had plenty of clean towels. The location was great...within easy walking distance to the seventh avenue express subway train for easy access to downtown. The Manhattan Club doesn't have a restaurant, but there are lots of great restaurants nearby, including Serafina, Carnegie Deli and Banash. There's also a Starbucks right around the corner. Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue shopping and MOMA are within walking distance. We did not take advantage of the concierge, but we did use the bag check service twice, which was no problem at all. All in all, a very good experience. I would go back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this as a treat for my daughters 13th Birthday and we had a great time. Room was spotlessly clean, good view outside and we had no trouble with the lifts! Staff I would say were polite but not as freindly as other people we met. Although when I had a problem (not to do with the hotel)the Manager was very efficient in sorting it out speedily for me. The location and standard of the room/suite means we would happily reccommend this hotel. One tip, book express passes for Empire State Buliding, well worth the extra cost, you get treated like royalty and we were up to the 86th floor within 5 minutes of entering the building, by passing massive queues. Fab delux deli around the corner and Central Park 5 minutes away, as is 5th Avenue. At the Rockerfeller Centre try the Rainbow Room for cocktails with its fab views. It is walking distance and well worth the mortgage busting cost!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There was a lady sales representative that had a "you owe me attitude" trying to sell us a timeshare. She was very rude, unprofessional, and her "aggressive" sales tactics were a total turn off. If I had a $100,000 in my back pocket, I would not buy a timeshare at this location. Everyone that we met in New York was very nice except for this one chick. I know that economic times are bad, however no one should be that desperate for a sale. She made comments such as, "you lied..." "your aunt lied..." "are you not in the same financial bracket as your aunt..." These comments were totally uncalled for by this so-called professional. She needs to get one thing straight--I am the customer, and you SIMPLY work there. If you are there for the timeshare promotion, I am hoping that you are treated with respect.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For us this was a great value because we rented from an owner for three nights over thanksgiving weekend. The costs would have been much more if we hadn't. We stayed on the 20th floor in a Junior Executive Suite and were very pleased with size. We stay in the city several weekends a year and this is the largest we've stayed in. The location is awesome, subway is real close, plenty of food choices. I have 2 complaints although not significant to us. The elevators were slow a various times during the day. Many people were willing to ride up the elevator just to get back down. And do not attempt to use them during checkout time (11 am). The guest directory is a little misleading when it talks about the club lounge- the continental breakfast is not included with your stay, it is $14.95. The tv in the room was even more misleading. We are going to stay here again in March in the one bedroom suite.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good location but....!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed at the Manhattan Club Hotel. Dislikes: The reception staff were not overly friendly. A genuine smile would help! The room was not adequate for 4 people, as it had only one double bed & one double sofa bed to accommodate us. The extractor fan in the bathroom was not working & when we phoned reception, we were told the fan wasn't working. No suggestion given as to when or if it would be fixed. The elevators were very slow and too small. Likes: Good location. Short walk from Central Park & excellent diners. Bellboys (except for one) and the concierge were very friendly & helpful. One of the chambermaids we met was very friendly & had a genuine pleasant smile. The kitchenette was a bonus, with cutlery & plates etc supplied. The beds, while inadequate, were comfortable & the kitchenette, & bathroom were spotlessly clean. Loved New York. Will be back again but not to the Manhattan Club!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We also took advantage of the Living Social deal, which, if you add up the regular cost of the room and the gift card we received, saved us about $160. Yes, the tax wasn't included but it was a relatively minor inconvenience. Ours was the opposite experience of the previous poster. We were able to check in at 12:30, our executive junior suite (22nd floor) was quite nice and we had no problems with staff or the whole timeshare element. When making the actual reservation (both Living Social and Manhattan Club do have you jumping through a few hoops), we specified that we weren't interested in the timeshare chat and were weren't bothered once. I have heard that the Metropolitan Suites on the second floor were less impressive. The location was perfect for our needs...within a few blocks of the Central Park Zoo and MOMA...and the N & R subway line was a block up, as was a delicious dinner at Trattoria Dell'Arte.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Terrible Customer Service Rude Reception & Maid”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First the good good points Location is Suberb.No need to get subway as it is close to everything Times Square and Central Park. Treatment on check-in was a disgrace we had a Metropolitan room which was next to the hotel aircon unit which was just outside the room on a flat roof on the 2nd floor. We asked to move to another room which after a few moans the receptionist reluctantly agreed to do. The new room was only 2 doors down the replacement room was worse than the original A damp smell, on returning to reception I was told there were no more rooms so I asked if we could change back. Her response was I canâ€™t keep on changing rooms It was 11pm there was no one else in the reception finally we got the original room back. The maid was very was rude as well asking why we needed or sheets changed half way through our 7 night stay, considering we were paying 15 dollars a night for the service. Hotel needs to sent staff on customer service class.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Manhattan Club during the Easter weekend. We had a one bdroom unit and it's the most spacious accomodation we ever had in NYC. The unit is kept very clean but the furnishings need updated. Prior to arrival, we had asked for an updated unit and was told my request was noted. At check in (a cool reception), we were told the unit was an updated unit. The unit was located right in front of the elevator but it turned out there was no issue with noise at all. But the unit was definitely not one of the updated unit. The fabric on the sofa was worn away and the door to the dishwasher look like it was falling off. We didn't use the dishwasher so we couldn't tell if it works. Aside from that, everything was fine- bed was comfortable and the unit was quiet though not much of a view. The valet parking rate at $28 per 24 hours was very reasonable compared with the lots nearby. Overall, it was a good stay though the service level could be improved.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This accomodation was clean, friendly and conveniently located. We are great walkers and did a ton of walking right from the front door. Great location to Central Park and short walk to Time Square. It was far enough away from the hussle and bussle of Time Square but it only took a few minutes to be in the middle of it. Our room faced the courtyard but could still see the street from our window. The windows are single pane so it was a bit loud. But the traffic was not bad so it was ok. Housekeeping was excellent but they need to be a bit more quiet with slamming doors. We were early risers but felt for those who were hoping to sleep in. Beds very comfortable. We were in a studio and only missed a toaster. But that might be due to fire regulations. Elevators are REALLY slow so don't hesitate to use the service elevator. No biggy though. Blue Line hop on - hop off is right around the corner. It was well worth the money. We took a two day pass and loved it.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband & I were on our first visit to New York to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary. We used our points system and booked the Manhattan Club 10 months in advance of our trip. Our accommodation was a junior studio which was ideal for our purpose. It was clean, functional and the bed was so comfortable (I want their pillows). There was limited cooking facilities but we had no intention of doing any cooking. Making coffee was our limit. The location was absolutely perfect for getting around New York especially Broadway, Times Square, Central Park, 5th Avenue and subways. During our week we received one phone call about attending a presentation, which we declined, and were never bothered again. Yes, we could have received vouchers for meals, tickets for shows but our time was more valuable. The only day we had a problem waiting for lifts was on check out, but it wasn't unbearable . When we go back to New York we will definately try and stay at the Manhattan Club.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Do not stay here if: 1. You want a room like the pictures found on their website online. What you REALLY get is not a suite at all but a small room with a bed in it and a two person sofa that pulls out into the most uncomfortable of "beds". The springs polk through - it hurts when you roll over. The fridge is the size of a cardboard box and it's under a counter. No table, no chairs. 2. You want the air conditioner to work. It was HOT! We had to ask housekeeping for a fan to be able to sleep; and it was April! 3. The elevator to work. It doesn't. Get on your walking shoes! [And your pepper spray] The stairs and hallways are dark and kind of scary. 4. The door to lock. It didn't. We moved the furniture in front of the door for the night to feel more secure. 5. Someone to help you. We asked the front desk to help us with all these things and they basically brushed us off like lint. Not helpful at all. I never write reviews but had to in this case; I was VERY disappointed!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Manhattan club February 2012. The "door staff" was very helpful from parking our car, unloading our luggage and storing it until our room was ready. The front desk staff was average, not overly friendly like the "door staff" was. We were able to get into our room at 4:30p.m, 1/2 late. Our room was a "soft" suite, with 2 bathrooms. facing Carnegie Hall. The room was "nice". Not wonderful, not fabulous, not outstanding, just nice. We rented this from a friend of ours who was an owner. The place is in need of an update. We were NOT happy with the lack of services, no room service, limited bar time, limited breakfast. The breakfast was nothing to be desired, overpriced and poorly displayed. We went to the adjoining hotel for a wonderfully displayed, very good, served breakfast with a view, for a few dollars more. The housekeeping department did a wonderful job and was very friendly. The next stay in NYC will be at a full service hotel for the same price, better view and updated facilities.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just spent a week at the Manhattan Club...we completely enjoyed it (in spite of the negative reviews we had read, we were a little concerned, then were pleasantly surprised. The MC exceeded our expectations.) Great accommodations, close to everything (Broadway, Central Park, 5th Avenue, Times Square, restaurants) and we found the entire staff to be very polite and friendly! The elevators are under renovation (like many buildings in NYC, the building is very old, thus the elevators are being updated)....just be patient. When you visit, do ask the staff for restaurant recommendations to avoid potential tourist traps - and do expect to pay a little more - you are in Manhattan! To get half-priced broadway tickets, be sure to visit the TKTS booth in Times Square. To get around, buy a Metro Card and use the subway - very efficient and seemed safe. In fact, the city in general felt much safer than we expected. We are already looking forward to our next stay at The MC and highly recommend it to others. Can't imagine staying anywhere else in the city.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We finally got a trade into the Manhattan Club. The location's great, a block from the subway station, right next to 7th ave and 2 blocks from Central Park. Like in the other reviews that I've read, the front desk people were not friendliest people. Not rude, but expressionless. It was a hit or miss with the elevators. Sometimes the elevator was there within a minute and other times it was so slow that we took the stairs. We were in room 1207 and there's not much of a view unless you like looking at the outside walls of the other units. We had a 1 bedroom suite. The bed was hard and the room was small compared to other timeshares that we stayed in. I was told that all rooms or hotel rooms in Manhattan were small and that this was quite large. We had 2 bathrooms and they were clean and with marbled counters and gold tone fixtures. I thought the room was dark too. The water pressure in the shower was good. There was a kitchenette and we kept sodas in the refrigerator. There were alot of police cars and police on horseback in the area. I felt it was very safe.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is in a great location, rooms are definitely ready at 4pm, not earlier. The staff was courteous. We were travelling with our 21 and 22 year old daughters, we stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, primarily because it had to full bathrooms. We decided it was more economical to stay in the 1 bedroom suite with a pull out couch for our daughters than to rent two rooms. The space was fine but the sofa bed was really uncomfortable. I'd probably stay at this hotel again but would not subject our daughters to the sofa bed. The only issue I had with our room was that it always felt a little too warm, and VERY humid. In fairness to the hotel, I never called them to complain, we just weren't in the room that much. Having the kitchenette area was handy, grocery store close by so we were able to eat breakfast in our room each morning. We avoided the slow elevators by using the service elevators which were not fancy but were quick! We also did not have any view whatsoever, our windows faced the interior of the building, brick walls, so there was no natural light in our room at all.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We travel to Manhattan on a yearly basis and bought a timeshare at the Manhattan Club three years ago. With two teenaged daughters, it's tough to find something as spacious as the suites at the Manhattan Club that are not exorbitantly expensive, so we purchased there. The service is excellent, and the reservations a breeze when we go through our salesperson, Arnie. Some of the rooms have not been renovated, but he always manages to put us in an updated room. We are very pleased with our ownership there, and the location can't be beat. It's three blocks from Central Park and within a block of Broadway theatres and Fifth Avenue shopping. Subways are right on the corner, and therefore Soho and Chinatown are 5 minutes away by train. We have recommended numerous friends who have also purchased there. It's a great value but Manhattan is not inexpensive. The concierge, Carmi, is also the best! He got us discounted tickets for Million Dollar Quartet on a Saturday night for less than $100 each, fourth row center orchestra! We also got into the Palm, which was completely booked up, through him.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were struggling to find a hotel in the city that was not over $500 a night, we were on a business trip but still we sis not want to pay that kind of rate. We had a quick review of Trip Advisor of the Manhattan Club and decided to give it a go. The hotel was easily found and very bright so you could not miss it. Check was fine, not the most helpful but then what else do you get in New York, the staff were not very rude but not very pleasant either. I had a 1 bed room, the room was big and comfortable, with a kitchenette which I did not use. The decoration was dated and the hallways smelled for lack of air. The bathroom was small but again big enough for 1, the quality of the wares within the bathroom was not the greatest at all, they could really invents in some better supplies. Check was fine, again not the best of manners and the bell guys were over helpful because of the tip they expected, they were quite rude when not tipped on placing the bags in storage but this improved on collection. Overall the location was great, the room comfortable and clean, the dÃ©cor was poor but for New York I guess this was good for a short stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a timeshare hotel, but it was not clear this is what we were getting into when I booked online through their website. The booking was just like booking any other hotel. Then the emails and phone calls started, trying to sign me up for a tour of the property (of course they give you a voucher for dinner or something like that). One phone call to me before our trip confirming our reservation was completely wrong, that worried me a bit. Part of our package was for a continental breakfast for two in the members club and a free days parking(their parking rate for our 5-day stay was very reasonable $28/day). Glad I didn't pay for the breakfast. Our room was clean, the mattres was excellent, the master bath was tiny, the second bath off the entrance to our suite was much better. The "Courtyard view" is a window to 3 walls of other buildingsThe workout room is large and well equipped. They offered free internet connection but had to ask for it. They didn't offer it up and it wasn't easy to connect. Location, location, location! Can walk to everything mid-town has to offer. Overall a good stay, reasonably priced, not over the top fancy but well priced for location.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this timeshare/hotel for a long weekend and it was very nice. The room was large for a hotel room in Manhattan and well priced for the location. The staff was friendly and helpful. They called and offered the timeshare presentation, but it did not meet our schedule. They accepted this and did not call again. The bell staff was helpful. The concierge staff were all great with advice on transportation, directions and arranging meal reservations. The location was perfect a couple of blocks from Central Park, within view of Carnegie Hall, and easy walking distance to the MOMA and many other locations. We visited as part of a 20th anniversary trip and the ride through the park, and other opportunities close by made the trip. The only issue was a plumbing problem in the middle of the night, and the desk had an engineer to the room to fix it in minutes, and had it mostly cleaned up. The next day after housekeeping had been in the room you could not tell there had been an issue. When it was time to leave they arranged for a car service to transport us to the cruise terminal for the amount estimated for a city taxi. I would certainly stay at this location again!.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having never been to Manhattan, choosing this hotel was a shot in the dark. And having just spent 5 nights there - we would stay there again anytime and recommend it to all my friends. The location is excellent - within walking distance to so many of the midtown sites, all the theaters, Times Square, Carnegie Hall, Rockefeller Centre & excellent shopping (both on a budget & not!). Also, the hotel is within blocks of the hop-on/hop-off tour bus locations (which we strongly recommend!), great dining (again, both on a budget & not!). Best deli "Carnegie" just around the corner and too many more to mention. The hotel rooms have kitchenettes - great for morning coffee, drinks and snacks! The hotel and rooms are a little tired (wallpaper peeling, smalls carpet stains) - but who cares! The rooms are clean, beds comfortable (though no king size available - queen only!) and price is right. Internet is available in the rooms and free. Staff are helpful getting cabs, directions and dining suggestions! There is a gym, fitness center and lounge/bar - no restaurant (thus the kitchenettes!). They offer a continental breakfast, though we never tried it....way to many other great options for dining near the hotel! Highly recommend the Manhattan Club!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed with a friend who has a time share; my daughter and I have stayed at beautiful hotels worldwide and are not snobs, and we hated this place. The rooms were dirty, the carpeting, upholstery, countertops etc were dirty as well. The staff unhelpful and unfriendly. Rooms are dark and dreary. Filthy would be a better word when it comes to the upholstery! When we walked into the lobby late at night I did not feel safe and felt like I was in a very sketchy place. The halls were dismal and dark, some areas were VERY narrow, could barely walk through without banging luggage against the wall. Luckily, I was not the paying customer, I would have been furious and appalled at the conditions. You could not pay me to stay here again. My friend offered me the place for additional days but we could not stay any longer than one night. I didn't sleep a wink, the fold out was uncomfortable. I would rather pay $500/night somewhere else and feel clean and secure than stay at the Manhattan club for a second. I don't write reviews normally but felt I had to in this case. Trust me you can pay less and have a significanly better experience!!! Previous reviewer was right Howard Johnson's or a Holiday Inn would be a better choice! You can pass on this one!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Manhattan Club with my Husband,30 yr old daughter and 13yr old granddaughter. we were there 7-4-08 to 7-11-08. Our check in was wonderful,the girl at the front desk could not have been nicer ,we exchanged though RCI and checked in at 3:30pm. Our room was 1708 and was very,very clean. It had a mini kitchen,two baths with tubs,a living room with pull out (which my daughter and granddaughter found ok to sleep on)we had a king bed in the bedroom that was very comfy. The maids came in every day for a fee of $25.00 per day but worth it. We rode the subway most of the time. We did take a taxi when we went to a show or out for the night . It was very warm and one would be too sweaty to walk to the theatre area. Location is great and there are little markets to get prepared foods, snacks or food items.There is a small fridge & microwave in the unit. We had two TV's and a table to sit at to eat. The elevators were slow and we did take the service elevators at times but the wait was not that long. The staff helped with anything that we wanted with a smile and in a timely manner. We did not see anyone that was rude or did not want to be helpful from the maids,desk staff to the door men. We would stay here anytime we can. It was a wonderful week.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of 2 adults and 2 small children visited New York for the first time. We spent 7 nights in a 1 bedroom unit at this Timeshare/Hotel property. It was fantastic overall. By New York standards, the unit was very good size, including 2 full bathrooms, bedroom, a living room with eating area and a kitchenette, which ended up being our saving grace. There was a refrig., microwave, dishwasher, coffee pot and dishes. We were out walking and seeing from 8:00 am until 7:00 pm each day and it was wonderful to be able to pick up some fresh ready made food from the many markets/food bars in the neighborhood and go back to our room to eat, (instead of dragging 2 tired youngsters to a restaurant) relax, make some hot tea and really rejuvinate for the next day. The unit was clean, quiet and very comfortable. The front desk staff was not particularly friendly, but we had no specific issues with them. The Housekeeping and maintainance staff was great. (the guests in the unit next door left their bathtub running and it flooded our front hall closet). The best part about this property was its location. 2 blocks from the southern edge of Central Park - there was a subway station right downstairs - and only 15 min. walk to Broadway ! We loved this place and will definately be back to stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently enjoyed a 3 night stay here.We had a 1 BR unit with a King bed, and the kids slept on a pullout in the living room. Both rooms were a really good size, especially for NYC, and there was lots of storage space. There were 2 full baths. One had a tub/shower combo, and the other had a large shower. Bath and Body works soaps/shampoos/lotions were included. The kitchenette area had a table and 4 chairs, microwave, frig., dishes, and dishwasher.There was also a coffeemaker and included coffee We enjoyed being able to have our coffee and breakfast in each morning. A major problem with this hotel/timeshare is the elevators. There are only 2 that serviced the timeshare apts., and 2 service elevators. Since 1 elevator was out of service,guests could use the service elevators, but it took FOREVER to get down from the 17th floor. We waited 40 minutes once, as every time one stopped, it was jammed full Finally we squeezed onto an elevator going up, and we stopped on each of the floors up until the 26th floor, and then on each floor on the way down.Everytime the door opened there were people hoping to get on, but there was no way. Everyone was complaining, and it was a huge problem! One couple squeezed their 2 kids on with us, and they walked down 17 flights to meet us at the bottom. Guess who got there 1st! Other than that, our stay was great..</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was a bit nervous after reading the reviews, but pleasantly surprised during my stay this month. Starting with the cons: 1) The elevators! We were on the 16th floor and at times just walked down! There was 1 regular elevator and then the service elevators, so we waited from 2-10 minutes based upon time of day. 2) While pleasant, housekeeping was very slow in helping us out our first night with a small issue, but then were fine after that. 3) The concierge was adequate but not particularly helpful. 4) The pullout couch, which my daughters slept on, was awful, so they put the mattress on the floor and layers of blankets on it to deal with the thin covering over the innersprings. Now the pros: 1) Great location just 3 short blocks from Central Park, 10 minutes to Rockefeller Center and 5th Ave shops, diagonally across the street from Carnegie Hall, and the theatres were all within a 5-15 minute walking distance (there are so many sets of lights that it can take a while). 2) The room was a generously sized 1 bedroom corner with views of Central Park, which I loved. 3) The bed was surprizingly comfortable. 4) Two great bathrooms! 5) Despite sweltering 88-92 degree weather, the ACs worked beautifully! So in summary, great location, great room, be careful of the pull-out couch mattresses and hope that both elevators are in service when you go, but I wouldn't hesitate to return!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed for a week in September. This was our second stay here. Both times we were in a one bedroom suite. The suite consists of a separate bedroom with a king bed, flat screen TV, closet, plenty of drawers and a bathroom with tub and shower. Then there is a separate living room with a TV, an eating area, a mini kitchen and another bathroom with a shower. There is daily maid service, good towels and bath amenities. We were on the 25th floor with an east view and windows that opened. The decor is functional, mid-level but clean and more than adequate. On our stay the elevators were running and our limited staff encounters wer also fine. We had done the time share tour last visit so they left us alone. I read the mixed reviews. I know they were having elevator problems but they are now ok. Of course, the location is the best. Easy walking distance to MOMA, Lincoln Center, Metropolitan Museum, Central Park, Whole Foods, etc. Plenty of restaurants in walking distance and easy subway and bus access. From our perspective, the best part is that we get in on a timeshare swap thru RCI and the cost is minimal compared to the rack rate. As one of the very few timeshares in NYC its not easy to get into but our timeshare company seems to make a deal to make it available. Don't know if I would pay $500 + a nite but as long as we can do a timeshare swap its a great deal and a great location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ignore all the negative comments - you will enjoy your stay. And to the management - do not listen to complainers that say your staff is rude - absolutely everyone of the staff was quite the opposite. . Check in was easy and fast as was check out. Concierge was friendly and helpful. Bellmen were nice, friendly and helpful. Did they have their hand out for a tip as one poster wrote?? Absolutely not! But did we tip? Of course - that is what you do in a hotel!! Elevators - not sure what some are referring to, but we never waited an excessive amount of time for an elevator. Not even once. It is a non issue. Location - perfect- close to everything. A few blocks from Times Square and close to the Theatre District. Room - Not large, but by NYC standards the room was spacious and good value for the money. (we booked an RCI extra vacation and payed about $1160.00 Cdn for three nights.). We were three sisters sharing a studio, the bed was comfortable, my sister slept on the couch without pulling it out, so not sure what the sofa bed was like, but the couch was fine. The room were clean (no bed bugs and we had a public health nurse in our group who knows how to check), Washrooms were nice - not luxurious but clean, updated. Loved having the small kitchenette - enjoyed cereal and coffee in our room for breakfast and wine and cheese for snacks. I will definitely stay here for my next trip to NYC (which hopefully is soon)!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Penhouse Suites at the MC”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were lucky enough to be gifted a night at one of the MC's penthouse suites. These are found on the hotel's 27th floor and above, and require a special elevator/key card to be reached. I'm not familiar with the rest of the hotel/time share accomodations, but my guess is the penthouse suites are somewhat more snazzy. Our suite was not huge but plenty spacious; galley-efficiency kitchen (coffee provided), sitting area with pull-out queen sofa, bedroom, and two very large bathrooms. The bathrooms are fabulous. The glass/tile walk-in shower in the master bath was, on its own, almost as big as a whole bathroom! Plenty of upscale toiletries are provided; the linens are very good quality and the bed comfy. The suite was clean and quiet. The quality/character of the lobby was not what I expected -- small, and always seemed rather noisy and crowded. We arrived at 4 o'clock check-in time, and the line at the front desk was quite daunting; basically almost backed up to the front door. Luckily, as we were going up to the penthouse suites which have their own check-in procedure, we avoided the line, but I felt sorry for those who could not. And, as everyone says, the elevator situation is totally inadequate to handle the volume of guests. We enjoyed our stay and would return to the penthouse suites. They are comfortable and the Club's location is excellent. I'm not so sure, however, if I would return to stay in one of the other lodging options.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “There were some great things, and some not so great!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I can understand why people give the Manhattan Club varying reviews. It really depends on what you focus on. The good: The location was fabulous. The lobby was clean and bright. We had a 1 bedroom suite which had 2 full bathrooms and was enormous by Manhattan standards and updated/decorated quite nicely. The kitchenette had a coffeemaker that they provided daily coffee for, a dishwasher, fridge, microwave, and plates/utensils. We could not have asked for more and there was a nice grocery store within a half block. We were able to have nice breakfasts in our room and save time and money. The Bad: the elevators (as mentioned by other people) were ridiculous- you can't run a hotel with elevators that take 15 minutes! One of the showers in our full bath didn't work. This didn't bother us, because we just used the other shower but if you were sharing a room between 2 families or couples that each wanted their privacy, it would have been a big deal. The noise was pretty bad from the service elevators in our room, but we used noise machines and ear plugs so we were able to get by. Other members of our family had the smaller rooms, and they were MUCH smaller. Upgrade to the 1BR if you can. The pull out couch was NOT comfortable at all. It didn't bother our small kids, but there is no way an adult could have slept on that thing. Again, we didn't complain because it was fine for our kids as they don't weigh enough to feel how thin the mattress was!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have been a Timeshare owners at the Manhattan Club for over seven years now and we very much regrate ever doing business with this SCAM that called the Manhattan Club. When we joined they were very nice to us. The fee for the week we owned was about $600 and they told us that we own a suit for a certain week of the year we can change it to any week we desired. We have also been told that the week of this Unit we own is Flexible and as owners we are entitled to change our week to any 7 consecutive or non-consecutive nights at our option, and including 3 weekend stays par year. By now The weekly rate jamped to over $2,000 (more than tripled) which we have to pay at the begining of the year but we COULD NEVER GET A WEEK OR EVEN SOME DAYS. FORGET ABOUT WEEKENDS. They keep saying it is all booked for any week or even days we requests BUT WHEN WE CALLED THIER OFFICE IN PHILADELPHIA WE COULD GET THE SAME WEEK THEY HAVE TOLD US WAS TOTTALY BOOKED IF WE WOULD PAY THE RIGHT PRICE. We have purchased our unit because the location was good and still is but, when we did manage to get a room for a couple of days 3 years ago we found out that the service that used to be fair turned to be almost unbearable, the front dask agents are rude and impatience and the stay was no fun. We could get over the bad service because of the location but, we are tierd of bagging and being TURNED DOWN for a week that we paid a lot of money for and we CAN NEVER receive.

<li><b>Title:</b> “Much better than most reviews.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am compelled to write since there are many negative reviews of the Manhattan Club. I have stayed in at least 10 other hotels in NY and in my opinion this is one of the best. A family of four, we had a one bedroom suite with 1 3/4 baths. It had a nice size bedroom and the sitting area/kitchen was large enough to contain the open sleeper sofa and a twin air bed without any problems. The condition of the room was excellent, and we had no complaints about the cleanliness. Compared to most NY hotel rooms we have stayed, this is definitely one of the nicest and surely the largest. To address issues of other reviewers: We did not find the elevators particularly slow--only once did we feel the wait was greater than 3 to 4 minutes. The hotel invites patrons to use the service elevators and they can be quicker. The hotel has studios and one bedroom suites. The studios appear per other reviewers to be too small for 4 people. The one bedrooms are not and that may explain some of the poorer reviews. We did not find the staff to be unfriendly or rude. They did not try to be our friends, but they did their jobs adequately. The only negatives we encountered were the air conditioning system which was a bit weak, and difficulty accessing the wireless internet. The AC problem was solved in Nov. by opening the windows an inch. It took several phone calls to the front desk to get the long-on name to be able to access the free wireless internet; and the concierge had no idea how to get online. We would definitely return.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Excellent Location for NYC Vacation”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 4 nights in a very nice large, studio unit on the 19th floor of the Manhattan Club. There was daily maid service, daily coffee refills in the room, and daily popcorn which was a treat. In a studio, there is a $15 daily fee for maid and concierge service, (and in a one bedroom there is a $25 daily fee) which can't be eliminated except for a $45 credit if you take a timeshare presentation. However, you also get complimentary coffee and cookies from noon to four in the 26th floor lounge. The staff is super nice and helpful. The location is unbeatable, walking distance to Times Square, Fifth Ave, etc., and the subway is one block away. In fact we took the subway and the M60 bus from Astoria to Laguardia and it took about an hour from the Manhattan Club. We took CitysightsNY tours which the concierge booked for us ( You can save $5 if you book it yourself on line.). It was a two day hop on, hop off tour bus that took us all around downtown Manhattan, uptown, Brooklyn, night touring, cruising on the harbor to the Statue of Liberty and other sites, and even gave us a museum to see on the uptown tour. The guides seemed knowledgable and friendly. We would not hesitate to return to the Manhattan Club. I had one minor complaint about a drape that didn't close properly, and it was repaired immediately. The unit has a half refrig., a microwave, and even a dishwasher. It was an excellent vacation. NYC was clean, and the walking areas were a real treat. Central Park is two blocks away, and again, a treat to stroll in.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 4 nights in the Manhattan Club through an exchange with RCI. I had booked a 1 bedroom and a studio unit. Both units were very nice, with the exception of the curtains in the studio unit. We brought to the attention of the front desk staff that the studio unit did not have a black out curtain. As the hotel is located on busy streets, a black out curtain is necessary if you are going to get any rest, unless noise and lights don't bother you. The desk staff did not respond to our request and so the couple that spent the 4 nights in the studio unit had to suffer through the noise and lights. They did go out and purchase ear plugs for the second night, but the fact that the staff made no attempt to respond to our request is not acceptable for a hotel of this calaber. The location is great...10 minute walk to Time Square and you could see Central Park from our 1 bedroom suite. The lounge upstairs is nice, but the bartender only knows how to pour 6 ounce drinks. The price reflects this at $16 a glass, but if all you want is a quick drink before supper it doesn't rally work well. Others have commented on the sales people, we did not find them a problem. We told them we were not interested and they left us alone for the duration of our trip. The concierge and front lobby staff are great at assisting with taxi service. There is a great Thai restaurant just down the block - the Topaz - you have to go there if you like Thai food - best curry dish we had ever had. Enjoyed our trip and would recommend the Manhattan Club.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very Disappointing Stay @ TMC”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at TMC from 12/3-12/5/10. My parents had never been to NYC city, so we wanted to offer the trip to be a positive experience for them. When we checked into TMC- the room was not ready until 4:05PM and once we arrived at room they place all 4 of us in a metro suite which had a pull out sofa and king size bed that were 1 foot apart and very little room to move throughout the room together. We were promised a divided area between sleeping arrangements for privacy. When I asked to be moved- they avised me that they were completely full and could not accomadate. Once we resided to bed- we pulled out sleeper sofa to find that it was broken and would not support mattress. I insisted to the from desk asst manager that we needed to be moved or bed repaired (at 1AM) and they decided to call repair person to look at sofa bed. Finally at 1:45AM another assistance manager called us to desk and placed us in another suite. Coffee pot in room was broken and repair person came to room after 2 hrs to bring alternate pot and when he hooked up coffee maker- he left the heater on. If we had not been there to see that- the room may have caught fire and our group blamed for damages. Rooms are dirty and hotel arrangements are sub-par. Soda and smack machine on 26th floor remained 90% empty all weekend. I am so glad that we did not purchase timeshare with the Manhatten club- they are far from a 5 star resort in my opionion. If they did offer refunds (which they don't, mainly because they would go out of buiness if they did)... I would certainly ask for my money back. Lesson learned........ DO NOT BOOK WITH THE MANHATTEN CLUB.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">So far in my traveling journeys, I have had very little bad experiences, and many, many great ones, "The Manhattan Club" being one of them. I was a little weary I must admit after reading quite a few reviews, but after my week stay there, I was quite impressed. So impressed, that I would definately love to come back to this hotel. After being greeted by the delightful hotel staff, we were blown away by our 1 bedroom suite with 2 spacious bathrooms, 2 plasma tv's, a nice size modern room (compared to New York standards), and a very comfortable king size bed. The greatest thing about this hotel is the location. You virtually are in the heart of everything, and if you want to go out further, just roll out of bed right into the subway. Thats how close you are. There is a ton of dining options around you. If you need help finding out a type of food, just check with the concierge, Furthermore, if you want to save a little on food, there is quite a few grocery stores in the area which would be perfect for your mini fridge in your room. Just a heads up, coffee in your rrom costs $2 per pack.. Just go to the grocery store, and buy your coffee, filters, etc. There is a coffee machine there for you use. Maid service is there daily for the mandatory $25 fee you pay per day, and it is worth it coming back to our freshly clean room. There is a business room on the 26th floor with over 6 computer terminals one of them being a a mac. There is also a nice size weight room with pretty modern machinery. I would definately come back here, and not only had an amazing time in New York, but was very impressed with everything as a whole.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My son and I stayed at the MANHATTEN CLUB in early July and we had a very nice time, Rooms were a little on the small side if for four people (JR SUITE) But for us it was fine. They say FIRST IMPRESSIONS LAST and having worked in the industry myself and at the front desk, It was a disappointment to find that most of the REVIEWS I READ about this place before we arrived were true regarding the RECEPTIONIST STAFF. There were no smiles and even a little small talk can go along way to someone when they first arrive in a new place, I just couldn't believe how unfriendly they all seemed to be. Thankfully the rest of the staff made up for it. The BELLBOYS are very nice, I'm sorry now i didn't write down there names, but they're great. Tthe CHAMBERMAID was the CLUBS BIGGEST ASSET very nice and very friendly. I was always brought up to believe that a smile doesn't cost you a thing but a frown can cost you the earth. I'm afraid the reception staff in the place are costing it the world and if i were the boss here it would be the one thing i would SORT OUT, BIG TIME!!!! All that aside it is a great location, close to all the usual things to ee and do and we will go back. NEW YORK is a geat city and i'm glad to say I found it to be a very safe place to be.. Don't be afraid to do your own thing and if in any difficulty just ask one of the street vendors, They are very good and seem to know the city better than most. If in a hurry or only there for a couple of days get the day pass on the subway ($7.00 AND KIDS GO FREE) and get on and off all over the city as you please. Hope all who read this and go, have as nice a time AS MY SON AND I HAD.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great location, decent room, nice front desk staff”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As everyone has mentioned, this hotel has a fabulous location. One block from Broadway, the subway, two blocks from great food on 8th avenue, and 2 blocks from a great little grocery/deli on 6th. If you are like us, and you go all day long and will enjoy a meal back in your condo/room, try the Ernst Klein Fine foods. Among other things they had the best chowder I tasted while in NYC. The rooms are nice sized by NYC standards with two very nice baths in each 1 BR condo. The bedroom is about the size of a normal NYC hotel room, and then you have a living room with a small, yet functional, 4 seat dinette. The partial kitchen has a fridge and a microwave. If you will need one, bring your own bottle opener. I find that the unit needs some major updating, but when you are in NYC you leave in the morning and go home in the evening. My family probably spends more time in the unit than most, and we enjoyed it. Several of the people have posted about rude front desk employees. I found the front desk to be great. The concierge was rude, as was the bellman named Jason who actually questioned the amount of the tip I gave him. I should have taken it back, but I didn't. I did speak with the office in Pennsylvania prior to going to NYC. I will say that the people on the phone from the main office were among the rudest people I have ever dealt with at any hotel. They were not onsite, so once you get there you do't have to ask them anything. Elevators -- not bad at all -- not even once during the week did we have an unacceptable wait time. On a scale of 1-10 I would have given the Manhattan Club a 9 based primarily on location.. For TA it is a solid 4 out of 5.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">this is my 3 time staying at manhattan club the first one before the renovations which was unbelivabley dissapointing as i could not watch tv comforably in the room due the angle of the bed and the t.v. i stayed for a few days in january and the suites are designed nice and the engineer showed me how to operate the dvd player with the hi def tv. you had to ask for a dvd player why they are not standard in the room i dont know. i came back for a few more days as i had expiring points and the tv in one room did not work. my room was changed as i asked to have the dvd/vcr combo brought to my new room and i was told that it was not compatible with the t.v. but it was hooked up to the previous room tv which was defective . then i asked for a plain dvd player and i was told that no dvd players are compatible with the t.v. i told the engineer that i was here 2 weeks ago in the same room with a dvd player which worked and he told me no .the staff acts like you are disturbing them when you ask for something. the location of the building is the only positive thing here. the are so many hotels in n.y. where staff actually smiles when you come in and greets you. the light switches in my room were missing in most of the rooms so i had to leave the bathroom lights on otherwise there was no light in the room. ther is no bathroom bar for the tub and the whole bathroom is marble so it is dangeous for elderly people. this place is toutee as one of the most difficult timeshare exchanges there is so i expected much more from this place since it had been renovated.you also have to pay a per night housekeeping fee .personally i will stay at an affinia hotel next time.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here during june and july and can say was dubious following reading various reviews , however we loved it. The hotel staff yes were short with us however helpful to us , probably due to the nature of their job. I was waiting to book in and a "american lady "was complaining that her safe wasnt working and wanted IMMEDIATE action....... get a grip its a safe surely will wait 15 mins. The room was spacious and clean, yes following a comment the windows were slightly dirty however its Manhattan and 20 floors high cant be cleaned every day !!!!!!! The place was central for everything and we hardly were in the room so not as important as if it was in the middle of nowhere. The only people i saw complain were the americans maybe they have different standards to the british but i certainly wouldnt complain about ths place and the service. The lifts yes could be delayed however they were no way as bad as people state also no air con in the business centre however does it matter unless you want to spend all your holiday on the internet. The place was lovely and seem to be a victim of their own success and no doubt will get moans but doesnt everywhere. W have been all over the world as you can nick pick about everywhere This is in the middle of mahattan what more could you ask for 2 streets from central park, broadway , 5 th Avenue and Time square and new yorkers are friendly no matter what people say you smile and talk to them they will be friendly back I would recommend going there and to the manhattan club we waited 9 months and it was well worth the wait. one thing i would say DONT BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ , TAKE A RISK AND USUALLY PAYS OFF .</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently stayed at the Manhattan Club. It was a timeshare exchange through RCI. Check in was quick at the Manhattan Club. We were assigned to an interior view 1 bedroom on the 24th floor. The room was clean and the facilities were in good shape, minus the elevators as others had mentioned. It was slow. It seemed to me the issue was that two out of the four lifts were reserved for the penthouse units/floors. Several times, we used the two freight elevators behind the lobby. The suite was kept nice and cool and noise wasnâ€™t an issue. The 1 bedroom consists of a bedroom separated from the living area via a door. In addition to the one bath in the bedroom, there was a Â¾ bath in the living room area. This was nice as there were 3 of us. There was a microwave, however no cooking stove top. There was a mini fridge in the room. Itâ€™s NYC anywaysâ€¦ Who cooks? Daily cleaning was provided and the housekeeping staff did an excellent job everyday. All the staff appeared cheerful and we experienced no problems. The were no spas or pools, however there was a good gym on the top floor. There were 3 flat panel TVâ€™s along with all the necessary machines, including free weights to work off all the great meals to be had nearby. I slept on the sofa bed one night and that was enough for me. Did not feel comfortable, but was okay with my little one. Overall, liked it a lot. It was in a great location with the subway a block away. You couldnâ€™t ask for a better location. Tip: at 55th Street and 9th Avenue, there is a laundromat where you can do some laundry if you have to. Also next door on 9th Avenue, there is a bike shop, Liberty Bicycles that rents bicycles for $6 an hour. Looking forward to coming back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After witnessing how poor service was previously at this property, I was pleasantly surprised at how nice and efficient the staff has become since our first visit. A special â€œshout outâ€� to Christina at the front desk, even after a long night shift, she was professional, pleasant and helpful with our early check-in! Much different than what we experienced in the past. The housekeeping staff was on top of things all week. Our two JR. Executive suites were in good condition. The head of housekeeping was really concerned about a spot on the carpet. He made sure it was taken care of before we checked in one of our rooms. This unit is the 1 bath unit. There is plenty of room a for a couple. The mini fridge, microwave, dishes and dishwasher are all you need in Manhattan. We were on the 21st floor, so street noise was not an issue for us. FREE Wi-Fi! The gym is really nice and well equippedâ€¦ along with the penthouse bar / lounge. The many complaints about the â€œslowâ€� elevators can be avoided by using the elevators to the left of the front desk when possible. A non-issue for us. The location is as good as it gets in Manhattan. Close to Central Park, Times Square and more importantlyâ€¦ multiple SUBWAY stations! As far as the t/s presentationsâ€¦ though one of the managers and I disagreed on a few thingsâ€¦ the salesman was a pro. Since we are in sales, high pressure is not a problem for us, but he was not that way at all. If we could justify the maintenance feesâ€¦ weâ€™d be owners. For now, weâ€™ll have to settle on trading or renting there. That said, the property is in good condition and exceeded our expectations. We would stay here every time we visit NYC if possible. Last, itâ€™s good to see MC managementâ€™s on TA. It shows they care what travelers have to say. Ratings: Location 10â€¦ Service 9â€¦ Unit 8. We will be back!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “When is a suite not a suite?”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked one of the Manhattan Club's Metropolitan Suites (through Expedia.com) for 1st week in March for my birthday. I was very , very disappointed! On my initial booking request form I asked for an outward looking suite and as high up as was available - preferably above the 9th floor. When we arrived we discovered that our suite was on the second floor. I questioned this and pointed out that I had specifically stated that I wanted a high floor but was informed, by very dismissive staff, that ALL the Metropolitan Suites are situated on the second floor! I was really flaming mad as no one had had the courtesy or the decency to let me know when I was booking, that this was the case. Then we went up to our 'suite' only to discover that it was not a 'suite' but one room with a pull down setee! Not enough room to swing the proverbial cat in and when the sofa was pulled down you could not even squeeze past it to get to the bathroom - you had to jump over it! We had booked the 'suite' as it was supposed to have a separate bedroom (according to the descprition and photograph on the web page of their ad.) and accommodate 4 people, there were three of us, myself, my brother and my female friend, she then had to stay with my sister and other friends, as there was absolutely no way we all could have stayed there comfortably for one week. After travelling 3,000 miles from Scotland to say that I was bitterly disappointed is an understatement. I did complain to the sultry, disinterested staff who informed me that it had nothing to do with the Manhattan Club, I would have to complain to Expedia and that it could take two days to get a hold of them. I'm afraid I feel I was well and truly very expensively conned and would not recommend the web site or the Manhattan Club to anyone I know intending to spend time in NY. First impressions are usually lasting ones!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we decided to make this trip on impulse simply because we had extra points and believe it ,we found a 1 bedroom suite on line with 10 days notice this was a points exchange,we did not have to call anyone,very costly for 2 nights/ friday to sunday to say the least,but we had to take the opportunity,since it is said its virtualy impossible to get a reservation especially an exchange. checkin was a breeze maybe 3mins this was at 7.30pm we did valet parking did not use the car again until departure of which we called 10mins ahead at found it waiting for us,very nice. indeed checkout was a breeze too .one thing though it gets busy at the lobby ,but they have alternative checkout dropoff points,where you dont have to go to front desk unless you have to.renovations are going on in the front of the clubso there is scaffolding right now,if its anything like the future pics show its going to be beautiful 1 bedroom suite is fair in size not your typical new resort size but fair size with 2 full bathrooms small kitchenette type place with fridge and microwave.there is a surprisingly small tv maybe15 inch in the living rm and bedroom,with cable service.flat screen lcd/plasma would be nice and definately create more space taken by the huge tv cabinets they say they are in the process of upgrading these really old tvs wireless internet was not available in rooms for free ,but if needed you can use internet at the business ctr on the 26th floor,together with gym ,bars ,etc location is unbeatable ,it is worth it for the location alone the suites are not out of this world but comfortable. we did not interact much with staff but the little we did was pleasant no problems like some reviews here ah !!! the elevators ,they are small ,we were in and out of the club alot but the elevators were fast.2 serving main lobby abd i think extra on the side ,service elevators i believe. for all intent and purposes we enjoyed our stay ,but the bills add up,parking ,room service,wireless internet</p></li>
