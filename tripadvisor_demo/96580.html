The condo that we rent has more than enough room, and the screened in porch is worth the money. The pools and water slide are excellent. Plus they are close to everything, but far enough away that you aren't in the middle of Branson traffic.</p></li>

The prices in the convenience store were over the top. There are no paper towels in the unit or hot pads. You do have to take care of your self for the price you pay.</p></li>

The lake right out the door. It doesn't get any better! It is one of the more expensive places to stay, but we have been able to take advantage of special offers and have scored a great price! Great for families. Highly recommend!</p></li>

Loved walking down to the lake everynight for sunset and feeding the geese every morning. We did stay in a studio with kitchen once and it was just too small for my family but was still very clean and nice. But the bigger condo felt more like home.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got a one bedroom one bath condo. clean and a lot of room for you money. There is free stuff to do around the resort, kayak, paddle boat fishing and three swimming pools. The extra full size bed you pull down from the wall mattress was hard, but ok for sleeping when you are exhausted. Close to Sliver Dollar City and Branson West, or Branson. The traffic was not a problem since they have rerouted the road and seperated the Indian Point traffic and the Sliver Dollar City traffic.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved this resort. Unfortunately when we were here it was cold and rainy, but in good weather this would be the place to be! There is everything for the entire family. Our room was very nice and clean. We rented a hotel-type room. We had a refrigerator, mw, two queen beds, closet, very nice bathroom and it was nice and roomy. The only thing we didn't have was a dvd player and KLEENEX! Next time we go to Branson, we will stay here again. The location of this resort is absolutely awesome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked a 1 bedroom luxury condo. Very well kept and spacious. This is the best place to stay if your going to Branson or Tablerock lake. There are many things to do on the property (pools, bbq, kayaks, tubes) and the marina is a great place to rent a boat or jet ski. Location is wonderful as it sits on the lake and Branson is only a 10 minute drive. Marketplace comes in handy too if u need a quick lunch or breakfast. I have stayed at many hotels in this area over the years and this is by far the best place to stay.</p></li>

We rented a Pontoon Boat for the day & the lake is gorgeous. It's close to Branson if you want to go there to eat, go to a show or whatever. There are grills all around the resort. There are tubes & Kayak & bike for free use. One pool has a waterfall & the scenery is beautiful. I recommend this place to anyone who wants to get away to a beautiful resort with everything & a beautiful lake.</p></li>

I was very impressed with the accomodations of Still Waters resort. We stayed in a one bedroom condo near the marina (June 11-15). The resort was nice and we are planning another stay soon. We have absolutely NO complaints! While there, we rode the Ducks, took the Branson Scenic Railway, toured the Titantic, toured Stone Hill winery, Zipped on Vigilante ZipRider, hung out in Historic Downtown Branson, etc.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Looked at many reviews for a short stay with the daughter/son-in-law and 3 grandkids. Contacted the property direct and they gave us a better rate that AARP or AAA. Checkin was a breeze. We were assigned room 316 in building D. A lovely 2 bedroom across the street from the newest pool. All amenities are close by except the marina. A bit of a walk to get there. The staff was very friendly and at checkout we were refunded money due to a price drop after we reserved the room. How nice. Would stay here again. Wish we lived closer.</p></li>

Our 10 year old son loved it. The kayaks, paddle boats, the playground, and of course the pools. We never seemed to have had time to ride a bike, but will next time. We brought our bass boat, so we spent a lot of time on the lake, and caught some great fish. We ate almost all our meals from Parmesans, the pizza and salads and subs were very fresh. Looking forward to coming back.</p></li>

The staff was so great and friendly, especially Amanda and Cassandra who took care of our extra days with perfect ease. Our kids loved the pools and took advantage of the bicycles and paddle boats. Love how it is by SDC and quiet surroundings of Table Rock Lake. I dont know about the reviews about noise because we didnt experience that all probably because we stayed Sun-Fri, maybe nosier on the weekends. Will DEFINITELY stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in one of the condos with our family for Thanksgiving weekend. The condo's are great, lots of room, clean and comfortable. We used the kitchen a lot and found all the things we needed...dishes, pots and pans, utensils, etc. 3 TV's so everyone could watch their favorites. Excellent location if you plan to see the lights at Silver Dollar City which is only a mile away. The big 20 person hot tub was open however, we didn't use it but could have. View of Tablerock Lake is great. Was a good value for this time of the year. Will go back many more times.</p></li>

Weather was a bit chilly and only one pool was open during our visit, but we knew that ahead of time. Sister's family also came with us and we were able to get a 1 bdrm suite for her family adjoining a 2 bdrm suite with ours. Stayed in one of the newer buildings (building J I believe) and had a lake level suite. Loved it--great patio for eating out on and sitting outside. Very pretty to look out over the lake. Enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay again if we get back to the area.</p></li>

The Zoom the Flume (water slide) was actually where the lifeguard was needed, but there was not one there. The condo was nothing special, but was comfortable, roomy and clean. The condo only provided 1 trash bag, 1 roll of toilet paper and 1 roll of paper towels per stay, so take extra depending on your length of stay. Take your own shampoo, soap, etc.. as well. The kitchen was very poorly equipped-not even potholders were in the kitchen. Free kayaks, free paddleboats. We had a ton of fun renting a boat one day.</p></li>

There was a fully equipped kitchen and a lovely fireplace in the livingroom. The balcony overlooked the lake. Everything was clean and well maintained. We spent afternoons at the pool with the waterfall and hot tub, and again everything was lovely, clean and well maintained. We used the paddleboats to get out onto the lake and there were kayaks there too for guests to use (no charge, no hassel). It was busy, but yet quiet for how many people were staying there. We would definately go back there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved it! We stayed on the top floor in Building K which was very nice and quiet! They did furnish toilet paper, trash sacks, dish detergent, coffee filters for our 5 day stay. I brought those things but didn't need them. However I did need laundry detergent. The only negative thing I can think of was the waterfall pool closed at 9:00 p.m. and we'd have liked it to stay open until 10 p.m. However the other 2 pools were open that late. We rented a powerboat however it didn't have enough power for adults to waterski behind...but we tubed instead. Everything else was wonderful...beyond our expectations! We'll definately be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The accommodations were clean and well kept. The amenities were a bit lacking, even for a vacation rental. No tissues, paper towels or sponge in kitchen. The kids enjoyed the pool and marina with kayaks, paddle boats, tubes and we even rented a power boat. We ate there and both the pizza and sub is good. It's a solid stay, nothing specatular, but enjoyable. One one compliant is that the check in is 4PM (late on the spectrum of check-in times to begin with) but the place was not ready until close to 4:30PM. I got a great deal for the 2 bedroom for $155/night, but I wouldn't have paid the $300/night the week prior. Walls seemed a bit thin.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Visited with family in mid March. Did not know that the swimming pools would be closed, but this made no difference to us. We had a lakefront condo with a beautiful view of the marina. We used the paddle boats and kayaks and had a lot of fun. Marina staff are very friendly. Ate pizza at the onsite pizzeria and it was good. Loved the fireplace in the room.Loved the balcony and the kitchen, whirlpool tub. These were a lot of amenities for our money. Also we were close to Silver Dollar City which we visited and was fantastic. I feel bad that this resort is ranked around 20th on tripadvisor. It should be much higher. Oh yes, also free wireless internet!!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family recently stayed at Still Waters Resort and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We live in nearby Springfield, MO, and went to Still Waters for a weekend getaway. The facilities are absolutely perfect for families, as there are plenty of kid-friendly things to do. We visited all three pools, spent time on the lake at their fabulous marina, played sand volleyball, basketball and horseshoes, and generally had a great time. The facilities were extremely clean and well-run. The staff was friendly and courteous. Still Waters is a first-class resort, and is somewhat of a best kept secret. I highly recommend it for families or for couples wanting a getaway.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I were very pleased with our stay at Stillwaters. We didn't realize how close we were to Silver Dollar City which was the reason we came to Branson. The location of the resort was perfect! I only wish the weather was a little warmer so we could have swam in their new pool which looked amazing! I definitely want to come back and take advantage of the complimentary kayaks too. The room was very nice and the decor was clean and still looked brand new. The beds were very comfortable compared to other hotels that we have stayed at. The microwave and fridge is a nice ammenity in the room. We will definitely pick Stillwaters again when we come back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family has been going to Stillwaters for 25 years. We started going when our kids were little, and now our grandkids are little and everyone still likes to go. We use it as our annual family vacation even after that many years. Tablerock Lake, with its beautiful clear water, is so much fun and Stillwaters is right on the lake. Stillwaters is family owned, and the famlily takes great pride in making their resort a great place to have family fun by always making upgrades to the property. The pools, docks, condos, and play areas are always clean and beautifully maintained. We always look forward to July so we can visit Stillwaters to make more family memories.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Family has been going to Stillwaters for more than 8 years. Every year the property gets better. They have nice pools, boat docks and areas for family entertainment such as volleyball, basketball and horseshoes. This year they had a great new pool area with zero entry, waterfall, huge hot tubs and huge cushy tanning chairs. My kids refuse to go anywhere else on a summer vacation. Two of my brothers also go every year and now the second generation families are coming as well. I would recommend this resort to anyone who loves the water. Although my family tends to stay away from Branson's nightlife there is tons to do if you want to spend some time with all the shows.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my first time at Still Waters. It's a ok place. I don't think it was worth what I had to pay,but I guess they get you during peak travel time. The pools were nice , but too small . It would be nice for a all adult pool. The room was clean, but like others have stated it is VERY NOISY! We could hear everything the room next to us was saying along with their crying kid. We also were trying to take a nap in the afternoon and was woke up to the maintenance man banging on our door to change the filter on the air conditioner. I think that could have waited. On the positive it is in a great location as far as away from the busy downtown stuff. The staff was very friendly.</p></li>

We had made a mistake in our booking dates and were pleasantly surprised when Tabitha came to the rescue. She was so friendly and willing to go the extra mile in correcting our error. Her 20+ years of military service to our country was very impressive as was her ability to make us feel taken care of. Tabitha is our hero! We were also impressed with Nancy, the concierge. She helped us organize our activities and provided us with tickets for shows and SilverDollar City. With people like her and Nancy at the helm we wouldn't hesitate to come back!</p></li>

Also, another couple experienced a vehicle problem which meant they too had to remain in the area. The staff at Stillwaters was just great in every aspect along with finding us continued lodging at the resort even though they were really booked over the weekend. Obviously, we've enjoyed this resort & Table Rock Lake in the past as we've returned every 2 years, but now I have a true appreciation for the staff and the concern they have for their vacationers.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got back from a week at Still Waters Resort for our summer vacation! Our room was a studio with a pull out sleeper sofa. The room was very clean and comfortable. There was new carpeting too. Our room was right next to the Oasis Pool, which was OUTSTANDING! I love the fact that this resort had free paddle boats, kayaks, and tubes to use for the lake. Table Rock lake was very clean!! To get to Downtown it was a 10 minute ride and Silver Dollar City was a 5 minute ride, which was nice! I would highly recommend this resort to anyone that wants to get away!! **Take dramamine if you are not use to the steep hills and Ozarks. We are from IL and it was quite a change from the flat lands!**</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family has been staying at Still Waters for years. We stayed over Labor Day weekend (me, hubby, daughter 8 and her friend 9). The kids had a great time, there is so much to do to keep them busy. They loved Zume the Flume waterslide. The resort was 100% occupied but it never felt crowded, the parking lots were crowded at night but the marina,pools and playground never felt over crowded. We also enjoy staying there since we are SCD passholders, the location is just a few minutes away and makes for easy access. If you are looking for a relaxing get away on the lake with your family I would definitely recommend Still Waters. The condos have all the amenities you need with lots to do at the resort.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having just spent another enjoyable vacation at Still Waters Resort, we're already made reservations for our return trip!. Love the location to Table Rock Lake, the three swimming pools (our kids love the water-slide), Bayside Market for cinnamon rolls & pizza, and the friendly attentive staff. We've been vacationing in the Branson area for years and have not found a spot better than Still Waters. Our group ranges from 10-85 years old. This year we especially enjoyed the free music concert poolside! We appreciate the family-friendly and safe resort environment. Pricing is competitive with similar nicer amenity resorts, but it's definitely worth the money. Thanks Still Waters for another great year!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place had so many things that families can enjoy. 3 pools, 1 with a water slide and 1 that is very tropical with a waterfall. Close to Branson shows and Silver Dollar City if that is your thing. I just liked enjoying the resort. They have boats that you can rent. You can also swim and kayak in the quiet cove that the resort is situated in. They have rooms of all sizes to meet your needs. You can stay in just a hotel room or have a whole condo. The little grocery store and restaurant was great, they had fantastic pizza. Found a nice place to eat breakfast on the water down the road and also a little bar and restaurant that had great seafood. Would love to take all the grandkids there next year.</p></li>

The new pool was wonderful with the zero entry. The kids loved the pool. There is a life gaurd on duty. We stayed in luxury lake front 2 bedroom/2 bath condo in building L. The view was great from the patio. It was very roomy for the family. The furniture was very comfortable. The kitchen was big and the washer and dryer was very handy. The staff was friendly. You could hear the noise from above but staying at a resort, this should be expected.This is a very family friendly resort with a lot to do. TableRock Lake is very clean, clear, and warm.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Still Waters for the first time with my family and my sister's family from May 14-17. In total, there were 4 adults and 4 kids. I was skeptical before arriving because it seemed that this place was too good to be true. I was not disappointed. Everything was perfect and the price could not be beat. It cost each family approximately $70 per night for the 3 bedroom lakefront condo...an amazing value! The condo had tons of room, a great view, and the resort is great. Unfortunately, it was too cool to swim but the main pool looks awesome. I would definitely recommend staying here. My only advice would be to bring some paper plates and paper towels. The room had dishes and a dishwasher but paper would be easier. Highly recommend!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I took a long weekend trip to Branson and stayed at Still Waters. I cannot say enough great things about this place. It was less expensive than many other resorts we looked at, and the amenities were amazing. We enjoy Silver Dollar City and this place is maybe 5 minutes from it. It was quiet and right on the water. The condo was spacious and had a full kitchen. The jacuzzi tub was a nice treat as well. The resort had bikes and paddle boats available at no extra cost, and had the weather been nicer we would have used them. I have stayed several different places in and around Branson and I would say that Still Waters is by far the most bang for your buck. We have even planned a longer trip in May and plan to stay at Still Waters again.</p></li>

It has spotless rooms and we have stayed at many 5 star resorts and some not as clean as this. The condos are large and have everything you need.After reading the reviews we did bring are own towels but the exchange was close and easy and we did not even use are own. The pools are very clean and lots of room in the new one. The docks are clean and the marina has everything you could need. The one and only downfall is that the noise from the upper floors transfer down if you are in a 1st floor condo but nothing that will make you not sleep. we can not wait to go back and have found are new place to stay while at table rock lake. We had a great time Thanks Stillwaters</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We bought a Groupon to the hotel not knowing more than what their website said. When we arrived, the hotel was better than it's website. The room was basically a 1 bedroom apartment with all the good stuff included. TV's in the living room and bedroom. Very clean, Plenty of towels, dishes and seating. Our balcony faced the lake and the view was great. We tried a sandwich at the store/deli and it was very good. The staff was friendly and the attractions all within an easy drive. Close enough to get to, but far enough away to have privacy and quiet. Great pool and Jacuzzi. Free paddle boats, kayaks and bicycles for the guest as well as other water recreation stuff at a reasonable charge. I wish we had stacked Groupons and stayed a few more days. We will be going back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Front desk service was quick and easy for check in and out. The concierge was great offering local tips and suggestions. We loved our room. it was spacious and cozy. We stayed in a Lakefront Luxury 1 bed room condo for 2 adults and 2 kids, a teen and a toddler. It was like a mini apartment. Full size kitchen and dining area was perfect. We enjoyed having a patio to sit out on and enjoy the view of the lake. Take full advantage of the marina and the free amenities. We went Kayaking for the first time and the lake is clean and beautiful! We enjoyed the use of the different pools. My favorite is with the waterfall. The Pizza inside the market at Parmesans’ is awesome! We would definitely stay here again. It's great for all ages, and is a perfect location to all the various attractions.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First of all, we stayed at Still Waters during the New Year holidays, so our experience was quite limited. Great location, close to Branson and on the lake. There were two couples in our party and that made it a bit unusual as I understand it is targeted mostly to single families. The Luxury suite has a gas fireplace and a whirlpool tub, both on short timers. Having a whirlpool tub as part of one of the bedrooms has made it a bit uncomfortable for the other party to use as it required them to walk through our bedroom. Otherwise, clean and comfortable. Usual checkout time is 10:00 AM, but we were allowed to leave at 11:00 as the resort was closing for several weeks. Due to the season, we could not visit the swimming pool facilities, but from what we could see, it could be fun being there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros..Nice location, good view if you have room facing the lake, good price for off peak season, good activities available, Condo type room with jetted tub, washer/dryer, kitchen and fireplace very nice. Place was nearly empty like many others at the end of Sept in Branson area. Quiet location, about 10 minutes to Branson or only 5 minutes to Silver Dollar City Theme Park. Pool areas looked inviting. Cons..Some buildings have no elevators, bed hard as concrete, self serve maid service,although this was not a problem for us it might be for some. (get your own linens and towels etc.. from central location.) Limited on site eating places. Breakfast, pizza and sandwiches only, and oddly located next to a sewage treatment plant. Wi-Fi service very poor, had to go out of building to get signal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose Still Waters for our 25th anniversary trip to Branson. We wanted to be on Indian Point, and wanted a condo. The 1BR lakefront condo was fairly new, clean, well laid out, with a nice size deck overlooking the lake. Staff were very friendly and helpful. They were mostly full by Saturday, when we left, with lots of families. If you enjoy pools or water sports, this is your place. We thought it was noisier than other condo properties we've stayed at in the past, but that's probably because there were more families and children. We've never stayed at a condo that had daily maid service - most don't, so not sure why people expect it. A good experience, and if you have a family or enjoy water sports, then you'd enjoy Still Waters. If you're looking for a peaceful, quiet stay, you might look elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great place to just kick back and relax! We've been vacationing in the Branson area for 18 years and have yet to find a better resort than Stillwaters. During the daylight hours we spend a considerable amount of time on Table Rock Lake; in the evening we enjoy gathering together as a family in the large spacious condo rooms for dinner and conversation while the kids frolic at the "slide" pool. Silver Dollar City is just a short 5 minute drive up the road and the other Branson attractions are just a few minutes further. Our kids LOVE the cinnamon rolls (and pizzas) from the convenient Bayside Market; and the staff at Stillwaters is always helpful and attentive. Overall I think we most appreciate the quite, family-friendly, clean, safe atmosphere that Stillwaters provides. We've already booked our space for next year!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got our room at a really good rate. It was extremely clean and larger than most regular hotel rooms even though we just had a regular room. We were right by the plain pool (not the huge pool or the pool with the water chute). It was very quiet and peaceful. The hot-tubs were nice and hot but the pools were REALLY chilly- we were there off-season and the weather had JUST turned cold. It didn't stop our two young children from having a great time in the pool anyway. We only went to the big pool once and enjoyed the amazing hot-tub there. It was nice to have the microwave and fridge for leftovers. We also loved that we were so close to Silver Dollar City, which was our main activity while we were there. We didn't use the boats (it was rainy) or try any of the onsite food- but we will definitely be using this resort again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family (5 adults) traveled to SWR at the end of December. Although I had read all the reviews, I was still surprised by how wonderful the resort was. We stayed in a 2bdrm 2bath in one of the newer buildings. It was very spacious - large kitchen, dining area, living area. A nice sized patio provided a beautiful view of the lake. The master bath was enormous with a full-sized jacuzzi (and another view of the lake from there). Most everything was impeccably clean, however, when even a small spot is overlooked it can be very deterring to the guests. That was one of my very small complaints. The resort was very helpful, assisting us with the wireless internet connection (which was nice), and making check-in and check-out a breeze. We thoroughly enjoyed our off-season vacation at the SWR and I can't wait to go back in the summer!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed as a large group for a family reunion, renting several condos for 5 nights. The best features were the lake out the back door, nice pools and hot tub, and fairly convenient location if you wanted to go into Branson. We also got to see the Haygood Show free just for staying here. However, overall cost seemed fairly steep and the condos weren't as clean as they should be for the price. One of our condos was only $50 cheaper per night and about half the size, so after asking to be moved into a better condo, the occupants were then forced to leave a day early because of other bookings which was really disappointing. We also didn't get a discount even though we rented 4 condos for several thousand total, but at least we could rent for any number of nights instead of being forced to rent an entire week like many places here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We rented a condo at Still Waters for a week and were very impressed by the whole place. This is a huge property surrounded by water with its own marina and docks, multiple outdoor pools, a game center, laundry areas, and even its own little grocery store. There are all kinds of configurations for rental from a regular hotel-like room to multiple bedroom condos and suites. All of the property was well maintained inside and outside of the buildings. There are hot tubs, free kayaks, free paddle boats, free innertubes, and free fishing for kids, and, of course, Wi-Fi. We saw lots of families here, and the kids were having a great time. This resort is located just a short ways from Silver Dollar City and is just past the edge of Branson, which we didn't mind. We loved the porch and the view, and would recommend this resort to anyone going to Branson.</p></li>

They have boats to rent , they are pricier but you can go down to the State Park Marina for cheaper or availability. But for convienence it is great. It is a Christian Family owned resort and everyone is very friendly.We needed a later checkout due to sickness and they did not hesitate to help us. That was appreciated so much. The only complaint is the noise. If you don't stay on the top you will hear a herd of elephants all times of the morning and night. But with all the fun we have there it is a very small problem. We know just about everyone there has kids and that is just part of it. We recommend it to anyone and will be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got back from Still Waters Resort last week. We were there for five nights with our children, ages 17, 11, and 10. It was one of the best family vacations we have ever had. We stayed in building E and it was absolutely gorgeous. I believe it was newly renovated in May. It was sooo relaxing and enjoyable for all members of our family. The free things were also very nice (bikes, kayaks, paddle boats, swimming pools, and basketball and volleyball) The washer and dryers in the condo was sooo convenient, as well as the stocked kitchen. Just be sure to bring your own beach towels. There is a Walmart that is about 5-10 minutes away so we just stocked up when we got there. We also rented a pontoon and a ski boat from the marina, they were very reasonably priced and nice units. Thanks Still Waters for allowing us to build great memories with our children!</p></li>

The beds were comfortable. The small problems with the room we encountered were taken care of promptly by staff. The room was quite, could not here anyone else. There was not an elevator and we were on the 3rd floor. Hard work unloading and loading. The biggest problem we encountered was the drinking of alcoholic beverages at the Oasis pool. In the afternoon they would sit in the shallow end of the pool with their beer. The more they drank the louder they became! Not a family friendly atmosphere! One man even poured his beer out into the pool. If you don't like being up close and personal with people drinking, I suggest swimming in the morning. The kids loved all the pools, but the open container in the pool was a huge problem.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Made for a great vaction. We enjoyed the pools, playground, rec room, free paddle boats, and the little store was awesome for last minute needs. The condo was spectacular! All except for not having enough pillows (we had 3 adults and 3 kids), so that may be why we didn't have enough. Everything else- from the eat-on balcony to the stack washer/dryer and the jacuzzi- were great. The kids really enjoyed the pool with the waterfall and it made for great family pics! We would definitely recommend to others and we hope to visit again soon. This place is awesome and the staff were very nice and reasonable and helpful. Also, basic kitchenware is provided but they do expect you to wash your dishes before you leave (which is totally understandable and easy to do since the condo also had a dishwasher!). We were not aware of a fitness center or room service so we cannot rate that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and friends go to TableRock Lake almost every summer for 25+ years and we've stayed at several of the resorts on the lake. We keep coming back to Stillwaters as it has the best amenities, good little convenience store on property for coffee, donuts, pizza, ice cream, etc., several boat docks if you bring your own watercraft, a fullservice marina with rentals for all the water toys, and several fun pools. Stillwaters is always busy when I've stayed there in the summer, but never feels crowded, and is quiet at night. The location is great to access Silver Dollar City, and you can be on the Branson strip for restaurants, shopping, shows quickly which is an ideal balance for those with us who don't want to be on or in the water. I've stayed for a quick fishing trip off season and everything has been fine too. The staff have always been helpful and attentive to any needs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went to Still Waters for a winter birthday celebration and to see the Polar Bear Plunge! Although we LOVE Still Waters in the summer, we had a great winter stay. Our three bedroom condo was very roomy and clean with a great lake view! The office staff is friendly and accommodating. There were great deals to be had at the outlet malls too. Our kids (14, 11 and 8) are already looking forward to our annual summer trip with lots of boating, Zooming the Flume water slide, fishing, paddle boats and kayaks. They have all grown up on the lake learning how to ski, tube and knee board. We can't wait for those mornings on the sun porch with a cup of coffee or evening with a glass of wine. You couldn't pay us to take our kids to Lake of the Ozarks and we have not found a better place on Table Rock Lake! Great location, great value and unforgettbale memories for our family even in the winter!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We visited this resort this past February on your Valentines Day Special and fell in love. The rooms are emmaculate and always very clean. We love how spacious the rooms are and the views are always beautiful. This place is very family friendly with the 3 different pool areas, there is a place for every age. We were suprised at all of the wonderful ammenities they provide such as free kayaks, bikes, paddle boats, inner tubes, etc. They are always right there to help you with any innconvience to make sure your stay is relaxing and pleasent. Parmesian's Pizzeria, small restuarant on site is always been wonderful. They have pizza and sandwiches that make your mouth water. We have been back six this year and have every intension of returning again soon. They have rooms that are always reasonably priced, which is something that always brings us back, not to mention the friendly customer service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I just came back from a 3 day last minute trip to Branson. We stayed at the Still Waters Resort which was wonderful. We had a one bedroom suite with jacuzzi and lakefront w/ balcony. The view of the lake was beautiful. Very quiet as it was out of season for most travelers. I'm a runner and felt very safe out running around the resort alone. None of the activities/pools, etc were open due to the season, but they all looked very nice. Glad place to take kids too. The drive from the main strip of Branson to the resort was about 5 minutes, but very scenic and convenient. We recommend checking out the Baldknobbers show, which was our favorite. HIGHLY recommend taking a drive to Ozark (between Springfield & Branson) to eat at Lambert's Cafe...Home of the Throwed Rolls. Homecooking at it's best!! All you can eat and very affordable ($26 for the two of us). Lots of shows, restaurants, and shopping!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family LOVES Still Waters resort. It has a variety of rooms and they are all very well decorated. We have stayed at this resort eight times over the last five years. We have stayed in a large, two bedroom condo with a screened deck, a one bedroom, and a small hotel room. We were happy in all types of rooms. The kitchens are well stocked with the utensils we needed and have always been clean. We have a boat and made use of the dock during every stay and we were happy with the dock. My boys (ages six and eight) especially love the beautiful pool with the waterfall. It is not heated, so it is chilly early in the year, but perfect during the summer season. The resort grounds are easy to navigate and everyone is friendly. I highly recommend Still Waters resort to individuals, couples, families and groups. We've seen a lot of big groups over the years and they are able to rent rooms next to each other and relax in the yards. Great place!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I went to Branson on our 10 year anniversary. This was our first time staying here. We were in building G just in a double queen room. The place was very nice and smelled clean. Beautiful view of the lake and would have been better if it was in the middle of summer so you could do the water activities they offer. That is all the good - Now for the not - so - good... In our room there was only vertical blinds no drapes to pull therefore at night there are porch lights everywhere up and down the walkways making it very light in the rooms. The beds were not at all comfy. At the time we were there the weather started cooling off and we needed extra blankets - in the closet there was 2 extra but they reaked of ciggarette smoke! But a call to the front desk and they sent us a new one. Last negative thing is they do not have maid service if you need more towels you have to take your dirty ones to the laundry and get more there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in a 2 bedroom condo with a fireplace in one of the newer buildings.(bldg J). We had a great view of the marina. We arrived on Sun. November 30th and stayed for three nights. Since it was after Thanksgiving, we pretty much had the place to ourselves. Although most of the amenities were closed for the season,(pools, marina, etc.) the 20 person freeforming hot tub directly across from our condo remained open. All four of us had a great time one afternoon while waiting to go see Christmas lights that evening. The condo itself was very spacious and clean. The linens were ample, and we did not have to exchange them during our brief stay. I originally found out about this place on Orbitz. They had a special so I contacted the property directly and spoke to Todd. He matched the price without hesitation. I always feel better working directly with the property. We only paid $120.00 total per night. I would come back to Stillwaters in a heartbeat!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'm not sure how to write this without sounding like an advertisement for Still Water. We were very impressed. One reviewer complained because there was a marshy area between the room and the lake. Well, yes there is, but it was clean and mowed with paved sidewalks around it. The facilities are in the Ozarks. You would except to find areas with springs. I thought the geese and ducks feeding in the “marsh” a delight. We used two of the three swimming pools. They were all great-clean and not too crowded. The kids did not have to anytime to use the waterslide. So many things are included with the room rental. We used the paddleboats, horseshoes and kayaks. If trip advisor would allow I would deduct ½ star because of the traffic getting to the resort. The road to the resort is used by people going to Silver Dollar City. If you arrive when SDC is opening expect a 30-45 minute delay. We had a great time and thought the resort was a real value. We plan on going back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is our second stay at Still Waters in Branson and it is a very nice place to stay. This resort is geared towards family stays and kids of all ages. The Oasis pool is very nice to just play and relax. The Zoom the Flum pool is small but the slide is really fun. I somehow even got talked into trying it this year. The rooms are really nice. We had three families this year six adults and six kids. We stayed in a three bedroom condo in building K and it was supper. Everyone had their own rooms and bathrooms and we even had a nice balcony for "adult" conversation. My only complaint was we were told we would have a murphy bed in the living room and we ended up with a fold out couch that was not even worth setting up, very bad. The kitchen is nice, well equipped and we were able to prepare and feed nice meals. Barbeque grills are available as well. The Marina and dock area was a huge hit with our group. Of course the lake is awesome. Don't second guess this resort. Book it now. We will return next summer.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed last week of July with 16 other family members in the adjoining condo in building J 443, 443b and 2 BR 244, Lots of room in the condo, The teenagers had there own space in the loft area and the adjoing condo were nice for a gathering spot for everyone with the 2 living areas and kitchen, wonderful views from our condo but can see how others views could be obstructed by trees Service was great, called about fridge in the one bedroom not getting cool and someone came early the next morning, brought a large cooler and 4 bags of ice to cool our beverages before putting them back in fridge. The kayaks are a lot of fun you can take them up the little cove area, Beach area is small and rocky, but it is table ROCK lake after all. The hot tub at the oasis poll is large and nice pool beds. Gas grills are located at the base of each building and they are short on grilling utensils, so you may want to pack your own. They provide tiolet paper, dishwashing soap and towel exchange but no paper towels, standard for condo rentals</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 4 nights in a standard hotel room at the Still Waters resort for our girls getaway and thought it was great! We were there during the "off-season" and were able to get a good rate on Expedia.com. The resort has much to offer, even more during the "peak" season. The room was spacious, clean, and updated (of course the resort is only a year or two old). Our room featured two queen sized beds, a nightstand, dresser, tv, closet, small table, refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, and bathroom. It was on ground level which made for added convenience. Even though it was the "off-season" we were still able to enjoy evenings in the outdoor hottub, bicycle rides around the resort (free), and paddleboating on the lake (free). We even received a free Christmas tree ornament upon check-in! The resort is located on the lake and has beautiful views. The location is very close to Silver Dollar City and a short drive (about 10 minutes) to everything else in Branson. It is a family-oriented resort, but great for anyone. We would stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family has been after me to join them at Still Waters for the last few years. I've always turned them down thinking that it would be best if I just stayed home to get caught up on some stuff. Well, I finally went this year. I told them I'd join them for a few days.....but after my 4-day stay I told them that I planned to return next year for the entire week. My favorite place was "The Oasis" pool/spa area. It's a place for everyone from toddlers to senior citizens. The sounds of the water gushing out from the "waterfall" drowns out any screaming from the kids that might otherwise be annoying in any typical pool. The rooms were clean and certainly adequate. I would never consider staying anywhere else unless I found a pool area that could beat "The Oasis". I've read some criticisms of the place. (Just a few). But these were from folks who were looking for absolute quiet. Still Water is a family place...and with that comes the occasional noise associated with kids and their parents having fun. I cannot wait until next year when I return to Still Water with my family.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was the first vacation that did not need any indepth planning. This resort is great and very affordable. The check in all the way to check out was wonderful. We stayed 5 days and didn't have to leave the resort.(We had packed or food before arriving) The rooms were spacious and clean. We had a kitchenette in our room. The decks were very pleasant. The marina has so much that you can do. Fish,kayak,boat rental, paddle boats, a nice clean beach and all it was for FREE except the boat rental that is very affordable. We visited all three pools, they all have their own perks. One for younger kids, one for the older kids and then a quite one for the adults. For the kids young and old there was also FREE bikes a game room to keep them busy and a market for that quick Ice cream. There was a little mishap that we overlooked simply because mistakes happen, especially when 2 different reservations under the same name can be confusing. Who would have thought two people with the same name would be staying at the same place for the same amount of time!! WE WILL FOR SURE GO BACK!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our 4th stay in the last 8 years or so. We like to go there for our anniversary (38 this time). As experienced and reported by others, the views are great, furnishings are great, facilities are great (though much is closed at this time of year), and off-season prices are fair compensation for lack of local amenities (pool is closed, etc). Only complaint this time, the room was at ground level, which makes my wife uncomfortable about the windows in the bathroom. They tried to swap rooms for us for an upper level, but the jacuzzi was shoebox sized, so we stayed in the original room. One recurring problem in their rooms is the lack of heat reaching the bathroom (& jacuzzi) from the furnace. I'd highly recommend bringing along a 1500 watt electric heater to boost the warm in that area, especially if you use the fireplace at all, which will probably keep the furnace from running at all. This trip, the air intake on the jacuzzi was stuck, they didn't fix it in 5 days there, but compensated nicely for "whirlpool not fixed" with a reasonable discount. Will be back, with heater next time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our 2nd trip to Branson/Silver Dollar City with our children, ages 4 & 8. Still Waters never fails to make us happy to come & sad to leave. We are already trying to plan a 2nd trip this summer! I just have to rave about the Oasis Pool & hot tub. It is beautiful, immaculately clean, and perfect for people of any age. Our kids love it & so do we! We also love the conveinece of all the appliances in the kitchen, even a dish washer!, and being able to do laundry in the condo. My kids also enjoyed feeding the geese every morning. They would come to the patio door & honk, they were our daily wake up call. (good thing we are not late sleepers) The one & only down side we had was that once again we had very loud people above us. However the staff was very responsive to our complaints & said they would speak to them. Its too bad the other visitors didn't care that they were disturbing others. However we do not blame the staff for this at all! You can't help it if people are rude! We have already reccomended Still Waters to several friends & hope to be coming with 2 other families in August!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for only 3 nights the week after Easter - a quick getaway with family. Rented by phone and got a great discount for the time of year and staying a few days. The 2 bedroom condo we had in bldg G was great - corner unit so sunny and bright. The weather was still cool, but we enjoyed looking out at the lake and feeding the ducks that walked the grounds. We didn't use the outdoor hotub or other amenities this trip - they do have bikes to use, paddle boats during the warm weather months, and outdoor pools. The property is on Indian Point - close to Silver Dollar City, but a drive from the Hwy 76 strip area. They usually have a small store with some food service, but it was closed with renovation going on when we were there. They do have Wifi in all the rooms at no charge. This is a great place to stay if you enjoy lake activities, Silver Dollar City, and want to get away from 'town' and the traffice. Now there is a Silver Dollar City bypass on Indian Point Road so you don't get stuck in the park traffic. We will be coming back to Still Waters again (have stayed here about 6 times)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got back from our first stay at Still Waters and had a great time. Still Waters is more like staying in a condo on the lake rather than a cabin. Cabins give you a more rustic lake feel, but these condos are nice and modern. We were in a 2 bedroom 2 bath lake front luxury unit. We were told it was recently remodeled and it was done very professionally. The pools are very nice and the newest one features a great hot tub. They could have made the new pool bigger because it gets pretty crowded, but it's not like there aren't other places to swim (giant lake for instance)! There is plenty for kids of all ages to do at this property including basketball, volleyball, swimming by the dock, fishing, jet skiing, etc. The marina is well equipped with just about anything you need for an outing on the lake whether you want to relax in a pontoon or go out in a ski boat (new Crownline 21ft bow riders). The market store/restaurant is a nice benefit to have close for a quick snack. The entire property is very clean. We've stayed at quite a few places around TableRock and will be going back to Still Waters.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We've stayed at Big Cedar Lodge prior to this trip and we decided we didn't want to pay the pricey summer rates, so we looked for an alternative and found Still Waters. We were pleasantly surprised with this resort. They have 3 pools, none of which was every too overly crowded during the time we were there at the end of June. The grounds were kept pristine and the room was very clean. We were in one of the older buildings, in a one-bedroom w/whirlpool tub. Everything at the resort is within walking distance, including the marina, which offers free paddle boats, kayaks, and cane poles. The boat rentals were a little pricey for our liking, but they offer discounts on different days, and sometimes have free boat rental offers when booking reservations. The resort is very close to Silver Dollar City, so if that's your ultimate destination, Still Waters is a very good choice. The only negative I have is that I wouldn't recommend the pizza pub (Parmesan's, I believe was what it's called). We weren't too impressed with their pizzas, but maybe we just had a bad one. Overall, we were very impressed and will definitely be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'm a cheapskate, so we had to try Still Waters when I found they were having a 50% off sale. This made their "luxury lakefront w/whirlpool & fireplace" a heck of a deal. Our one bedroom condo was on the third floor (no elevator) and was 900 square feet. That's almost twice the size of our old apartment! Everything looked brand new. Full kitchen, nice living area with two couches and a massive balcony with table and chairs. The bedroom was also large, had high ceilings and a king size bed (very comfy). As the room description says, there was also a whirlpool tub, as well as a shower stall in the bathroom. If pressed, I'd say my only complaint would be the shower stall. It was pretty cramped, the fabric shower curtain kept blowing in an sticking to my leg and the shower head was pretty awful. But big deal, it's only a shower. The location of Still Waters was perfect for us. We were only there to visit Silver Dollar City, which is just a couple minutes away. And, cheapskate's dream, someone gave us free tickets when we got there so we didn't even have to pay admission! We did not go anywhere near the strip, so our visit was very nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Stillwater Resort is a fairly large complex of condos and hotel rooms located on a lake about 15 minutes from Branson. The facilities include a number of pools and free boat and bicycle rentals we did not use. I had booked a standard hotel room and when checking in asked what the room faced. A testy check in clerk told me that hotel rooms have NO VIEW. OK I get it. No need to get nasty. The room had two beds and a small kitchenette with a fridge, microwave and coffee maker. The décor was dated with shag type carpet but the room was fairly spacious. The first night we had no problem with noise but the second night a couple moved in next door and you could hear them arguing, coughing and playing their television loudly. Not much soundproofing as others mentioned. The other problem was the vertical blinds that did nothing to block the light. What were they thinking? If returning to Branson I would not stay at the Stillwater. The drive is long and dark from town and unless you have kids who want to use all the amenities, or have a large group, it offers no advantages. I did get an excellent rate through Orbitz and was happy with the price paid</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here because we thought it would be a great place where our 6 month old and 11 year old could have something to do. The pictures of the pool are not what the pool really looks like, much smaller. My baby loved the 0 entry pool, but not a whole lot to do for the 11 year old. The pool with the slide is not very big at all, neither is the 3rd pool. And, we went in the beginning of June and the water was FREEZING! If you are booking this place just for the pools, don't. The room was really nice. We book the "hotel style" room and it was a lot nicer than I planned. However, we were given a joint room and the people next to us were very loud. The only down fall was no room service and we really needed that with a baby who is crawling. Having the floor vacuumed would have been nice, especially since we were there 4 days. We saw some of the larger rooms, and they looked great! The location was nice if you didn't want to go downtown, however if you do, plan wisely. We didn't and it felt like we spent more time driving. We are planning another trip there next year. Not really sure if we will stay here, but we might. I guess it depends if we go early in the summer or not!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our second stay at Still Waters. The first time we visited we stayed in the standard hotel room. It was very nice so, when we found a deal for a 2 bedroom lakefront condo we jumped on it. We were not dissapointed. The condo was very spacious and clean. There was a washer/drier,gas fireplace, dishwasher and T.V.'s in both bedrooms and the living room and a whirlpool tub in the master bathroom. Hairdryers were also provided in both bathrooms. There are tons of free resort amenities and boat slip rental is also available. The pizza and salad from the Bayside market was quite tasty and reasonably priced. However, I will echo some of what I have read in previous reviews about the Condos. Bring your own paper towels, plates, disposable silverware and cups if you do not want to run the "real" dishes through the dishwasher. You are responsible for cleaning all dishes you use and taking out the trash at the end of your stay. This is the same policy that I've had to comply with for any condo rental we've had. Obviously, that is not the case if you stay in one of the standard hotel style rooms. I believe that you will not be dissapointed if you choose to stay here. I know that my family and I will be back. . .soon!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a fabulous 6 night stay at this resort. Our group consisted of grandparents, parents and kids ages 9, 7, and 3 year old twins. We stayed in a 2 BR luxury Lakefront Condo and even with 8 people it never seemed crowded. One BR had a king bed and one had 2 queens and there was also a queen sized murphy bed. We had a full size kitchen, a table with 6 chairs and a bar with 4 barstools. There was also a washer and dryer. Our balcony gave us a beautiful view of the lake and the kids loved feeding the geese and ducks off the balcony every morning. We loved the Island Oasis Pool and the Zoom the Flume water slide pool. We never visited the third pool but it looked like a standard hotel swimming pool. The kayaks and paddle boats are free along with bikes of every size, including helmets. The kids loved fishing off the dock with the free cane poles. We rented a pontoon boat for 4 hours and started having engine trouble after 2 hrs. When we returned to the marina we offered to pay half of the cost rather than switch boats and they were nice enough to waive all the charges. That was way more than we expected! The office staff and marina staff were all friendly and helpful. This is a wonderful resort for people of all ages. We can’t wait to return.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Still Waters in October 2011. The property is very nice. We took advantage of a special offer on a motel style room but we were actually upgraded at check-in to a one bedroom condo! Now that is good customer service! The condo was beautiful, and the view from our patio was amazing. The room was spotless and very modern. Still Waters offers lots of amenities, including paddle boats, kayaks, and bicycles, all free for guests to use. There is laundry onsite, a playground, and an arcade.The new Oasis pool and hot tub is beautiful, but be warned: it is much, much smaller in person than it appears to be on the website! I can see this pool getting very, very crowded in the summer. They also have a small-ish pool with a water slide that my kids really wanted to try, but it was too cold. Again, it is fairly small, so I can see crowds being an issue. Overall, Still Waters is a great place for families to stay, is close to Silver Dollar City, and has a lot of amenities. Unfortunately, it is very expensive to stay here in the summer,(we're talking Disney-like prices!) and even on the off-season it can be pricey, unless you catch a special. But if you can get a good deal, or you are willing to shell out big bucks, this is a great place to stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 4 nights in a 3-bedroom unit in the H building. When we arrived, had to wait a very long time to check in only to find our keys did not work and had to go back up to the office to get them reprogrammed. Unit was not as clean as I would have liked. Had flies and spiders in the unit. The elevator was not operating and with a baby and being on the fourth floor, it was very inconvenient. One of the kitchen chairs was 'wobbly' but luckily did not cause any injuries. No hot water in the master bedroom faucet or bathtub on the morning of our third day. The playground was convenient and the kids enjoyed it; but unfortunately the baby swing was broken. The game room was dirty and there was no one on duty to reimburse you for lost money in several of the machines that were not working. The heat/AC in the unit wasn't working properly. When I brought these issues to the attention of the manager, hoping for some small token of financial 'satisfaction' at check out, I was met with "you should have reported these when you were first aware and we could have notified maintenance." In all fairness, none of these issues were that significant separately, but as they added up, it left me with an overall feeling of being 'not too thrilled' with the accomodations. On a positive note, it was very convenient to Silver Dollar City. Would I stay there again? Probably not.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family of five absolutely loved this resort! We couldn't have asked for a better place stay. It is very convenient to Silver Dollar City (you don't have to deal with waiting in line on Hwy. 76). If you never left the complex it is a great vacation spot. They offer several pools, hot tubs, free tubes and paddle boats on the lake. Rent a boat for the day if you want to cruise Table Rock Lake. Many of the units overlook the lake and have awesome views. Several mornings we went out on the covered porch early and watched the geese and deer running through the yard. They have a wonderful playground for the kids with swings, slides and a basketball hoop. There are horseshoes, too. This is a perfect place for a family get together or reunion. They have a very nice picnic pavilion. The units are neat and clean and many have washers and dryers which is really nice for the wet swimwear and towels daily. The kitchens are fully stocked, we cooked most of our meals in the unit to save money. They have fully equipped kitchens in many of the condos. Their staff went out of the way to bring an air purifier into our room on our request (our daughter has asthma and is very sensitive to smells). They were prompt in bringing it to the room and turning it on for us. They were also very accomodating in getting us a high chair. All in all I cannot say enough good about this resort.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Time at Still Waters - Beat the Crowd”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Still Waters May 19 thru 23rd. We beat the Memorial Day weekend crowd. The pools and marina were open all during our time there. We stayed in Building K and had a great view of the lake and the marina. The other new buildings (I and J) had the same view. Our room was comfortable, clean and exactly as described. It worked much better for us to stay near the marina as the older buildings were further away. The new pool with the waterfall was very nice. A nice feature was the many "beds" in the pool area where you could lay around without using the usual beach chairs. The hot tub felt good. Maintenance was planting new flowers, bushes and such before Memorial Day weekend to make it look even prettier. We came back one night to the resort after a show in Branson and found four small deer grazing near this pool. We rented a jet ski twice at the marina and had a great time with that. It was nice there were bicycles to use, but the area is very hilly , roads are narrow, and I didn't see a good place to ride them. The pools and atmosphere seemed great for families and children. Free wireless internet worked well and always had a good connection. It was nice to stay right next to the lake rather than in the middle of Branson. It takes ten minutes or so to make the drive into Branson. Silver Dollar City very near the resort. We would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I went for a romantic get away!! And it was just what we needed!! We loved everything about this place. It is on the lake and you have access to free canoes, paddle boats, bikes and more. The pools are beautiful and fun! The location is private and quiet but just 5 min from the BRANSON you visit at night. We never saw staff unless we called for them and they were at our door immediatly. The location is PRIME!! It is on the same road as Silver Dollar City, just a mile or so away. The wild deer just graze by in front of the water just steps from your baclony. It is just breathtaking!! The staff is SOOO friendly and amazingly helpful!! The place is so clean I thought we were the first people to ever stat in it. We actually had a room mix up and they bent over backwards to make it up to us. (It may have not even been their fault) It was not a big problem at all but they wanted to be 100% sure we were not upset! PS If you stay 5 nights you get a free night!! And the rates are GREAT!!!! They are realy great people!! We had a 1br 1ba and it was bigger than any apartment I have ever lived in!! The space is almost too much. The balcony facing the lake was just wonderful especially for breakfast and dinner!! We had a washer and dryer in our room. Now that is convience!! We will be back and next time get 2br 2ba and bring the entire family. PS there is no restraunt on the property but that is my ONLY complaint. There is a store from 7-2 that serves dogs and burgers.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went to Still Waters for a Girls weekend and enjoyed our stay! We were able to get an excellent spring rate (approx. $60 per night, no Groupon!). The people who answered the phones were very friendly and willing to help at any time. When we arrived, they were quick with the check-in process and were still able to answer all of our questions with ease. Our room was very clean with an updated bathroom and carpeting. There was an unpleasant odor at first but we opened the windows (another great feature on a 70 degree day) and the problem was solved. The hotel room had plenty of towels, a refrigerator and some silverware, which was very nice. All resort amenities were within a two-three minute walk but we were not able to use many of them since the temperature dropped on our second day. My only complaints are that there was no room service, which we knew ahead of time. One of the girls with us had a tanning oil mishap on the bed and had to sleep in it for two nights; however, I'm sure if we had called they would have brought new linens. They do not supply new towels unless you go to a little building to get them. This was not a problem for us but I could see it being a challenge for some people. Lastly, this resort is approximately 15 minutes from the main strip and 25 minutes from Branson Landing. We spent a lot of time at the Landing and it was a bit far for us, especially if we were out late. Again, overall, we had a great experience and I would recommend this resort to anyone!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a very pleasant check-in at nearly 10 p.m. to start our mother/daughters get-away. We spent 2 nights in a 3bdr/3ba condo in Building G, fourth floor. The Master Suite had a huge closet, separate bathroom with jetted tub, large sink and vanity outside the bathroom, and patio doors to go out to the enclosed sun room. The loft bedroom was also large, and overlooks the kitchen/dining/living room, but does have double doors to shut there, but no door on the stairs. The third bedroom was smaller and my sister said that it's separate heating/cooling system was adequate, but that the small refrigerator in there was quite noisy. We enjoyed our time there, especially getting Danna's BBQ takeout and having lunch in the sunroom overlooking the lake on a gorgeous autumn afternoon. The condo was a real treat for my mother especially. The staff was great at reservations, touching base with us the morning after we checked in, providing very good directions from Springfield and answering our questions. Having stayed at condos in Jackson, WY, etc., I was not surprised about doing the dishes and taking the trash to a chute very close by. We got a really excellent deal, got to spend lots of time together relaxing, and made lots of great memories. My only recommendations would be a bit of a decor upgrade, and a little more attention to cleaning of mouldings at the floor level, and lack of available Coke products to purchase, but none of that was a big dieal for any of us. We would go back anytime!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Started off when we arrived. When we booked our rooms and asked for adjoining rooms they told us it wasn't a problem, we called a few weeks in advance to make sure we still had "adjoining" rooms and again they asured us that they were. So of course when we get there the rooms are on total oppisite sides of the building. When we called and asked about it we were told there was nothing they could do. When we got in our room the furnace closet door was broken and off the hinges, we put a cooler in front of the door to keep the kids from pulling it on top of them. The living room lamp was missing the knob to turn it on. The bathroom light fixture fell out and busted glass was all over everywhere. The smoke alarm went off at five o'clock in the morning due to a dead battery. All these problems were fixed like two or three days later. But that wasn't even the worst part! No we had to live with a god awful sewage smell that nobody was able to use the patio or back part of the condo after dark! The smell was so bad inside our rooms. We used plenty of Lysol and Glade to combat the smell. There also wasn't any linen service and if you needed fresh towels you had to drive about a quarter mile to the office to get new ones. We rented two suites and one room for a week with three days boat rental and five day slip rental and when we first contacted them they offered us FREE PIZZA!!! Eventually they did refund us a small fraction of our bill. We will never be back to to over priced SEWAGE smell waters!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was surprised when I arrived to this resort. From the pictures, I thought it was the run of the mill resort here in Branson. I was shocked when I walked into my one bedroom suite. It was very spacious, clean, and near perfect. I only booked a 2 night stay for a quick get away and to do some Christmas shopping with the wife. When I booked, I go an insane price when I booked via the resorts website. I got 50% off for both nights and I booked this awesome room. The room (room 126) had a huge full kitchen, laundry room with washer & dryer, dining area with a full table, full living area with 2 couches with a pull out bed, full master bedroom with a king bed and tv, and a full bathroom with a jet tub and shower. The room sat on the lake. It looked like the room was recently redone. We spent a lot of time out on the deck drinking some wine and enjoying the insane nice weather for November. It got to 70 degrees on Saturday. STUPID ME, I forgot my camera at home so I have no pictures to post, but trust me......this place is 100 times nicer than the photos posted on here and on their website. This place also has a market that serves food. We ordered Pizza on Saturday night......it was decent. It was not bad at all. We also ate Breakfast on Sunday morning. They also have great coffee. They also have pools galore (closed). They also offer free bike rental and paddle boat rental. There are also boat slips. There is a lot to do here. I will be back next summer...............I am so glad I found this place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found Still Waters in 2003 through AAA guide book with hotels and restaurants in Branson. We've been back several times a year since (2003 to 2011). We like the convenience of their motel rooms (with a mini-refridgerator, microwave, toaster, and coffee pot) and studio units for a 2 night weekend trip to 1, 2, or 3 bedroom condo units when staying with extended family for 3 or more days. There are nice pools and hot tubs on the property as well as lots of "free" stuff (seasonally available) from bicycles, kayaks, paddle boats, and fishing poles for kids to use. The hot tub at the "Oasis" pool is even open in December. December 2009, we used the hot tub while there was snow on the ground around us. Our daughter enjoyed playing with the snow and getting in & out of the hot tub. Our family enjoys being able to have extra space to relax when in the condos on one of our many trips to Silver Dollar City each year. If you are planning a family reunion there are 3 outdoor pools (all with hot tubs and two with separate "kiddie" pools), playground as sandbox play areas, pavillion with picnic tables, various grills (some charcoal and some gas) on the grounds. Still Waters has tickets availabe to Silver Dollar City (2 day ticket for the price of a 1 day ticket at the gate) as well as other help booking tickets to one of the many shows in Branson. I forgot that there are boat slips and boat rentals available on Table Rock Lake. All the staff are courteous and have worked with us on the very rare occassion we had problems.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading all of the wonderful reviews about this resort, we couldn't wait to spend our vacation at Still Waters. However- when we got there we were somewhat disappointed. I guess we had expected something spectacular for the price we were paying. Like the last two reviews said- you could stay at a beachfront property for what you pay to stay here. We stayed a studio in one of the older buildings. The carpet was VERY worn, the comforters looked stained, the TV is small, and the bathroom set-up is awful. While they've redone the sinks with nice granite type counters, the sink is outside of the bathroom- right as you walk into your room. It has a very small countertop, so not much room to spread out your toiletries, etc. I found this to be a real pain, as most hotels you can get ready in the bathroom and spread out your things on the counter. We did enjoy the pools and the kids loved the slide. The Oasis area is nice and works well for small children. Older children tend to like the pool with the slide. The playground is nice and the docks were perfect for the kids to fish off of. The grounds down around the lake aren't maintained as well as up around the condominiums. Overall, it's a good location and the outdoor amenities are great for a family with kids. The main problem with this resort is the overpriced rooms. When you're paying close to $200 a night for a room, you expect it to be really nice. They may have reasonable rates off season, but during the peak of summer they are WAY too high for what you're getting.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just spent Christmas in a 2 bedroom, 2 bath lakefront condo at Still Waters, and could not have been more pleased!! We just checked out this morning, and we did not want to leave!! We loved the gas fireplace, and the huge master bath with the jacuzzi tub for 2. We had a view of the marina. When it was lit up at night, the reflection in the water is an awesome sight!! The kitchen was great, and stocked pretty well. I brought extra serving bowls, casserole dishes and such, because we were having Christmas dinner there, but you could probably get by with what they have stocked. The frying pans in our unit were a pretty much worn out, but I did bring one from home, so that helped. I took extra kitchen towels, and dishcloths with us, and I was glad I did, since there was only 1 of each. We were there for 4 nights, so we did a lot of dishes!!! I did dry the towels several times in the clothes dryer. There was a dishwasher, but we never used it, I guess maybe that would have helped. Everything was clean, and very comfortable. The furniture is very nice, clean and new looking. We had a huge dining room table with 6 chairs, and then 3 bar stools at the counter. It looks as if they have a great variety of watersports, and a nice pool area, if you are staying in the summer. The summer rates are obviously much higher, but even in the winter it was a very enjoyable stay, with a terrific rate!!! We will definitely stay again, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great condo, with an awesome view!!!! It is also very close to Silver Dollar City, without the hassle of the Branson traffic!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have been staying at Stillwaters for several years. We've always loved the pools, docks, grounds, store and marina. The last couple years that we went we started to feel like the prices were getting too high. This last year we took our family and another family to split a 2 bedroom condo. At check in we were told that the room in the newer built building that I requested had a sewer problem and we had to be moved. We didn't mind that and we did get a small comp towards the downgrade in rooms. The room we got however smelled bad almost like mold. My wife had to buy some air fresheners to cover the smell. The beds were very worn and needed to be replaced. The other complaint I had was the lifeguards at the main swimming pool were sitting together texting on cell phones the whole week we were there. My kids are old enough that I wasn't concerned for my family but when you advertise that you have a lifeguard and they are sitting there not paying an ounce of attention, then I do have a problem. I did email Stillwaters about this when we got home but got no response addressing this. My family has decided to stay elsewhere on Table Rock Lake this summer and we have found other resorts that are half the price and have just as nice of accomodations. The only thing different is the pools aren't as nice as Stillwaters. I feel that the pools are not worth that much money difference. I did enjoy Stillwaters the years we stayed there but it just seems as though the trips were getting more and more expensive and the disappointments were starting to mount. I hope they get things back in order with these problems either give you more for the money or lower their prices.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was very excited about this resort based on reviews and pictures found here. Wish I could say I wasn't dissapointed - but the experience was not as I had expected. We were given a room on the third floor in a building without an elevator. Lugging stuff up three very steep flights of open steps was difficult. Then we were greeted to our room by bangs from our neighbors - they really weren't mean people, but as we found out the walls are PAPER THIN - I could here them blow their nose the next morning. And when their phone rang i answered ours because it was so loud it had to be our phone, not a neighboring room - wrong. No housekeepng services, must exchange towels and retreive additional toilet paper - also no small bottles of shampoo to use in a pinch. On check in we were told the opening times of three pools on the property - only one was stil open - the rest were shut down for the season. When the couple in front of me checked in they were so excited to go to SDC - the front desk flatly replied - yes you and 14,000 other people. When I called to report a toilet that ran all night and the thin walls, I was greeted with the same sort of flat hospitality. CUSTOMER SERVICE not high on the list here. The property boasts many amenities - marina, paddle boats, etc. But when we went to to check these out - the marina was closed (it was 80 degrees outside) and a note tacked to the door that the paddle boats are self serve. I travel frequently and understand lake life and rustic ambience - but the price of this hotel was too high for the quality. If you have elderly people traveling - definately request a bottom floor room and count on running around to replace towels, etc. Convenient only if SDC is only destination - off the beaten path. Would not recommend and will not stay again.</p></li>
