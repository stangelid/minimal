<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything about this place was wonderful. My husband and I were looking for a CLEAN reasonably priced room, and we found so much more. Literally five minutes from St Mark's square this little gem is a lovely family owned hotel. Take the time to get to know the owners and staff.

Internet available at a price. Good location close to all the tourist midway between Rialto Bridge and San Marco Square.</p></li>

Our room was small but served its purpose - we were never in there! Venice is an amazing place, with too much to explore to sit in a hotel room. Breakfast was great - make sure you ask for a Cappuccino instead of a regular coffee - yum! If you're looking for a hotel that's close to all the action at a reasonable price - this is it. Would definitely recommend.</p></li>

I would recommend getting good directions from the staff before locating it.

Location is behind St Marks square, so the price is actually of good value. Air conditioning was the best we have experience in Italy (yes, I am a spoiled American;). Hotel has 27 air-conditioned rooms with a safe and fridge. Also has free large breakfast which saves a lot of money in Venice. I would definitely go back</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has a great location, a simple 5 minute walk to San Marcos Square and 10-15 mn to the Grand Canal. The website does a poor job at supplying accurate pictures so don't make the same mistake I did, and go with an open mind and not a set expectation. You also must walk up stairs to your room. Everything was in good shape and very, very clean. The breakfasts lack in variety, but can be filling if enough is eaten!! Overall, we enjoyed staying at Hotel Al Piave.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was probably our least favorite during our trip to Italy. First off, the rooms are small, even for European standards. The staff are not as friendly as some of the other reviews said they were. The location is great, but Venice is so small that it is never more than a few minutes to the center of town. The positives were that the hotel was clean and the air conditioning worked great. I would probably find another place to stay, especially since this place wasn't cheap either....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wow, this is a lovely hotel. It's tucked in a quiet street that is convenient to all tourist sites -- a bit tricky to find at first but worth the trouble! Everything was immaculately clean and the rooms were quiet. The lobby and breakfast room are beautifully decorated with Venetian paintings, glassware and gorgeous lamps. Breakfast was very good, including scrambled eggs. One warning -- there is no elevator. We were on the third floor and it was quite a workout getting our luggage up the stairs.</p></li>

Plenty of room for a family of four, close to amny attractions and a very Venetian experience. No views, but I don't wish to pay exhorbitant prices for such.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A very nice "bed & breakfast" type hotel in an excellent loaction...just a few minutes walk from St. Mark's square, and right around the corner from a water taxi stop...next to a lovely little square with restaurants, ATM machines & souvenirs, but not too crowded. The owners were very nice and helpful, and the breakfast was also very good. Internet access. Avoid the room with the "terrace" unless you like hiking up 3 flights of stairs! All-in-all, a very pleasant stay for a reasonable price. I would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

We booked this hotel based on the reviews on this site and were not disappointed in the least. The hotel was very clean and quiet. The included breakfast was always delicious even near the end of breakfast at 10am. Every member of the staff that we encountered was always friendly. We had a special situation that we were arriving on a Sunday at 11:30pm and they confirmed our reservations and gave very detailed instructions to help speed our way. I would whole-heartedly recommend this hotel for a trip to Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading all the positive reviews on Trip Advisor, I was even more hesitant about choosing this hotel. It seemed too good to be true, but I bit the bullet and decided to give it a try. The hotel was awesome. Great value for money, compared to many hotels in Venice. The room was spotless. Small, but that's Europe. Bathroom was clean. Breakfast was above average for continental style. Coffee was amazing. Location was great. I highly recommend this hotel. As for directions, I suggest you get off at the San Zaccharia stop instead of San Marco, if you're taking the Alilaguna.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall the stay was good, great location to see Venice. The hotel has a main lobby where breakfast is served (which was very good), but the rooms are old apartments nearby. There was some construction going on at the time, so there was some noise in the morning/during the day. The room we stayed in was on the top floor, and had a very low ceiling and a restricted bathroom. If you are tall or bulky, email ahead and ask if you will have issues. The staff was very helpful. Look up on a map how to get there from the water, the directions are good but some prep work would have made it easier.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed our last night here and liked it very much. Small room, but comfortable and clean with private bath. Dont bring too much luggage to Venice, streets are narrow, and its tricky navigating the bridges and people while trying to find the hotel. (Great tip - Marco Polo Airport has luggage drop off on the first floor, so we only brought one bag to Venice and left the heavy ones at the airport!). Very close to San Marco which is the most expensive part of Venice but must be visited. (Tip #2: book the Secret Itinerary tour, its awesome!). Breakfast on the roof is beautiful. Well recommended!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Al Piave in October, 2005 for two nights and enjoyed our stay immensely. We found the hotel in Rick Steves' Italy 2005. We took a water taxi to the hotel. When we left, the hotel called us a water taxi and the driver picked us up at the hotel . He and the bellman carried our very heavy luggage all the way to the taxi. The staff at the hotel were very, very nice and quite helpful. Our room was very large and very nice. The bathroom was large and very clean. Breakfast was wonderful. The only disttaction was that there was not elevator. Lovely place to stay and would do so again, in a heartbeat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our 3rd stay at Al Piave. As previously our experience was most satisfactory. We were accomodated for 5 nights in the appartment a short walk down Ruga Guiffa which offers a spacious living room with kitchenette and large bedroom and bathroom upstairs. Staff are friendly and accomodating and most have VG English speaking abilities. Breakfast is much better than the average offered in Venice. Hotel is well located with major attractions a short distance away although the charm of Venice is best discovered by "getting lost" Will stay here again on return visits to Venice. L& M Reeves.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Conveniently located only a few minutes' walk from Piazza San Marco and the Grand Canal and vaporetto stops, Hotel Casci is a clean, quiet, well-run establishment. Our room was nicely decorated and the beds very clean and comfortable. The staff was most helpful in explaining how to get around in Venice. The breakfast buffet offered plenty of protein (eggs and meats), plus pastries, fruits, and caffe. The only negative - they charge by the minute for internet usage, the only hotel to do so on our trip. I would not hesitate to stay here again, and would recommend it to anyone seeking a quality hotel in Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's a 3-star hotel with fairly old decoration, but the service is excellent! The staff were helpful and friendly, we were surprise to get this wonderful service in Italy. The room was small, but the hotel was in a great location. It's a bit difficult to find at the beginning, then we found out it's located in pretty central location~easy walk to most of the major site. The breakfast was good, they got everything you need. The only bad thing is this tiny hotel doesn't have an elevator, pretty difficult to carry the luggage up and down at the narrow staircase. The friendly service will make you feel like home!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband, 8 year old daughter and I stayed at the Hotel al Piave for 5 nights in August. The room was wonderful. There were 2 bedrooms so that we didn't have to pretend to all go to sleep at the same time. Our daughter's room had a separate air conditioning unit and both units kept the rooms comfortably cool in the hot August weather. The breakfast is great (eggs, cereal, breads, fruit) and the staff is very helpful. The free WiFi is excellent. We always had a very strong signal. The location is very good and the directions on their website from the vaporetto stop were perfect. We would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I read Travel Advisor and found the Al Piave lived up to the reviews given by other travelers. It was in a terrific location, the staff were professional (they booked a private tour of a glass factory in Murano, arranged for a privately guided tour, etc.). Our room was for three and was very cosy and comfortable. The breakfast was excellent. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel. One other thing to note. When we came in from the airport, I did find it a bit difficult to get to the hotel from the St. Marks square dropoff with all of our luggage. Next time I would invest and take a private water taxi.</p></li>

The hotel staff is extremely friendly and accomodating. The rooms were spotless and the morning breakfast was delicious. We were visiting Venice on my wife's birthday and upon our arrival they updgraded us to a bigger room for free. One of the best features is the 5 minute walk to St. Marks. All other hotels this close to the square were almost double the price. One piece of advice: the hotel is a good 45 minute water bus ride from the Venice train station so if you are travelling by train be sure to give yourself some time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved our stay at Hotel Al Piave. Our two-room suite was perfect for our 11-year-old son, my husband, and me. The room had the authentic Venetian flooring and beautiful wood-beamed ceilings. Very comfortable beds, too. Everything was clean, and breakfast was ample (they even had scrambled eggs, which made my husband very happy!). While it was a short walk to St. Mark's and to the Rialto bridge, we really enjoyed the square just up the road--Campo Santa Maria Formosa. It seemed to lack the throngs of tourists, and gave us a sense of local life in Venice, complete with children playing and dogs running after each other. It's also a cheaper place to secure a gondola ride.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and 18 year old daughter just returned from our Italy vacation and Venice was our last stop. Hotel Al Piave was everything we expected and more (for the price); the front desk staff spoke english and was always helpful and courteous, the breakfast (included) was very good and the room was clean and well kept. The hotel was in a great location, although we did get lost while wondering around and could not find the hotel - ask the front desk for a map - we found out later their map was much more detailed than ours. Check out Burano it is a nice little treat. This was our first experience to Italy and Hotel Al Piave helped us enjoy every moment of it. We would stay here again</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We picked this hotel after reading many reviews from Trip Advisor. They were right! This hotel is well located, walking distance to St. Mark's square. It was a little tricky to find but their website map is pretty good. We followed all their instructions and found the hotel no problem. The rooms are comfortable, roomy and clean. The bathroom was superclean and the towels white and fluffy! The staff was super friendly, especially to our son (18 month-old baby). It was refreshing to come back after a long day of touring to our rooms and felt at home. The breakfast was really good, cappuccinos, eggs, etc. Each one of the staff was very attentive and courteous. We will love to come back soon!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The review title summarizes, but some details: 5 min walk to St Mark's square and about 7 mins to Rialto (if you don't get lost in Venice as it is such a maze :-)). The room was very ornate, spacious, bathroom was clean, shower had good pressure, full bodied pillows. The shower tub was somewhat tight but seems to be common in Italy. Minor annoyance was the thermostat which could only start/stop the ac, but not change the temperature. The breakfast included egg cooked to your liking, and coffee or hot chocolate served to you. The staff was friendly, one guy even helped load the prepaid cell credits into my WIND/TIM cell SIM, as the instructions were all italian. Talk about customer service!</p></li>

But back to the hotel, we were very pleased and would recommend it to others with no hesitation. No complaints, got wonderful service and had interesting chats with Claudio who was extremely helpful and charming. Al Piave was extremely clean, had comfortable beds, modern bathroom and generally was a pleasure to come back to at night. All in all one felt this place was well taken care of.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Al Piave for two nights in June, 2005 prior to our Mediterranean Cruise. What an excellent choice we made by staying here. The staff are so welcoming and helpful in every way. From taking our many bags to our room to arranging a water taxi to take us the port to giving recommendations on restaurants. We stayed in a family suite for 3 and there was ample room for 2 adults and a teenager. Breakfasts every morning was delicious. My husband believes they have the best coffee at this hotel. We were within walking distance to every attraction we wished to see. We had a great time there and highly recommend Hotel Al Piave. When we next visit Venice we will be staying at this hotel.</p></li>

Some good things were: the location; it is very close to St. Marks Square and not too far from the waterbus station. The breakfast; not your average continental breakfast. They had scrambled eggs, fruit, pastries, meat, cheese, and they made you cappucinos to order. Our best breakfasts in Italy by far! They made our restaurant reservations for us and gave good recc. too. The price is fair considering we talked to other tourists who paid $300-400 a night for their hotels. Their rooms are very comfortable(air cond!) The whole staff is very kind and speak pretty good English too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from trip to Italy and stayed at this hotel. It was exactly what we wanted. Tucked back in, away from the crowded streets along the waterfront and centrally located. We had reservations at this hotel and the Hotel Marconi at the Rialto Bridge. The price difference was about $300 between the two, so opted low based on the reviews on this website. After we got there we were so happy we did not fall for the novelty of staying on the Grand Canal. The crowds were constant and I'm sure it was noisy at night. Hotel Al Piave is a great place to stay in Venice. The walks to the waterfront, the Rialto Bridge and Piazza San Marco appear longer on a map. Staff, breakfast and rooms were all fantastic.</p></li>

The moment we stepped into the hotel, which is steps away from both San Marco and Rialto, we knew we were in a special place. Everyone was welcoming, kind and helpful at every turn. We stayed in a second floor, charmingly appointed studio apartment with a full-kitchen and cabinets stocked with china, flatware, glasses etc. Each morning we enjoyed breakfast (included in your stay) in the hotel restaurant where owner Paolo would take special care of us. We felt like family and now have a Venetian home away from home. We've already booked this treasure again for June.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great little hotel in Venice. Our room was 119, so it was very spacious with a cute view of the "street". Only downfall was that it could be quite noisy late into the night and/or early in the morning. But no big deal to us. The bathroom was a bit small, but still nice for European standards. Breakfast was great, crowded, but very accommodating. Hotel is difficult to find and forget any maps! Half the streets are not noted anyhow.. With some help from Venetians and just luck, we stumbled upon it. Hotel is in a great location (when you figure out where you are), just minutes from St. Mark's Square and great dining. The best meal we had was at the restaurant right next door.. Would recommend staying here. We had a very nice stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Al Piave for 2 nights at the beginning of June 2007. We booked it primarily based upon the TripAdvisor reviews and were not dissapointed. The hotel is a little hotel located about 5 minutes or less from Piazza San Marco. It is very nicely kept and our room was one of the bigger, cleaner rooms we had in Italy. The hotel is family run and they were quite helpful and friendly. Breakfast was a little above average. The only slight draw back to the Al Piave may be the walk from the canal to the hotel, which is quite long if you are carrying a large suitcase but I suspect that is the same for most Venitian hotels with the exception of the 4-5 star hotels. Overall the Al Piave was great and we would highly recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at Hotel Al Piave for 2 nights in April during a week-long European adventure. I am a TripAdvisor fan, and always check before I go. I must say, I was a bit disappointed. The room we had (standard/cheapeast) was VERY tiny. We're talking open the door and falling onto the bed. The location is great. The breakfast is great too. I would suggest upgrading to the next level at least. I am sure the hotel is good for the price, but have stayed in Venice before at a location not as ideal in a much bigger room with the same level of service. Venice is easily walkable, so if comfort is a consideration, you might want to check the hotels a bit father out. Yes, you're not in your room for much of the time, but if you want to be more comfortable: upgrade or go further out.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great place, located between St Mark's Square and the Rialto Bridge. On a narrow street but then lots of things are in Venice! We followed the directions given by 'jbearKent' on here - thanks jbearKent! A few winding streets from the San Zaccaria waterfront and we were at the hotel. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, and gave us a map, pointing out some sights when we first got there. The breakfast choice was great: cereals, cakes, fruit, rolls, spreads, cheese, yogurts, drinks, and they always asked if we wanted cappucino and eggs with our breakfast! The room was great - larger than I'd expected with ensuite bathroom, wardrobe, TV, mini kitchen in a cupboard(!), phone, hairdryer, air conditioning, 2 windows but didn't get bitten by mosquitos! Great. Would like to go back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed a nice stay at this Hotel Al Piave during Carnivale 2010. We rented a family suite for a couple with two boys, 10 and 15. There was adequate space and the rooms were spotless. TVs, irons, hair dryers made them well equipped. The hotel is not luxurious but gives yo more than you would expect for the reasonable rates. Maid service was prompt and effective. Location is superb with a short walk to St. Marks, Rialto, gondeliers and vaporetto... Breakfast was more than servicable. Great coffee, expresso and hearthy with fresh eggs. The Puppin family are welcoming and informative. One piece of advice-splurge on the water taxi to and from the airport. The dropoff is minutes from the hotel. Walking from the vaporetto stop up and down stairs with luggage was a BIG MISTAKE for us.</p></li>

We received a warm welcome by Claudio who got us 2 rooms and fantastic rates- given that it was peak tourist period- . The rooms were spacious, clean and cozy...great value. Next morning we had a rich breakfast and again very friendly service all included in the BB rate. To top it all before checking out we met the owners and we chatted for almost 30 min.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Al Piave was recommended by Rick Steve's so I started communicating with the owners by email. They had a "triple" which was one large bedroom with a queen-size bed & sofa attached to a room with a single bed (plenty of room & privacy for our 19-year old son) connected with a bathroom/shower. The rooms were immaculate, beds were very comfortable. The breakfast provided with the rate was very nice with a gentleman who cooked eggs the way you like plus breads, cheese/meats and juices. The same gentleman walked with us to our water taxi in the pouring rain to make sure we went to the right dock. I accidentally left my cell phone in the room and they searched until the phone was found and then shipped it to me in the US. This is a quaint, lovely hotel on a quiet alley with an easy walk to St. Mark's square. Highly recommended!</p></li>

This was our 4th stay at this family run establishment and the standard remains high. We were accomodated in a good sized room with a small terrace on the top floor of the building a few doors down the street. A much better than average breakfast is served in the hotel proper. Hosts, Paolo, Illaria and Mirella are gracious and quick to provide assistance .Rooms and bathrooms are kept spotlessly clean. The hotel is well located in Castello, close to many of the major attractions and water transportation. Venice is a joy to explore and this is best done on foot. Getting "'lost"' is half the fun of any visit to Venice and a few steps down a quiet side street is all that it takes to escape the maddening crowds.Recommended. Would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel after reading reviews on TripAdvisor. This was a good, clean hotel near major attractions in Venice. The breakfast was sufficient and the staff was nice (and spoke English). The bathroom was a good size and the shower was larger than we expected. It was nice to have air conditioning, but the AC seemed to only have two settings on (very cold) or off. Nothing "wowed" us about this hotel. The rooms were small (although that's typical in Europe, and probably especially true in Venice); and the "view" out of our window was of the apartments next door (again, typical in Venice given the cramped city). From what I understand, the price was good for Venice (165 Eu/night)... although, be warned, Venice is an expensive city! :-) This review may not seem overly positive, but it may suffer from comparison to our stay at Residenza Cellini in Rome (which was outstanding).</p></li>

<li>From what I understand, the <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">price</span> was <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">good</span> for Venice (165 Eu/night)... although, be warned, Venice is an expensive city!</br></br></li>
<li>:-) This review may not seem overly positive, but it may suffer from comparison to our stay at Residenza Cellini in Rome (which was outstanding).</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">wow what a find, i can't find fault with it at all. The hotel is lovely and the family that own it are friendly and make you feel very welcome. Despite other reviews saying hard to locate we found it with no problem at all, when you get off at San Zaccaria, go towards your left and take the calle de rasse which is on your right, go straight to to the top bear left and then go sharp right sort of ahead of you, up and over a tiny bridge over a small canal( an enterance to another hotel is just as you come over the bridge), up a very tiny alleyway and at the top turn left and you should be on the ruga guiffa, the al piave is a little way down on the left, not far from santa maria formosa. In all not even 10 mins walk from San Zaccaria. The newly decorated rooms are a must, well worth the extra money. Would we return to Venice, most certainly, and where would we stay the Al PIAVE.....</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">To start with, Venice hotels are old, small and a bit quirky. They are generally rehabbed old homes, etc. so you are not going to find big, modern hotels like most Americans are used to. Also, hotels are expensive here so I really had to do some digging to find a decent value. I would actually say this hotel was probably "very good" by Venice standards but just average by most hotel standards. This was definitely one of the more budget friendly hotels I could find but it was by no means inexpensive. The room was small with old decor and the bed could have been more comfortable. However, the bathroom was a decent size and very clean. The breakfast room was average though the staff was pretty helpful and friendly. They made dinner reservations for us and gave suggestions of things to see and do as well. The hotel is challenging to find but that is pretty much the case for everything in Venice!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I stayed in the Studio room which was just down the street from the main hotel and along a wee alley. I did read one bad review of this room on the TripAdvisor website so wanted to add a more positive one - to give another opinion!!! We found the studio room was pretty much ideal for us. It wasn't cramped, it was really clean and had a downstairs shower room and upstairs kitchen/living area with separate double bedroom. Moreover, it was very reasonably priced (just 145 euros a night)...making it an excellent, central, base for exploring the city. The other review moans about the steps. There are about 12 and, if you are able-bodied they really are not a problem, so don't let that put you off!! All in all. it was kinda like having your own wee Venetian flat for a few days...somewhere to rest your head after a busy day - not somewhere to laze around in luxury. We'd definately go back...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was the perfect place to stay for our anniversary / belated honeymoon. Very friendly staff. They surprised us with champagne in the room. Also they helped husband's sister (back in US) send us a beautiful bouquet of flowers. They were very patient and diligent answering our many questions regarding the different aspects of our trip (confusing opening hours on a place we wanted to visit, entertainment, transportation, and directions for example). Great breakfast - fruit, eggs, meats, cheeses, pastries, yogurt. Great location - easy to get to both San Marco and Fondamente Nove Vaporretto / Alilaguna stops. Fte. Nove is much shorter ride from airport with only 1 tricky turn while walking. They have a variety of room types - we really liked having the balcony / patio on our room. Internet computer was easy to use with minimal charge. Liked Best: Location, staff Liked Least: can't think of anything I would change</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a very nice place, and especially good to come to after finding that the room we'd reserved at the Hotel Alycone was unacceptably dirty. We stayed in the studio down the street from the hotel, in what looked at first to be a scary dark alley but what is in fact simply a typical (and quite well-traveled, safe) Venetian street. It's also fairly convenient for getting to the airport (if you have a decent map!) - quite close to the Zaccharia vaporetto stop, where you can get an Alilaguna boat to the airport for only 10 euros. If you have trouble with stairs, do ask about the studio - it's on the ground floor, an unusual bonus in Venice. You simply walk a block to the main hotel for breakfast, which is unusually good and includes fabulous hot chocolate. The hotel is also right next to a brightly lit laundromat which is open nice and late. All in all, a fine choice in a city where good accommodations can be difficult to find.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our third stay with Hotel al Piave and as always we only wish we'd had more time there. The difference this time was that we had our friend along with us and therefore needed a larger accomodation. She and I were also running in the Venice marathon so we required a kitchen in order to prepare that early morning brekkie. We booked the one bedroom studio apartment (Blue Studio). When I arrived to check in, I was informed that they had given us a different apartment. It was so much larger than the one I'd booked. I couldn't be happier. This apartment was over 3 floors and had a full kitchen, living room, large bathroom, ample queen bedroom, and a cute single on the top floor. The apartment is located right accross the alley from a pasticceria and the smell is divine. The staff of Al Piave were, as always, willing to go the extra mile. We love it there and have sent 2 other groups of people there over the years also, and they loved it too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Many thanks to Tripadvisor reviewers for your comments about Hotel Al Piave - we chose this hotel for our first visit to Venice and we were very happy. Very friendly staff, very helpful. For the price Hotel Al Piave is elegant and a great deal. The fragrance of the fresh flowers at the front desk is a lovely touch. Our room # 17 was spacious and the bathroom very fresh and roomy. The beds were wonderfully comfortable and the room very quiet. The hotel is located very close to San Marco Basilica and the vaporetta (sp?) system which is a big plus. The breakfast room and breakfast offerings were very satisfying and one time we got to sit outside in the "patio" area and ate our breakfast watching locals and tourists passing by. Returning to Hotel Al Piave every evening was an adventure in itself and on entering the warm and welcoming reception area I always felt like it was just the finest way to finish a day of discovering Venice. I highly recommend Hotel Al Piave. Enjoy!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I visited Venice for the first time and choose this Hotel via recommendation by this website; we were not disappointed! The Hotel was very clean and rooms tidied daily. The Staff were all very friendly and breakfast was lovely. Try the cappuccino and scrambled eggs â€“ yum!!! The Hotel is very central and ok to find but make sure you have a good map prior to arrival. Italians are friendly and most speak English and are more than willing to show you the way should you get lost (which is not a bad thing as you will come across so much culture and beautiful little corners). Little tip; try the little restaurant â€œAgile Artisteâ€� right next door which have some very tasty and very reasonably priced food (compared to the other overpriced restaurants in the area) Try the tourist menus; 3 course and dessert between 19.50 and 22.50 Euro pp with very generous portions. We did not want to eat anywhere else after our first visit. A Hotel to be recommended - enjoy your stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I arrived around sunset so as we were walking to the hotel it started to get dark. Venice streets are confusing they are like a maze but this hotel is not far from where the airport bus let's you off. The front desk staff is very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and spacious. We had a full kitchen in our "wardrobe." At first I though it was extra storage but when we opened it we found a sink, a stove and a refrigerator. There were pots, pans, dishes and silverware. It worked out perfectly being that we took some food home from dinner. The staff were also helpful in giving directions and recommendations for places to eat. Very short walk to St. Mark's Square and the Rialta Bridge (spelling). The breakfast consisted of deli meats, cheese, croissants, cereal, juice, water and coffee/cappuccino on request. The only complaint I would have if any is our room was on the first floor and there was a alley way in between our room and the front desk so we could hear people passing by, talking, etc. I would definitely stay here again. The price was not bad either.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Hotel Al Piave for 3 days in May 2006. This is a family owned and operated 3 star hotel. We had the cheapest room. Yes, it was very tiny but nicely appointed (pictured), with a new bathroom, and clean. The front desk was very helpful booking us a reservation at Al Buco; maybe it was just coincidental we got a table on the canal under the Rialto Bridge (pictured). The breakfast was excellent. The owner took your drink order including the choice of cappuccino and hot chocolate. The free internet helped with travel logistics. The location was excellent midway between the Rialto Bridge and San Marcoâ€™s Square. Being off the beaten path kept the noise down at night. Our only complaint was it is two bridges and 10 blocks from the nearest water taxi making luggage lugging difficult. In fact, the owner saved us money by marking a map to catch the waterbus from San Zaccharia to the airport. It was only 10 blocks further and less than half the cost of a taxi. Just the kind of advice a dad would give. We enjoyed the food and hospitality served by Hotel Al Piave and would go back!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel during April 2007. All the positive reviews are correct - this is a great hotel. High points: - Very clean rooms and hotel; spotless. - Rooms were of a good size for couples, although you could probably only fit one other single cot for a baby in the room. - Hotel staff couldn't be more helpful and spoke english and german (and probably more languages). They gave good directions, i.e. how to catch water bus then road bus to Treviso airport (which is a pain if you are flying Ryanair). - Breakfast was fine, and had the opportunity to sit outside in their little alcove which was nice on warmer mornings. - Location was fabulous. Very close to St Mark's square, which is where all the action is. This also makes it easy to get to if you are catching the water bus in from Marco Polo airport. Location also meant there were more than enough good restraunts nearby. - Rooms were very quiet and peaceful and airconditioned. No problems with the mosquitos. Downsides: - Honestly not many. For the price of this hotel (100 pounds sterling in high season per night) this was a great hotel. -</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I found this hotel in a book called: Venice Top 10 and then researched it on Trip Advisor. We stayed at Hotel Al Piave May 14-16. We had a family suite in the annex just down the road from the main hotel (rooms 112 & 114). The rooms were located on the second floor and we had our own floor. This was a great room for families. My husband, 12 month old, mother and father were traveling together. When you walked into the suite there were two doors to your left and a bathroom directly in front of you. My parents stayed in one room and we stayed in the other. It was perfect for us -- my husband and I could go out for dinner while my parents watched the baby, but could be in their own room. The bathroom was nice size as were the rooms. Both rooms could sleep three adults (they provided a playpen (or "cot" as they call it in Europe) for the baby. One of the rooms is a bit larger than the other and it has also the tv and fridge in it. We are going back to Venice in December (we live in Italy) with friends and will stay at Hotel Al Piave -- rooms were spacious, breakfast was great (including scrambled eggs!) and the location was very central to exploring Venice.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Once again, Trip Advisor got it right. Our stay was from November 4 to 6 and 13 to 15, with a Costa cruise in between. This is a small, historical, family-run hotel in a wonderful location, close to all of Venice's major sights and a short walk from the San Zaccaria water taxi stop. We spent our first two nights in a two bedroom "suite" and though it was just my husband and I, the "space" was a pleasant surprise. It was clean, as past Trip Advisor postings have confirmed, and well appointed. Though it was a two story climb (yes, there is no elevator), our bags were quickly moved to our room without asking. Our final stay was only one floor up to a nice size, equally well appointed room with high ceilings and a great bath. Breakfast at Al Piave is better than on the Costa cruise, with real, fresh scrambled eggs (a first for us in Italy), Italian meats and cheeses, hot and cold cereal, fresh breads, rolls, croissants and pastry, and they make the best cappuccino. The family is bilingual, very helpful and even arranged for us to share a private water taxi, at considerable savings, for a 4:30 AM departure to the airport. Al Piave is now our place to stay in Venice!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for a few days in May 2011. Being our first time to Venice, we were nervous about finding the hotel in the maze of streets. Luckily, the detailed directions that accompanied our reservation led us directly to the hotel. The man at checkin (cannot remember name) was extremely pleasant and helpful. He gave us all sorts of info about activities and transportation options, as well as detailed info about the hotel itself such as breafast times. The breakfast was wonderful, hot coffee and a great spread of pastries, fruit and cheeses. What a great way to start a day of exploring in beautiful Venice! The room was very adaquate with a nice bathroom, TV and air conditioning. It even had a hidden safe in the closet and a desk for writing post cards and relaxing. The only complaint is that the hotel has very thin walls - you can hear everything that is going on in the hallway and adjacent rooms. This was only a minor issue for us because the other aspects of the hotel make up for it. Overall, this is a fantastic family run hotel with great charm and an even better value in the overpriced city of Venice. We will be staying here again in the future, thanks Al Piave!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in the handicap-access room (although none of us are handicapped), which may skew our review. That said, our room was beautiful and spacious and very modern! The bathroom was huge and very modern. You may need some instructions for some of the gizmos (we accidentally turned off the cold water for the building...whoops). The folks at the front desk are very nice and helpful although constantly busy. The breakfast is delicious, and there were even some freshly cooked eggs, which is a real treat in Europe. You can pay 1 euro/ 15 minute for internet access at their computer. I really liked the location because it was a quieter area. It was near one of the smaller piazzas, which meant we could find food and nice places to walk without getting caught in flocks of other tourists. Once you know your way around, its only a pleasant 5-10 minute walk to the Rialto bridge or San Marco square. We had only one complaint: when we arrived at 7am on the first day, they kindly offered us breakfast but didn't tell us they would charge us for the extra meal until we were checking out 2 days later. I wasn't too surprised and we probably would have eaten the meal anyway, but it seemed misleading and unprofessional by not mentioning the cost. Otherwise, no complaints!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just spent 3 nights at Hotel Al Piave. I arrived having broken my foot in Florence 3 days earlier, in a cast and on crutches! From the outset the hotel staff went out of their way to help us - I really cannot speak highly enough of how wonderful they all were. I was very grateful. Now the hotel... It was relatively easy to find being an easy 5-10 minute walk from San Zecharia vaporetto stop. There was just one small bridge to cross. The rooms we had were very clean, comfortable and well appointed. (We appreciated having tea making facilities). Bathrooms were modern and fresh. (We were moved to a room with disabled bathroom after first night) The hotel is located in relatively quiet area bordering San Marco and Castello. While away from the busy tourist areas they were still in easy reach(even for me!) and there are good and well priced restaurants close by. A laundrette is located just a few stores to the right too! We enjoyed the breakfast which included eggs in addition to the usual offerings. Pastries and rolls were often still warm if you took the early breakfast option. Having stayed near Rialto on our last visit, we enjoyed the quieter ambience of the area. Service and price beat views hands down in our view. I look forward to another visit when I am walking on two legs again!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice hotel in Venice”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband, 16 year old son and I recently spent three nights at this hotel in Venice. It is in a great location (only a 7-8 minute walk to Piazza San Marco once you learn the best route). The hotel was very clean and the rooms were nice. We had two rooms adjoining a shared bath. It is important to note that there is no elevator at this hotel and there are four stories with narrow stairs. There is a bellman available to haul your luggage upstairs though. The hotel encompasses two adjacent buildings and there is a small patio area with tables between the buildings which is a nice place to relax for a few minutes. We were able to walk everywhere and enjoyed the area around the hotel. On the same side of the street and just next door to the hotel is a nice restaurant - Tratorria Agli Artista - that we enjoyed. There are several small markets in the area that sell reasonable (for Venice - which is VERY expensive) water, sodas and wine. The room has a mini-refrigerator so you can stock it with your own provisions. The included breakfast was quite good - included cereal, eggs, breads, pastries, yogurt, cheese, etc. Tip - the hotel's website provides directions to the hotel from the waterbus that are a bit misleading. After exiting the water bus, turn left rather than right as instructed by the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't have a problem with stairs.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were part of a Rick Steve's tour group (FANTASTIC way to tour Europe!), so we didn't have a choice in which hotels we would be staying in, but they wouldn't book us into a bad place. And this was NOT a bad place. The location was perfect! Some much to do and see just steps outside the front door. St. Marks Square was a little distance away, but Venice is such a great city to walk (or take a gondola) in. The front desk staff is very eager to please. Many of them speak very good English, but it's fun, and appreciated by them, if you at least try to speak Italian, even if you butcher everything you're trying to say. The lobby is very inviting to just sit and relax in for a little bit. There are no elevators, so whatever luggage you have, you have to carry it upstairs. I don't know if they offer assistance with luggage, my wife and I had just two fairly small backpacks each, so this was not a problem. The room was clean and mostly comfortable. I thought the bed was a little hard, so I didn't sleep all that well. But, I don't think that's a knock on the hotel. It was nice to hear church bells (not close enough to be too loud) in the early evening and the morning. It added a lot to the whole experience. The bathroom was spotless and looked like it had been updated fairly recently. Lots of hot water. With the exception of the bed, I wouldn't hesitate for one second to stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Best 3 star hotel in Italy.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you're looking for charm & location my daughter and I loved this hotel. We were two women traveling in Rome, Florence and Venice, and this was our favorite hotel. I have visited Venice twice before with my husband and stayed in 4 & 5 star hotels. Friends we met there were in a 4 star right on the water near San Marco where they could see all the people and boats arriving. I liked our experience better. Walking through some narrow paths on the way to the hotel and coming upon an ancient church or an unexpected piazza filled with wonderful restaurants and activity is part of the hotels charm. You arrive by water bus near St. Mark's square and once you're at the hotel, if you venture in the opposite direction as you leave (have a good map) you'll wind up at the Rialto Bridge (about 10 min. walk). The people at the desk were always accommodating and helpful. The breakfast was lovely and plentiful. You can see the care they take in the table setting with beautiful linens and china. The rooms were very clean and had the best bathroom of all four hotels we stayed in while in Italy (showers can be quite small we noticed). We stayed on the second floor so we had our own balcony with flowers and this made for great pictures. We like being upstairs because Italy doesn't have screens on windows and we like to have fresh air at night and be safe. And no, I'm not related to the owners. This is the only hotel review I'm doing. They deserve recognition.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for 5 nights over Easter and would highly recommend it. My room was in an adjacent building, accessed off a courtyard beside reception, meaning it was possible to come and go without going through reception. The room was tiny, and would have felt even more so with two people. Likewise, the bathroom was poky with the smallest shower cubicle I have ever seen. It was all fresh and clean, however, and rooms were serviced daily. My room had a pleasant view of neighbouring rooftops - typical for Venice! - and was extraordinarily sunny, which made for very lovely mornings! Wireless internet connection was provided free - you just needed to ask for a password from reception. Breakfast was typical for Italy - cereal, fruit salad, yogurt, cold meat, cheese, fresh coffee, tea bags, non-chilled milk (!), oversweet orange 'juice' and average pastries and bread. There were a couple of hot options which I didn't investigate! The breakfast area was small and a couple of times was full when I arrived, although it was also possible to sit outside and eat, which may have been pleasant in a group. The reception staff were very helpful, though I am not the kind of traveller to be asking for much in the way of advice. I'd highly recommend the location - far enough away from both the San Marco and Rialto areas, but completely central on the island. This is great for airport transfers, as it's an easy walk to Fondamenta Nuove which makes for a shorter and cheaper boat trip to/from the airport than the San Marco jetties.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very nice family run hotel. Location is good, within walking distance of the train station, if you donâ€™t take lots of bags. Stayed 6 nights (April 2005) in room #116. Very small room, although the bathroom was large. Both were extremely clean. Had refrigerator. Staff very helpful and above average. Lots of noise from people walking/talking in the little street/alley in front of the hotel. Closing the windows is a must if you want to sleep. If it had been hot, it would not have been good, since the hotel had not yet turned on the AC. So be very careful in the shoulder seasons. Find out the temps and if the AC is turned on yet or you will most likely be very uncomfortable trying to sleep. Breakfast consisted of bread, cold cereal, juices, canned fruit. Plenty of coffee and tea. There were some cheeses and crackers. Definitely helped to fill up before a day of tourist activities. You will not find a place that serves breakfast. Suggest renting the room with breakfast. It is worth the extra 5 Euros. The towels were very nice in this hotel; Terry cloth and they had washcloths, hand, and bath towels. This hotel was 135 Euros (cash) a night with breakfast in April. I would highly recommend this hotel. Restaurants recommended: â€¢ Trattoria Agli Artiste: pizza, Salmon pasta, Lasagne Bolognese, salad were very good; located next to Hotel al Piave; the service was spotty at best; because of convenience to hotel and lots of restaurants closed certain nights of the week, ate here 4 times â€¢ Trattoria Ai Greci: Excellent seafood; a bit pricey</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here with friends in June and would stay again. It`s a good 3* hotel at a reasonable price(for Venice!). The rooms were small but nothing unusual for a 3* in Venice and the view was more or less non-existent (again not unusual) but they were very clean and there was a good supply of decent towels and adequate toiletries. The shower was fine,and the water was hot. There`s a tv in the rooms,showing CNN but nothing else English speaking but then who comes to this gorgeous city to watch tv? Breakfast was perfectly alright--mainly cold meats and cheese but also fruit(some canned) and cereals and scrambled eggs.Coffee and tea and hot chocolate were available.The dining area was a little cramped but you can sit outside as we did. There are no tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms,though I understand some rooms have a mini-bar but it depends on what you pay..a good deal on the net doesn`t get you one of the best rooms of course but ,again,you won`t be in Venice to spend a long time in the room.The stairs could be a problem if you aren`t reasonably able bodied though ,if you`re not ,the walk to the hotel could be a problem too.But then Venice isn`t the easiest city to get round if you aren`t reasonably mobile The hotel is in a great location which is the clincher.It`s about 10 mins walk to either St.Marks Square or the Rialto Bridge so it`s perfect for the 2 main areas.There`s loads of great restaurants nearby and little bars and cafes as well as shops.It is though quite difficult to find when you first arrive ,lots of winding alleys so be prepared for a hot walk from the waterbus stop and travel light if you can.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “High-tech in ancient style”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were actually three Latvians staying in this hotel for 3 nights, using one double room and one single room, and really enjoyed the time. Finding the hotel is not as easy as if it faced Riva degli Schiavoni or Via Garibaldi, or any large open place. It is located on a narrow street; to reach it you need to follow directions like â€œgo strait, then turn left, then immediately right, then cross a bridgeâ€¦â€� and so on. If you are in Venice for the first time, perhaps it may be a bit confusing but not much. Having reached Rugga Giuffa, look for the lantern-shaped sign â€œAl Piaveâ€� sticking out from the building. I had a single room and was first disappointed when the bathroom was across the corridor, although it was not shared with any other room. Perhaps this had something to do with the building's layout - not everything is possible. But then it was ok when I found a large bathing-robe on the bed. Premises are well-equipped; bathroom was perfect, with a hair dryer and a shower niche which is generally better than a separate cabin. The room was arranged in the traditional, ancient style with a comfy bed; the only disturbance was some noisy parties during the first night. Breakfast was also pretty good, especially fruits and excellent juicy plums. I didnâ€™t like coffee which seemed to be instant coffee, but cappuccino was much better. Spongy white bread was so-so, especially if you are from a country where black and wholegrain bread is preferred. Staff was also kind and very helpful, we as art historians already knew where to find our objects of interest, but I heard them carefully explaining to other guests which are the churches housing those famous Titians and Tintorettos.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Highlights follow below for quick review: Plusses: 1] Service of staff was very good. When we arrived on Friday morning, we were given choice of 3 rooms, and got to see each of the three to pick the one we liked most. We selected one on the top floor because it had a nice balcony from which to soak up the atmosphere (note that the balcony did not really have a view but was Italianesque and nice to enjoy a drink on after a day exploring Venice). One point to make here is that there is no elevator, so if stairs wear you out, select a lower floor. However, the staff carried our luggage up and down the stairs when we arrived and departed. 2] Nice breakfast each morning, with broad selection of items. 3] Really convenient location; only about a 5 minute walk to San Marco Piazza, and about a 10 minute walk to Rialto Bridge. Several nice restaurants nearby. 4] Very good value for Venice in what was still the shoulder of the high season. Negatives: 1] No real drawbacks but I will identify a couple items to keep in mind as you consider the best place for you to book your stay. 2] First, this is not a 'luxury' hotel so if you want to be pampered and expect fancy, this is not your place. It is a comfortable room, but not high end. This should go without saying based on the price, but want to emphasize. 3] If you book through a 3rd party (e.g. hotels.com), you will not have choice of room and may be placed in 'sister' hotel, which happened to the couple checking in before us. They were not happy about it and got pretty loud. Best to book direct if you want to know you will be at this hotel property. Overall, we really liked this place because it was such a good value and we were treated well.</p></li>
