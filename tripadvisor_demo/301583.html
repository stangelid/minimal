<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We only went for the famous 'Singapore Sling' which is ridiculously expensive at $S26 and we found it a bit sickly sweet. Interestingly I have since made one at home following their recipe (which is on the menu) and mine was much nicer. I think they must have slurped in extra grenadine. The atmosphere and staff are great but it did not feel value for money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Raffles is one of those names that evokes a certain set of images associated with imperial grandeur. It lives up to this image in many ways. The imposing Indian doorman, the bar, decor and ambiance in many way make up for the fact that this hotel is 50% more expensive than other local five star hotels. Great to visit once but hard to justify a second time, given the local competition.</p></li>

Didn't realized there were different flavors--Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Tropical, Courtyard and Original. We ordered the Summer and Original. At 26 SGD each, they weren't cheap. Peanuts provided for each table and tossing the shells on the ground is encouraged. Every so often, electric fans overhead starts moving.</p></li>

The suites are comfortable, the location is central, and the service always impresses without being too formal and stuffy. Whenever I travel via Singapore Raffles will always be my first choice.

It was both of our birthdays over the wekend and the whole staff fussed over us from start to finish. Great suite, great food and wonderful ambience. Despite other reviews of the Long bar, as residents we were made to feel very special; reserved tables and very attentive service. No downsides at all; truly a piece of magic and an oaisis in this busy city state. Will definately be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Raffles during Christmas. It was very expensive, but the trip was a gift for us and definitely memorable. The staff is absolutely amazing, their attention to detail is unparalled. The accomodations are huge, with an old World setting yet luxurious. The hotel was magnificently decorated for Christmas. It feels really colonial, which is fun but kind of disconcerting - you feel quite like an imperialist. The morning buffet was terrific, one of the best hotel buffets I've ever seen.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've always wanted to stay at Raffles and we weren't disappointed. You can feel the old colonial age while staying here. The Staff are very friendly and we had the added luxury of a Lady Butler. Loved the sheets and the towels. Amazing variety at breakfast. Free wifi in the whole complex. The piano bar was great to relax in the evenings and they even had Sam playing, very entertaining. Couldn't sleep because of the time difference so enjoyed being able to have a relaxing swim at 4am. Superb stay.</p></li>

Although the drinks are pricey, the venue was well worth it. Driving up to the hotel you exit onto a gravel path, reminiscent of days gone by. The colonial style hotel is exclusive and absolutely gorgeous. Service at the bar was top notch. The hotel gift shop has great Singapore style gifts and not over-priced. I would recommend this for leisure travellers who don't mind paying for it. A true gem!</p></li>

The staff are excellent, the suites are classically thoughtful and opulent, and the grounds are exquisite. It really has the turn of century (c19-c20) feel, but updated.

If you like modern and cutting edge, then you wont like Raffles as it's Colonial style and old world charm are superb. The breakfasts were delicious and also the other food outlets we tried as well.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for three nights in early March.The greeting was excellent particularly as we arrived at 9.am. The Palm Court Suite was large, clean and as reported frequently, very colonial. We tried two of the many restaurants. The Long Bar Steakhouse provided the best porterhouse steak we had eaten for many decades. Breakfast in the Tiffen room was very good. In both cases the service was excellent. We ordered room service twice,the service again excellent and the food very good indeed. Is Raffles expensive? Of course it is. For special occasions however, I don't know of a better hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Decided to splurge on this trip to Singapore and it was worth every $ that we spent!! There are memories of days gone by everywhere. Service is wonderful.....I am not accustomed to this but it was so unobtrusive I felt at home. We also dined in the Tiffin Room for supper on one evening and it was a great choice...so many choices that anyone should be happy with Indian style food which happens to be my favorite ethnic food. Buffet breakfast in same room is also great with multiple choices. Save your $ and enjoy it at least once in a lifetime. Jimmy, the pianist in lobby bar, is amazing also.</p></li>

I don't think there is another Hotel in the world that compares. We dined at Raffles Grill (thank you to Stephen and the team for making our experience so wonderful), the Long Bar Steakhouse and the Bar and Billiard Room, had breakfast in the Tiffin Room and drank Singapore Slings in the Long Bar. Each time we went out sightseeing we could not wait to return home to Raffles. Truly a home away from home. The staff can not do enough to assist you. WOW!! Can't wait to return.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I had a 3 night stopover at the Raffles for our Honeymoon. Incredible!! The service is just perfect. We entered our room to find gifts from our butlers, we felt very spoilt... Breakfast was disappointing. Had the worst eggs benedict I have ever had. Eggs rock hard and water through my muffin not to mention the taste of nothing??? A bit surprising when everything else is so fantastic. Hope its just a one off, I am sure it was, but wasn't willing to try again. The whole experience was mind boggling, do normal people need all that luxury and service all the time?? Why not.....hehe. We had fun and will do it again.</p></li>

I had tried to get into the Fullerton (which is excellent) but it was full. I think this hotel is living on its past glories and now tries to be just a moneymaking factory fleecing tourists... I was escorted to the Spa, using a tiny lift and also noted how small the gym is and how cramped the equipment. I have been to the hotel previously, as a tourist and afternoon tea is a similar rip-off. I also ate in some sort of diner at the back of the hotel, which was also overpriced and average.

We didn't stay at Raffles but we did go there for a very boozy afternoon sipping the drink that made it famous. Stepping into the place was like stepping back in time, we could almost see the ghosts of staff and guests past walking through the lobby. The sling was exactly it should be,delicious and we even bought the glass it came in as a souveneer. This is a must do on any trip to this city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Raffles is the oldest hotel in Singapore which is its main attraction. So if you dont mind the small CRT TV's, a useless internet service, a gym which is very small and a small swimming pool, then this is the place to stay. Besides the lack of tecjnology, the only other gripe is with the key system which is required to access the residents only areas- the place is inundated with tourists. The key system failed intermittently which necessitated long walks to the reception in public areas. Otherwise, it is very well located in the colonial district and the service is very good. It has many restaurants on site ans surrounding it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in a courtyard suite at Raffles for two nights in June 2006 and cannot recommend it highly enough. Our room was huge and very comfortable - the style was colonial with all mod cons, and we were provided with our own valet. Although the hotel is swarming with tourists, residents of the hotel are provided with their own key to private areas and the rooms are gated off to ensure privacy. Also the pretty rooftop swimming pool is not open to tourists. We ate at both the Grill and the Tiffin Room restaurants which were both superb, with a wide choice of menu and excellent attentive staff. A must if you're visiting Singapore!</p></li>

The hotel exceeded our expectations in that we thought it might be slightly tired and full of tourists. Although it obviously is a tourist attraction in Singapore, if you are staying there you do not feel overrun as you have access to areas of the hotels that tourists just visiting to see it do not. The service was exceptional and all the staff delightful. The pool is on the roof, and when we were there rarely had more than a handful of people using it. Although the restaurants in the hotel are expensive, it is worth eating there at least once just for the experience.</p></li>

The wooden flooring, the rugs, the food served, and everything are appealing to one’s senses. One gets just carried away by the mannerisms of the hotel staffs. It is expensive to stay at this hotel of course, but it would be great if you try it for once in your life time. The memories of age old elegance and luxury are sure to make you feel great. Another tip is to pamper yourself with a special spa treatment while you are here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just loved the stay here. Extremely comfortable stay, got to see the fabled Singapore lightning show from my hotel window. Access from the hotel to the subway gives a feeling of being in the midst of city on the move, rather a constantly moving city. Spent some great time at the famous Long Bar- the origin of the Singapore Sling, inspite of not being a great fan of the Sling. The upper floors and the bar provide a clear view of the boundries of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singspore (ofcouse weather being clear). The food is great and the breakfast spread is very modern for an old hotel like the Raffles. The rooms are spacious and also extremely well furnished.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Raffles for two nights at the end of a three week visit to Singapore and found it a great way to finish our Singapore experience. The ambience of the hotel is very old world and we got a great appreciation for the history of the place. It is not cheap, but as the saying goes, 'you get what you pay for'. Service was excellent, pool area and staff there were great for us, high tea was nice to experience (as a guest, we had it upstairs and avoided the crowds) and the breakfast was excellent. Room, although a bit dated, was still very comfortable and did not detract from our visit. Would recommend a short stay to experience the ambience of the place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for our honeymoon in one of the personality suites, the whole thing was first class from start to finish. Peacefull room, you would'nt know you were in a city. Breakfast is amazing, the french toast is a must. the restaurents & their's lots to choose from are very good our favourite was the steak house. No visit is complete without a Singapore sling in the long bar. I had visited Raffles many years ago when back packing & said one day I will stay here, after staying here now after all those years of waiting & the expectation it blew me away, felt like royalty. Massive room, huge bathroom, quality service...everything you could ever hope for in a hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife has already reviewed this visit but after reading other reviews I felt the need to add to a valid point made by someone else. We too were stopped upon entering the hotel by the main doors one evening by a younger member of staff who rather clumsily enquired if he could help us as he partially blocked our entrance. I replied 'no' and pushed past as he really annoyed me as you have to pay good money to stay here. I feel Raffles should train their staff to be a bit more subtle when making these enquiries, I understand that they don't want everyone entering other than guests but the usual staff member who meets and greets manages to achieve this without annoying you!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On returning from a shopping trip in Bangkok we spent two nights at the Raffles Hotel in a courtyard suite. It was like a step back in time, sitting on the verandah sipping tea, drinking on the verandah of the bar and billard room in the balmy evenings, it was a dream realised for us girls who love a little luxury. Our butler Miss Anna looked after us effortlessly for the entire stay. To wander the halls, have high tea in the tiffin room, and lay by the pool this was truly a memorable lifetime experience. Just across the road from raffles city, and a block from the marina centre, a little more shopping was undertaken also. We highly recommend a stay for nostalgia at Raffles.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Raffles Hotel is what it is, a heritage 'must do' when in Singapore. However the price is now way too high for what you get. The staff are as you expect excellent. But it seemed there were not as many staff as my previous visit 11 years ago. We were on or honeymoon and had pre-informed the hotel. This was the only hotel in Singapore or Malaysia that we stayed in that did not acknowledge the honeymoon. Whilst not demanding any extra treats etc it was nice of every other hotel to make an effort to make our honeymoon special. The Hotel seems to be relying on its status and not making it that bit special as it should. Sorry and sad to say Raffles, this is my last visit to you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staying at Raffles was a dream come true. From the moment you enter you are made to feel "special". Staff calling you by name, Even if you can only go once in a lifetime, it is worth it. Hotel is immaculate, fantastic flower arrangements everywhere, Your personal butler to see to your every whim. For that "special" meal in the Grill room, the suggested menu paired with selected wines with each course!!! will make you feel like royalty. The hotel is well located for sightseeing, and a visit to Sentosa Island via the cable car is fantastic. A must is the evening street markets for your satays, cheap and cheerful and very clean. If you are thinking about staying at Raffles don't hesitate, do it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the raffles in December 2007 and it was the absolute highlight of our holiday before we moved onto other parts of Asia. We booked one night at the Raffles knowing full well that we would be paying through the nose. The hotel staff are very friendly, check in was smooth, and the room was pure class. The swimming pool is lovely, although a little small, but location is fantastic. It's nice to lounge around the pool and be waited on by the bar staff. Obviously drinks and food are pricey, but that's the Raffles for you. We loved the old charm of the hotel, and how everything has been beautifully restored. This is the hotel to stay at for names sake, and also for a once in a lifetime opportunity. We would definitely come back.</p></li>

I would recomend it to any one that asks! I also did the Tour East Tour that included a Singapore Sling at Raffles, I opted out of the Singapore Sling for $29.50,Thought it was over priced. I can understand some one who says having the Singapore Sling as a memorable experience, to note as having done it. Tick it off as been there done that. I can say the same as having just experiencing the aura of The Long Bar and treading on peanut shells as an experience in itself.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here to break a long haul flight to Australia. The service is impeccable. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The room smelt musty ( do all Singapore rooms smell that way?). Breakfast is good value and the atmosphere relaxing. I also recommend the High Tea in the Tiffin Room and the Long Bar for a Singapore Sling. Raffles has its own group of shops and Restaurants, which can be very relaxing in the oppressive Singapore heat. Raffles City is opposite and offers lots of western brands and restaurants. Raffles is a little bit of history in a very modern City. It is a shame that it is now overshadowed by lots of tall buildings. It looks slightly lost. However, the service is still of a high standard and the staff very welcoming.</p></li>

One would think that the Raffles could aford to pay barmen to make them up on request after all at aud $20 a glass not cheap.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent three nights in a Palm Court Suite on the way back from Bali. The room was just fine, maybe in need of a little bathroom upgrading, but seriously in keeping with the colonial vibes. Lots of treats on offer, from money off vouchers in the stores to a free meal and spa credits, none of which were used or expected - but nice to be asked! Excellent service all round, and a great meal in the chinese restaurant there which we can highly recommend. My sense is that you have to join in at Raffles - it is one of those hotels which has to be viewed as an experience rather than a place to stay. If you want business / typical five star, there are a load of Singapore hotels which can deliver the goods. But if you want to be part of history for a while, Raffles is the one.</p></li>

<li>My sense is that you have to join in at Raffles - it is one of those hotels which has to be viewed as an experience rather than a place to stay.</br></br></li>
<li>If you want business / typical five star, there are a load of Singapore hotels which can deliver the goods.</br></br></li>
<li>But if you want to be part of history for a while, Raffles is the one.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent two nights at Raffles. I initially had some reservations about staying in a hotel that was itself a tourist attraction. I was relieved t discover that, while there are restaurants, bars, and shops that are open to the public (and quite touristy), as a hotel guest, you need not experience any of this unless you want to. The guests' entrance and lobby is completely separate from the entrance to the tourist venues. I think the hotel does a very good job of providing a wonderful, peaceful, and historic retreat for its guests, while also providing an interesting, if touristy, experience for visitors who are not staying at the hotel but want a bit of a Raffles experience. Rooms are wonderfully comfortable, beautifully decorated, and the service excellent.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Have always wanted to stay at this hotel when I travelled to Singapore and when I decided to head there for a holiday this was a no brainer! Booked directly through the hotels website so no hassles there and communication was excellent. Met straight off the airbridge and escorted through to my waiting Bentley and whisked away to the hotel where I was taken straight up to my room (Suite 215 - The James Michener Suite) where all was taken care of by my attentive and excellent butler. The room was magnificent with the high ceilings and plenty of space. The only issue really was that the TV could use an upgrade but that is a minor issue. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The staff are beyond unreal and eager to assist in any way. Book it if you are in Singapore and want a true 5 star experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are looking for a classy colonial experience then Raffles will provide it. The rooms are huge and their decoaration refects the history of the place. Fantastic ambience and atmosphere. The hotel is still well located for shops/restaurnats/bars. However, as a regular visitor to Singapore, I would recommend to stay at this hotel only once for the unique experience as there are far cheaper five star hotels with better facilities than Raffles. For example, its sister hotel 'Raffles Plaza' - a modern version providing the same high standards but with fantastic gym and spa etc. Do not go the Long Bar - its a toruist trap. Go to the Billiards Bar for the colonial experience. We ate at the main restaurnat (can't remember the name) and was sorely dissapointed - the food was seriously average and grossly over-priced.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had 3 nights at Raffles, en route between New Zealand and Malaysia. It was a very pleasant stay made particularly enjoyable by the wonderful staff and the old-world charm of the hotel, which has been beautifully restored. It was also well located. We had a courtyard suite which, whilst comfortable and spacious, was very dark as the only windows were from the adjoining dining area onto an outside passageway. It was fine for a brief stay but would have been depressing if we'd stayed longer. Our package included tea (or "Tiffin" as they call it) and their buffet curry, both of which were excellent. Their breakfast was magnificent though, a real experience. Our only gripe was the cost of their laundry service - 13 items costing us over £80! In previous hotels on our trip a similar service would have cost less than half that. Despite this, we really enjoyed our stay and would happily return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got home from a one night stay at the Raffles hotel and I felt compelled to write a review since we had such a wonderful time. Unlike most visitors we actually live in Singapore and have visited the hotel bar when friends come to see us. For over a year I've mentioned to my husband how nice it would be to stay the night... and we did. From the moment we were led to our room until the time we checked out it was 5* service all the way. It really does feel like you have checked into a little slice of history... the rooms are amazing with the ultra high ceilings and old fashioned fixtures. There is 24 hr butler service and will get anything you want. I really enjoyed the pool. I found it was a little oasis inside this busy city. The staff is very attentive without being in your face and everyone is so pleasant. I would definitely recommend staying even one night just for the experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at Raffles for one night in June, the last night of our honeymoon! We weren't sure if it would live up to it's name but it surpassed our expectations! From checking in to checking out we were made to feel so welcome, all the staff have a real passion for the hotel and want you to make the most of your stay. The butlers were fantastic, offering to do everything for us!! They have a great knowledge of the hotel and were full of suggestions of things to go and see in Singapore, they really make your stay very special. Our room, a palm court suite, was well proportioned, full of elegant charm and a pleasure to stay in. If you stay here, make sure to explore the hotel, there are so many lovely areas to see and the butlers kept reminding us that it was our hotel to make use of. This was the perfect end to our honeymoon, a magical stay we are sure to remember for many years.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I love afternoon tea. Everywhere I travel, its a must. But, this last visit to Singapore was a huge disapointment. First of all, since it was the holiday time, I emailed and made the reservation two months in advance. They asked for a credit card guarantee, which I gave them. Next thing I know, they CHARGED my credit card for the tea. Two months in advance? And its not like I was booking an $800 room. Anyway, dutifully, we showed up for tea. It was in the Tiffin Room. It was the coldest experience you could have. The tea was average, the pastries dry and the service way below what one would expect from a First Class Hotel. To top it off, when the bill came, the glass of wine we ordered... $50 a glass. After the most uninspired tea ever, we decided to look around the gardens. They looked dry and boring. We went to the restrooms and the smell was so bad, we left. Absolutely the worst experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staying at this hotel was something that we had wanted to experience since we were very young (we are of the age where Raffles was known as an iconic hotel) and we were not disappointed. The hotel still retains the old colonial charm that you would expect to find and the excellent service levels for which it is famed. The rooms are up to date while still retaining the colonial style with ceiling fans and wooden floors etc. There are often queues for the Long Bar and Tiffin (although I believe residents get preference for tables) and you can sometimes have curious "tourists" looking though the fence at "your" hotel however this can just give you the feeling of celebrity! Prices for rooms and food are quite high however Singapore is an expensive place to stay and eat in general so they are not really out of sync with other hotels. We genearlly had a very enjoyable stay and our room accommodate 4 of us comfortably.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was everything I expected and more. I had booked for the Sunday brunch for one and they had my nice large table ready with a selection of reading material - newspapers, magazines etc. The brunch buffet was very impressive and worth the stay, for example there was a selection of four types of oysters from across the globe. A mark of a great hotel is the response when something goes wrong. My bathroom ceiling sprung a leak. I was swiftly and professionally moved to a larger room. Tip: If you have a flight in the evening you can request a free late checkout until 2:00pm and if you flirt with the concierge you can have it free until 4:00pm beyond that you can leave your luggage and then come back and use the spa to shower and freshen up. Standards are high. The manager of the Long Bar decided that my Singapore Sling was not up to scratch even though I had finished half and had no issue with it, so replaced it with one that was more perfect.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There is very little to add to the comments alreay shown on this website. A few things may sway you however when you decide to book this Hotel. We booked the courtyard suites and felt a bit of an outsider. Despite the hotel being stunning the services exquisite and the food fantastic the room was on the outside of the hotel where a short walk past alot of tourists took you to the main reception and hotel area. This was the part I was a little disappointed with as all the tourist stared at you when you came out of your room and walked down towards the main part of the Hotel. If I booked again I would definately get a suite in the main part of the Hotel. However it was our honeymoon and the treats they gave us whilst we stayed were unbelievable and unmatched elsewhere on our honeymoon. The Royal China restaurant was fantastic but don't miss out on Chilli Crab at Clarke Quay just a few minutes stroll away where the nightlife and restaurants come to life.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a suite deal for 4 nights at the end of our 6 week family holiday to NZ, Australia and Singapore. From the Bentley at the airport when we arrived to the wave off at the front of the hotel when we left, everything about our stay at Raffles was absolutely perfect. Every member of staff was both attentive and willing. Anything we mentioned would be done instantly and with a smile. High levels of training were obvious, as the staff knew exactly how to look after us and our 4 and 2 year old children, who are going through that difficult to handle stage. We made good use of most of the hotels facilities and services and couldn't fault any of them. We checked out at 12 noon on the day we left, but weren't being picked up by Emirates until 11pm. The staff continued to look after us throughout the evening, despite no longer being resident there. We are planning to return there in July next year for our wedding anniversary - without the children this time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is simply the best hotel that I have ever stayed at. My wife and I stayed here for 1 night of our honeymoon. We had stayed elsewhere in Singapore for 2 nights then came here the night before flying to Bali. I just wish we had done 2 nights. We stayed in the Charlie Chaplin suite (personality suite) and the room just took our breath away! Stylish, high-tech and colonial all mixed together. Our butler (Bong) arranged a big surprise for us in our room upon returning from a night out. This consisted of rose petal strewn floors, a bubble bath already ran and topped up with hot water until our arrival back at the room, strawberries dipped in chocolate etc. It was a fantastic....and unnecessary extra which just personified the general customer service of the place! When you see the prices initially you will gasp, but trust me it is worth it! It is not often that you will ever be treated like this! I cannot wait to go back to Singapore.....and Raffles particularly!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had wanted to stay at this hotel since visiting Singapore 10 years ago. We were to stay for 6 nights. Reception was very smooth and we finished registration in out suite which was large and pleasant overlooking palms etc. Going to breakfast the next day was quite a surprise. My wife was very upset to find tea served in a coffee pot and stewed. It was difficult to get anyone to take our breakfast order and this then took 20 minutes to come despite very few guests and many chefs. Not impressive. We booked to go to Doc Cheng for Valentine's dinner. The meal was very good but was extremely expensive - more so than anywhere I have eaten world wide !! Needless to say we did not eat there again. We were booked for afternoon tea in the Tiffin room and this was much better as there were three times the service than for breakfast, and this also applied to Dinner there. Regarding the tea my wife had to complain to the head waiter to eventually get proper tea in a china pot, albeit a coffee pot !!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for three nights before moving on to Bali as part of our 10th wedding anniversary celebration. Raffles is very traditional and colonial, but we couldn't help but feel like we were outsiders and not guests. Each time we entered the lobby we were challenged by the staff as we must have been viewed as carpet treading tourists looking to get good photos of inside the hotel. The hotel complex is part of the tourist trail in Singapore with all the associated shops, bars and restaurants, and is therefore busy at most times of the day. Hence we avoided eating or drinking anywhere in the hotel. The room was very colonially decorated to the point where the bathroom looked unclean and possibly in need of an update. We stayed at the Shangri-La at the top end of Orchard Road on our way back through Singapore for one night and found it leagues ahead of Raffles in all aspects of service and it was much cheaper too. If you want an air of stuffy colonial grace then go to Raffles and empty your pockets, if you don't go to the Shangri-La.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at noon having travelled from London via KL and received a warm welcome. Our Palm Court suite was ready and we were shown round it by our butler. Having stayed at Raffles Phnom Penh we knew we wouldn't be disappointed. The room looked into a grassy courtyard and it was only a few minutes to the main lobby. Main highlights were taking afternoon high tea on the 2nd floor (quieter position) - served by Joshua, who also added some delicious Dim Sum to the spread. A visit to the busy Long Bar but as residents we were seated in a quieter spot. Honourable mentions go to Rasty in the pool bar, Marco in the Empire Bar and finally Andrew the concierge whose advice and organisation was exemplary. The breakfast choices were superb. Although having a butler was good I felt that calling him/her to make a cup of tea each time we wanted one was one luxury I would happily forego. At times the calling system was a little tempramental and it would have been quicker to make our own if facilities were available in the suites. Having said that our stay was thoroughly enjoyable.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Similar to another reviewer (Brian B.), we headed for the Long Bar with some anticipation, already savouring the experience of a properly constructed and served Sling in the hallowed shrine of the eponymous cocktail. Having done the same thing more than 20 years' previously, there was perhaps an unfair weight of nostalgia, but the drink that we were served was little better than the canned variety available on Singapore Airlines. Ready-made jugs lined the bar, ready to be poured into the legion of glasses adorned with pineapple and glace cherry. All might have been forgiven had one been charged a price reflective of the experience, but 30 eye-watering dollars is double the price that I had paid the previous night for the genuine article personally prepared and served in a perfectly reasonable bar elsewhere on the island. The only mitigation? One is still allowed to eat peanuts and toss the shells on the floor, although I wonder how long this nod to tradition will be allowed to remain. We stayed for about 10 minutes and then headed, disconsolate, into the sultry heat of a Singapore evening.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We only stayed here for one night in March 2011. Difficult to make a real review on such a short stay. Rooms were just fantastic with a plethora of character. Superb. Lobby and the greeting was exceptional with a real old colonial feel to the experience and, of course, the decor has been superbly renovated to the original glory days. I stayed here in the eighties and it was pretty much run down then so great to see it back where it belongs. One downside to this is that the hotel no longer has the open outlooks it once enjoyed and is now surrounded by modern buildings etc. We had a complimentary free Singapore Sling and although very nice was bettered by the same in Sala Samui [see other review]. The food was excellent as was the breakfast. We didn't do much sight seeing when here but we took a walk to the old Bugis Street and this is now a Mall but still brought all these great memories back. If you like only contemporary, this may not be the place. If you like Classic Chic, this place hits the nail right on the head. This Hotel stands out from all the others. If you have been to the Burge Al Arab in Dubai - This is better.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We transferred to Raffles after a problem at Raffles The Plaza and spent two nights here in late May. Staying here is a classy colonial experience and we had a truly wonderful time. I'm ashamed to say that, other than a quick 2 hour private tour of the city, we barely left the hotel as it was so fantastic and there was so much to do. The hotel has a lot of facilities and shops and, if you're staying here, make sure you plan in enough time to experience it all. The Long Bar has a great atmosphere and the bakery is good for a quick lunch if you want to avoid the formal restaurants. High Tea in the Billiard Room is much better than Tiffin in the main restaurant (this seems to be aimed at tourists who are not staying at the hotel). Only residents of the hotel are able to access certain areas and the staff keep a watchful eye out to ensure this policy is respected.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We made a mistake staying here. It is a lovely old building and first impressions are great. However, it quickly becomes clear that the quality of the product doesn't live up to the history or architecture. The staff are friendly but the rooms are old fashioned with obvious problems. The mini bar is thinly stocked, several of the power sockets were not functioning and some of the amenity kits were empty. However the real issue is the dining. Singapore trades heavily on its reputation for great dining and Raffles in particular is fond of quoting Rudyard Kipling ' When in Singapore, feed at Raffles'. Not anymore! The food is overpriced and very very average considering the high prices. The breakfast (at a cost of about US$75 for two) consists almost entirely of eggs and not much more. My husband can't eat eggs so we ended up paying this for essentially a cup of tea and a cold piece of toast. Dinner at The Tiffin was equally disappointing. Approx US$150 for two for a very average, lukewarm curry buffet. We were in and out in 20 minutes. Back home you wouldn't expect to pay more than US$20 for what we ate. This hotel is clearly trading on its heritage and needs to improve its offering.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Raffles Honeymoon”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I had a memorable stay during at Raffles during the first leg of our honeymoon in Singapore. The staff was very courteous and provided us with coffee and a temporary room to sleep in when we arrived very early in the morning after a flight from London. We loved Raffles for the atmospheric colonial feel. The hotel never felt busy, and we did not often run across other guests near our room. Room service breakfast was a real treat on the verandah, and the juices were amazing. We had the Indian buffet in the Tiffin Room, and my husband was in heaven. Service in all the restaurants was wonderful. We did ask to change rooms after hearing the music from the courtyard, but the hotel organized this fairly efficiently. The suites themselves are large and lovely with oversized tile bathtubs and beautiful hardwood. The gym and pool are small but very nice, and the atmosphere of Raffles more than makes up for what it lack in amenities. There are newer, slicker hotels than Raffles in Singapore but none that quite match its charm. It was my favorite hotel of the trip (though my husband preferred the more modern Peninsula in Bangkok). Raffles is a great choice for a first-class stay in Singapore if you want to experience colonial charm and a bit of history.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Raffles lived up to its expectations. We only had one night there on our way from Sydney to London but it was a great stay. We arrived an hour prior to check in and the room wasn't ready but no problem, we were given a free drink (we opted for Singapore Slings) in the bar until 15 minutes later were were told the room was ready. The Garden Wing Suite was great, spacious, very well equiped and plush in an old world style. The personal butler whose services come as part of the package was charming and nothing was too much trouble. Like everyone, we had another Singapore Sling in the Long Bar and threw our monkey nut kernels on the floor! Breakfast was very good, not exceptional but a wide variety, enough to please everyone. The thing where Raffles scores is with the staff. Every staff member we encountered was a delight and couldn't do enough to help us. We were, unfortunately, caught up in the Icelandic Volcano air disruption fiasco and again, the young lady at Concierge was charm and support personified. She tried endlessly to get us another hotel, succeeding when all of Singapore seemed to be sold out for an influx of 20,000 delegates attending a food fair or the like. All in all, Raffles was great, not the cheapest option but certainly one to be experienced!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">this was my second stay at Raffles, and this time i brought my husband as we were celebration our second wedding anniversary as well as a well earned retail experience. it is truly like stepping back in time and the service was faultless in all areas - in particularly when a cake was delivered to our table during dinner to celebrate our anniversary. Although 'classic' is not the type of hotel we would normally choose to stay in, we were not disappointed. The only gripes i would have would be the maintenance in the rooms - although i am sure the building will be listed leaking shower doors, sink traps held with black insulating tape and obviously broken door closures is not what you expect to find. However, saying that cleanliness was good and the butler delivering my coffee every morning at 0530hrs during our stay so i could work was welcome. My husband loved the Spa, but unfortunatly my experience was not as good or anywhere near the standard i would have expected. Shopping - Tiffany is just downstairs and the Raffles shop is great for little momentos. We ate/drank in many of the restaurants and found them to be good including the cocktails. Would i go back - yes, but perhaps again for a special occassion rather than a short vacation. overall well done and thanks for a memorable stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Only stayed here for 2 nights, but I wish it could of been longer. After days touring Singapore in the humidity walking into the hotel was like a Colonial Oasis. I loved the hotel it has such character and charm. Our rooms were large with such high ceilings and we had a huge terrace overlooking the lovely courtyard. Our Butlers Adie & another guy who's name I can't remember, were fantastic and even escorted us around the hotel when we couldn't find places. The Indian buffet in the Tiffin Room was exquisite, I've never tasted anything like it. There is something about the hotel that when you walk through the courtyards & past the fountains etc you can't help but imagine what it used to be like when it first opened over 100 years ago. The pool is also really cute and the pool attendants are waiter are very attentive coming around with fruit kebabs, blueberry smoothies, and water throughout the day. The only downside was the restaurant we chose one night for dinner Royal China, was very disappointing. It was nothing like the standard of the Royal China in England and it was empty, A local we were with says the Red Cherry in the Mandarin Oriental hotel is the best around if you are looking for chinese food. However the hotel is probably one of the best I have stayed in and only wish I could've stayed a little longer.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We held our wedding at the Raffles Hotel and paid for a night's stay in the courtyard suite. We had high expectations of the hotel as it was ranked as a 5* hotel and had very good reviews all round. The hotel itself was charming and had the old world charm. The rooms however told another story altogether. Whilst the rooms achieved the vintage look and might be charming for someone into old world charm, however the room was generally tired looking and most of the furniture looked worn out. The bathtub was leaking and the one time we took a bath, there was a steady spray of water from the tub onto the floor resulting in the bathroom being flooded. To their credit, this was quickly rectified when I phoned for the butler who came swiftly with a whole bunch of towels to soak up the mess. Some of the switches in the room didn't work, and neither did the refrigerator and we gave up after a while. Also, the tv was still the boxy kind you'll find in motels nowadays - flatscreen tvs are a norm these days in 5* hotels. Positives: loved the fluffy bathrobes - very luxurious. Also, The of their breakfast was one of the best we've tried amongst 5* hotels. The juices were divine and the selections were pretty decent too. Overrall, a decent charming hotel but for the price we paid, we would have preferred staying at the Ritz or the Mandarin Oriental.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Raffles cheating with beer”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is absolutely fantastic and the job done in restoring it back to it's heyday's splendor are unparallel. We have been visiting the hotel every second year after 2002 and really like it. During our recent trip in June 2009, however, we were shocked to see staff blatantly cheating with beer. We were siting in the Courtyard bar and ordered a Tiger beer from the tap. The barman looked at us and seeing us watching him poured a normal beer from the tap. Then, however, somebody siting at the tables at the Courtyard ordered a jug. In front of our eyes the barman then took one-quarter-full jug from the refigerator (somebody had obviously not finished his previously), added some beer from tap, then quite a lot of water and send it to the table. And that all in front of the eyes of the people siting at the bar! After a while there was another request from the tables. Barman took a jug, poured some beer from tap, then some water then a bit more beer and then another part of water and sent it away. We were absolutely dismayed. That seems to be regular practice there and it is obviously encouraged by the management. I have never seen it before in my life in any other 5 star hotels. To charge 18 SGD for a small beer and then mix it with water - it is just unbelievable. Needless to say, we shall not have another drink in this establishment. Everybody be aware !!! KG</p></li>

<li>During our recent trip in June 2009, however, we were shocked to see staff blatantly cheating with beer.</br></br></li>
<li>We were siting in the Courtyard bar and ordered a Tiger beer from the tap.</br></br></li>
<li>The barman looked at us and seeing us watching him poured a normal beer from the tap.</br></br></li>
<li>Then, however, somebody siting at the tables at the Courtyard ordered a jug.</br></br></li>
<li>In front of our eyes the barman then took one-quarter-full jug from the refigerator (somebody had obviously not finished his previously), added some beer from tap, then quite a lot of water and send it to the table.</br></br></li>

<li>After a while there was another request from the tables.</br></br></li>

<li>To charge 18 SGD for a small beer and then mix it with water - it is just unbelievable.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I guess it depends on what you are looking for. This is a historic property that was last renovated about 20 years ago. Since we often stay in modern hotels, we sometimes seek an alternative, such as an "original" historic property. We were not disappointed about the historic nature of this hotel. It was easy to walk around and imagine what life was like in this oasis in the middle of a bustling colonial Asian city. The room itself was laid out and furnished as it likely existed when some budding writer or journalist stayed there 100 years ago. The restaurants are very pricey, but excellent, with one of the best breakfasts we have experienced anywhere...simple, but very fresh and offering just enough variety of choices. And the service is superior. However, I think we would not return to this hotel. Knobs on the sink and the shower came off when used. The bathroom tile is stained (dirty, mildewy grout). The TV appears to date from the last renovation 20 years ago. Electrical and audio control equipment is ancient. The majority of the rooms in the original hotel have been rented out as shops, creating tremendous amounts of non guest foot traffic in the common areas. This last issue is likely necessary for the hotel to retain economic viability, but it is fatal from our perspective. It has caused what should be a quiet oasis to become a busy tourist shopping mall.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I can't imagine that this "iconic" hotel of Singapore has been rated so highly. Either I was staying at a similarly named hotel in an alternative universe or some of the raters here have not seen better hotels. For starters, the hotel is rather run down with the last renovation probably done eons ago and that sort of affected the feel of the room. While the rooms are large for a hotel, i would hardly call the small corridor before the bedroom a "living room" - my toilet at home is at least 2x the size of the living room. Many other raters have complimented the hotel on the service but all i received was rather plastic fake smile service. You could just sense the underlying contempt, disdain, disinterest, etc. underneath that well practiced smile (ever notice the eyes make a difference?). It was also frightfully slow, it almost felt like we were back to victorian days where aging male servants ambled to fetch hot water. Management was hardly better but I will leave it for another time. I am rather harsh with my critique I know but this is one of the most expensive hotels in Singapore and not a common run of the mill one. I would have taken this level of quality at another 3/4 stars hotel easily. I travel nearly 200 days a year and have stayed at some top hotels around the world. Raffles Hotel certainly is certainly all fluff when it comes to living up to its reputation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Raffles is the nicest place I've ever stayed. The service was great! The room was luxurious and beautiful. We arrived early and were greeted pleasantly. Our only intention was to have them lock our luggage away while we did some exploring as we were staying there after a cruise. However, about the time we checked in my husband realized he'd left his cell phone at security coming off the ship into Singapore. The concierge assisted him by calling to check on it. He gave my husband the name of the person to go see at the port and apologized that they could not send someone to get it for him. But, he explained that my husband would have to identify it and then put him in a cab. While he was gone, the manager took my daughter and me up to the pool area to relax and wait for his return. We were served a lovely refreshment "on the house" while we were waiting. After perhaps an hour, the manager returned with my husband showing him where we were. He then informed us our room was ready and escorted us to it. It was the cleanest hotel room I have even seen. Also, it was super comfortable. We enjoyed every minute. We also went to the bar that night to have a Singapore Sling and have a snack. It was expensive but in our opinion well worth it. I can't say enough about Raffles. While we felt that we were splurging to stay there, we all agree if we are back in Singapore we will go back and stay longer.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We decided to stay at Raffles for a week as a way of resting after a particularly busy year work-wise. I had always wanted to stay there and the only thought that troubled me was whether it would live up to expectations. Well, it did ... it exceeded them. The hotel itself is beautifully clean and airy and the staff couldn't do enough for us. Our Butler was unbelievably helpful and always let us know when he went off duty and what the temporary Butler's name was. The room, Palm Court Suite, was more like an apartment. Unlike other reviews our room was always serviced whilst we were at Breakfast and everything was fresh every day. Even the turn-down service was completed when we were out. The breakfast at the Tiffin Room was staggering!! There were two egg chefs and one Asian chef so the choice of hot food was wonderful. Do make sure that you try the Asian menu ... it is second to none. We dinned at the Tiffin Room (the Curry Buffet) and the Billiard Room (the International Buffet) and both far exceeded what we were expecting. The flavors and appearance of all of the dishes were beautiful and the service was friendly but efficient. All in all, Raffles completely EXCEEDED what we were expecting and provides us with the most relaxing week of our lives. We intend to go back again this year and would advise everyone to stay at Raffles if they get the chance. If you are in Singapore then eat AND stay at Raffles!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After 4 days on the Eastern and Oriental travelling down from Bangkok we were used to exceptional service levels - Raffles met that standard. I really love this place. The staff are perfect - the rooms large with exceptional bed linen and even a pillow menu and the whole ambience sophisticated with beautiful flower arrangements and historic furniture. The rooms are large with high ceilings leading into a twin basin bath room which in turn leads on into the bath and shower room. There is no scrimping on space or anything else for that matter. Luxurious bath robes, fluffy towels, fruit, water and a butler that solves any unexpected problem that might occur. On the first night we ate in the seafood restaurant in the courtyard. It was very warm and the menu is a little limited but the food itself was delicious even if expensive. Most evenings we spent in the Long Bar – they do a variety of Singapore Slings my favourite being the Winter version with a vanilla content which I preferred to the red ones. The Band was great with the lead singer being a Tina Turner/ Amy Winehouse cross. Opening their second set with Baker Street showed how talented the Sax player was and guitar easily coped with the slow version of Layla. On leaving our pick up was messed up. Reception was great in trying to sort it all out as they had been in suggesting things to do. Life is too short to go back to many places but not long enough to return to Raffles too often. Perfect</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In 2002 I had high tea in the Raffles Hotel with my daughter, which, as far as I can remember, was in the Bar & Billiard room at that time, and one did not have to walk through the hotel's main entrance. On our way to Australia in September, we stopped in Singapore, this time with my husband. I wanted to show him where I stayed with my parents in the 1950s as a child. In 2002 we were allowed to look in the entrance hall but the taking of photographs was not allowed for some reason. It is an attractive hall area but I didn't think it was that special. This time we weren't even allowed to walk in to the entrance hall at all even though the venue of the high tea has changed to the Tiffin room, which is in the main building; in order to get to it one now has to walk through the main entrance. I was considering booking high tea but the doormen and other staff refused to let me in at all so I decided not to bother. In fact, after we were not allowed in, I realised that one can look through the windows round the side of the hotel into the Tiffin room. It didn't look as nice as the Bar and Billiard room and, judging from some of the reviews of the Tiffin Room on TripAdviser regarding quality and price, I think we made the right decision . From a review I read, it seems that the hotel is under new management with new rules. I was actually thinking of staying in the Raffles Hotel on our way to Singapore but the rooms only accommodate two people and we had our daughter with us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel during a recent business trip and loved it! The hotel takes up an entire city block and consists of living quarters, a shopping arcade, and several restaurants. There are at least three gorgeous courtyarts with beautiful fountains and ample greenery. The decor is Colonial. My suite was very large, with the highest ceilings I've ever seen in a room, and a good size bathroom with a deep soaking tub. The furniture and decor (drapes, paintings, carpets) all transport you into another time. The staff (including a 24-hour butler service) were amazing and always willing to accommodate special requests, including altering dishes to, e.g., make them vegetarian or substitute ingredients. The pool is not large, but very picturesque and relaxing. The gym, likewise not large, was never crowded and was well-stocked with cold towels, water, and fruit. I did not try the spa (it was fully booked during the only afternoon I was free) - the spa lockers did not seem particularly luxurious and the steam room didn't seem to work. The only dining option I tried was the Empire Cafe. Their dim sum were great, and don't miss their young coconut drink and desserts! I also tried the famous Singapore Sling at the Long Bar and enjoyed it. The location is very convenient to all the major attractions and to the financial center. The shopping is quite good as well - the Raffles Store has many interesting souvenirs. I had a wonderful experience and cannot recommend this hotel highly enough</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Though I am a thorough bred Singaporean, I never thought of visiting this grand hotel until now. Having lived abroad for over 2 decades, I hear many of my foreign friends speak highly of it and they wonder why I never set foot there. So finally I did in the last weekend of august. Wish I had been there earlier. Stayed in a suite with my husband. Of course everything there is rather new but furnished like the British colonial era. Will go back and stay again. Yes, it is really a place filled with history, opulence, regal. Service - absolutely excellent. Honestly I have nothing ill to speak about Raffles. Oh please visit the Raffles shop . Buy the book written by the historian of Raffles Hotel - Mr Danker. It will make your stay more meaningful and can walk through history as you explore the grounds of the hotel. Visit Long Bar too. There's is something magical about the Singapore Sling there - the original. One downside but an interesting one. As the floors are wooden, you can hear walking noises from the floor above your suite. So what, that's how guests lived with during the late 1880s and early 1900s. They have lifts but somehow you are drawn into re-living history by taking the stairs. You can spend the whole day exploring the hotel grounds and not get tired of it. So much history in it. Seah Street Deli - food and ambience is only so so. Breakfast spread at Tiffin could be better. Dinner and lunch at Tiffin room is good if you like Indian food. Tiffin room makes you reflect on those plantation days of Singapore and Malaysia</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A warm welcome with staff rushing to help with our suitcases. No lengthy form filling just a signiture and we were whisked to our suite (no mere rooms here) by Dave who was very informative - a credit to the hotel. What a suite is was too - we could have lived there for ever. A huge bedroom, small lounge & dinning area and a generous bathroom with double sink. Everything looked traditional, in keeping with the hotel`s history but it was all in excellent condition and worked well. We had suite 103 with a garden view. The room had everything we needed and I didn`t have to ask for extra anything. All the staff were polite and geeted you by name in the restaurant, nothing was too much trouble and they were very attentive. True 5 star plus service. The location of the hotel is good with everything just a walk or quick & cheap taxi ride away. Breakfast was amazing with good quality food and service - if I had to moan or rather comment on anything it would be that hot food arrived before we had completed our fruit, maybe they were a little too eager. The hotel has a fab swimming pool on floor 3 but alas we were too busy to use it. Afternoon tea at approx £25.00 per person is not cheap but the experience and quality are well worth it - if only they would have left the teapot on the table to save us having to ask for refills each time. The ambience and polite genuine service makes this probably the best hotel we have stayed in, maybe even beating the Peninsula in HK. We will definitely be staying at Raffles Hotel when we are in Singapore again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I recently stayed at Raffles in Singapore in a Palm Court room. What an experience! This place is truly amazing and lives up to its reputation as one of the finest hotels in the world. It's certainly among the best we have ever stayed in anywhere. From the moment you arrive you are made to feel at ease by your personal butler and the welcome Singapore Sling on the verandah outside your room sets you up for your stay. The ambience of the hotel is superb and you get the sense of the history of the place as soon as you enter. The rooms are spacious with a separate dining area, dressing room and bathroom/toilet off the main bedroom and the furnishings are in keeping with the period decoration of the entire hotel. We had arranged to stay over the weekend particularly so we could attend the Sunday Champagne brunch in the Bar & Billiard Room and we were not disappointed. Would recommend this experience to anyone, but make sure you book ahead. The magnificent selection of the finest foods accompanied by fleeflow Billecart champagne is an absolute highlight. We had previously enjoyed the brunch a couple of years ago during an earlier stay in Singapore and the standard has certainly been maintained. Another highlight is the daily breakfast in the hotel, which is as good or not better than any other we've seen. A magnificent buffet selection of fine foods supplemented by extensive a-la-carte offerings as well. This hotel is truly a jewel, it does not come cheap, however if you have the opportunity it warrants a stay at least once in your lifetime.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had a wonderful 4 nights stay at the Raffles Hotel. The location was perfect, within walking distance of everything. The service was personal and courteous, including personalised butler service, where no wish remains unnoticed. The ambiance of the hotel is calm, elegant and cosy. You feel welcome, as you were in your own home. Privacy is of utmost importance and unless you need anything, no one will bother you in the slightest way. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. My suite (#228 Courtyard Suite) was right underneath the pool, where one could hear a bit of water filter noise coming through the ceiling, but no drama really. The only thing missing in the suites were tea and coffee maker facilities. Asking why there are none, I was told that the hotel prefers to make tea and coffee as a presentation and serve in your room or veranda, instead of making it yourself, well fair enough, but how about if I get up at 3am and feel like a tea? Do I need to wait for the butler to come and serve it 20mins later and what if I want more tea after...I really prefer to have free coffee and tea maker facilities in-room as in almost every hotel on the planet and have the option to have it served when needed. Otherwise really nothing major to complain about. LCD Tv's would be nice in the cabinets, instead of the 80's style tubes, wireless internet jumps in and out, not convenient for conference calls, wired internet in rooms would be much better. All-in-all I had a very pleasant stay and I will be back for sure. Thank you Raffles Staff for making this Christmas visit a life-long memory.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived in Singapore off the P&O cruise ship Aurora and booked for six of us to have lunch at Raffles Grill. It was a lovely setting and the staff were very courteous. Two of our party had a starter and all six ordered their signature meal - Welsh shoulder of lamb that had been slow cooked for 36 hours. We also ordered a bottle of White and red wine together with some water. When the lamb arrived only three of the meals were edible - three cooked perfectly and three raw and running with blood. We complained to the staff that three of the meals were impossible to eat. After some 5 minutes the executive chef came to see us and he spent 10 minutes explaining how his meal was cooked. We asked why three meals were perfect and three were not. He just shrugged his shoulders and said "it happens like that sometimes". I fail to understand why a meal which has been cooking for a day and a half can be raw in the middle but the chef was adamant there was nothing wrong with it. He offered us an alternative meal but our companions had finished their meal by then and we felt that the moment had passed. He then offered us desserts as complementary and we accepted the desserts as we were by then quite hungry. Finally we had coffee and chocolates. So all in all we had two starters and six bread rolls, two bottles of wine and four bottles of water, three lamb meals, six desserts, five coffees and some chocolates. The bill came to almost £750 between three couples. One couple had no main course as they were two of the three uncooked meals but it cost them just under £250 for what we considered a disastrous meal out.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have a home in Singapore, so for many years I never had to use a hotel in the city. However, when running a conference last year, I decided to join the VIP guests and try it out. I remember Raffles when it was a charmingly-tatty old place, with staff that may well have been recruited by the Sarkies, when they built the joint. When it was 'renovated' I sidelined it as even a place to recommend to friends, on the grounds that it looked like a well-disguised shopping centre with rooms. I WAS TOTALLY WRONG. This may be the best hotel in the world. If you want a taste of 'colonial' living, with none of the obsequiousness that the word suggests, you simply have to go here. Even if you don't particularly like Singapore, go here. Before you die, fellow trippers, go here. If you want super-trendy, stay away. If you want up-to-the-moment decor, stay away. If you want a cool pool-scene, and an in-house disco, give it a miss. There's absolutely no point in going into details beyond that. The amazing staff and the look and feel of the place are unique. There's nowhere else on earth I prefer...with the possible exception of Singita or Londolozi in S.Africa, but then the criteria are different there. Here's the kicker: my much-travelled son is ten, and it's HIS favourite place in the world as well. Some of the bars and restaurants are better than others, and none of them is The Best Place in Town...but Singapore is full of brilliant food and booze, so who cares? Raffles has the knack of making you feel like the only guest in the place, or at least the most important. I'm seriously thinking about selling my house, and moving in here.</p></li>

<li>However, when running a conference last year, I decided to join the VIP guests and try it out.</br></br></li>
<li>I remember Raffles when it was a charmingly-tatty old place, with staff that may well have been recruited by the Sarkies, when they built the joint.</br></br></li>
<li>When it was 'renovated' I sidelined it as even a place to recommend to friends, on the grounds that it looked like a well-disguised shopping centre with rooms.</br></br></li>
<li>I WAS <span style="background-color:#f032e6">TOTALLY</span> <span style="background-color:#f032e6">WRONG</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>This may be the best hotel in the world.</br></br></li>
<li>If you want a taste of 'colonial' living, with none of the obsequiousness that the word suggests, you simply have to go here.</br></br></li>
<li>Even if you don't particularly like Singapore, go here.</br></br></li>
<li>Before you die, fellow trippers, go here.</br></br></li>
<li>If you want super-trendy, stay away.</br></br></li>
<li>If you want up-to-the-moment decor, stay away.</br></br></li>
<li>If you want a <span style="background-color:#fffac8">cool</span> <span style="background-color:#fffac8">pool</span>-scene, and an in-house disco, give it a miss.</br></br></li>
<li>There's absolutely no point in going into details beyond that.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#911eb4">amazing</span> <span style="background-color:#911eb4">staff</span> and the look and feel of the place are unique.</li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#f032e6">amazing</span> staff and the look and feel of the <span style="background-color:#f032e6">place</span> are unique.</br></br></li>
<li>There's nowhere else on earth I prefer...with the possible exception of Singita or Londolozi in S.Africa, but then the criteria are different there.</br></br></li>
<li>Here's the kicker: my much-travelled son is ten, and it's HIS favourite place in the world as well.</br></br></li>
<li>Some of the bars and restaurants are better than others, and none of them is The Best Place in Town...but Singapore is full of <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">brilliant</span> <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">food</span> and booze, so who cares?</br></br></li>
<li>Raffles has the knack of making you feel like the only guest in the place, or at least the most important.</br></br></li>
<li>I'm seriously thinking about selling my house, and moving in here.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This historic hotel was completely refurbished in 1991 and the property is kept in immaculate condition. It has retained considerable charm and history (I could almost see a member of the Raj behind every pillar!). The service is outstanding - and many staff are able to address you by name when they see you around the hotel. They are extremely polite and courteous and very helpful. The hotel is expensive, but well worth it. Every suite (all rooms are suites) has fresh flowers and the fruit bowl is kept full throughout the day. The suites a very large (each with with its own parlour), ample products in the bathroom, very deep bath, and one of the few hotels where the bath robes are changed every day. Each suite has a Butler who is very helpful and prompt in appearing when called. The service at the Tiffin Room is extraordinarily good with enough staff to be able to attend to your every need without being too intrusive. (Such as being there to seat you each time you return to your table and to replace your napkin). There was one and only one negative and that was the regular pianist who played a grand piano in the lobby each night. His choice of music was not in keeping with the place and rather too virtuosic - the Sunday night pianist was excellent with peaceful background music which suited the ambiance of the hotel in general. There is an excellent pool (on the 3rd level) and spa. The main door is constantly manned and usually only guests of the hotel are allowed into the lobby area. All private areas of the hotel are accessed by guest key. It is truely a very relaxing and private experience - with outstanding "everything"!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Raffles is an experience to stay at, the staff are lovely and the food is amazing. It does come for a price as you're really paying for the name of the hotel. The entrance is so grand when you pull up and the doormen are so friendly. The rooms are massive, furnished in an older style and the hotel is massive with a pool hidden away on the roof by the spa and gym. The buffet breakfast is served in the Tiffin Room and there is so much to choose from, not to mention what you can order from the menu. They also have the best fresh orange juice I've ever had. There are at least 6 different restaurants within the grounds to eat at so there is plenty of choice. People in these reviews seem to complain alot about being stopped by the people on the front doors, if you're nice to them and spare time to chat to them they'll get to know you and it's fine to wander in and out. They have to ask people as they walk in because of the hotels history and status there'd be so many people wandering around inside getting in the way of everything if they didn't stop people. The staff are brilliant and so helpful when it comes to finding places to eat, shop and to get directions to places. The rooms haven't got the highest standards of luxurious fittings and decor that people seem to expect, I think mainly because of when it was built and it's styled to reflect those times. We as a family love the place and the staff we get to know always remember us when we've returned a year later. I have to mention the man who plays the piano in the hotel lobby is a legend, he usually wears amazing velvety pjamamas and bright slippers while providing the evening tunes.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fearing the worst after reading an "average" review from a dissatisfied TripAdvisor member, we ventured to the Raffles Hotel expecting a tired, over-rated hotel with dodgy toilets and cheap toiletries. Instead, we were welcomed with warmth, personally shown to our Raffles Inc. suite and a complimentary round of cocktails brought to our room. After spending most of the day in a plane, we felt right at home. The suite was in a 1920 wing, colonial in style, with timber floors comprising 4 rooms - entrance, bedroom, parlour and bathroom. It was not only spacious, but tastefully appointed with a combination of antiques and modern reproductions. Seating was comfortable and multiple period pieces of Chinese objet d'art placed around the room. Whilst in no way gaudy, compared with staying in all-too-common 5 star modern hotel rooms with plain furnishings, carpeting, glass and marble, the Raffles felt like staying at a home. The butler service was effectively similar to having a personal assistant to organise activities, laundry etc. They even offered to make coffee on our espresso machine in the suite for us. They remembered my name every time we met and so did the staff in the food outlets which were plentiful and varied from inexpensive to over-the-top. The bathroom was well appointed with very nice products from the Amrita Spa that is based near the lovely pool and spa area. On top of room tariff, almost everything else is at additional cost at the Raffles, including ironing, for they won't provide one - citing fire hazard. The Mercedes taxi was a fine way to return to the airport; the Bentley will cost a bundle if you want the luxury. Overall, an excellent stay - it transformed my ho-hum Singapore stay into a very relaxing and luxuriously homely one.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Absolutely amazing hotel! You must stay here once in your life!!! Having spent many nights in the best hotels in the world I have to say that this is easily now in my top three. My wife and I spent our honeymoon here recently and were treated like royalty from the minute we arrived until the minute we departed for the airport in the hotel's very own Bentley Continental The food options at the hotel are vast and varied from a funky american style diner to more exclusive jacket and tie fare. Charmingly old and traditional the hotel really has a warmth about it and the staff are extremely attentive and proffesional The Queen recently stayed there and we had the pleasure of meeting the guest services manager called Terrance (he served the Queen personally when she was in residence) who made our stay that little more special after we requested a few little tweaks to the stay, including the Bentley back to the airport (you simply have to do this if you want to arrive their in comfort) The city itself is amazing but we found ourselves spending most of the time in the vast grounds of the hotel and drinking Singapore Slings long into the afternoon in the long bar surrounded by monkey nut shells (we all have a bit of tourist in us don't we?) The rooms were spacious and the beds extremely comfortable. Each room has its own bellboy who arrives in seconds of the push of a button. We rarely used him but when we needed to the service was world class. Nothing wasan issue for any of the staff. Prices are extremely reasonable compared with the UK's top hotels, but then you don't come to Raffles to have a cheap meal and a three pound bottle of red wine. All in all an amazing experience, we have some pictures and more information should you want them so feel free to email johnny@alphamen.co.uk placing 'Raffles' in the subject line</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here as the first part of our honeymoon and had a fabulous time. The staff were extremely attentive and after less than a day the staff were welcoming us by name and the barman in the lobby bar was asking us if we wanted our usual (we had only been once before so we were really impressed that he remembered!)! We ate in a number of the restaurants including the Tiffin Room ( we ate breakfast, Tiffin and afternoon tea there), Doc Chengs (we were ate there on Chinese New Year and the staff even found out for us what time the fireworks started down at the esplanade) and the French restaurant. The Courtyard Bar was also a lovely area for an early evening drink (especially when it was raining and you could shelter under the bar's canopy!) On each occasion we found the service to be very friendly, attentive and professional. The food was excellent in all and there was a wide range to suit all tastes. Our butlers were extremely nice and helpful and the littlest thing was no effort for them. On our last night they even surprised us when we went back to our room to find that they had scattered rose petals around the room, filled it with scented candles and given us a bottle of chilled champagne, chocolates and fresh chocolate covered strawberries. The room was beautiful and well maintained, as were the public areas of the hotel generally and there were plenty of nooks and crannies for a quiet sit-down with a good book. Small touches such as fresh fruit/ flowers in the room everyday really highlighted the personal service. The pool area was a pleasant surprise and was a great place to chill out in the heat of the afternoon before heading out for the evening. The best time of day to enjoy the hotel is in the evening once all the tourists have gone and it is then that you can really start to appreciate what the hotel has to offer. We enjoyed every minute of our stay there and would definitely return if we have the opportunity to do so.</p></li>
