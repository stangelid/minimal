<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel staff was not very friendly and didn't tell us we had to "reserve" a spot on the shuttle and the shuttle driver said he would not go to SeaWorld?... Rooms very basic, loved the king size bed, but it stank pretty bad when we came in. Overall Just like the title. I wouldn't spend over $100 a night here.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great value: Free breakfast, free WiFi, free shuttle and even free parking. Many hotels in San Diego charge for parking. The staff were really helpful when our teenage son managed to lock himself out of our room. We also enjoyed the bagel breakfast by the pool, which is at the far end of the hotel from the Interstate and so pretty quiet. Clean room and well laid out. We stayed two nights and we'll be back.</p></li>

We did not use the on-site restaurant, but enjoyed the heated pool--it was surrounded by tropical foliage and a hill which made it seem very private. Beds were very comfortable. Loved the palm trees surrounding the property. We had a rental car, but the trolley does stop right in front of the hotel. Close to a top-notch mall and many restaurants.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel with my daughter and everything it was great! The room was clean and everything we needed. We had some pounding up above one afternoon but we called the front desk and they offered us a differant room or to go and speak to the guests in the room above. I asked them to talk to the guests so I wouldn't have to pack up and move again and we never heard another sound. Don't waste your time on the Pam Pam grill, service was lousy and food was nothing special.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here during a trip down the coast for my "splurge". Basically, the hotel was fine. Lots of old-world charm and history. When you have high expectations, a hotel really has to roll out the red carpet to live up to that, and this one did a 50-50 job of that. But the one that that made the whole experience transformative for me was the pool. If you love beautiful tiles and a historic feel that transports you elsewhere, that old indoor pool (with steam room, etc) was absolutely amazing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Faced with the prospect of choosing a hotel from the many on offer in San Diego we eventually chose Days Inn. We stopped there for four nights at the start of our holiday and we can certainly recommend it as excellent value. We chose the slightly more expensive rooms. The facilities were good and the hotel staff excellent. The hotel bus saved us from having to negotiate the road systems and the drivers were really helpful. Well done to all the staff involved for giving us such a great start to our holiday in California.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For the price, very good value, lower than similar properties nearby. Be aware that rates seem to be higher if you arrive without reservations. We had very good rate by contacting directly. Room is nice, fairly typical of Days Inn. Central location (i.e. not far from zoo, Old Town, etc.). Several restaurants within walking distance, including one on property. Recommend third floor; there is an elevator. Fairly accessible internet in lobby; free newspapers there. Very friendly front desk. Pool at back of property, not much used but quite excellent.</p></li>

A great price and very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I would definately stay there again on our next trip. It was not a huge room but you only sleep at night and we were out all day. We had no issues with noise or any other scary issues you read about on some of the other hotels. They did have an onsite restaurant but it was a little pricey. We traveled W on I-8 and found alot more restaurants and places to see.</p></li>

From the drivers of the shuttle, the severs in the restaurant, to the front desk staff. The room was good but we weren't in it unless we were taking a shower or to sleep. I mean really, it was 72 degrees and beautiful blue skies outside. The pool was great. We did use the MTS transit system to go to Old town, Mission Beach, and Pacific Beach. Very easy and the bus drivers helped us to seamlessly choose a route for our destination. Very friendly city. The bus stop was right outside the hotel too.</p></li>

We catered two meals for our event through the hotel and it was also great. The rooms and beds were comfortable, clean, and a good value. Our experience for all our family members was excellent. We highly recommend this hotel for the budget-minded family who wants more than bare-bones accomodations.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Days Inn - Hotel Circle from June 8 - 16th. Was very impressed with room and location. Perfect for getting anywhere. Room was nice - adequate for our needs and was pleasantly surprised by the pool area during quiet times. When it was full of kids was hard to swim as pool not very big. Very clean and well kept. Always staff around cleaning. Pam Pam Grill was very expensive and service was slow. Went there first day for breakfast, was charged $23.00 for 2 people and didn't go back all week. Otherwise pleasant stay and the room looked like what it showed in the pictures.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I travel to SD often and this time was only in for 1 night and thought Hotel Circle is convenient to where I need to be. It is - but never again! This is a trap for large families seeing the zoo and sea world! Room was out dated, not clean the couch in the room was not one I would have let my dog sit on. The crowd this place attracts does not lend it self to a relaxing evening after a long day on the road from work. On a budget? with family? dont care about your car or who parks next to it? Stay here. Otherwise- look elsewhere! One positive note: the front desk staff are very courteous and pleasant!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">At first we weren't so sure if we should stay at this hotel, but since we wanted a cheap one and since it was just for 2 nights, we chose this hotel. I could say that the service given by the two drivers who were extremly friendly and also gave us a lot of information and tips regarding San Diego, was excellent. It made our holiday in San Diego one we will definitely remember. They came for us at the airport, took us to seaworld and were always there when we needed them!!! They even saved us from losing our van to go to los angeles! So for an excellent service there's no other hotel you should go to!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel met all my needs for a recent visit to Sea World. The room was very clean and I was able to get a parking right in front of the room. The hotel is nothing fancy, but I felt safe. Hotel Circle is indeed a busy area with a lot of businesses and hotels/motels. It's not a scenic area. I felt safe at this hotel and believe it is a good option for families looking for simple/nothing fancy lodgings near Sea World. The front desk staff member on duty when I checked in was very friendly and helpful. I was impressed with his politeness and his help in finding the number to my favorate Pizza place. I enjoyed my stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There are quite a few hotels in the Hotel Circle. We chose the Days Inn because of the reviews on Trip Advisor. The room was large and clean. Internet is included in the reasonable rate as well as parking. OK Breakfast can be had at the nearby diner. The Fashion Valley Shopping Center is within walking distance and offer everything you could need when it comes to eating and shopping. If you have your own car, it is very easy to get to both the Old Town and Sea World. There is also a shuttle service which supposedly stops by the hotel, but the hotel staff did not have much information about it so we ended up using our car instead.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We really appreciate the 'no pet' policy and no smoking policy of this hotel. This puts this hotel on the top of our list for places to stay in San Diego. The room was quiet, clean, well equipped, in excellent condition and also the swimming pool was clean, well maintained and towels were provided. The staff was helpful and friendly. A few minor complaints - the free breakfast provided as part of a promotional to some of the guests was not available to us because we didn't book during the right month. When we saw the free breakfast, it was a basic continental breakfast. Also, the pool deck is very slippery and needs to have a rougher surface.</p></li>

Beds comfortable, fridge/microwave saved money on breakfast and snacks. Staff friendly and quickly responded to minor problems. Free 15 min computer acesss in lobby. Parking free and adequate. Room clean , carpets stained but renovation under way. Very convenient freeway acess to Balboa Park (museums, zoo, etc), also only a few minutes to Mission Bay beaches. Also handy to Hillcrest area, great eateries. Didn't eat in hotel restaurant but amazing apple pancakes just down the road at Ricky's. Pool and hot tub very nice in tropical vegetation.</p></li>

The kitchenette/bathroom area seemed crowded. Who wants to cook next to where they comb there hair! The beds were good. The hotel could use some upgrades (pocket door squeeks to the bathrooom) The latch on the door broke and they fixed it the same day. They are good about requests.

The pool has a good size, the water is warm and the jacuzzi is awesome:) The location is very good, too. You have a bus that's right across the street that takes you to the Old Town and to Downtown. You also have the trolley 5-6 min walking distance from the hotel. Happy New Year everyone and thanks for making our stay so pleasant! Cristina S. PS San Diego is a great city, by the way!

Overall, the staff was great, especially when our wireless internet access codes would expire from time to time; however, the staff was awesome and would reissue new codes - no problem. The rooms were clean, and the beds were comfortable. Great location, and close to the MCRD, Old Town, Balboa Park, and many restaurants. The only issue we had during our stay was the hotel room doors will slam shut as people come in and out, which can get pretty loud from inside the room. Other than that minor issue, we enjoyed our stay and had a great time in San Diego!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There are so many things to see and do in San Diego, and this location is great to get to them all. It took less that 10 min. to get to the zoo, Sea World, Coronado, and Mission Beach. The rooms were perfect for a longer stay also with a micro/refrig. The bathrooms were nicelydone with granite counter tops also. My wife and I noticed the upgraded beds and bedding there too. As frequent travelers, not many limited service hotels have beds this nice. We were fortunate to have access to the covered parking also, which is nice on sunny days and two small kids. Every staff member we encountered was friendly and helpful too. We would certainly stay here again when we come back to Diego.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel to attend a conference that was being held at the nearby Town and Country Resort. All during the conference I heard complaints from the people that were staying at the conference hotel as they groused about the freeway noise, the extra costs for parking and wifi, the lack of a room fridge, and the puny television sets, all at $150 per night. Needless to say, they didn't like it too much when I would brag about the great service and the super deal I had at your hotel. I especially appreciated the free shuttle to and from the airport and that the front desk staff allowed me a late check out because my flight wasn't leaving until early evening. Thank you so much for an awesome stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed one night we are a family of four . The staff was nice and gave us a coutesy call to see if we were happy with our room. The beds are comfortable lots of pillows and the room was clean. It had a microwave, refrigerator, efficiency stove, pots and pans. The bath tub was a nice size which I appreciated after a long day at the beach. We were able to park our car right in front of our room which gave us some piece of mind and made unloading easy. Easy access to the 8 and a conveniant distance to Sea World and Mission Beach A continental breakfast would be a nice addition and the parking lot can get a bit noisey late at night but it was a good choice and a great room for the money. I would stay here again! :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Days Hotel was good overall. The price was terrific, only about $66 per night. I did book online for a business place room in the newer building of the hotel, but was given a room in the older section. I didn't realize it until I was already in the room and since the room was pretty nice, and since the lady at the front desk was kind of grouchy, I didn't mention it. I didn't have time upon checkout to mention it either. The room was clean and comfortable. I didn't have a chance to go swimming, but when I went to check out the pool, it looked pretty nice. The shuttle service wasn't nearly as convienient as I thought it would, but the shuttle driver that picked us up from the airport was very helpful and friendly.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We asked for a room away from the street, ended up not getting one. (Probably because they have a specific layout for rooms with kitchenette) . We couldn't get a wink of sleep the first night, because the lights would turn on automatically every 15-20 minutes. We called up the front desk, were told that these were motion sensor lights with no master switch to turn it off. We ended up removing the bulbs. The next day, we asked for a change of room, the staff upgraded us to a business suite, free of cost, also moved all our luggage to the new room. I was pretty impressed when they took care of moving our stuff in the fridge (which I had forgotten all about) to the fridge in the new room. 5 stars for customer service, 2 stars for room maintenance.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I didn't have very high expectations for this hotel, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was clean, comfortable, and spacious enough for my husband, 5 month old and me to have a very enjoyable weekend. It is in a great location - not beachfront, not in an area you can walk out your door to attractions - but not too far from anything either. You need to have a car, but you can also take advantage of the shuttle runs from the hotel to Sea World. The pool was fun for my infant, the restaurant served it's purpose for an early morning snack to tide us over, and the room itself was big enough for us to spread out and have a pack and play for our son. I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a decent, no-frills, reasonably priced place to stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This little hotel gets good reviews. This was my 4th time there and I was disappointed. First, they booked me in a handicap room and then explained that I had booked this. So, after room change and 2 queens instead of 1 king, I noticed that the sheets on one of the beds was stained--thank goodness it just looked to be coffee! The shower blasted so strongly that I had to keep my you-knows out of the way! The t.v. was adequate but it wouldn't cost a fortune to change to flat sceens in the rooms. And, for all hotels, it's about time to throw out the in-room coffee crap. I'll go up the road to Peet's, thank you very much! Finally, I thought the towels were quite coarse (old). Is it too much to ask for a soft towel? I will think twice before booking again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Days Inn/Hotel Circle from June 11-15, 2006. It was a choice based on budget and safety. We got a great room with frig and microwave, nice TV, and clean! Their pool was a family oasis in the back of the property with tall trees around and locking gate. I saw families having a great time. It was close to a street which we discovered was a back road into San Diego without getting back on freeways. We bought discounted Sea World tickets at front desk and rode the motel van to and from for no cost. The trolley had a pick up in front but we did not use it as we had a car. I suggest the Business class rooms in the back by the pool if you want quiet and privacy. It was a great place for $69 a night. Look for deals online and through your work place.</p></li>

There was a computer in the lobby with free internet. Room was clean and quite roomy. There was a pool but i didnt use it as it was too cold. Had a nice dinner at the restaurant one night and also had takeaway breakfast from there. We also went to servo for snacks which was a few metres down the street. The hotel also has a free shuttle to zoo & sea world. Zoo was a bit average but Sea World was amazing loved it! Killer whale show was great. Did a day trip to Tijuana Mexico wouldnt recommend that it was awful army driving round with big guns on back of trucks it was scary and not worth the time as the shopping wasnt that great all though we did get free shots of tequilla!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We wanted a place to stay for a quick overnight in San Diego. We werent looking for anything special since we were only going to be in the room to just sleep and shower. I read the reviews and decided that this hotel sounded perfect. It was. Close to the attractions and inexpensive. When we checked in, we got a call about 10 mins later from the office wanting to know if everything was ok. It was. We noticed that we needed more towels and called down to the front to get some sent to the room. They came quickly. Again, about 10 mins later another call to make sure we got the towels. We chose a room on the third floor about halfway back so it was fairly quiet. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a good place to stay inexpensive. It was clean and quiet and close.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We thought this hotel was great in every aspect! free pickup from the airport to the hotel, free shuttle to sea world (5minute drive) free shuttle to the zoo and with in walking distance to a large mall. Also very close to the harbour where you can take in all the sights (old ships to walk through including a naval aircraft carrier, harbour tours, a short boat ride over to Coronado which has a nice little beach for the kids to play at, as well as some neat shops and good food. The staff was very friendly at the front desk, shuttle drivers, cleaning staff and at Pam Pam restaurant which is right on site with great food as well. The pool is a bit small but still great for our 3 and 7 year old girls. This was our secend visit to this hotel and would not hesitate to go back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had a great stay at this hotel. Ample parking and friendly staff with no issues on check in or check out. Large comfortable rooms and bathrooms, serviced daily and nice and clean. Only stayed for two nights but would definatley reccommend a stay here if staying in San Diego. Bus right outside the entrance which can take you into the city or to Fashion Valley Mall or the Westfield shopping centre. Pam Pam's was the highlight, food was great and the service in this cafe is better than we had experienced on the whole trip, also good takeaway coffee). Definately include a trip to Tijuana if you are staying in San Diego, was a highlight. Pool and spa also available but was too cold at the time we stayed. All in all was a great place to stay and would highly recommend, no problems at all.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got back from a weekend in San Diego and we loved our stay at the Days Inn in Hotel Cirlce. This Hotel is in the Mission Valley Area. Just a short drive to beaches, shopping, and downtown. We've lived in San Diego and stayed in San Diego at other area hotels and for the value, quality and convience it can't be beat. It was clean, the staff very helpful. It is just off the freeway (like all the hotels in the area), we just got a room on the 3rd floor (top) near the back and noise wasn't a problem at all. A beautiful heated pool and spa with towels available. The rooms look newly remodeled. The small Pam Pam Cafe' located at the hotel is a nice place for a late dinner or early breakfast. Great menu, service and terrific food. I can't say enough about this place. We will stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel room was clean. Location was great. Didn't even have to get on the interstate to get to great places like Old Town and the mall. This was a relocation stay. We were so exhausted at the end of the day from moving that we didn't even want to leave the hotel once we got there each evening. So we ate at the hotel restaurant every night. The food was good and hot. I think we had everything on the menu. (We ate breakfast once, too.) The kids ate free, so that helped on the cost. We were even able to get a latte first thing in the morning. The bed was comfortable. Lots of pillows. If you are taking a nap, put the sign on the door, and if housekeeping has not come yet, they will leave the fresh towels in a bag on the door. Then the hotel shuttle took us to the airport to catch our plane. Can't beat it.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a great stay thanks in part to Mariano Soto, the evening desk clerk. He suggested our meal locations every evening. He was able to suggest ones that we could walk to or he could get the shuttle to bring us. Each meal was great food and decent price. The hotel is an older hotel, but they have redone the rooms. They aren't perfect rooms, but the location is good enough to get past the old room. Having two Queen beds with a good hotel staff make it a great family hotel. We made it to Seaworld, Zoo and airport using the hotel shuttle. We were able to catch the Old Town Trolley Tour by just walking to the bus sign. Location was very important since we did not rent a car for the visit. The hotel staff helped us get tickets to some of the attractions, and suggested we buy etickets and print them at their computer for better deals.</p></li>

Whenever anyone walked past our room on the walkway our beds bounced, I did try to find another hotel but everything was totally sold out so couldnt shift. Walkways were dirty, with water also running across them from the ac units, truly would not have surprised me to see strippers etc hanging out around the hotel as it really was quite scummy, cant comment on the price as it was part of a package done by a travel agent but in my opinion any amount would be too much.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have just returned from a US holiday travelling on my own. I spent 4 nights at this hotel. I chose this hotel as it was only a short distance from SeaWorld, the zoo, Old Town San Diego and shopping malls. I didn't have a car but the hotel had a courtesy bus to drive to me SeaWorld and the zoo and to and from the airport. The room was very clean and comfortable. Pay tv to watch at end of a long day. Free internet in the reception lounge area. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful organising day tours and giving directions to eat by car or by foot. Onsite is a reasonably priced family restaurant "Pam Pam Cafe and Grill". At end of long day, very convenient. I was given a complimentary breakfast voucher for each day of my stay. Only downside, was my room was near a stairwell, so heard a bit of foot traffic. Definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely be going back.</p></li>

Our Son and daughter then slept in the Queen Bed and it wasn't too bad !!!! The view from room was nothing to look at , as was a dried up hill... The noise from above when trying to sleep was abit annoying to start with as sounded like a wee heard of elephants but we cranked up the air condition to cover it ... The Air conditioner wasn't working properly to start with but the front desk quickly had that sorted for us ... The hotel is old BUT like any hotel I like to stay in as long as it is clean I am happy with this .. Pool area was ok but lost the sun early because of high trees surrounding this.. Free Shuttle was excellent ,, also the Seven Seas restaurant was prefered over the Pam Pam ...</p></li>

The hotel is old BUT like any hotel I like to stay in as long as it is clean I am happy with this .. Pool area was ok but lost the sun early because of high trees surrounding this..

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed two nights. First time visit. For the cons: The room had a very prominent mildew/musty odor. Parking was tight. The bed was okay but getting on the worn side. The elevator was a little too creaky for my liking. It was an older room but the hotels in this area are all old. I would request a room NOT near the elevator or the corridor as we heard every little sound. No frills. Pros: Clean room and linens, location can't be beat, microwave, coffee pot, iron, hairdryer and safe in room. Pool stayed open until 11:00 p.m. Offered wake-up call. For the value it can't be beat. I would recommend this to a friend. They let you know up front what services will be additional. The location is perfect if you are a tourist and most people just sleep and shower in the rooms anyway. We got a rate of 63.00 with our AARP card. I see the photos show rooms with a view and next time I will try to get one.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nites. We were very comfortable in our quiet room on the 3rd floor ,which was very spacious with a small kitchenette. We enjoyed the heated pool and jaccuzzi. We were able to walk to a 24 hour family restaurant and convenience store closeby. To our surprize when we asked what bus to take to the attractions they said '"we will sign you up which time do you want to go"? and "we will pick you up." They even one nite drive us down to "Old Town" so we could tour area and have dinner. If you are traveling without a car, this is the place to stay. You are close to public transportation but staff will van you to your point of interest. If you plan to go to San Diego to go to Sea World, Zoo, Old Town, or other attractions this is your hotel. Also they are family friendly, offer AAA discount and other discounts. We stayed for less than $70. a nite. This is a must stay!!!!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel is fine - you are there to do the sights not spend the day in the room so on that note it was perfect. Location was EXCELLENT - walking to Fashion Valley - old Town Trolley (which I highly recommend) stop right out front, family type restaurant on site - heated pool. Staff was very friendly. Only complaint - their 'free shuttle' service- while it IS free - it was NOT on time ever. Be it 15 minutes to 35 minutes late - you could count on it being late - and this is the pre booked shuttles. The most distressing was departure - had to be at airport 2 hours early for an international flight at noon. Was told to take the 10am shuttle - would be there by 10:15 - the shuttle didn't even leave the hotel until 10:35! Then it made another stop first before heading to the airport. Still managed to clear customs and make the flight - but very stressful - if you want the 10am shuttle for the airport - book the 8am one!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For the room rate per night, this was a great budget hotel. All my family needs is a clean bed and clean bathroom and I got both of those. If your standards are higher and require fancier things, you should probably look elsewhere. The customer service worked for me. When I checked in I asked if I can get a crib because I had a baby with me. Within 30 minutes of getting to our room, housekeeping showed up with a crib and two extra pillows. Also, when I asked where the nearest grocery store is located, guest services gave us the map and written directions are on the back, very easy to follow. The location of the hotel is pretty good since you can easily pick it up off the highway. I can't comment on the shuttle service because we did not use it. I can't comment on the pool because it rained during our stay. I can attest to previous reviews though that the walls/floors are thin because you can hear your neighbors around you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here with my family in January 2012 and we had a great experience. We rented 2 rooms and both were clean and well-maintained. The rooms are not huge, but are large enough to be comfortable. An added bonus was that the rooms had kitchenettes with dishes, a microwave, a kitchen sink, as well as a separate bathroom sink, and a mini-refrigerator. We ended up going to a nearby store and buying food to make for breakfast so we didn't have to have as much fast food while traveling. The hotel is close to Sea World, Old Town San Diego, the mall, and trolley stations, so it was really convenient. The only complaint I had about the hotel was that the parking lot fills up quickly and it was difficult to find a parking spot at the end of the night. Also, the parking spots that are available are fairly narrow and there is limited room to back out of the spots. Other than that, we had an amazing stay and I would definitely go there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Honestly, I was a bit scared at first after so many mixed reviews from Yelpers and from Tripadvisor. But I was pleasently surprised. Good, quiet property. Clean, felt safe and enjoyed everything. ADVICE: REQUEST a Sunset Wing room. This is a new building and it is enclosed with hallways. The rest of the property is more like a motel with outside hallways. I dont like that. No privacy and a lot of screaming kids running up and down. The window shades must be closed the entire time if you want privacy. The new building was just fine. Clean, had water, granola and popcorn in room (complimentary) with a microwave and fridge. Was great to store cold water in. The room was big. The beds, HUGE. For this price, I would definately stay here again. Enjoyed the pool and hot tub too. Close to the freeways, access to everywhere. Wouldnt really recommend Pam Pam on the property unless you are VERY desperate and dont want to venture out. Basic, greasy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'm starting to think that in regard to reasonably priced San Diego hotels, the key question is whether one is a morning person--the kind of person for whom a complimentary breakfast is an important perk. This Days Inn does not offer any sort of breakfast, so if heavy start to your day is important to you, then you may not like this ppty. The advantage of sacrificing breakfast is all you receive in its pl;ace--larger than usual room in this price range (with even an interesting piece of modern art on the wall), a refrig, a micro- wave, a great heat pump unit for comfy climate in the room, nice furnishings, a computer for guest use in the lobby, and, wow, an absolutely smashing pool and spa surrounded by lush greenery at the rear of the ppty--very zen pool area. The pillows are a bit tired, but the king size bed is a real king size, not an exaggeration. Friendly front desk staff. I came for business, but the shuttle sevice can be a big help so check into that too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What seems to come through when I read other reviews is consistent praise for the staff. Let me add my voice to that! These people are phenomenal and go out of their way to ensure a comfortable stay. In my own case, I was displaced from my home by an emergency, exhausted and at the end of my tether. Jeremy in reservations and Joy, the on-site PBX operator, could not have been kinder, going the extra distance to arrange an early check-in so I could get some sleep. Joy even called my room after I checked in to see if I'd gotten settled okay. Now, really, do those kinds of things happen? Not often..... For the money, it could not be a better value. Comfortable beds, clean and pleasant rooms, soft linens, hotel restaurant, free wireless, city bus stop across the street, free shuttle service -- and the STAFF who are truly the icing on the cake. I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone, especially budget-minded travelers who don't completely want to sacrifice comfort.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Note: there are 3 sections to this hotel. The first 2 are on either side of the drive and are your basic motel rooms. Outside corridors and backing onto other rooms. The section we stayed in is at the back by the pool. This is a hotel type - indoor corridors, backs onto parking, newer business type area. The front desk charged us $10 more for this and it was worth it. Only downside - you have to walk to the back of the property if you aren't driving. Restaurant was nice - after a few days you will want a change but it served us well for the time we were there. Shuttle drivers to the attractions range from wonderful to one who's attitude said "I'm doing you a favour by even letting you on the bus". Fortunately we only had him twice. Housekeeping was great - clean towels, extras if needed, and very pleasant. Note: turn on the fridge when you get to the room, they must turn them off between guests - experience talking here, we just assumed it was on. A very pleasant stay - would love to stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The minute we pulled up, we noticed how much so the facility was in disrepair. The building needed a paint job, there were cracks, etc. However, I attempted to keep an open mind, so we went to the front to check in. Aside from the outdated decor, which again, I was willing to overlook, the staff seemed pleasant (although he was coughing all over everything!!). We went to our room and walking along the terrace was an overwhelming smell of urine. It was disgusting. Someone literally urinated on the walkway. The cleaning staff happened to be working on the room just in front of where the smell was coming from, but didn't seem to be phased. When we opened the door to our room, there was a very musty odor that was ineffectively being covered up by lemon furniture cleaner. The room was dark, stinky & in need of a makeover. We left immediately, but not before making our reasons known to the front desk. This is a gross motel & I would never stay here, especially with my toddler. Run the other way!!! YUCK!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We are from Hawaii. We just got back from San Diego. We were experiencing the June Gloom month, everything was cool and overcast with gray skies. Not good. Anyway we stayed at this hotel. It was totally worth it! We are not used to staying at an Inn, only hotels. So we expected the worst. But it was actually a very, very good stay. The place is very well up kept and the staff are very helpful and friendly. We requested to stay in the new section called the â€œsunsetâ€� something. This newer part is very nice, mostly everything is renovated in there. The bathrooms are very nice and the beds are very soft and clean. The rooms are very quiet and the pool is clean and heated. There are a lot of people there, the rooms were mostly full. Overall I would highly recommend families to stay there, but request for the new section. Also what was best is that it is very close to malls, old town and the freeway. Very good location! The food around the area is also very good. I would definitely stay there again. Aloha!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was reluctant to use this hotel after reading some of the reviews but took my chances, I am glad I did, it didn't smell, the beds were comfy and the staff was friendly and informative. If you plan on using the shuttle service though I would book the time at the same time you book your room as the spots fill up fast, and why wouldn't they, it is free. The only real negative thing I have to say is about the PAM PAM cafe, we had breakfast there our first morning, what a mistake. The food was horrible and the staff was RUDE. Days Hotel should be ashamed of this place. We got a buy one adult breakfast and get the kids free deal through the internet booking process as did several other guests. Pam Pam staff did not honer the deal, they told other patrons that they were misinformed by the hotel. My wife went to the hotel to let them know what was going on and we eventually got the three free meals but the others just paid for them. I plan on going back to San Diego before the year is up and will stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">if you're looking for an inexpensive, clean place to sleep, then this is for you. HOWEVER, I suggest either bringing earplugs, staying on the third floor, or only choosing this hotel if you're a sound sleeper. we stayed on the first floor near the office. From the room above us, it sounded like elephants were walking around. This was NOT due to rowdy residents, simply people moving about in a normal fashion. We happened to have people above us who stayed up late and got up early, and we heard every move they made. Also, the cars in the parking lot were only a few feet from our front door, and we heard people getting in and out of cars as well. the fact that there was about a 1 inch gap under the door didn't help. On the upside beds and pillows were comfortable and the place was clean and updated except for the worn looking carpet. The water pressure in the showers was magnificent with a shower head at a decent height for tall people. Location was good, near the highways, and fairly close to stores like Target and many others.</p></li>

(although i did not need it.) the food in the pam pam restaurant in the motel was just ok, and i found it very stark and in need of major decorating . there are alot of restaurants in the area as well as a movie theatre, target, gas station and other shopping within a 10 min drive from the motel there is also a small convenience store within walking distance. internet was free, but slow. i would stay here again, if i got the same good deal of 57.00 a night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is nothing to be wow'd about. It's exactly what it appears on the website. Near Seaworld. drivable to the beach, efficiency rooms (a bit on the tiny side) with fridge and microwave. It's clean and within the what I expect from a Days Inn. The "quick break breakfast" is mainly packaged pastries, coffee and juice --less than we hoped for, but better than trying to kit a restaurant on the way to the parks. The shuttle service was always full while we were there so we didn't utilize it, but we had a car. The staff was helpful, though the practice of giving the room pool towels was odd --we ended up requesting several more, which were brought promptly. The pool and jacuzzi areas were often crowded in the evening, but such is the case after the amusement park the hotel is built around closes. The internet was very slow and unsecured. On the whole it's a great value, but not impressive. I wouldn't discourage people from staying there, but I would probably try another property near hotel circle for my next San Diego stay if my budget were a bit larger next time.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were in town for a wedding and stayed at this property for almost a week. Surely one of the best hotels in the Hotel Circle location. Rooms are very nice, spacious, and up-to-date. I was blown away by how clean the room was. I have two small children and wasn't worried one bit about what they could find on the floor. What a relief for a germ-phobe mom. The service was amazing! Everyone was nice and helpful. Requests were fullfilled quickly. They had cribs, refrigerators and no noise issues at all. Again, all ideal for families. You can't beat the location. You can tell they have a management team that really cares about the property and the guests that stay there. Very refreshing! Easy, easy, easy access to main freeways, but without the freeway noise at all. Easy to hit all the main points of interest San Diego has to offer... beaches, zoo, sea world, downtown. Best part, you can purchase tickets to the main attractions directly from them! No waiting in the lines. We couldn't have been happier with our stay at this gem of a property. Would come back again and again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was simply just "okay" for the price. We booked on getawaytoday, for a San Diego family trip, and we knew it would be no frills. There were nine of us total, and we had two rooms. One room had a terrible musty smell that we tried to mask with Lysol spray. That helped for a few minutes at a time. The other room had ants crawling all over the bathroom sink area. Basically, the rooms were clean, the bedding was clean and crisp, and the beds were fairly comfortable. There is a small convience store within walking distance that helped out with treats and drinks. There is also a restaurant on the property called Pan Pan. We ate an excellent breakfast there. We were in a hurry and the waitress was right there to help us get out the door on time. We used the hotel shuttle service to take us to SeaWorld, and pick us up, and that is definitely the way to go. The girl at the front desk was VERY professional and helpful and had great customer service skills. In fact, her great personality would be about the only reason I'd book again at this hotel. It was just a little bit too much on the borderline of being awful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place was a steal for $55 a night! I was lucky enough to reserve a room during a 1/2 price sale. Customer service was great! I called the front desk three times and they were very pleasant and accomodating to my requests! It's one of the few hotels that offer a free shuttle to various places like the Amtrak station which is next to the Gaslamp District. So, if you want to go downtown for dinner without paying $20 for a taxi, just take the free shuttle to the Amtrak. The hotel is in a central location, Hotel Circle South. We basically used this hotel just to sleep, so it met our needs very well. Comfortable beds, microwave, coffee maker, mini fridge, hair dryer, iron & safe included! The shower was good, hot, water pressure was mediocre. Towels were plentiful, soft, and clean. I didn't eat at their restaurant named Buns, but family that also stayed here did, and said their burger was way undercooked. Now, I have to say I am considering what I paid compared to the area rates at the time (Feb,2012). This is a budget hotel, so it was not as quiet as a library, nor that pleasing to the eyes. But it was great for what it is!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I recently stayed at the Days Hotel, San Diego as part of a vacation package booked with Alaska Airlines. I felt compelled to write a review as we were pleasantly surprised in many areas of this hotel. Our family was travelling on a budget and the free shuttle service to the airport and the San Diego Zoo was convenient and amazing! The location of the hotel was perfect for us as it was in a nice area of town central to exactly what we needed. There is a beautiful shopping mall only a ten minute walk away as well as a local transit station that will hook you up with all transit services that basically will take you anywhere you want to go in San Diego. The rooms were especially clean and comfortable. The staff (including maid service, front desk, shuttle drivers) were extremely friendly and professional. The outdoor areas (including the pool) are nicely landscaped and spotless. There is a small restaurant attached to this hotel that we had most of our meals at. The food was not only excellent but reasonably priced. Overall if we are ever in the San Diego area again, I will choose this hotel for my family! Thank you!.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got a good rate for 2 nights here... about $75 with all the taxes... per night. Hotel was very clean. Staff friendly and helpful. The shuttle drivers were on time, and very very courteous!! We rode the shuttle to the zoo even though we wanted to visit Balboa Park. When the shuttle driver overheard us talking about it, he drove us to the main entrance at Balboa Park-- which is not a scheduled stop for them. Rooms were very spacious. We had everything we needed. Shampoos, etc were a nicer quality than most.My husband has trouble walking, and we were given a 3rd floor room.... but right next to the elevator.... so it was very convenient. A few things could use some improvement: (1) Luggage... we waited over 30 minutes for help with the luggage and the shuttle driver had to wait, also. Finally carried most of it down ourselves.... and the guy showed up. (2) The bathroom door was VERY annoying!! It was a sliding door, and hard to close. It squeaked badly... was very very hard to close (heavy), and woke my husband if I used the bathroom during the night. (3) Ice machines are inconvenient. It was still a pleasant experience, and a good value. I would definitely stay here again!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After waiting in line 20 minutes to check in, we were given a key that didn't open the door. No biggie unless your room is all the way at the opposite end of the property. Then, as we checked in, we inquired about the complimentary hotel shuttle that would take us to the cruise ship. We asked about the best time to take it...10AM or 12 Noon. Clerk said 12 Noon. Little did we know that we had to SIGN UP for the shuttle. I guess asking him about it wouldn't have tipped him enough to figure that we might WANT TO GO ON IT!!!!! Needless to say, when we came down at 11:45 to catch the shuttle, it was full and we had to wait an extra hour and a half for it to load up and take the guests then come back for us. No biggie, unless you're waiting there with a 3 and 4 year old and you now have no where to go. BTW, don't forget to ASK for a receipt if you pay cash. As the same genius who caused all of these other problems forgot to mention that we paid in cash, so when we checked out, the clerk had no record of it. Would I stay there again? Well, if they offer me a complimentary night for my inconvenience, I think I'd rather pay the money to get the piece of mind knowing that I won't have to go through THAT AGAIN!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We normally only stay at higher rated hotels but due to Comic-Con everything was sold out or extremely expensive. Even this hotel charged a bit more than I normally would be prepared to pay for this kind of hotel but the area was good for us and we liked the free parking. We opted for the business section at the back of the hotel area next to the swimming pool. The room was a good size and clean with a big king size bed, a table and two armchairs as well as a desk area. As it was at the back we were never bothered by noise other than from the A/C unit (sometimes the A/C smelled a bit of beer when we started it in the afternoon - not so nice). The pool area looked nice but we never used it. We never found out how to get the free breakfast but we bought breakfast at the restaurant the first day and never again. The bagels tasted stale. But we had a fridge and microwave in the room. The best thing about the hotel is the comfy bed, the cleaning and the location. The best mall (Fashion Valley) is just a 2 min drive away and so is another mall with bigger shops like Target and Best Buy. It is also very convenient for Sea World and the Zoo and it is located between Downtown and La Jolla. We spent a lot of time in La Jolla and Del Mar and it was very easy to drive there.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 3 nights in June 09. The staff was incredibly nice upon checking in. I was looking for just a place for us to sleep with a safe location and no bugs - this served our purposes well. The beds were comfortable, the rooms looked like they tried to keep them clean, and there was a microwave and refrigerator in the room, and they have free wireless internet which is a bit slow, but usable. The bathrooms have a sliding door (which was the hardest thing ever to close) and you can tell the walls have had many coats of paint. The only times we ever heard our neighbors was when they were running the shower or shutting their door. The location is perfect. It's close to the Zoo, Sea World, and the beaches. Although we didn't use it, the hotel has a shuttle to sea world. We did however visit the zoo and loved it. Take Note: Get a parking pass. I noticed the 2nd day we were there cars in the parking lot had parking passes in their windows. Not sure how the staff, although nice, could have missed telling me that when I checked in since my car was parked 10 feet from me while doing so. Luckily, since we checked in so late I think we missed the guard walking around checking the cars - I noticed him the second night. The parking does get busy at night, but we were able to find a space at midnight (weeknight).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Days Inn Hotel Circle was a great hotel for the 5 nights my son and I stayed there. It was very close to the Fashion Valley Mall and trolley stop (less than 0.5 mi). The pool was very nice when not filled with noisy kids and the setting was very tropical and relaxing. A nice touch was finding pool towels placed on the pool lounges; it seemed like the hotel was inviting you to the pool. The Pam Pam restaurant had good food (only ate breakfast) but it would have been nice if the Days Inn had a free breakfast bar. A previous commenter suggested upgrading the standard room to the "Business" room, which we did. It was only about $10 more per night and included slightly better bedding (I know it was slightly better because we stayed in a standard room for one night at the end of our vacation and I was able to compare the two room types), complimentary bottled water, granola bars, and micro-wave popcorn, and it had the added benefit of being in a totally separate building (near the pool) with interior hallway and doors. This definitely made the rooms quieter. Also, if timing was right, there was covered parking which definitely helps keep the car cool. There was easy access to I-8 and Rt 163 so getting to town only took a couple minutes. There were many other hotels near this one so keep that in mind if there are no rooms available when you try to book.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reviewing the hotels located on Hotel Circle, we decided upon staying at the Days Inn despite some negative reviews that travellers gave this hotel. Our room was located on the second floor which may be considered the older section of this hotel property. We spent very little time in our room as we were gone for the day and returned to our room later in the evening. Our room was an older room but clean. Upon entering the room there was a sanitizing odour. Seeing that our room had an exterior entry, we kept our curtains shut and windows closed. It would have been preferred if we could have opened our windows at night and had sunlight come into our room in the morning. When reserving a room at this hotel, we were looking for a hotel with a modest room rate, close to San Diego attractions, no charge for parking for hotel guests, easy access to and above all was clean. This hotel/room met our requirements perfectly. There is a restaurant that is attached to the hotel. Prices are reasonable as we only ate there once for breakfast. There is a Denny's located nearby. It would have been great if this hotel offered a complimentary breakfast as others do in the area. Front desk staff was knowledgeable and presented us with a map of the nearby groceries, restaurants, shopping, sports arena, etc. that were a definite asset during our stay. We will definitely consider staying at this location if we are ever in the San Diego area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned home after spending 3 nights in San Diego at the Days Inn-Hotel Circle. The location was central to everything we wanted to do and so easy to find. The motel is older but seemed to be kept in nice shape from the grounds to the building itself. We found the staff to be very friendly and went out of their way to accomodate our two families by placing our rooms next to each other. We appreciated the easy-to-follow maps with excellent directions to many attractions around the area. Our rooms were clean, but ours had a slight musty smell, while the other one was just fine. This wasn't a big deal as we didn't spend much time there anyway. We did notice some noise from people above us and outside the walkway, but we expected that from an older motel. Our rooms had a small fridge which worked out so well for us for milk and other beverages. The motel offers a complimentary shuttle to a few attractions but since we had a van, we didn't use it. We were told though that people must reserve a spot the day before to secure a spot. The pool was a nice retreat after a long day of sightseeing. There were lots of towels and chairs to use, even though the pool seemed always busy. If you are looking for a good place to stay on a budget, this economy motel is worthwhile to check out. We were pleased that even though the motel is rated at 2 stars, we got a good value for our money. We will definitely stay here again, and will recommend it to friends and family.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very happy with this hotel (and tripadvisor reviewers - thanks again). We had 2 rooms for Aug 2,3,4. Rooms included fridge, microwave, iron & board, free wi-fi in room, plenty of pillows, plent of towels. The staff is VERY nice, called within an hour of check-in to make sure our rooms were fine and to see if we needed anything else to make our stay better. We were able to buy tickets for Sea World, San Diego Zoo, and San Diego Wild animal park here- the tickets were discounted and included extras (Heart of Africa Bus tour, Bus tour at the zoo etc..). Free shuttle to Sea World and the Zoo (airport too) - book as soon as you get there since it fills up - the bus drivers are wonderful and even gave my husband a second unscheduled ride when I forgot our Sea World tickets at the hotel. Overall a great deal and if we are ever in the area again this is where we will stay. I would happily recommend this hotel to anyone Only cons: rooms smelled a little musty but cleared out with an open window and the AC on - it was very humid and hot during our stay. Tiny bit of mold on one of the drapes in 1 room - I am sure they would have taken care of this had we brought it to their attention and I only mention it because it seems people are bothered more by this now-a-days. We did seem to have a herd of elephants staying over us for all 3 days but this was not the hotles fault - next time I will ask for a 3rd floor room. PS. If you have kids try to control them a little and not have them running and stomping around at 6:30am !! :)</p></li>

Day 1 -Got to the room and the doors had so many coats of paint on them that they barely closed. We were next to the elevator that by the way the expiration expired in 5/09. Beds were great. The room to the shower and the toilet was a sliding door that didn't lock. could hear everything in the room on the other side of the mirror. Day 2 ok so now we have bugs half pincher half roach looking things - ugly that is all I know. Called front desk was told that happens in the heat - i asked could they come spray - they said they did but the next day they were back!!! Day 3 - Ok I have has enough requested a new room Alex and the front desk was very very very helpful - he said not to worry he would fix it - we left for the day and when we got back to the hotel he placed us in the Business Room in the back of the hotel and had moved our luggage for us- great room with interior doors - and no Bugs. Day 4 - long day at Sea World and got back to the hotel at around 1am to find ourselves not able to get into our rooms - had to walk all the way abck to the front desk to find a very rude young man - that fixed our keys and not once said he was sorry about that. Pool was nice - need to replace some planters rusty and gross - Would I stay here again no and &@#* no! Oh and by the way the parking is the worst - I would rather pay at another hotel to insure that I had a space when I got back to the hotel at night</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wow! We were so impressed with the service we recieved as soon as we walked into the hotel. We both travel,however,my boyfriend is a seasoned traveler and travels extensively, nationaly/internationally. On a last minute whim,we decided to stay in San Diego and picked this hotel since it was inexpensive and close to the venue we were going to. We booked our room through Expedia on the phone,which turned into a nightmare...we arrived to the hotel and learned that the room we booked had been booked for the NEXT night! Well,after only getting more frustrated as we tried to rectify Expedia's mistake,we decided, that it was easier to just stay an extra night. Thankfully there was room.The gal at the front desk was so sweet and could see our frustration,she offered us the room at a very low discount rate for that night!! WOW,as if the rooms weren't already incredibly reasonable. From that point on we recieved 5star service...including phone calls to our room making sure we were pleased and comfortable.... YES and YES!! Our room was perfect for what we were paying..breakfast poolside was lovely..but most of all it was BLANCA,RALY and ALEX (and I know of 2 others whom names I did not catch,but I'll bet you know who you are:-) who made our last minute stay perfect!! So much so,that we have chosen to go back next week for 2 nights instead of heading to Santa Monica!!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">So we read different reviews on this hotel, including the one about a sink falling off and parking nightmares, so we really wondered how it would be when we got there. After checking in, we were anxious to get to the room to see if I needed to to go pay a visit to the front desk to change the room. Two things I noticed right away.......1) plenty of parking (although keep in mind this is a 3 story motel, with motel style parking), but common sense will tell you too that sometimes you might not get the space directly outside of your room. 2) Sink was secure to the wall. Phew!! So after I did the normal checking around the room I determined it was very clean and tidy. I did not find anything wrong. We used the pool in which was very clean and at the back of the property away from the street and you needed your room key to get in. A secure pool area. The onsite restuarant was convenient for the one night a meal and a couple of beers in the room was in order. I would come back and stay at this hotel, although price shop around on the hotel circle as all the hotels are right in one area and next door to each other. In my case I am a triprewards member so I wanted to stay in a property with rewards. If you are looking for a motel, then this has what you expect with additional perks of a microwave, fridge, coffee pot, iron, iron board, shampoos, lotions, soaps etc. and the "distressed travellers kit" which are the complimentary forgotten items like toothpaste, mouthwash, toothbrush, shaving items, all for just asking at the front desk. If this hotel comes up with a tempting price, consider.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">They were the MOST helpful I have ever experienced. When I arrived 3 hours early, they were able to provide me with a room. When I arrived to my room and realized that it was next to an elevator, and requested a room towards the middle of the building, they took care of it right away. Also, I had reservations to go horseback riding but could not remember what the name of the facility was. So, I called the front desk and they stepped away from the front desk and went over to their "public use" computer within their lobby and started to look up horseback riding for me! They must have been on there for at least 10 minutes asking me questions and trying to locate it. We ended up finding it by the way. I thought it was very nice of them to take the time to do that for me. They made my whole experience of staying at that hotel comfortable and accomodating. Unfortunately, I booked 2 days but needed 3 and was unable to book the third room due to high demand that weekend. However, the person that assisted me with locating the horseback riding facility gave me a number to a local agency there in San Diego that specializes in last minute deals. I called and was able to find another hotel just a few miles down the way for the same price. (The Days Hotel had a bigger cleaner room with a bigger, more comfortable BED!) This was my second time staying there this year, and I wouldn't stay anywhere else while in San Diego. Since their rooms are newly refurbished, they are very nice and clean. Plus their beds are the most comfortable I have slept on. For a 3-star hotel and price, you feel like you are staying at a 5-star......</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A friend and I stayed in this motel for 3 nights in August and initially was unhappy with the room we were allocated. The room upon arrival had a musty smell and could have done with a good airing prior to occupancy. When we pointed this out we were offered another bedroom which was only slightly better however this was easily remedied with a good household spray. The hotel is quite deceptive as it looks worn and in need of updating, definitely could do with a makeover! however what is offered as part of their service more than makes up for the appearance. The on site restaurant PAM PAM served up good well prepared meals although they take their time with your order which if you are having a leisurely day is fine. They will usually speed up if you tell them. The motel offers free shuttle bus service to and from the airport greyhound terminus and to some of the attractions. You have to book this by completing a form and submitting it the day before. The facilities also include free internet service and a pool with hot tub. This was a real bonus as it was great to be able to relax by the pool. They also had onsite laundry facilities which again was very handy. On the whole I enjoyed my stay in San Diego and although we did not have a car we were able to get around quite easily as the hotel is located near Trolley and bus stops and quite close to Old Town. The staff were generally helpful. I think for what we paid we got value for money and although I was a little put off by the outward appearance of the place It was always busy and full of people coming and going. Although, If I were to use this hotel again I would request the new block.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For some reason I was thinking this would be more of a hotel experience but, as the previous reviewer states, it is a motel with little frills. We were on the second floor so we weren't close too the parking noise but we did hear our upstairs neighbors walking. I felt bad for the neighbors below as we traveled with our 3 children so having them walk quietly was a challenge. We got a 2 queen room with a kitchenette. The beds were comfortable, and the small kitchen area was appreciated. The kitchen had a small 2 burner stove, with a mini fridge and small mircrowave. It was nice to have the silverware and dishes provided as well. Just wish they had provided more than just 3 of each with a family of 5. We had to have the kids eat first, then dish ourselves up. But we managed. The pool was nice and we did take advantage of that during our trip. The kids really enjoyed going during the weekend to attend the pool side movie they played. My only compliant is I wish they played the movie a little earlier. It didnt start till 830pm so wasn't over until close to 10pm. My younger two passed out both nights around 9pm so it wasn't worth it for them. And I have to agree, the resturaunt was not very good at all. We went because kids eat free so thought we would give it a try. The food wasn't very good and when we got our bill, were upset to find out that the Happy Hour specials were not combinable with the Kids Eat Free specials. The waiter or the flyer for the Happy Hour specials never mentioned this so we ended up paying full price instead. I don't know if I would stay at this hotel again. It's a great place if you don't plan on staying in your hotel at all except to sleep. With 3 young children, I think it was a little too cramped for us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just returned from a 7 night stay at Days Hotel Circle and I cannot find words to express how happy we were with our visit. Prior to our arrival I emailed the hotel because we were arriving late on Friday night of Labor Day weekend and I was concerned about possible problems with check in. Not only did I receive a gracious and prompt response, but was assured a room would be blocked for us on the upper level as requested and also we were upgraded to the business class room at no extra cost - all of this to ease my concerns about our late arrival. Customer service is primary at this hotel. The room was very nice, comfortable beds and exceptionally clean - large flat screen TV, refrigerator and microwave in all rooms. This was probably the best housekeeping service I can remember in any hotel we have stayed in - including cruise ships. Everyone was very helpful and the one problem we had with the air conditioner was fixed immediately. The breakfast we had in the adjacent restaurant (Pom Pom Cafe) was good and prices were reasonable. The pool area was very nice and pool was heated just enough to feel good. I had previous read some negative reviews about this hotel and can only say that the problems stated in those reviews were obviously not expressed to the management at the time of the visit - as I mentioned before, customer satisfaction is primary here and I'm sure problem would have been fixed if management knew about it. We certainly will return here on our next visit to San Diego and advise anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, convenient to all motel (they even have free airport pick up and shuttle service to Sea World and The Zoo which we did not use) at a reasonable price (free parking too) to definitely consider the Days Hotel Circle. It was a great vacation!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Myself and two friends chose this Days Hotel after extensively researching the options in the San Diego area. We were looking for a great value, clean, comfortable rooms, and great service for a stay of 5 nights/6 days. Boy did we find it! The front desk staff were always helpful in answering our many, many questions about the area and the shuttle drivers should be commended for their friendliness and flexibility. Even when looking to go to areas that weren't noted as specific shuttle locations (Old Town, nearby Fashion Valley Mall), they still offered to take and pick us up as their schedules allowed. For those worried about the WiFi availability, I didn't have a single problem with it whatsoever (and was located in the middle of the 2nd floor). I was taking an online class that extended through our stay and needed to submit daily assignments, as well as take a 2-hour exam one of the days. The connection was always stable, as well as the speed, even during peak traffic times such as the evening. I was actually quite surprised by this as some of the reviews speak negatively of the availability. This was the only location I accessed it from, however, so I can't be quick to say that I would have been just as lucky in other areas of the property. They also offer a wireless printing service, but I never personally used it. Overall, it was a fantastic experience. I feel as though people are often to quick to complain, as if they're specifically searching for flaws in the first place. In my experience with numerous hotel stays in the past, I would have to say this has been one of the best. Yes, the property is in need of a few renovations, but you'll find few hotels that aren't these days for such a great value! The pillows are soft, the rooms are very clean, and the staff always greeted us with a smile and a helpful answer.</p></li>

<li>For those worried about the <span style="background-color:#d0d0d0" title="p=0.999">WiFi</span> availability, I didn't have a single problem with it whatsoever (and was located in the middle of the 2nd floor).</br></br></li>
<li>I was taking an online class that extended through our stay and needed to submit daily assignments, as well as take a 2-hour exam one of the days.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#d0d0d0" title="p=0.994">connection</span> was always stable, as well as the speed, even during peak traffic times such as the evening.</li>
<li>The connection was always stable, as well as the <span style="background-color:#A00000" title="p=0.829">speed</span>, even during peak traffic times such as the evening.</br></br></li>
<li>I was actually quite surprised by this as some of the reviews speak negatively of the <span style="background-color:#d0d0d0" title="p=0.986">availability</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>This was the only location I accessed it from, however, so I can't be quick to say that I would have been just as lucky in other areas of the property.</br></br></li>
<li>They also offer a <span style="background-color:#d0d0d0" title="p=0.999">wireless</span> printing service, but I never personally used it.</br></br></li>
<li>Overall, it was a fantastic <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.998">experience</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>I feel as though people are often to quick to complain, as if they're specifically searching for flaws in the first place.</br></br></li>
<li>In my experience with numerous hotel stays in the past, I would have to say this has been one of the best.</br></br></li>
<li>Yes, the property is in need of a few renovations, but you'll find few hotels that aren't these days for such a great <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">value</span>!</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading reviews here I wasn't sure what to expect. So here's what I can tell you...first off check in was a breeze I was 1.5 hours early..no problem. Staff was very friendly and helpful they'll get tickets and book reservations for area attractions for you. Room was clean, beds were super comfy, Nice granite vanity tops. AC, refrigerator, Microwave, blow dryer, iron all worked well. Computer in lobby was helpful for printing boarding passes and show schedules for Seaworld. We used the hotel shuttle to visit Seaworld and it worked out just fine. It does run on a set schedule so reserve a seat the day prior. We never had any parking issues arriving back at the hotel around 10pm each night. It did appear that the hotel was full each night as the parking lot was full when I awoke each morning. We did most of our swimming at the beaches, which are very easy to get to from here. On one evening we got back around 9pm and went for a swim in the pool and used the hot tub..both get thumbs up. As for noise we didn't experience any though we were on the third floor with no one above us..and regarding highway noise......I never heard any, besides every hotel on hotel circle is along the highway so how can you single this one out. honestly with an AC running I never heard any offensive, annoying noise even with it off I didn't. We did eat breakfast each morning at the hotel restaurant and our plates were clean when we left. Never was around for lunch or dinner so can't say. Bottom line, I was looking for a clean, safe, comfortable place with a pool, close to all the attractions I was interested in seeing at a good price and that was exactly what I got...in fact knowing that many of the hotels in the area have been around awhile I set my expectations accordingly. You won't be WOW'd when you drive up but my expectations were exceeded. I found nothing wrong.</p></li>
