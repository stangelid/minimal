<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Those that don't like this place need to stay in their cookie cutter hotels. This place is really nice. OK the carpets are older but everything is clean. The rooms are nice with great AC. The pool is fantastic. Can't wait to come back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Sportsmen's Lodge is a throwback to the old days when the Valley was not wall-to-wall houses and strip malls. Usually, the accommodations are great, but this time we were put in the old wing. Although we were supposed to have a king bed, it was probably only fullsize, not even a Queen.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed there with a friend for 4 nights. Received good room service. Our room was non-smoking. Complimentary breakfast was nice. For the price we paid would have liked free internet too but that was not the case. Location was very central I would say to all 'touristy' places we wanted to visit. There were many restaurants nearby to eat at. My review title summarizes the deal.</p></li>

The on site restaurant was great & all the food we had was good. Don't care for the hold that gets put on your credit card.Especially since they had been paid & 9 days later the hold was released. Nor the 3 calls after check out to get my 25.00 food credit applied to my account.</p></li>

They have upgraded some things like the bed linen which is an improvement. My problem was with the carpeting not being clean, and the furniture was just okay and arranged in a haphazard way. No real style to the king bed room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here to try to beat the heat, as they have a large swimming pool. The pool area was very loud, like they are trying to create a party scene. My children did enjoy the swimming, but did not enjoy the loud music and too many people everywhere. The pool towels were gross, very hard to find a clean one. The room was yucky smelling. Bed was decently comfortable, but sheets had holes in them.</p></li>

It just felt like we were staying in a roadside motel in the '80s - and right next to the elevators, which were grinding away all night long.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Check in took a little longer than necessary only because the lovely gentleman at the counter wanted to make sure I knew everything the hotel had to offer. This isn't the most modern of hotels but my room was very nice. The bed was comfortable and I slept very well. VERY convenient if you're going to the Rose Bowl. Freeway close. Being a solo female traveler, I felt very safe. The cafe was very nice for breakfast. I'd rather pay for a good cafe breakfast than get a free cheesy continental!!</p></li>

My daughter left her Ipod in the room and we did not realize it until we got home. They sent it to us within 2 days, we thought that we would never see it again!! The location is great if you want to sightsee and there is plenty of places to park. It is such a welcome change from all of the craziness of Hollywood. Perfect to relax in after a long day!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here one night and it was a fine accommodation- a bit worn, but still fun. Great location on Ventura Blvd in Studio City in central location in San fernanco Valley. Lots of history relative to Hollywood actors visiting there and trout-fishing in bygone days in the golden era. Bobby Kennedy spent his last night there before his assassination. Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. Worth the stay just to see photos of glamorous actors of the past who stayed there back in 20's thru 60's.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The lodge is a great place to stay while visiting Studio City. It's in a great location if you're visiting nearby attractions such as Universal Studios. The lodge itself has a "aged", but very clean atmosphere to it that suits it well considering its history. The room was neat and clean with a relatively comfortable bed. The service staff was extraordinarily friendly and helpful.

After our previous trip to the USA we were surprised and pleased to see a fridge in the room. The swimming pool is just glorious - huge and really well maintained. The only downside was a bit too much noise from other rooms - stomping of feet from above and slamming of doors from the room beside us. Hard to tell if this would always be a problem or if we were just unlucky with our neighbours!</p></li>

We really had a great stay, overall. The food at the restaurant is good. If I stayed there again I would check in earlier in the day, stay on the outside of the hotel, not facing the pool (away from the people who smoke outside the restaurant) and take the kids to the pool. It would also be a great place to have an event. My 7 year old told me she wants to get married there. So cute.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was a great experience for us with two young kids. Location is very good if you have your own car and $10/day parking fee is reasonable. The area is good and feels safe at nights. Has few nice restaurants nearby. Recommends very much "rocco's" few blocks away. The rooms are spacious (except the bathroom) and has all necessary amenities. Staff is more than friendly and helpfull. The Patio cafe has great breakfasts. Pity it's not open evenings for dinner. The pool is just great, but the hot tub was not working. Shuttle to Universal is very convenient and free. Will surely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">i stayed here in 2009 as part of a tour group. the hotel was friendly and nice and clean. the room i had was spacious and clean. it was at the back of the hotel so was quiet at night. we had breakfast in the dining area, it was nice continental, they gave me a fruit salad that contained pineapple, i am allergic to it so told the waitress and she got the chef to make me one without the pineapple. the bar area was nice in the evening and we spent a while in there after a busy day sightseeing. theres some nice restaurants down the road that we ate at and really enjoyed. would definately stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Upgraded to a Suite (whatever that is nowadays- a room with a coffee table and 2 extra tables), smelled strong of paint thinner/acetone, complained, moved to room originally booked no smell. bath faucet will not stop leaking, worn out fixtures, scratched furniture, sign on balcony- (do not lean on handrail (!?!?!?), broken divider between patio's, very run down, this could be such a cool boutique hip Hollywood type place if they would fork out about 22 million, or bulldoze it and put a Residence Inn. I think it is just a mill for out of country tourists that are to far from home to complain or don't know any better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I could tell that the staff didn't have good communication. I was happy to know that they had a shuttle service to Universal Studios. We told them the times we wanted to leave and be picked up and no one had a clue. We ended up leaving 25 minutes late and the driver was sort or wreckless.When it was time to leave the park, my boyfriend and I rushed to the pick up area to be there on time for the driver. 10 minutes later I called the hotel to see if anyone was even coming to get us. "Oh, are you suppose to be picked up right now?" No one had a clue. So we sat in the sun for 20 minutes till finally someone came to get us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was here or the Marriott just down the road. Both places were close to our destination, but we thought we'd give the Sportsman's lodge a try since it didn't appear to charge for parking. However, they did charge for parking which made the stay only $14 less than our stay at the close by Marriott. The lodge had late 70's wall paper throughout in spite of a claim to have been newly renovated and had paint pealing off allover the exterior. The Marriott is a way more modern hotel with better accomodations and waaaaayyyyy nicer rooms. Great exercise room at the Marriott too. In short don't stay at the Sportsman's lodge unless you absolutely have to. It's a dump.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed at Sportsmen's twice a year for the past ten years and have always liked the hotel and its restaurant.. But we stayed four nights over this Thanksgiving weekend, and had the feeling that the place was g etting ready to close although the employees deny it. Only one of the two elevators was working and no sign of anyone trying to repair the other one. The once very good restaurant is only open for breakfast and lunch now and seemed to be seriously understaffed. We had just one breakfast there and we waited over 30 minutes for it to be served and then everything was stone cold. The management needs to decide whether to close it or operate it properly.</p></li>

It was a close walk to the shops on Ventura Boulevard and they offered a free shuttle bus to universal studios. The rooms aren't amazing but they were ok for our budget. The hotel is in need of renovation, the carpet and walls are very 80's but overall the customer service was great and the staff were very helpful. Try to avoid gettng a smoking room, they smell terrible and have the worst views. Luckily enough we were able to change to a non-smoking room after we caught sight of a number of spiders watching us from the corner.</p></li>

It turned out to be a nice experience again. The hotel is older and could use some updating, but it is a "lodge" look for a reason. The hotel was clean and comfortable and quiet for being on the busy street its on. Lots of room in the room, bed comforatble and hot water in the shower. The cafe had good food and was inexpensive considering its in a hotel and in LA. We didnt use the pool, but it looked very inviting and a good place to relax. Considering some of the recent replies here I guess we just got lucky? I wouldnt hesitate to stay here again though.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have to say that the Sportsmen's Lodge Hotel was one of the most comfortable "down to earth" places I have ever stayed. There is a certain benevolent feeling about the place.That lodge feeling allows you to forget that you are in the heart of the city. It feels more like you are out in the country somewhere. The rooms are clean and cozy. The beds in the rooms have been recently upgraded and so you don't have to worry about old rickety mattresses. The new down linens and pillows are a nice touch. What I liked most about the hotel was just the overall vibe, its unique, cool and casual. The staff there is great. Everyone is very warm and welcoming. I would definitely stay here again and would refer it to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Room was of a good standard and very clean. Yes there are areas that could be updated but it all works and is spotless. The staff were all friendly and helpful. No fridge in the room but when requested was put in the room within 10 minutes. Room service also very good. The pool is an excellent size and very warm and welcoming. The area the hotel is located in is easy to walk around with a supermarket opposite and many restaurants within walking distance. Would definitely recommend Twains on the corner for breakfast. A real old diner with great value food and friendly staff as well as locals. Make use of the shuttle from the hotel to universal soooo much easier than driving yourself. We will certainly stay at the Sportsman's again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I love this place. They don't even blink if you have a small dog. Where other places charge you fees of don't allow them at all, Sportsmen's Lodge is truly pet friendly. This is also a great value. Our parking was free, although they said it was $10. The pool is really big and inviting. There are so many places to eat and shop, all within walking distance. A large store across the street can net you all your snacks and drinks. Starbucks is across the street too. There are a couple of places to eat on site as well. We had a great breakfast in the cafe where the staff has worked for 50+ years. The entire place was very clean and spacious. People call this place, "Long in tooth" which would be true, but we just love Sportsmen's Lodge!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I grew up about a mile from the Sportsman's Lodge. I left L.A. in the early 80's. Whenever I visit, I always stay at the S.L. In the 50's/60's, you could catch trout in their lake, but those are days gone by, however the hotel is still as cozy as ever. If you're looking for a modern, upscale hotel, this isn't the place. The Sportsman's Lodge offers comfortable, clean rooms, many with balconies overlooking the pool. Get a bottom floor and your steps away from a gorgeous full length pool and pool bar. The coffee shops serves lunch and breakfast poolside. Laying by the pool reminds me of famous L.A. hotels gone-by. It definitely has an Los Angeles/Valley feel. For me, it's a cozy spot in the midst of fine restaurants a walking distance away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Yes, as already stated in so many other reviews, this is an older hotel. However, from our personal first time experience, for the rate we paid we found this hotel to be a good choice for visiting the areas many attractions. Our room was clean, the fridge looked new and was very handy.Bathroom was a little small, but this didn't bother us! There is a lovely large pool area, which never seemed to get too crowded. We found the reception staff friendly and helpful with our enquiries, and we had breakfast every morning in the restaurant and our server was always cheerful and attentive. The Sportsmens Lodge ran a free bus to Universal Studios, and we found this reliable. Based on our experiences this trip, we would stay again when visiting Hollywood.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room was spacious and the bathroom clean. It took a while whenever I had to deal with Reception, mainly waiting in line but this means of course that when your turn came, you were never rushed. They were friendly and helpful, arranging tours and providing local information. There is a coin operated laundry which was an absolute godsend, although there was no change machine within which meant you had to go and cue back at reception to get change. The pool was the central (surrounded on all sides by the hotel) and large with a pool bar and snacks. The restaurant had strange opening times (open for breakfast but not dinner) but did a good breakfast and room service was reasonable and prompt. Very centrally located in Studio City and no problems with parking.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My stay with the Sportsmen's Lodge was excellent. The greeting by the hotel staff was the first level of excellence. My room was squeakly clean and the bed was so comfortable. The grounds are unbelievable, once you pull in the parking lot it is easy to forget that you are in the city. As you explore the poolside area and see the area that is available for outdoor events you will be amazed and the buffers for sound like the waterfalls and foliage. Yes, it is a beautiful spot for an outdoor event. Parking in LA is a huge issue, the Sportsmen's Lodge has ample parking. The Sportsmen's Lodge has been chosen as our host hotel for the upcoming Welcome Home to Jericho Charity Event scheduled for April 2009 and I am extremely pleased this hotel has been our winning choice!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Lodge because the rates were good compared to other hotels in the area. The room was clean. The staff was very friendly. The decor is a bit 'tired' and shabby. Overall, though, it was a clean, pleasant stay EXCEPT when it came to getting business done. The wireless service was spotty, especially in the mornings. I wouldn't have minded paying for it if it had worked properly. Will I stay again? Not sure. Great deal for tourists but not necessarily for business folks. One additional note. I saw some of the other reviews where guests complained about the decor, the food, etc. Come on, folks, what are you expecting for prices like this? You want five-star hotel services, book a room at $300/night hotel. This is a decent, relatively inexpensive place to stay.</p></li>

For this New Yorker who doesnt drive, that is KEY! I can literally walk to my cousins place on Ventura. The staff is always welcoming and super friendly, they treat you as if you were family. And the waitress in the Patio cafe always remembers me from my last visit. I try to get out to visit LA 2-3 times a year and I have to admit that sometimes that 3rd visit is strictly for the AMAZING POOL. They are also very interacive with their social networking. I posted a comment on their Facebook page and received 3 comments back within a couple of hours. It shows there is someone listening, not just speaking. :-) LOVE IT!!!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We knew that Sportsmen's Lodge would be a green haven in the middle of busy Ventura Boulevard, but we didn't anticipate the disruption of events planned and unplanned: a wedding reception that careened loudly into the early hours of the morning, and a thunderous two-day rain that drenched much of the lobby and outdoors and caused the public areas to fill up, literally, with furniture in various stages of drying. Our first room, right beside the first floor exit, was intolerably noisy (the wedding? normal traffic? who knows), and at our request we were cheerfully switched to a 3rd floor room that was quite comfortable. There was free internet and the staff was friendly and supportive, but next time we'll stay at the Beverly Garland Holiday Inn, where such surprises are few.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent one night at the Sportsmans Lodge. It's an older place, been around over 30 years. Nice place, kept up nice. My only comment, if you're not on the top floor just cross your fingers that the room above you doesn't have kids in it. It sounded like the entire 1st Marine Division was marching through the room. The sounds are not muffled at all and I suppose it's because it's not built to the modern standards of some places today. One complaint, when we made our reservation we were told that check-in is 3pm. We arrived at 3:15 and discovered that our room was not ready yet. The place didn't look that full either. Especially when we visited the restaurant for desert around 8pm. The place looked like a ghost town. On the positive side, beds were comfortable and the room was nice.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Maid stole my wife's clothes & hotel is shabby anyway”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I spent the first weekend in December there for a family function in the area and thought the place was nice. When we got home, my wife found that $1,200 of her jewelery and clothing was missing. We called the hotel to complain and said they would check to see who took care of our room. We called back and they told us that the maid who cleaned our room had suddenly left for Cuba (for family issues). We asked them to reimburse us for the stolen items and they referred us to their insurance carrier (Certus Claims) who referred us back to the hotel. I complained to the hotel and they wouldn't speak to me except to say to speak with Certus. Certus refuses to pay for anything. I am going to have to sue them in small claims court. I thought the maids are supposed to be bonded. Maybe they have illegals there???</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is located within 10-20 min to all the top spots in Hollywood, Beverly Hills etc. it is a smaller hotel, rooms are small for 4 people, especially the bathrooms are very tiny. The pool is large, the jacuzzi as well.The main problems is the missing enthusiasm of the staff. Around the pool it could last hours until garbage, and used plates are taken care of. Leaves of the tree were continuously falling down but I only saw once a person who fixed that. The restaurant is ok, but also here one has to ask for everything by oneself, nobody is taking care about the guest by himself. The hotel needs urgently restauration. If sombody wants to invest and is keen to make something out of it. I would consider this one really as a hidden jewel, based on the locationnd and the style which is so different from the usual hotel chains</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The rooms were paper thin, lots of partys going on until early morning hours in the hotel and around the pool even though the pool states it closes at 9:00PM. No cafe until Thursday for dinner, their cafe is not open throughout week and when it is open it closes at 2:00PM and does not reopen. You could hear people in the rooms next to you and above you. Actual conversations. People in the hallways slamming doors, laughing and partying. Not only do you pay for your room but have to pay to park your car in their parking lot $11 per day. You are charged a $250 deposit so in case you smoke in the room they charge you a cleaning fee. Even if you did not smoke it takes over a week for them to credit back your card. They state it is done at check out but do not plan on seeing the credit for up to 2 weeks. I still have not seem mine.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My sister lives in Sherman Oaks and recommended this hotel. It is a great deal on a budget, so if no frills is what you need this fits the bill. We stayed here three nights for the Thanksgiving break and would recommend. I don't mind cheap and a little worn as long as it's really clean, and it was really clean. The rooms are really basic and we ate in the cafe one night and it was...okay, just like the rest of the hotel. Stay here if you are going to be out and about most of the time. I think in the summer, for families, it might be really fun because children would do well here and there is a huge pool with containment. Little things will go wrong (our door key) but the people are nice and you can't beat the price. We ate at the little sushi place next door, and it was also okay. Lots of locals in there. We'll stay here again.</p></li>

Room decore was spars but very large for its size. Rooms were clean but not 4 star hotel clean. Clearly renovations from years of neglect was still in work. As for bring children would be fine but keep an eye on them at all times as there is plenty of trouble to get into given the renovations or lack ther of. I did not see a security gaurd to speek of but felt pretty safe given that the area is safe by Los Angales standards.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I made my reservation thru the hotels website and had the confirmation letter in my HAND on my ipad. We came all the way from NC, traveled all day only to be told "your reservation was cancelled". The unemotional, cold front desk person would not tell me how or why. I did not cancel it so who did. He offered me a smoking room but we have asthma so that is not a good thing. I mentioned that it did not appear they were booked solid since the large parking lots were empty. He said there were tour buses. I went back there to check after we found another hotel and ate dinner. NO BUSES at 9pm. I have to say that after seeing and smelling the lobby I did not regret not staying there. It smelled bad and looked really dirty and in disrepair. There is something wrong at this hotel. In case there is a need for my proof of this here is my confirmation # 136616503</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I reserved a room in the hotel for my parents for one night, Dec. 18. They were hosting a Sweet 16 party for my daughter in the Event Center that night, and due to my father's recent knee surgery, they couldn't stay at my house as they usually did( I have steps up to the house). When I called the reservations desk, I told them of the situation, and requested a room with a handicap toilet. I was then offered, by the reservation clerk, a handicap room, with a walk-in shower, that he could easily get into. I was very appreciative of her consideration. However, when they checked in that day, they were given a room with a tub shower, and were told that the reservation didn't specify a handicap room. This created stress and an uncomfortable experience, on a night that should have been joyful for us all, I will never suggest to anyone that they stay at your hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Yes this hotel is in the old style but we loved it. The room was comfortable for 3 of us with plenty of space and it was clean. The service at the front desk was generally very good. We used the free shuttle service to Universal Studios and they also booked us tickets.From the bedroom we had a view of the pool and the hills beyond which I would recommend asking for. The pool was big and warm. At night they put candles around the pool which made it look very attractive. When we were there they were just about to host their annual cowboy gathering ( real ones and film ones!) and so there was some nice singing around the pool by men in stetsons! We also got chating to a guy who claimed he was a TV director- real LA!! Breakfast was served in the restaurant and you could order food around the pool. I have not given this hotel 5 because the restaurant and bar shut at 9pm!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My short stay at the Sportsmen's Lodge was fair. Check-in was efficient and parking was easy. Unfortunately the hotel is very outdated, with tiny elevators and dirty carpet in the hallways. My room was nice but I had expected there would be a small refrigerator, but there was not, and ice machines are only located on the first floor, which is an inconvenience. The pool is wonderful. The business center is pathetic and the fee for using the PC in the so-called "business center" is the most grossly overpriced I have ever seen anywhere. (I could go down the street and use the PC at FedEx/Kinkos for about 35% cheaper than the ripoff fee this hotel charges.) Also, all night long I could hear people in the room above mine stomping around on their floor -- I almost expected the ceiling in my room to fall in. When I am back in the Studio City area, I doubt I will stay in this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We pre booked two rooms for 3 nights on our PCH adventure from San Fran To Las Vegas primarily to visit Universal Studios.The staff were very helpful. Whist the hotel charges for parking ,this cost is off set by the complimentary shuttle bus to Universal Studios. ( Which as we found after a fun packed day, has a shopping precinct attached with all the bars and restaraunts and street entertainment. making for a great night out after if you have the stamina)) We found the rooms to be clean,quiet and comfortable. Great pool and jacuzzi with a busy pool bar. Busy as it was the only bar open! Good supermarket across the road for supplies and enough places to eat in the local area. well place to visit Santa Monica, Malibu, Paradise Cove and downtown LA.Good breakfast in the mornings with a wide choice. We enjoyed our stay, thought it was good value for the money,and would recommend to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We liked our stay here. It sort of trying for a cool ratpack kinda vibe. Although the hallways and lobby are a little shabby and the balcony railing was in sad disrepair our room was very clean and comfortable. . The staff was very accommodating. The pool is big and clean but many of the deck chairs were in need of repair. If you want quiet, don't get a pool room. there is a DJ on the weekends and it is a big party atmosphere. Great people watching if you are into that. We like the location right on Ventura Blvd. Easy access to Hollywood, B Hills, Universal Studios etc. If you are looking for luxury, this is not it. But if you just want a place to rest your head and maybe take a swim after a long day of theme parks and sightseeing its ok. Oh, and no exorbitant parking fees...in fact, no parking fee at all. So when you see the advertised price you don't have add 25 or 30 dollars a day plus tips.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed at a number of places in the Los Angeles area and the Sportsman's Lodge is my favorite for the price. With an advance booking, I was able to get a room for less than $100 a night and the property is outstanding for that price. The facility is a little old. The rooms don't have flat screens and they feel a little dated. But that doesn't bother me. I'm more about location and cleanliness, and the Sportsman's Lodge is in a great Studio City neighborhood and the place is extremely well kept. Also, the grounds are absolutely beautiful. The pool area is nice and all outdoor areas are great. In short, if you're just looking for a nice, quiet place to stay and don't require a flat screen TV and a room that looks like it was decorated yesterday, you'll love the Sportsman's Lodge. As long as the price range stays similar, I plan to return later this year when I take the family to Universal Studios.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were in LA for my kids nomination for the Young Artist Awards in March. We choose this hotel because the event was at the Sportsman Lodge so it was convenient. The hotel was charming, the staff was very pleasant, the garden was beautiful. But the room we were initially given on the 2nd floor was not too clean. We walked into the room and the carpet had stains by the door, but that was not the doozer, my husband saw a bed bug crawling around the bed sheet and I immediately called down to the front desk and ask for another room. We were given a room on the 5th floor overlooking the pool :) I guess the bedbug landed us a better room. The 2nd room was fine, no bedbugs! We checked by pulling the bedsheets off and checking around the mattress seams! Yuck! Other then that, it was a pleasant stay. Plus my daughter won an acting award for her catagory! I can't recommend this hotel because of the bedbugs, sorry.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wow!, I've stayed here twice in the past month. First, there are better priced hotels. This is a family hotel or more a hotel for senior citizens. The photos give the impression that its this trendy Hollywood hotel in Studio city. Get over it real quick. The carpet is dated in the halls and rather than place it they just steam decades of cigarette smoke and what ever out leaving a constant stench in the hallways. There's literally 20 shades of floral wall paper all over the place, the rooms look more like a Florida condo rental, the room service is horrible and way over priced, and the service makes you feel like you're standing in line at KMart. Let me why. I was standing in line in the lobby at the front desk when a girl behind the desk yelled out, "I can help the next customer in line". Need I say any more. Bottom line, this is an over priced hotel with a staff that has no idea what real "hotel' guest services are.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose the Sportsmen's Lodge as the most convenient place to stay for our friends' wedding this month; the ceremony and reception were both at the Event Center next door. The grounds were lovely for the wedding, and we found the location to be excellently sited for all we were doing for the weekend. The rooms are frankly just a touch worn in a spot or two, but they were spotlessly clean each of the four days we stayed, and we always felt safe -- both VERY important to us, much more so than up-to-the-second decor, and we consider that to be the biggest contributions to the great value! And the mattress and bedding were soooooo comfortable.... Wonderful! Even after we had left, when I realized I had left one item behind and called from the road to have it sent, Jose at the front desk was great and had it shipped to me immediately. Clean, convenient, comfortable and courteous: I'd definitely stay here again with no question!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for a couple of nights as part of a nearby conference at the CBS Studio Center. Sportsmen's Lodge was conveniently located with lots of nearby places within walking distance. Check-in was smooth and staff was friendly and the room was clean and spacious (a king sized bed). Bathroom was very clean, to me the sign of a well-kept place. Plenty of parking available in front, side and back. Room was quiet enough to sleep although I tend to be a pretty sound sleeper. While I was awake, I could hear people in the hallway who were talking but at night it was quiet. Also, free wireless internet was available so that was a nice surprise. The web site didn't really point out that so I was assuming it was only available for a fee so I was pleasantly surprised. Overall, a great place to stay after a long day out at a conference. I think in the future I may try to stay with family as there is a free shuttle to and from Universal Studios Hollywood.</p></li>

It's not a bad place to stay. The room was comfortable and clean, the food was good and the pool was great. We just get the feeling each time that management doesn't care enough to take a hotel with such great potential that extra step, particularly in a city as sophisticated as L.A.! The first thing we noticed when we got there was the smell in the lobby. Was it mildew or just old carpeting? The bathroom off the lobby was even worse. The gift shop was another disappointment with dusty old products with unknown brands we would never consider buying We had to ask for new pillowcases because the ones we got were so yellow. Fortunately, our room was very quiet and we got a good night's sleep. If you are used to three star hotels, you'll probably think it's fine.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">With six kids at home, Sportsmen's is just ten minutes away from home, so we love to come here for an overnight getaway whenever possible. On our last stay we had a third floor pool view room. Very nice. The tropical landscaping outside the patio windows was beautiful. Next time we're going to try a ground floor room with direct access to the pool and poolside lounge. The bed was so comfy and I really enjoy the Bath and BodyWorks toiletries. The room was very clean and the temperature was great. We didn't bring the kids on this trip, but judging by the kids who were in the pool, they were having a great time. The music by the pool during the day was lots of fun. Great sized pool, so it never felt crowded. My only complaints...I always get frustrated with having to pay for parking, but considering the great rate we got using the hotel's website, it took the sting out of it. And I wish they would install inside door latches. Definitely a pleasant and relaxing weekend getaway!</p></li>

I drive there so I need convenient parking; I smoke so I need a smoking room; I bring my laptop so I need internet access. It's gotten very hard to find a reasonably priced hotel with those features anywhere near my family in Beverly Hills. I'm very glad to have found the Sportsmen's Lodge, an unpretentious but comfortable survival of the relaxed "old LA" I used to know. It's close to good restaurants of all kinds, there's a supermarket across the street, it's not that far from BH, just over Coldwater Canyon. My room was comfortable (very quiet even though it faced Ventura Blvd.), the plumbing was wonderful (how do they get away with all that water pressure in the shower?), the service was excellent, the price was very right (even with the $10/night parking fee). The only downside was a very slow but functional wifi connection that cost $9.95/day. I will definitely stay there on future trips to LA. Highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed at the Sportsmen's Lodge while in town for business. Everything about the hotel is just ok. It has very outdated decor and facilities but it is certainly livable if you are only staying a few days. The room was generally clean but we did find a roach in the bathroom, which did not seem to surprise the people at the front desk. The walls between rooms must be paper thin as normal conversations were audible from the next room and hallway. The "rental facility" associated with the hotel states that it has been recently renovated but you could have fooled me. The landscaping around the facility consists of a very dirty brook and fountain. The Wi-Fi is free in the rooms but the charges to use the outdated and slow computers in the business center are ridiculous. The redeeming quality of this hotel is its location and friendly staff. Although there is not transportation to or from LAX it is right across from a grocery store and minutes for the studios. The staff in the cafÃ© and front desk were all helpful and upbeat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Sportsmen's Lodge for work for 3 nights. The hotel feels somewhat like it has been stuck in 1962, complete with kitschy astroturf ringing the pool. The room that I had was on the 3rd floor and faced the pool. This only presents a problem if you want to get to sleep early as the pool is frequented until about 11pm. Room and furnishings appear to have been updated within the last few years and were quite clean and well kept. Hallways and lobby are beginning to show their age but are quite clean. The hotel restaurant was under renovation during my stay so a temporary dining room had been set up in one of the hotel's conference rooms. The wait staff still appeared to be ironing out the details of this change. As I only had breakfast (cereal and fruit) at the hotel I can't comment on the quality of the food though the selection looked decent for all meals. Staff at reception were quite friendly and happily made taxi reservations to the airport, etc. Overall the hotel is comfortable, clean and offers a decent value for LA area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I lived in LA for years and was always obsessed with the Sportsmen's Lodge every time I would pass by, so this May when I returned to LA for a wedding my wife and I decided to stay here (the price was definitely right). What a great hotel (it's not the four season's but we already know that) Our room, a poolside king, was enormous, and needless to say clean, being able to sit out on the private patio and drink coffee in the morning was wonderful. And the restaurant had really fantastic breakfasts - I mean really good breakfasts - If I still lived in LA I would go there (Hat tip to Moe - our favorite waiter). We also enjoyed the giant pool - which has a decidedly old California feel too it - with people actually laying out in the sun and ordering drinks from the bartender. Most of our activities took us to Hollywood and or Downtown and it was very convenient for both. The downside would be that on Saturday they rented the pool area to birthday party with a DJ who blasted music and when we returned late Saturday afternoon to relax before going out again it was a little loud.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent three nights at the Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City. We booked this hotel without reading reviews as we had previously stayed here with our children but that was ten years ago. The pool is still fabulous and we enjoyed our breakfasts in the cafe as well as poolside service. The room seemed so tired and outdated. The carpet was an unusual colour - perhaps faded green? Definitely needs to be replaced! We had an adjoining room (big mistake I know!) and it was fine for the first two nights but the third night we could hear the other family's conversations loud and clear. There wasn't much on tv tho so it was rather entertaining : ) Staff was friendly and helpful although we did have to explain that CAA is the same as AAA so that we didn't pay the parking fee. We had no internet connection during our entire visit and when my husband called for tech support he was basically told it was our ipad. We found that hard to believe as we overheard other guests saying they also had no access. The free shuttle to Universal and the fabulous pool almost make up for the dowdy room. Almost.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at this hotel a number of times and have never had a problem, thus the reason I returned. The staff in the Patio Cafe were great!! The room was clean and the staff (front desk excluded) was extremely nice. I did have a problem with my room key. Three times I had to get a new key and was blamed each time for it not working. My room had no refrigerator and I contacted the front desk twice with no results. Also, and my biggest complaint......I had requested a room with a pool view (an additional $10 per night.) I did get a room on the pool side, however, my balcony was boarded up so that you could not see out. Seems the original railing was so rotted that for safety reasons boarding was placed. So sitting on the balcony, my view consisted of....... nothing. Upon check out I asked to be credited the $30 for my non-existent pool view. I was told the room was on the pool side, deal with it. Granted it was only $30 and at the very least an apology for the misunderstanding should have taken place. The woman's attitude at the front desk was callous at best. She showed very poor customer service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location in Los Angeles, near all the main sights. Rooms were clean and tidy. If in a room of four you would have two large beds which you share and are big enough. We many not have had a great view but the room was all you need, clean,comfortable, tidy, large and balcony. The pool was clean and lit up at night and also had an outdoor jaccuzi around the back. If you stay here the night time food is not great but if you want to visit LA why not eat out? The hotel must not be that bad if it was used to film an episode of 'the office' and season 2 episode remember (1) here. When I visited the sportsmans lodge had just had the lobby redecorated. The hotel is quiet and has a big supermarket across the road. Doors locked fine and were safe, there is also a lift here if you need it.From this hotel we visited - Universal studios, Hollywood - the stars and famous handprints - Rhodeo drive - Beverly hills- Venice muscle beach and santa monica pier. Did not get a chance to roam around the lodge very much but hear there is a nice gardens. Overall, the room is great for a shower and sleep at night and to explore throughout the day.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were here for business and friends. I was very disturbed when checking in on Saturday night. The hotel's crowd seemed like something between a swinger scene and a biker bar, complete with inebriated older women hitting on older men. That's not what you want with little kids. It was very disconcerting and upsetting. The pool water was very murky. Grounds are nicely kept. More kids did show up while we were there, but this is definitely not a family atmosphere. The carpet was stained and clearly not cleaned in a long time, the ceiling in the shower was bowed - seemed to be from humidity and/or mildew. The room was always far more humid than outside. The cleaning crew often didn't replenish something... one day it was washcloths, a few times it was shampoo, soap, etc. This hotel charges about $10 for Internet Access, $10 for parking, and ridiculous amounts of money for the "media center" use ($3 just to get the computer to turn on). There aren't any snack machines! So, at 11pm when we wanted a candy bar, we were referred to the gas station next door or the grocery store across the street. We didn't get around to the restaurant, but it seemed to be popular.</p></li>

<li>The <span style="background-color:#4363d8">carpet</span> was <span style="background-color:#4363d8">stained</span> and clearly not cleaned in a long time, the ceiling in the shower was bowed - seemed to be from humidity and/or mildew.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#911eb4">room</span> was always far more <span style="background-color:#911eb4">humid</span> than outside.</br></br></li>
<li>The cleaning crew often didn't replenish something... one day it was washcloths, a few times it was shampoo, soap, etc.</br></br></li>
<li>This hotel charges about $10 for Internet Access, $10 for parking, and ridiculous amounts of money for the "media center" use ($3 just to get the computer to turn on).</br></br></li>
<li>There aren't any snack machines!</br></br></li>
<li>So, at 11pm when we wanted a candy bar, we were referred to the gas station next door or the grocery store across the street.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed here two times with my family and we couldn't have been more satisfied with the place. I'll admit that it is outdated, for the most part, although some rooms were renovated a couple of years ago but the rooms remain very clean and spacious. The hotel has two restaurants, one casual and the other white tablecloth, and both offer excellent food at reasonable prices. The Olympic-size pool is wonderful for serious swimmers and frolickers alike, and a cute tiki bar offers every favorite libation. The grounds around the hotel could use some sprucing up, though. Some staff members seemed a little indifferent to the needs of guests but most were nice enough. The neighborhood is safe and walkable with many restaurants and shops located up and down Ventura Blvd., including a Ralph's grocery store just across the street that is open 24 hours. The location, itself, is very convenient to any other area attractions that beckon tourists. I highly recommend staying here if you don't mind a laid-back, unpretentious atmosphere. The rates are reasonable and the parking is free, which normally isn't the case in the LA area. I would definitely stay here again and again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For those on a tight budget this is a good place to stay-We had just drove from San Francisco to LA and after a disappointing stay at our last hotel I was worried about the standard of this hotel because it was rated a 'star' lower. However we were greeted by friendly and helpfull staff although we were booked into smoking rooms, (not the fault of the hotel it was the travel companys fault). They made sure the rooms were still ok for us and I can say we were pleased with the overall quality. We arrived late but they informed us that there was a free shuttle bus going to Universal Studios in the next hr and could at least find our bearings and have a look around tonight. The staff printed maps and specific locations that we required for the following day/s and the bar was small but pleasant after a long day out. Starbucks and a great basic shopping centre across the road and various eating places in walking distance made this a great location. A taxi back from the 'Walk Of Fame' only cost $15 dollars so you can stay out longer without having to worry too much about getting back to catch the last shuttle from Universal Studios at 8pm. We didn't use the pool but had a balcony to catch the sun and relax.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and my Wife stayed at this three star hotel for four night in January 2009 and was good value for money at $80 (Â£60) a night. It was close to Universal studios of which the hotel runs a courtesy bus and only 6 miles from Hollywood boulevard ($15 in a taxi) with the hotels there costing three times as much, so this was good value. We have stayed in many luxury hotels and the rooms at this hotel were comparable. The outdoor pool was heated in the winter with a hot jacuzzi poolside. On appearance we thought the hotel looked like a cheap motel, but this hotel really was of good standard for what we paid, certainly better than motel standard. It had a moderately priced restaurant, with an internet room, and a hair salon. Outside the hotel across the roads there was a starbucks, and down to the left there was an excellent 24 hour diner called jerry's. There was also a ralph's shopping center across from the hotel for those essentials. To conclude the best feature of the hotel was the room and the hot swimming pool, everything else was just better than average, but for the price and for the locality to universal and hollywood, i would recommend to those budget seekers looking for decent but affordable standards.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our second stay at the SLH was as pleasant as the first, (6/10). We choose this location because of it's proximity our daughter's home. Once again we found staff and accomodations to be above expectations. Although the Lodge is an older property and showing signs of age, it is clean and the rooms have always been very clean and comfortable. Our flight into LA had us arriving well after 10:00 PM, yet we found the staff to be welcoming and friendly. We had booked the studio suite poolside, and found it to be quite roomy with a couch and chair/ottoman. Windows lined one wall with views of the pool and the hills across Ventura. We noted when we got to the room, that the refrigerator was not there as had been the expectation..a call to the front desk brought an attendant with the fridge within 15 minutes! We also received exceptional service from housekeeping staff, pool bar, and Cafe staff! I have even observed maintenance staff working to clean around the pool and parking lot areas well into the evening. The price of the rooms seems to be reasonable for the area. The only suggestion I might make is to possibly update and spruce up the hallways a bit, and to repair the balcony railings as they were very wobbly, and I would be a bit worried about the safety issues!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had a good weekday stay at this hotel. Rooms were very clean and spacious for 2 guests. Hotel decor very outdated/stained but beds were new and comfortable and that's what mattered. Was a bit worried with no wall between patio decks but kept the patio door locked at all times to alleviate those worries. Friendly and prompt wait staff at the restaurant each morning. The "free" breakfast was pretty limited but got us going. Pool was wonderful, hot tub a little small but manageable. Drinks at poolside was very expensive but what bar in CA isn't. Many reviews stated loud on the weekends but our stay during the middle of the week was very quiet. Hotel a bit difficult to get out of on a busy Ventura Blvd. but not impossible. Shuttle to Universal was prompt and very convenient. Only real negative was the room service. Tried to order the pizza special but no luck. Called and no answer the first try, 2nd attempt they put us on hold for several minutes. Finally called the front desk and they referred us to a ma and pa pizza joint...pretty sad to lose business but in the end, great pizza. We did the Universal package (free park, free breakfast, 7 day tickets) which was a good value for a 2 night stay but if I had to pay the $159.00+ nightly rate, I would look elsewhere or keep watching for a better deal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were supposed to move rooms because we asked for a king and they put us in doubles. While we were at dinner they moved our luggage to another room. When we went back to the original room all of our stuff was gone. When I went to the desk they looked at me like I was crazy, they had switched staffing and no one communicated to one another where our luggage was. After 45 minutes if calling around they finally found our luggage. By this time my wife was already asleep in the original room so we slept there. The next morning we decided to move into the pool side king room that was finally given to us. There was a massive no smoking sign on the door but when we walked in the room wreaked so bad of smoke that my wife immediately ran into the bathroom and began throwing up in the toilet. Once she was done she had to stay out on the porch to get fresh air until I went back to the desk and figured out what to do. The desk told me they didnt have a room right then but they would move our stuff (again) to the new room when it was ready. We had planned on staying two nights and I told him we would like to check out then and skip the second night. He didn't even seem surprised by any of this, didn't offer a free night, sincere apology or anything. Overall it was the worst experience I have ever had at a motel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Firstly, the hotel itself was great, and the front desk staff was very friendly and helpful . If i weren't for the below, I would definitely stay again. I booked the reservation 2 days before my arrival and made it clear that I needed a quiet room. Upon check-in, I again requested a quiet room, and was assured that my room was in a quieter area. The next night, one of the loudest outdoor parties I have ever experienced took place in their courtyard (adjacent to every room in the hotel.) It was a birthday party which included live music (complete with a man on a loud-speaker accompanying the music) and cheering, dancing, etc. This went on until 11:15 PM. Unfortunately, my evening of heavy work and hopes to be asleep by 9:30 were over. At one point, I was speaking on the phone to the airline, discussing my early morning flight, when the lady on the other end of the phone asked me to turn down my music, because she could not hear me well! My question is: why, when the party was surely booked two days before, when I made the reservation, was it not mentioned when, I repeatedly asked for a quiet room? It left me with the feeling that the management cares more about the money from their parties than satisfying their hotel guests. I would have gladly returned if they had been honest and recommended a nearby hotel. Also, the business center is deficient and very expensive.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Sportsmenâ€™s Lodge Hotel More than lodging. This is a slice of L.A. life. Weâ€™re natives who have moved on, but go back each year to see family in the Valley. The week we stayed there was some sort of Change-Your-Life seminar there. The place was crawling with showbiz wannabes and never-was-es. One guy, his jeans legs rolled up like Perry Smithâ€™s in the movie â€œIn Cold Bloodâ€� spent the entire time sleazing around the pool trying to promote his project (â€œJulia Roberts is interestedâ€�) from anybody he could nail, including the hotelâ€™s security guard. There was also a lady with a leopard-skin cushion on which she carried two little dogs. Lots of bands stay there, as the parking lot has room for tour buses; not the stars, just the sidemen and road crews, and they hit the pool bar early. We eavesdropped on a group therapy session being held in the coffee shop, too. In other words, you know where you are when you stay here. Make no mistake â€“ this is C-list L.A. So much more amusing than the studio tours. The rooms are large and comfortable. The coffee shop is excellent; the lox is as good as Jerryâ€™s deli up the street, at half the price. The entire hotel staff does a good job and is unobtrusive. And, best of all, you donâ€™t have to be perfect to appear in a swimsuit here â€“ there are plenty of red-state tourists in residence, and believe me they look worse than you. All this for a reasonable (for L.A.) price â€“ if you have to be in the Valley or Studio City or Burbank, itâ€™s a great choice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is approx. 35 minutes from LAX airport (shuttle buses take longer, but are cheaper). The staff are helpful, but service is rather slow (it took 3 days for my pre-ordered fruit basket to arrive). My double king room was spacious and comfortable. Having a fridge means you can stock up on breakfast foods/snacks (there's a supermarket across the street). However, the decor is dated - the country lodge look is too dark and heavy for sunny LA and could do with a revamp. And internet service is $10 per day, when it should really be free, considering the price of the room. I suggest that you book this hotel at least a month in advance so you get the Advance Purchase rate, which is much more reasonable. (The peak rates are ridiculous for a 3 star hotel!). I had a rather uninspiring street view from my balcony, but pool view rooms are probably too noisy, with the DJ playing by the pool all afternoon, kids splashing around until quite late and rowdy adults at the pool bar in the evenings! For a hotel that welcomes many international guests, they can only cash $50 worth of travellers cheques each day, which was rather frustrating! This hotel is excellently located for trips to Universal Studios (tickets and transport arranged by the hotel) and Warner Bros Studios (I highly recommend the Warner Bros VIP Tour!) And it's not far from the nightlife in West Hollywood. But it's a very long drive to the beaches, what with the incessant traffic. As such, I'd recommend hiring a car, or you'll spend all of your allowance on taxis! (Although it is $10 a day to park at the hotel!)</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were "upgraded" upon our arrival to poolside. Little did we know that there would be people sitting at tables ten feet from our sliding door talking loudly for hours. The worse part was the series of live lounge singers with electric guitars and amplified music - at "POOLSIDE" who sang REALLY LOUD until 11 pm. (It was a Friday night.) We've stayed at a lot of hotels and this kind of thing has never happened to us. We called the front desk and asked to change rooms but were told that they were all booked up. They said the music ended at 10 pm....then later when we called they said it ended at 11 pm. This is the first hotel review I've ever written; I felt compelled because this experience was so bad. It's the kind of thing where you keep telling yourself, "This is insane!" I paid $200 per night for what I thought would be a quiet night in a convenient location near where I was conducting some business. Instead I ended up in front row seats FOR THREE HOURS to a series of poolside singers - none of whom were very good. The room was nonsmoking but smelled like cigarettes, although that happens at a lot of hotels. There was one good part to the stay - after we realized we were "stuck" in that room - we laughed a lot since the singing was comical - especially the one who sounded like he was from The Godfather and sang "O Solo Mio" really LOUD. We had friends staying on the back alley side of the hotel and they couldn't hear the music, so if you have to stay here and want a quiet room and a good night's sleep book at that end of the hotel. Good luck! Half of the hotel's rooms are "poolside."</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Because we have family near this hotel, we have stayed their often over a 15 year period.. Each time we go, something isn't working - this time it was one of the two elevators servicing a large part of the hotel. These are small elevators, and they have to be used to transport laundry and cleaning trucks of the staff and the guests. The elevator that was broken had been broken for over month (see other reviews to confirm this). There was a sign on the door of the elevator that it was temporarily out of order. This is dishonesty. We were there on an off week. There were very few cars there when we came back to our room late at night, yet they charged us $10 a night to park, something that should have been waived during this period. They were skimpy with soap (i bar), quality of towels, shower cap,etc. We are sad, as we really looked forward to staying at this unusual place. Housekeeping was not a problem. The breakfasts that we had in the restaurant were just fine, but the service varied according to waitress. One lovely young lady (whose first name begins with a V) was so nice that we would walk in and ask her which tables she was serving, and we would sit there. On the last day, I used the business center to try to print out my boarding passes. I brought them up on the computer, but the printer didn't work. The desk clerk said she would print them out for me, and I asked her for my three dollars back for use of the computer. She said she couldn't do it; I would have to contact the owners. When i said that I wanted to contact the owners, she readily gave me my money. This is a great location - the hotel should be razed and a new hotel built there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Regretfully my wife and I had business in Sherman Oaks and chose to stay at the "Sportsman's Lodge Hotel". Not regretting the business, that went well but staying at this hotel was less than desired. We checked in about 9pm and that went just fine. I love old movies but this place reminded me of the lodge in the movie "Dirty Dancing" staring Patrick Swayze & Jennifer Grey set in the 60's. The place smelled a bit old and was very noisy at night. The next morning our appointment nearby was at 9am and that was 5 minutes away so at 8am we went downstairs to the restaurant and were immediately seated. My wife ordered an omelet while I'm a sucker for biscuits and gravy. Her meal looked great while the cook told our waiter someone forgot to make the biscuits. I said that was fine bring me some toast and we'll cover it with their "homemade" gravy. They brought me toast and a container that held 2 tablespoons of gravy!!!!! I said is this a joke or a teaser? The waiter said this is how they serve it but let me get you another container of gravy. Yes another 2 tablespoons! Appalling! Now here's the best part. We left and forgot my wife's pajamas hanging on the bathroom door and called the hotel. I spoke with 3 different people on the phone over several hours and although all 3 promised to call me back after they checked with the manager, housekeeping supervisor and the maid who cleaned our room we still have not been contacted yet and that's been a week. The pajamas were a gift, not an heirloom but just a few hours after we left they could't locate the maid or housekeeping supervisor so one would wonder if the employees are taking things out of the rooms while people are still there? Sad very sad that we called 3 times and after being promised a call back we still haven't heard from anyone at this hotel! Personally I would rather drive 100 miles than stay at this place ever again!</p></li>
