<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Front desk people were just amazing, at your beck and call. We had the adjoining rooms, very nice, but you should be aware at booking that adjoining rooms don't have any windows! Different, but we got used to it. Front desk people are what made the hotel special.</p></li>

A very nice hotel bar is across the street. Within close walking distance of the French Quarter and good restaurants on Tchopitoulas. Would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was good to have a hotel 3 blocks from the French Quarter. We stayed in the Quarter our last visit to New Orleans and this was much better. Much quieter than the Quarter, but an easy walk to the Quarter. Nice Rooms. Very helpful front desk staff. Would stay here again One thing to note - the swimming pool on the roof isn't really a pool, it is a hot tub.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved this hotel. Elegant and quiet--not in the French Quarter, per se, but only a couple of blocks across Canal--much better than staying in the FQ, which can be noisy and stinky (sorry, NOLA, love ya but ya know it's true). Convenient to both the FQ and the CBD. Staff was super nice and very helpful. Bed was very comfortable. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 3 days following Mardi Gras 2011. The room was small but comfortable and cozy. The beverage service was excellent and the staff was courteous. The water pressure in the shower could scour your dirtiest dishes clean! I think the best part was the heated rooftop pool. The lookout point has the most amazing views of the city. Definitely would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I really enjoyed when I stayed at this hotel. All of the staff was very nice and helpful. The people I traveled with also enjoyed staying here. We had a good time in New Orleans. The only complaint I have is the fact that there are no rooms with 2 beds in it. The different websites to book hotels on does not provide this information. Other than that, I was quite pleased with everything including the staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a great stay at The Omni Royal Crescent. Opted for an upgrade to the DEEP tub in the bathroom -- that made the room worth it for us. The one thing I didn't like about our room was the layout. Our large bed was only about 18 inches from the dresser, so I would hit the corner of the bed almost everytime i would try to pass in between to get to the bathroom. Next time we would ask for a different layout if possible.</p></li>

The bathroom was marble and large enough for 2 people to get ready in. There is 1 and only 1 problem: there is a goofy glass half-door for the shower that doesn't keep much water in the tub.</p></li>

The customer service was impressive, especially considering I had read all of the good reviews. They even wrote a handwritten note thanking us for our stay. Would highly recommend also due to its location. It's 2 blocks from the French quarter which is far enough to avoid the noise. Definitely sign up for the "rewards" program as this gets you free wireless Internet and two free beverages each am at breakfast.</p></li>

The price of our stay was very nice, averaged $100 per day after taxes and fees. Only minor gripes; wifi never did work even after repeated calls for help, and the odd shower arrangement would soak anything in the bathroom during a shower, no matter how careful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The staff are very friendly and accommodating. Gravier street is kinda dark and not very busy at night. The lobby is small and so are the rooms. Everything in the room was clean and decorated decent, but I had to be careful not to hit my head on the sink when sitting on the toilet. And the shower had half a glass wall, so the floor always got wet. Overall, the Omni Royal Crecent is a decent hotel close to Canal and Bourbon Street if you don't mind a small room and no frills hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent value that we got through Travelocity. Was worried about the equal number of good and bad comments when reviewing trip advisor! The value was EXCELLENT. If you are a service snob and want no lateness or forgetfulness of requests, then you will be disappointed. They always apologized nicely but forgot one wake up call in the afternoon and often forgot the beverage requests in the morning. The room was kept very clean and a note was hand written by the maid for the tips left. The hotel was very nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose the Omni Royal Crescent for two reasons: (1) rating on Trip Advisor; and (2) price. We weren't disappointed. It isn't the fanciest of places. It has a small entry lobby. The elevators make a few disconcerting noises. But the staff were all friendly, efficient, and professional. The rooms (we had two) were comfortable with very good beds. And they were clean. It's on a quiet street but close to Canal Street and a pleasant walk to the French Quarter. It's only about two blocks from Mother's Restaurant on Poydras. What more could you ask for?</p></li>

You get free internet, a free beverage in the morning and a few other perks. The staff was amazing and treated us like royalty.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a relatively small, almost boutique-like hotel just two blocks from Canal Street and the French Quarter. We stayed on the 8th (top) floor where it was very peaceful and quiet. The room & bathroom was spotless. King size bed was like sleeping at home. The air conditioning is very capable & quiet (we turned the temperature up to better suit our preferred range). The front desk staff was pleasant, professional and efficient. There was a card in our room on arrival from the hotel manager, which included his cell phone number should we need anything. Overall a very pleasant stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I officially love Omni. They never disappoint me. This place has a great location very close to Canal St. and the French Quarter. Staff was super nice and we were granted an early check-in during Jazz Fest which was a pleasant surprise. Everything was clean and the bed was really comfortable. You use beads on your door knob (red for privacy), a really nice touch. The only problem was the shower door only covered half way through the tub so everything would get wet outside. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for comfort and quiet close to but not in the middle of the action.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was very clean. The hotel and waitstaff were excellent. The food from the restaurant was inexpensive and taste GREAT. Location is good close to Harrah's and the French Quarter, but far enough away that you don't have too much late night noise. Walls were thin, I could hear the people in the rooms next to me and the hallway. We stayed in the "jacuzzi suite", it was more like a standard bathtub with jets. That jacuzzi is Ok for one regular size person, but I'm 6' 5 so I didnt fit in it. Next time we come back to New Orleans we probably will stay again, but not in a jacuzzi room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not only is this hotel in a great location but I found the staff to be very friendly and honest. We arrived around 8pm on a Saturday night and the concierge giggled at us when we asked if we could get into Jacques-Imo's Cafe. Okay some may have been insulted by the giggle but it was not mean spirited and he ended up leading us to Luke's (a John Besh restaurant) just a block away. It was great! Our bed was really comfortable and the room was spotless. I would definitely stay here again!!!! 1 complaint and it is minor but this hotel does not have a real pool so forget about that and enjoy NOLA.</p></li>

It did not look like that when we arrived ! I know they are trying to remodel. Room was a bit small but adequate. Bathroom was weird- shower door only covered half the bathtub- so water went all over floor !! Hotel staff was very friendly & helpful . We felt pretty safe walking- not too far from Canal Street. You do better getting advice from the local people on eating places - We loved Deanie's- good food & good price ! All in all I would pay more for a hotel that had better aminites.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'll admit up front that I'm one the rare people that doesn't like New Orleans. I was there for a conference so my primary needs were quiet, proximity to food, air conditioning and a refrigerator in the room. This hotel delivered on all counts. I was amazed at how little street noise I heard, even during the day. The hotel is just off Canal, and a quick walk to the French Quarter, so there are plenty of dining options nearby. The room was fairly large for a single traveler and very comfortable. I would stay here again without hesitation. It's close to everything, yet felt away from the noisiest places.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is one block from Canal and that can be a good thing to get away from the sights and smells of the French Quarter. It is also in a good location if you are going to the convention center, the casino and the museums on Camp Street. Before we checked in the contacted us to see if we wanted bigger room or a room with a view. We chose a bigger room and the view was of a cinder block wall three feet away. Just be aware of this, if views are important to you. The restaurant and bar aren't anything special, but it's New Orleans and everything you need is right outside the door. This is good hotel and I would recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lovely smallish (approx. 90 rooms) hotel just a few blocks from the French Quarter. My room on the top (8th floor) had high ceilings, a king bed, a big TV and an expresso maker. In general I was really pleasantly surprised at how nice the room was for a very reasonable price. Only real downsides were the "pool" (really a big hot tub) and "sundeck" (pretty small - more a big patio.) Finally - the staff here were FABULOUS. Just could not have been nicer. Got a hand written welcome note from the GM and warm welcomes from the front desk every time we passed. Really genuine and nice. Highly recommended - would definitely visit again.</p></li>

The lobby was fine, (ice water available at all times) the bar a little small and narrow and closed early ( I suppose they expected everyone to be out on Bourbon Street!). The key differentiator for me here was the staff, specially the young women who worked on the front desk. They were knowledgeable about their city, they were warm and friendly and they always welcomed you through the front doors with a smile. The technical support (I had an internet problem) were also very good indeed. I shall return here when I am next in NOLA!</p></li>

Its a nice boutique hotel two blocks away from the French Quarters and not to be mistaken with the Omni Royal Hotel - a four diamond luxury hotel inside the French Quarters. Our taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong Omni Hotel! Once we arrived at the right hotel, the front desk gave us two free breakfast vouchers for the inconvenience. The customer service is great and the rooms are very clean and a nice size. I will definitely stay there again on my next visit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Omni for 4 nights while attending a conference. My jacuzzi room was tiny with a bed, dresser and TV. There was not enough space for a desk or chair. The floor to ceiling window faced about 3 feet of dead air space and then a brick wall. I was on the first floor and never saw sun light. The tv remote was missing as was the hair drier. The "pool" was a dirty hot tub with no jets. The resturant was closed for renovation. The hotel was quiet during the week, but on Friday nights the drunks came singing through the halls every few hours. When I complained to the front desk about the noise, I was brushed off. I would not recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As the other reviews have mentioned the hotel has a great location (close to Canal St. and the French Quarter). Check in/out was quick and the room was clean. However, the staff at the hotel definitely made a difference with my stay. Everyone we encountered was extremely friendly, helpful, and professional. The staff seemed to go an extra mile to ensure we had a great stay. When the staff saw that we had a child with us they made sure he received an Omni kids pack. Upon entering our room we found a handwritten note to us from the manager of the hotel welcoming us. The daily complimentary beverages and ice delivery to the room was an another bonus. I would definitely stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I travel all the time and this hotel was an oasis for a road warrior. Close enough to the French Quarter and downtown to walk (only a few blocks away). A block or two from the street car lines so you can get out to the neighborhoods. The rooms were fantastic, well appointed, and clean. Service at the Omni is always impeccable. I got a great deal on the Omni website for the room - $109/night a week before Mardi Gras. The restaurant is nothing to write home about, but the breakfast sandwich I ordered a la carte my last morning was fantastic ($6.50). A great restaurant called Luke is also just around the corner (have their own farm, local/organic). All around a great hotel in a great location!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the first minute we arrived at the Omni Royal Cresent we were made to feel very welcome and our stay was perfect. The room was spaciuos, lovely bathroom, huge bed, coffee machine, safe and fridge. The food in the restaurant was exellent and really reasonably priced. The location was very good, everything was in walking distance. The staff are fantastic always welcoming, polite and friendly the room was cleaned everyday to a high standard. The hot tub in the roof terrace is great although it was a bit hot when we stayed to use it more often, we were waiting for a cool evening to make the most of it but we didn't get one. We hope to return to New Orleans and would definatley stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having somehow missed out on the papa noel rates I stumbled upon a great rate here. Our early check in request was granted with lightning speed. The entire staff was friendly and helpful. The room itself was very nice and clean.We had a street view thru our windows that went from floor to ceiling. The bathroom was a bit small but adequate for two adults. The only thing peculair was that the bathroom listed slightly to one side. The location is convenient just several blocks off of canal street in the CBD(central business disctric.) The St Charles streetcar is just blocks away. The streetcar provides easy access to th WWII museum, garden district, Magazine st, etc. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My stay in this hotel was very nice. It is conveniently located, so you can walk to most restaurants and attractions. It was a very quiet hotel, even though we were on the first floor. The jacuzzi bathtub was large enough that a small family could probably use it for a swimming pool! My only complaint was that throughout the night, I was awakened by loud booming sounds. The next morning I came to the conclusion that it was the sound of a shower kicking on very noisily. So either the room I was in had several rooms' showers above it, or the room above it took an awful lot of showers that night. Overall, I would recommend it, if you don't stay in room 102. Other travelers in my party didn't have the same problem on other floors.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I expect more from Omni's. Great locale. One block from Bourbon and Royale Street's. Two blocks from Harrahs Casino. And about 6 blocks from the Superdome if you walk. They have a great Gourmet Burger Bar called "Dress It" and it stops there. Ice machines are only on three floors. They have no drink machines because they have a deal with whomever runs "Dress it" the burger bar that all drinks alcoholic and otherwise will be purchased from there. (buy your own drinks at a store and bring them in) The maid the first night stole money off our dresser. The desk staff didn't realize we were Omni Gold Club card holders we had to tell them.(We've never had this problem before) The beds were comfortable and the pillows were great on a happy note!</p></li>

I travel to New Orleans a lot, as I used to live there and it is one of my favorite cities, and for the value - this is my favorite hotel. The staff went above and beyond (going through the trash for me after I realized I'd left a (full) shopping bag after checkout) and the room was beautiful and quiet. This is nothing flashy like the W, or Le Pavillon etc. but it is a quiet, safe, comfortable, and really pretty hotel with a wonderful staff. Book early - unforthnately it was booked up for my last trip and I was sorely disappointed with where we ended up staying. Omni Royal Crescent is a gem.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Omni Crescent was the hotel I stayed at for my first trip to NOLA, and I made the decision based off of Trip Advisor. It was great! The room was clean, well equipped and modern. The bed was COMFY and the bathroom was large enough so we could both get ready at the same time. The location was great, off the French Quarter enough that it was quieter but it was never too far to get anymore. One word of caution, which applies to anywhere in New Orleans, I'd stay on the main streets when walking after dark. The burger restaurant in the lobby was never busy but the food was good. We stopped in there our first night in and the server was very helpful and friendly! Great food and the Albita beer was a good local beverage. I'd highly recommend this hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have been coming to New Orleans for the past 5 years (our son was a Katrina freshman at Tulane). We have stayed at most of the 4 star hotels in the City during this time and this was the best value for the money and one of the most pleasant stays. The room was spacious, the bed was almost as wonderful as ours at home, the shower was great and the staff were so friendly and helpful. By joining the select guest program on the internet we had a pot of coffee in the morning and a bottle of water at night and free internet. The location is great as you can walk to Canal and Bourbon Street and also to Poydras and the business district yet it was easy for us to be picked up. The traffic was not as bad as in the French Quarter. The bar was great to relax and the bartender was very friendly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Omni during a conference and had a fantastic stay. The check-in was smooth and our room was ready right away. The beds and pillows were REALLY comfortable. One small draw back was that we requested a crib in the room, which made it quite cramped. The sundeck and hot tub on the 6th floor was small, but still a nice way to relax. The front desk staff were wonderful during our stay. They were cheerful, helpful and responsive to any questions we had. Plus, their restaurant recommendations were always good. Our favorite was the Ruby Slippers around the corner. I recommend joining "Omni Select Guest" as well: many perks including morning beverage, free WiFi, fast check-in and morning newspaper. And it's free! Overall, for the price, this hotel offers fantastic value and great location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel for 200 euros for 3 nights. Was pleased with the price until we arrived. It turned out we could not escape the valet parking of the hotel since there were no parking garages nearby. That alone added 30 dollars + tax a night to the room. Above that you have to pay a ridiculous 10 dollars a night for the WiFi in your room since it's only free in the lobby. Rooms are clean but nothing special. Did not like that the air con was placed right next to the bed and because of that the wind kept blowing in my face. The hotel is located just outside the French Quarter. Very close to Bourbon Street but in a quiet street. I did not feel very pleasant walking back at night since there are a lot of homeless people in the street and you have to walk through a quiet part of the city center. Will not book again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at this location on June 23, 2005 for three nights. The hotel's staff were helpful. I made one complaint. I needed clean towels that morning. I waited for about an hour, and still no towels. On my way out for my morning outing, I let the staff know that I still did not receive any clean towels and that I had to use the ones from the previous night. I was not happy with that. But, one staff apologized for the inconvience and promise to get them for me by the time I returned. When I retuned, there were clean towels awaiting. The hotel is in a great location; away from the noise, but close enough to the French Quarters. Everything is in walking distance. This hotel is a little outdated and needs to be renovated, but it still was a comfortable place to stay for the price. Yes, I would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from a four night stay at the Royal Crescent. From check-in to check-out we were completely satisfied with our visit. The location is just close enough to walk to everywhere yet away from the constant hustle and bustle of New Orleans' party central. Front desk personnel were pleasant, helpful, accommodating and friendly. My special room requests were met and our room was very comfortable and fresh feeling. I recommend the eighth floor due to the extra ceiling height and the 'deluxe' level for extra square footage. The Omni frequent guest program is a must if you enjoy delicious coffee and juice delivered to your door(complimentary) in the morning. We would happily choose this hotel again. It provided a welcome respite to our long days and nights in New Orleans. Cute roof top deck an unexpected treat as well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very first time I stayed here I felt that this place wasn't up to usual Omni's standard of excellence but this time it was a different story. Omni chain has always provided a consistently great stay experience and this time the Royal Crescent lived up to the Omni's name. Join their loyalty program to get morning beverage and news paper delivered to you every morning. You will also get turndown service and free wifi. I got upgraded to a corner room with bright full length windows and large bathroom on this particular stay. Great location if you want to be near Bourbon street but also want to be able to take a break from it. Closer to the two street car lines and other buses to get to attractions around town than many hotels in the area. Helpful, friendly staff and their brand ambassador that really make you feel like a value customer. Great stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family of ten travelled to New Orleans for my wedding over Easter weekend. We very much enjoyed our stay at the Omni Crescent. The staff were friendly, courteous, and helpful, especially when my fiance and I needed computer and printer access for marriage license info. They added a baby crib to my brother-in-laws room for his 1 year old, also. The roof-top hot tub and fitness center was great. We enjoyed lounging there, though the hot tub was HOT! The bathrooms in our rooms were huge. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. The one problem we had was getting our cars from valet parking. I think the valets had a problem with the elevator in the parking deck at one point and were very busy because of the Crescent City Classic on Saturday. Luckily, the hotel is close enough to everything in the quarter to walk to. Stay here! It is a hidden gem!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My stay was near perfect, the staff members were extremely accommodating, floor to ceiling windows... I couldn't ask for more!! A great boutique hotel for those looking to get away from the hustle and bustle of the french quarter-but still have easy access to the nightlife. The bedroom and bathroom were cleaned well, and I received prompt and efficient maid service after my first night. There is no swimming pool, only a oddly placed jacuzzi for those who enjoy that sort of thing. There is a very small gym, equipped with some PRECOR cardio machines and a sauna.. nothing too spectacular. Nonetheless, if you are serious about your workout you work with what is available. Conclusively, I must add that I am an Omni Member. I set up my member profile stating my particular needs and quirks and they were really great about offering a room and services that met my needs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is definetly the only place I will ever stay at in New Orleans! I booked through a bidding website so you never know what to expect. When we arrived we were greeted by the friendliest people and given a HUGE corner room with floor to ceiling windows that overlooked downtown. All the furnishings were luxurious and the bed was so comfortable I never wanted to move! The bathroom was large with robes and nice soaps. The room also had a flat screen TV. One night I had a few medical issues and the staff went above and beyond helping me out. This hotel is in the perfect location. It is two streets over from the french quarter, two streets up from the river area(casino) and two streets down from the St Charles Streetcar. Nothing is more than a 4-5 minute walk away. It is also quiet so you can get some sleep. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who asks!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for a week and found it very enjoyable. Because it is tucked away on a side street, the rooms are quiet. The hotel and rooms remind me of a small European hotel. The room we had was actually a nice size and the bathroom was a good size as well. We didn't feel crowded at all. Omni properties are nice in that they give you a bathrobe, three sets of towels and included in the amenties is mouthwash. Little touches that make a big difference. The hotel is very convenient to the French Quarter, the Canal Shops Mall and the Convention Center. The valet parking was efficient. The hotel staff is very nice. The hotel has a small, but lively bar with a "build your own burger" dining option in the evening. There is a small computer nook in the lobby if needed. We would definitely stay here again - it is a nice change from the big hotel chains. We found it very charming.</p></li>

So anyway upon arrival I was turned off when we drove up and their was no guest parking you had to pay extra for valet. The room was even worst very small for the amount of money we spent ,no Wi Fi, no view just a brick wall, refrigerator did not work, no complimentary breakfast or nothing the bottle of water in the room was $8.00, the room was hot could not adjust the air and poor lighting. We also paid extra for our dogs only to get told that we could not leave them along because they were barking and disturbing the guest(why not a dog floor like the LaQuinta offer.) so we had to cut our trip short because there were no other hotel available because of the festival never, never will we stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed our stay at the Omni Royal Crescent. It's located just a block or so off Canal Street, which makes it very convenient to the French Quarter, as well to the Warehouse District and its great restaurants, the casino, the convention center, and the streetcars. The king room we had was quite luxurious, with a wonderfully comfortable bed and full marble bath. Staff was friendly and welcoming. A couple of negatives: one day, we did not have room service until after 5:00--and we had to ask the chambermaid to clean the room. But that might have been an unexpected staffing problem or something beyond one's control. I was not too impressed with the breakfast in the restaurant (typically overpriced continental breakfast). I did not have any other meals there, as it was always empty and dining well is one of the reasons one goes to NO. This was an elegant, comfortable, reasonably priced hotel and I recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this hotel for our honeymoon based on the Trip Advisor reviews. We were not disappointed. Join the Omni Select guest for free and get free WIFI, free beverages and paper in the morning. We received a complimentary bottle of wine on arrival (because it was our honeymoon). A handwritten note from the manager with his mobile number. turn down service every night. Huge bed. Great aircon. Two blocks from French Quarter. Very helpful reception staff. You have to pay for Valet but that is pretty standard in NOLA. The pool was rather amusing - basically a big bath - but we weren't there for swimming so it was fine. Nice little gym. I cannot stress what fantastic value for money this was. And you are not having to compromise on luxury. We will be staying there next time we are in New Orleans. The burger restaurant seemed pleasant enough - but when you are in new Orleans it seems silly to eat in a hotel!!!!Enjoy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The staff at the Omni Royal Crescent took our experience to a whole new level. This was our first time to New Orleans and decided to stay at the Omni Royal Crescent to celebrate our 4th wedding anniversary. My husband called and talked to Sarah, who is over guest relations, and she was such a tremendous help. She worked with husband to arrange some anniversary surprises before our trip and then made sure that everything was timed correctly while we were there. She also went out of her way to make sure that we were enjoying our stay, found the best places to eat and hang out, and always had a warm greeting and smile. She, along with the other Omni staff members truly made this the best anniversary that we have ever had. We loved the room and thought that the valet cost was worth it for the night because we were able to take the car at any time to go out. Overall we highly highly recommend the Omni Royal Crescent!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I made our first trip to NOLA over Memorial Day Weekend and stayed at the Omni Royal Crescent. We found a great rate on the internet, and booked through the hotel's website. I arrived very early on Friday, expecting to check my bags and walk around for a few hours, but our room was ready and they were more than willing to let me in! EVERYONE we encountered at the front desk was so friendly and helpful. We got lots of great tips on restaurants and other attractions...at all hours of the day, every day! Our room had every ammenity we needed, and was spacious and clean! I loved the huge all marble bathroom and the bed and linens were perfectly crisp and comfy. The location is perfect. Close enough to walk everywhere you want to go, but far enough away from the big party. We were more than happy with our stay, we would recommend the Omni Royal Crescent to ANYONE, and we will defintely stay there again!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Went to Jazz Fest for work. Stayed at this hotel and Loved everything about it. Such a nice small feel to the lobby and the Service was so wonderful. Opening doors for us, had some water with lemon ready for us on arrival. Had such a big room with a comfy bed and a huge tub with shower.. a little hard to get into though. First night woke up to water dripping in my bed from the room above or something. Called service desk and they moved me immediately. No hassel at all. Very helpful giving us directions to shuttles for the Fest and how to get to Bourbon st and our places we wanted to go eat. I felt that they were genuine and happy to help. Best service ever at a hotel. We loved the feel of this hotel and how well we were treated and have already reserved rooms for next year for Jazz Fest to make sure that we can stay here again. A little pricy but worth every penny. Walking distance to everything and we didn't take a cab one time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had one extra night before a conference elsewhere in New Orleans and decided to stay closer to the French Quarter. The Omni Royal Crescent is just a few steps across Canal Street from the Quarter, on a quiet street. I had pre-checked in before leaving home, and after a long delayed flight, arrived at the hotel to find our room keys ready to go, along with a hand-written note from the manager welcoming me to the hotel. Although the rooms here are on the smaller side, we had a spotless room, great bed linens (much better thread count than the other hotel we stayed at that weekend), and a roomy bathroom with all the amenities. What I loved was that because I'm a loyalty member, I got beverage service delivered to the room in the morning - real coffee, nicely presented and delivered on time. Much better than making the stuff in the hotel coffee pot. I'll stay here again the next time I get lucky enough to get back to the Big Easy...</p></li>

Check in was a breeze had joined Omni Select Guest (for free ) and had pre selected room preferences. Our room was very smart and stylish and I had a personally signed birthday card and note with cell phone contact from the hotel manager. Daily with the select guest we had hot and cold beverages delivered to our room first thing in the morning. I must say it was really nice to enjoy coffee in bed with my hubby. The coffee was local too it was New Orleans own Community Coffee. A great way to start off the day. As well as free wi-fi for Select Guest. For those reviews that say it is off the beaten path. I would say it is one of the most central located hotels. It was only a few short blocks to the French Quarter. moments away from St. Charles Street to catch the street car to Garden District. I don't think I would stay anywhere else in the Big Easy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Two blocks west of Canal from the Quarter, friendly, friendly employees, quick valet parking (since there is not a practical alternative, add $29 to your rate), and wi-fi in room (and morning coffee/paper) by free joining of Omni Select online, beforehand. Their room rate is like buying stock, changing hourly, so if you see a competitive rate, better lock it, RIGHT THEN. Safe as anywhere. Close to the great hat shop, all night convenience stores of Canal. An old warehouse, so if you have a window, you are looking at a warehouse 50 ft. away. The tradeoff is total quiet, in hallways and from outside. Full of young corporates on Iphones; not a New Orleans leisurely outdoor patio sort of place. If you are there only to start and end your day, it is above average in every way and a good deal. Only improvement: the mattress, while fine, could be replaced with the current higher up, swallow you sort of luxury. That is why you are there, to get great sleep, be it work or holiday.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Wonderful Alternative to Big Conference Hotels”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose to stay here instead of the Sheraton where my conference was because they offered a government rate within my per diem. What a great choice I made. It was very relaxing to return to low stress and quiet, personal atmosphere at the Omni each evening, after enduring crowds and chaos all day at the Sheraton. I stayed in a King room (250 sq ft) with plenty of space and a large well appointed bathroom with a whirlpool tub. It was very clean and comfortable with many pleasant touches (bathrobes, nice amenities, good coffee, and unobtrusive evening service) The front desk staff and bartender made me feel so welcome - remembering my name all week and responding to every request I had. I will stay here every year for this meeting and encourage others to defect from the huge hotels. The only thing I did not love about the room, was the lack of a window made me feel a little closed up, but I had requested a quiet room so that's probably why I was placed in an interior room. If you join their reward program, the web access is free.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recommend when you book a room with Omni, to sign up for their Select Members program. When we walked in around 1pm, we didn't even have to ask if we can check in early. She had everything ready and prepared. Very friendly. The room was great, a little small, but enough room for my bf and me and our bags. The bathroom was great except for the half glass door. That looked great but very impractical. The room was clean and it was cleaned daily. The view was okay. They use feather pillows, which my bf is not fond of, so they were quick to bring him foam pillows after he called. Then an hour later, the front desk called to make sure we got the pillows. I really liked the follow through with the service. My biggest disappointment was the "pool" was not a pool but a hot tub. There is no need for a hot tub on a day where the heat index was 100 degrees. But they did say we had rights at their sister property in the French Quarter. The location of this hotel was very central to the FQ, CBD, and Garden District. I would stay here again!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visited the Omni Royal Crescent for my Birthday which was on Easter Weekend. Upon arrival, the staff was very pleasant and professional, I received a hand written card from the manager of the hotel welcoming my stay and thanking me for choosing the Omni Royal Crescent, out of all the hotels I've stayed in, I have NEVER gotten such a nice jester/greeting as this, I thought it was very personable and it made a lasting impression with me. The hotel is in EXCELLENT location, short walk to EVERYTHING and away from the noise on Bourbon St. for a good nights rest. The rooms are on the small side, but yet they were comfortable(especially the beds). The lobby was nice and clean. The only recommendations I would have for the hotel (to change) is to do some updating within the hotel such as rooms and hallways, and I think the bar should stay open later then what it does, to accommodate the late nighter's and fix the sidewalk outside of the hotel, outside of those things, you will not be disappointed and I would stay again upon returning to NOLA!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got a great deal on this hotel on Priceline. Excellent location...an easy walk to the French Quarter. Staff was very polite. Gym was a nice size....good for cardio, but not weight lifting. The rooftop hot tub was ok....a little run down...but still a nice way to relax after a long walk. This was an excellent value for us....and the room was very comfortable. The only problem was that we were on the 3rd floor facing the street....and there is a small bar/nightclub next door. The sound of the music wasn't too bad...but 3 out of 4 nights we were woken up (between 2-4 am) by drunk people outside....laughing/yelling/fighting. By the time we left for our next destination, we were exhausted! Did not use the small restaurant....but there is a cheap little cafe across the street that serves breakfast and lunch (Majoria?). $1 coffee and 25 cent refills. We also enjoyed a gourmet breakfast (Banana Foster french toast) around the street at Ruby Slipper (30 min+ wait). Would recommend this hotel, but at a higher floor away from the street...or bring ear plugs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Usually, my husband and I stay in the French Quarter, but after our stay at the Omni, we will never stay in the F.Q. again. The Omni opened our eyes to hotels on the south-side of Canal street. The location is centrally located to the riverfront, Bourbon street, and the casino. All of which are within walking distance of the Omni. We even walked to Frenchmann street. This is the first time we did not rent a car and we didn't miss it. The room was small but we weren't cramped. The bathroom was nice but the shower door (rather half of a door) was a neat concept but the functionality was poor. Water was leaking onto the floor so we had to use towels to absorb the water. We didn't want to slip and fall while exiting the tub. Not good! Since our room faced Gravier street, our view was that of a brick building. I guess the view or lack thereof encourages one to get out and tour the city of NOLA! It worked. We didn't mind the view because we didn't stay in the room much. Overall, I enjoyed the property, good customer service and I would recommend the Omni to others.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently spent a long weekend in New Orleans for a conference, and after seeing the hotel rates for the conference hotels, I decided to find my own place. Ultimately, I decided to stay at the Omni Royal Crescent because of its proximity (both to the conference location and to the French Quarter) and because of its price. I could not have made a better decision! My room was on the top floor, so I had vaulted ceilings with beautiful beam work. My room was clean, quiet, and comfortable. The hotel staff was always very friendly and helpful. When I accidentally missed my return airport shuttle, they helped me get in contact with the company to make other arrangements. In addition to the hotel just being a wonderful hotel, its proximity to New Orleans' finest was great! It was a quick 5-10 minute walk to be right in the heart of the French Quarter, with Bourbon Street, Royal Street, and the Mississippi river all easily accessible. They are also just a block away from the Ruby Slipper--one of New Orleans' best breakfasts! I would certainly stay here again--it was incredibly pleasant and enjoyable!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First of all Hotwire describes this hotel as having a pool - NOT! It has a very dirty oversized hot tub on the sixth floor. Hotwire says it has a restaurant - NOT! It has a space with tables and chairs for a restaurant, but only offers a continental breakfast - with no utensils available, cereal but only chocolate milk, day old pastry and no service person. We had no air conditioning the day before we left, was finally fixed by bedtime - given it was a Sunday, some consideration, but were told by manager that we could have a 10% discount on return trip - like that would happen. Hotwire does not advertise that it is a non-smoking hotel. Surprise! In the hotels defense, the rooms are small but clean, beds comfortable, quality sheets and down comforter. Towels were nice, but two for two people in hot weather was not enough - especially when the air went out. Hotel staff at front desk were some of the best we have encountered anywhere. One man appeared to have worked two shifts since we saw him in the evening and then again in the late morning. Still pleasant and helpful. Staff aside,we will not be back - not at $209 a night nor at any price.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here October 13th, 2011 for 4 nights. This was our first trip to New Orleans and we wanted something fairly close to the French Quarter, but not too close to hear all the noise. My wife and I traveled there with our 7 year old and 3 year old. We had a room on the first floor, which was very nice and easily accessible. Pros: -Hotel is in a great location, just two blocks from Canal Street and only about 10 min walk to French Quarter. -The hotel is situated on a side street (Gravier) so the noise is minimum (almost non existent). -Front desk personnel was very helpful and very friendly. Cons: -The hotel room itself is average. It could use some updating, but it was clean, which was important. -Valet service was $29/day with unlimited in/out. I expected to pay this, because there is virtually no other parking within a 1-2 block radius of the hotel (only street parking meters). Overall: I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again... highly recommended. Can't give it 5 stars for the cons listed above, but if you're looking for a nice hotel with excellent service, and a great location, don't look any further. The customer service alone would make this hotel 5 stars.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “The best choice for your Honeymoon!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I chose the Omni Royal Crescent, New Orleans for our honeymoon out of dozens of hotels. Our decision was not in vain. We arrived at 3am only to find someone immediately on-hand to take care of our bags, and to find out that we'd already been checked in. (Hassle free!!) Our room was immaculate, bed turned down, and everything that was guaranteed was there! The jacuzzi was a wonderful asset along with the plasma TV and more than comfortable King bed. Every morning we were treated to two complimentary beverages of our choice EACH (and they brought the whole coffee pot!!). The staff was among the friendliest I've seen and were always available. The bed was turned down each evening, toiletries refilled, and room back to pristine condition. The day of our check out they completed our stay hassle-free yet again by simply slipping our bill under our door. All we needed to do was ask them to bring the car to the front door (they provide valet parking for a reasonable daily fee.) We would definitely stay here again!! Make sure and become a member on their website or over the phone when you reserve to receive the complimentary items! It's a FREE membership!!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great, Friendly, Clean Hotel Right Outside the French Quarter”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is only a block-and-a-half from the French Quarter so it's nice because it's very close to everything but still outside enough that it's quiet. The hotel staff is incredibly friendly and helpful, the room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. My only complaint is the bathroom isn't set up real well or at least not in our room and we were on the fourth floor. Also, the tub/shower combo just has a partial glass door which is weird and water flies out of the shower because of this no matter how you have the shower head positioned. It wouldn't make me not stay there, I just want to be informative. The hotel staff which also arrange taxis and will store your bags if you are checking out earlier than your flight. If you are a select guest too, they will accomodate you checking out later which is very nice and convenient. There is also a restaurant in the hotel that's pretty tasty at least for breakfast. One more thing, they give you beads to put on your door. Red for do not disturb and green for maid service. At least on our floor, someone took our beads, so it helps to wrap them around the door handle as opposed to just hanging them. Would definitely stay here again and can't wait for our next trip to NOLA!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband came to stay at this hotel after leaving another hotel due to poor accommodations. I was able to book a room the same day of our stay. They were able to accommodate our request for early check in. The room was beautiful. We were in a corner room that had windows galore on two sides of the room and overlooked the street. Noise did penetrate the windows but due to the hotel being away from the noise of the French Quarter proper after dark the noise dropped off considerably. The bed was comfortable and my husband and I slept well out entire 5 night stay. The fitness room consists of two elliptical and treadmill machines, yoga mats, and a stretch machine and his and her sauna's. The roof deck with jacuzzi pool and lounge chairs, and recliners was very welcoming. Consider joining the select guest loyalty program (free) which will entitle you to free Wi-Fi (which is a little slow) and free a.m. beverages and newspaper delivered to your room. Staff is incredibly accommodating and was able to answer all of my questions about the hotel and local area. The hotel only offers valet parking. You can park on your own at any of the surface lots within a block of the hotel for a lot less. I look forward to staying at an Omni Hotel again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from five days at the Omni Royal Crescent while attending a conference a few blocks away at the Riverside Hilton. I'm so glad I opted out of the conference hotel for this cozy boutique on a quiet sidestreet, just a few blocks from the French Quarter. In addition, by staying at the Omni for about $130/night including tax, I saved my employer well over $600. I agree with other reviewers who praised the location, service, comfort, and decor. I also agree that the shower is a bit strange, the pool is tiny, there are no vending machines or business center, but none of these are dealbreakers to me. While the complimentary morning coffee delivered to the room is nice (for frequent guest program members), a light continental breakfast would be even nicer! This hotel has a hip European vibe to it; it's best for independent types and probably not suited for families or high maintenance people. As a woman travelling alone I felt comfortable in the neighborhood, even at night (not so in the French Quarter) and there are lots of small local cafes nearby, including a great Thai restaurant if you ever tire of the creole/cajun cuisine. Parking can be found for $15/day at a surface lot two blocks away -- this is a steal by New Orleans. standards.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I picked the Omni for a five night stay while attending a conference. Overall, I was very pleased with the choice. The hotel was quiet, had a good location and the staff was helpful and friendly overall. I purchased an inclusive breakfast package that featured the morning breakfast buffet located off the lobby. The breakfast was excellent, and featured a variety of offerings. The front desk staff is great, they are observant, friendly and very helpful. They assisted in everyting from hailing taxis to delivering room service. Our king suite was nice, with high ceilings. We reserved a jacuzzi suite room. We used the jacuzzi once, and it was great. The bathroom was enormous. The mattress should be replaced, it's time is up. I have a criticism with the housekeeping efforts in the room, it should be improved upon. Service was spotty, the tub was never cleaned after using the jacuzzi and the room was dusty. We ran out of toilet paper, and amenities. I requested two additional pillows to be sent up, and they were never received. My husband has asthma and it was bad during the stay. The moment we left the room, it would subside. The value overall was good for the price point, and I would stay there again, but would hope to see the cleaning issues resolved.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Omni Royal Crescent this past weekend for the Memorial Day holiday. The staff was extremely welcoming from the moment we walked in, and were more than happy to answer any questions and provide tips on where to go to eat, etc. I was quite impressed with the rooms. I don't usually pay that much attention to decor, but I loved the way the rooms and bathroom were decorated, giving them a romantic feel. The room was quite big, for us anyway, and especially for the great price of approx $70 (through expedia). I paid more the previous night at another hotel, with the rooms being much smaller and service not so great. The only minor complaint I had is the same as mentioned in a previous review - the shower has some sort of half glass door, and water gets all over the floor. Also, the hallways were extremely cold, so maybe the A/C could be taken down a notch. However, not a big deal at all, considering the fantastic deal we got for such a great hotel. Also, as a tip to fellow travelers, if you need to park your car, just go down a couple blocks where you can pay $15 overnight. Ask the concierge and he will point you in the right direction. One more tip is to join the Omni Select Guest program, and you will receive free wireless internet in your room. Simply go to the website, and sign up there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After a 20 hour amtrak ride from Chicago to New Orleans we were greeted getting out of our taxi. Thats right, she came OUTSIDE to the side walk to welcome us. My 7 year old son recieved a paper "bookbag" containing a few small toys, twizzlers (which I was asked about prior to him recieving it) and a small paper wildflower bomb to plant at home. Upstairs we found our room impeccably clean and with a handwriten note welcoming us and with the phone numbers of the manager in case of any concerns. If you sign up for their rewards program you get assorted perks, includind a beverage delivered to your room each morning. The staff was so helpful and friendly, looking up multiple addresses and times online (I had her on the phone from my room.) While dooroes allow the room to get soaked if you use the bath mat it would be impossible to fall, and we had a peacefull nights rest each night. Its literally steps from the French Quarter and the streetcar lines. Eat at Verti Mart its only a few blocks away on Royal street, and you've got yourself a little slice of heaven in the middle of New Orleans. I cant imagine staying anywhere else on future trips to NOLA. Id like to give it ten stars I felt pamered and impressed and not at all like I only spent $109 per night. I'll miss you Omni Royal Crescent and all your attention to the little things!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I wa ssharing this room with two female coworkers (I am male) since we were going on business and wanted to extend our stay a few days. We were extremely pleased when we walked in the room to find out we actually had a suite. I did not book a suite, and nor did i expect this, I am not sure if all the rooms are like this or just some. We had our own rooms, i had abathroom with jacuzzi hot tub. The girls ahd their own bathroom with stand up shower. There was only one flat screen tv but that was ok. It was spacious, clean, big and clean. The bathroom was nice too. It was marble with gold trim. The beds were not full, not queens, but two KING beds! Tons of pillows. AC worked great. There was a nice clean gym. The pool was really a big hot tub outdoor. The only thing was that we didnt have a view, our room was in the middle and therefore it was kinda like a cave with no sunlight, we had a big window to the hallway which i thought was strange, but overall it was nice, trust me you dont want a room with a view in New Orleans. We got free continental breakfast. It was near the French Quarter. I would defiantely stay there again. It was safe also, you need your room key to get in which was good, i have stayed in other hotels where bums walk in and out of the hotel. The area is a little shady, but its new orleans, its going to be shady no matter where you go.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 2 nights at the Omni Royal Crescent. it was located just outside the french quarter, which was wonderful because it was quite. The hotel is within walking distance of the streetcar line. We took the streetcar to the french quarter and the garden district. The hotel staff was very personable. They gave greeted us by name and gave our daughter a welcome package filled toys and goodies. We booked the breakfast package so we ate both morning at Dress It. The food was okay for a buffet. They didn't have a chef prepared omlet bar. I've had better buffets at other Omni hotels for the same price. Since we are Omni select guest members we received complimentary beverage delivered to our room each morning and we received bottled water each night with our turn down service. Each evening we came home the staff greeted us an asked us about our evening. We were treated like family and not just a number like the big chain hotels. Some of the drawbacks to the hotel. The rooms are newly renovated, but a little small. The bathrooms are newly renovated with granite and tile, but the half glass door in the shower was a very poor design. We had to place towels on the floor each day to catch all the water coming out of the shower. I can see this eventually leading to mold problem with the amount of water sitting on the floors each day. It's a shame because it's a nice hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “It's an okay hotel- convenient and less pricey. Average overall.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were in New Orleans for a conference at a nearby hotel and the Omni Royal Crescent had a good price, so we booked it. It's very conveniently located 2 blocks from the French Quarter, so you don't really need a car to experience everything. A couple things we noticed: 1. The hotel staff is very friendly and always greets you. 2. The hotel is quite small and walls are kind of thin- we were woken up once in the middle of the night by people talking in a voice just above normal conversation volume. 3. Let me say a couple things about the bathroom: a. The shower door is "European" we were told. This apparently means half of the door is missing. Therefore, the whole bathroom is wet after every time someone takes a shower. b. There is no fan/vent in the bathroom c. One day we were left a towel with what appeared to be dried blood (or some other red spots) on it. d. It's quite a small bathroom 4. Housecleaning is okay (based on 3c above) and while they changed our sheets, they did leave a pillow case with some holes in it (could be due to moths or cigarette burns). 5. The water bottle in the hotel is $6, and there's no wireless but the staff was happy to let you use their computer in the back if you needed it. 6. The fitness center is just okay- 2 treadmills, 2 ellipticals and 1 bike. We weren't in our room that often so it wasn't too bad. It didn't make our vacation better or worse.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Best alternative to staying in the quarter!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've been to New Orleans 5 times now, 3 of which where I stayed at the sister Omni in the quarter. When I wasn't able to snag a room there, I figured that I'd give the Crescent a shot because I was an Omni member. I was hesitant to stay outside of the quarter only because I considered the area a second home, but I was SO glad I made the move. The price was cheaper, my room was bigger, the staff is incredibly nice and it's close enough to the quarter to feel like you're in it, but quiet enough to know that you're not. If you're a first-timer to New Orleans and are looking to have fun and be part of the action, I would recommend the Omni Royal Orleans. But, if you still want to sleep at night and avoid the crowd that the quarter attracts, this is the best hotel you can stay at across Canal. I do have a couple of complaints though, hence the 4 stars....if you're looking to work off those po'boys and gumbo, don't expect to do anything but run in the gym. The room is incredibly small and only really has cardio equipment. The pool is miniscule and is basically a hot tub. The roof-top pool at the other Omni is great and offers a beautiful view of the city but for some reason they're unwilling to let guests from the Omni Royal Crescent use it. As I've said in my review of the other Omni, JOIN THE SELECT GUEST CLUB! It's free!! You get free wifi and FREE drinks, 2 per person EVERY MORNING of your stay!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you need a relatively comfortable place on vacation to tour the French Quarter, this would be a decent choice. Party is non-stop. I think about 10 or 20 years ago, this hotel would be a great choice. But if you are in New Orleans and need to get some work done, stay elsewhere (the W, the Hampton Inn are both better choices). Omni's physical facilities are nice--rooms are spacious, comfortable and the bathrooms are large and nice. Most of the staff is really nice and go out of their way. However, a lot of amenities that you might expect if you travel on business aren't there. No restaurant. No room service if you arrive back from work late and don't want to brave the French Quarter that late. No soda machines. Had to ask for mini-bar key. Maid took robes from the room after the first day (where'd they go?? LOL I don't think this is completely a Katrina issue). Wireless internet stopped working for my Macbook, after 1/2 hour on the phone with their IT hotline no help. No hard-wire substitute Internet available (if you need to get work done, this becomes a real problem). I kept being told the Internet was working (it wasn't working for everyone the way their router was configured), ironically while I was checking out I overheard the desk clerk telling the same thing to another frustrated guest (clue: if your guests are telling you it's not working, it's not working). Would not stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived around 2 pm and our room was not ready for us so we left our bags in a small room next to the lobby and took a little walk. When we returned we finally got our room key and were rather appalled that the room had no windows. Felt like a tomb... The bathroom smelled like an ashtray. We asked for somebody to get rid of that smell and they put up a small machine which was supposed to suck out all the bad air in the room. Unfortunately, it did not help. Around 4.30 am our neighbors next door came home and started a nice little party, it was really loud and my smoky tumb turned into a disco. The next morning I asked for a new room - which worked out. The staff was really nice and tried their best to improve our stay. Our new room was located in one of the upper floors with real windows and no ashtray bathroom - a true relief. Also our new neighbors were not noisy and we were able to get some sleep. What I liked best was the staff. All of them were really friendly and helpful. I can only recommend a short visit to the bar; they serve pretty good burgers and the bartender is funny and nice. The location is also pretty good. It is not in the middle of the French Quarter but close enough to walk there and to many other interesting spots in the city. Since our first night was so terrible I would probably not go back to that hotel. First impression counts the most and it was just not what we expected.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I were on our way to Biloxi and decided to go the extra hour on to New Orleans for a quick trip- I am a planner who researches hotels and was a little nervous to just book this one on the way there on my Iphone! I always check with the travelers photos on tripadvisor cause they always show the truth of what the place really looks like-- The Omni Royal Cresent did not disappoint. I was pleased from the person who took my "last minute" reservation on the phone to when we arrived at check in and was helped by two of the nicest gentleman--- I was very happy with the room it was on the corner so a bit small, but the furnishings were tremendous- beautiful bed, luxurious drapes, flat screen, large windows, marble bathroom with great toiletries- You will love it here- there is a rooftop area that has very sheek furniture great for lounging! there is a gym and sauna up there and a hot tub- The hotel is very close to the french quarter, riverwalk and harrahs casino- we felt safe at night walking from our hotel and when we came in at night the desk clerk always smiled and spoke to us! In fact, we stayed an extra night cause we had such a great time and they so nicely worked with us on the rate for sunday night- She even gave us a room on a higher floor with panaramic views for the 2nd night- The staff is all about pleasing the traveler! Put your mind at ease after booking here- you will be very happy!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My sister and I came to visit New Orleans from 2/19 to 2/23. PROS: 1) Front desk staff was extremely courteous and professional. An error was made with our room request upon check-in and it was rectified in a timely manner with apologies. They greet the guests as they enter and exit the hotel. 2) Location was good - 2 or 3 blocks of walking distance to the French Quarter, away from party noises and the smelly streets of garbage! CONS: Housekeeping either needs to re-train their staff or hire new ones. 1) All the surfaces (end tables and writing desk) were covered in dust. My sister and I coughed and sneezed after we tried to wipe them down ourselves. 2) The carpet in our room was not thoroughly vaccuumed - we found cut toenails left by previous patrons near the bathroom entryway! GROSS! 3) Two days in a row - We left in the mornings to sightsee and we returned to find that housekeeping did not close our room door all the way. We came back to a hotel room with the door ajar! Fortunately nothing was stolen but it sure posed a compromise in security! 4) On our day of departure, we found housekeeping hidden around the corner texting on her cell phone . . . she should spend her work hours cleaning instead of socializing! 5) Ask for a room that is NOT FACING Gravier Street! There's a club/lounge next door and patrons liked to carry their partying onto the street. The first night we had a room facing the street and we could not sleep until 4 a.m.!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Omni Royal Crescent is an ideal place to stay in New Orleans. Although this is a boutique style hotel, the place offers lots of value. Rooms: The nicely decorated rooms have been renovated, featuring a large marble bathroom, flat screen TV, a safe for your valuables, a fridge, and plenty of lighting. Location: The hotel is located just two blocks away from the French quarter, yet is far enough away that it's peaceful late at night. I was in town for a conference so the Morial Convention Center was an easy 10-minute walk form the hotel. Amenities: The sixth floor has the a rooftop deck with wading pool, exercise room with TV, and sauna. Even two yoga mats were available. "Dress It" is the on site restaurant. They offer a breakfast buffet for $14.99. It may sound pricey but there was a vast selection of breakfast foods to suit any desire. Taxi Service: The hotel can make arrangements with a taxi company to take you to the airport once your stay has ended. Just let them know what time you require a taxi the night before. Cool hallways: Although not very necessary in March, I can see how having ultra cool hallways can be a relief in those humid summer months. Professional front desk staff: I found them to be very cordial and on the ball. I ran out of tissues and requested a new box, which arrived less than 5 minutes later. The staff wish you well when you leave for the day and welcome you back when you return: a very nice touch. Elevators: My room was on the sixth floor but the wait time was very short every time, even on checkout day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I love the Omni Royal Crescent. I have high expectations for where I decide to have my beauty rest after a long day of fun or business. Most people say " Oh its just a hotel, its not like you have to live there" but that's not the way I see it. Im more like if Im paying my good money to stay here it better be worth every dime even if im paying for a discounted package. This will be your home and place to unwind after a long flight, day out with family, or business meetings and you want to be able to relax and come HOME to a clean, comfortable, and quiet place. This hotel was all that and above. Rooms were clean, bathroom was spacious, clean, and up to date, beds were comfy and the staff were very nice.The only problems I did have was the shower in my room would not turn in different directions. It would only stay straight causing my shower to be a big mess since the water shot right through the curtain onto the floor. I didn't make a complaint because there was already a drain on the outside of the tub, which I thought was weird but obviously It was there for that purpose (to catch the water). So I figured they know about this problem and that was the solution. Also I asked for a computer room and they offered a small area behind the front desk. This was uncomfortable and I wasn't able to get anything done. Also I was not pleased with the valet parking area, it didn't seem safe and the area was not gated along with that it took forever for valet to arrive with our car. I would recommend this hotel and my sister and her family will be there soon.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My girlfriend and I and my sister and brother-in-law traveled to New Orleans in Oct. of 2011. It was a first time visit for three of us. We intended to rent a house but I waited a little too long to make the reservation and the houses we wanted were all booked. After doing research here on TA we selected the Omni Royal Crescent for our hotel. It turned out to be an excellent choice. Upon check in we found our room was not quite ready, so Sarah on the front desk gave us two free drinks in the bar while we waited for our room. Sarah would prove to be very helpful on more than one occasion over the course of our three days at the hotel. We, of course, ordered hurricanes and walked around the hotel neighborhood while we waited for our room. We discovered an interesting, small diner on the corner across from the hotel where we ate breakfast the next day. The hotel is on a small side street with very little traffic. Our room was modern with a very large bathroom. Everything was exceptionally clean and the queen bed was quite comfortable. My sister and her husband were originally booked into a two double bed room (my mistake), but Sarah moved them into a king room after one night. The hotel is only about two blocks from Canal St and the French Quarter, as well as 2 blocks from St. Charles and the street car line, so it was very convenient for us as well as being just far enough away from the crazier parts of the French Quarter that street noise was never an issue. We all had a great time in New Orleans, and we would definitely stay at the Omni Royal Crescent again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a good location for me to walk to and from everywhere within New Orleans! I found it perfect for me who loves to walk. For some it might be far to Decatur, but it's good excercise after having a beignet or two...:) Close to French Quarter and some great places to eat! My experience was even better with the staff who treated me with friendly and local hospitality as if I go there frequently. The check in was easy, the front desk was very welcoming and every night that I went to night cap in the bar, I had a different but always fun and friendly bar tender who gave me some off the beaten path (but safe) places to go so that I didn't rely on some Travel guide. Every recommendation WAS worth it and where the locals were to have fun. Because of that, I made some great friends. Also, I went during Halloween which was super fun because of some of the staff recommendations on what to do, where to go and what to be cautious of. My room was great exactly what I would want in accomodations. My robe was fantastic,by the way. So much, that I bought one from them. The only thing I can think of that one might not find acceptable is that there isn't a large pool. There's a pool but it's a small "relax" type one. But really? Why would you go to a place like New Orleans to sit in a pool??? I can do that for free at home. Go to another hotel if you're set on a big communal pool. Otherwise, I liked that this hotel was downtown, close to everything, but not in the busy pace of it because it's situated in a quiet corner that is still accessible for cars and taxi's. Lovely!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice rooms, good staff, bad for light sleepers.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in a King room at the Omni Royal Crescent, New Orleans. The room itself was nice, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was large with a nice vanity area and good amenities. Our room was cleaned and in good condition everyday, my only minor complaint is that the regular coffee for the coffee pot was not replaced one of the days we were there. Other than that everything was good with the room itself. Our room did not have a good view, it faced out to an alleyway so all we could see was a parking lot and another building. The view didn't bother us as much as the noise in the room. Often you could hear people talking in the hallways when they were talking. Generally we couldn't hear people in other rooms with the exception of one room being particularly loud late one night. We could also hear trash being picked up on the street early in the morning. This noise never woke either of us up in the morning, but if we already happened to be awake we could hear it. I'm not a light sleeper so the noise never bothered me too much but I'm guessing if you are a light sleeper that it would be difficult to sleep late at night or early in the morning. The staff was very friendly and offered us a few restaurant recommendations. They seemed more than willing to help with any issues we had. Valet parking went smoothly, the parking is valet and it cost us $29.12 a day tax included. The location is excellent we were easily able to walk to the French Quarter from the hotel. Overall I highly recommend this hotel, it was a great value for the price. The location, staff, and the size of the rooms are what makes it great.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Onmi Berkshire in Manhattan this spring, and was very excited to stay at another Omni. My room was quite pretty, with large windows, and was booked for only $89 at the hotel website. The front desk was friendly at check-in, and provided me with a city map marked with suggested walking routes on my first afternoon. However, on the first morning, beverage service was late and was only provided for 1 person, not the 2 requested. The cup of coffee was accompanied by packets of non-dairy creamer and sweeteners. I went downstairs and got another coffee from the continental breakfast, and took a milk for the coffees. (The breakfast was more attractive than most, with fruits and cheeses and petits-fours, along with the typical cereals and breads.) When we came in on the second evening, about 9 pm, I wanted to stop at the desk to get a beverage card for the next morning, but no employee was present in the lobby or behind the desk. We called out "hello" a few times, but got no response. We decided to call down from our room phone, but our keys would not work. Back downstairs, and still no employees. We called the hotel on our cell phone, and on about the 15th ring, 2 people emerged. There was no apology or explanation for the inconvenience, but the employees were still friendly. Our keys were reset and we got a beverage card. Beverage service the 2nd morning was at the time requested, made for 2 people, and they included liquid cream and creamer. (I wrote a request on our beverage card). I wouldn't stay at this hotel again, and if I hadn't had such a wonderful experience at the Berkshire, I wouldn't stay at another Omni.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great anniversary getaway”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I always check tripadvisor.com before selecting a hotel for our family vacations. When my husband said he wanted to go somewhere for our anniversary, I chose a location and researched prices on other websites before checking the reviews on this site. I was a little worried after seeing so many contradictory reviews, but I noticed that the manager of this property always responded to complaints promptly and with courtesy. This impressed me and demonstrated the manager cared about his/her guests' experience, and that is what convinced me to choose the Omni Royal Crescent. We were not disappointed. The staff was wonderful, and they made check-in painless, even though we arrived right around 3:30 p.m. We didn't have a great view, but then again, that wasn't the reason why I chose the hotel. Much more important was the fact that Harrah's casino was a two-block walk from the hotel, and Bourbon Street was a mere three blocks in the opposite direction. We walked to Jackson Square, the Riverwalk Mall, and saw everything in between without much exertion at all. I used the workout facility and was impressed with the quality of the elliptical machines and treadmills. There was even a sauna! However, I was disappointed that there wasn't a hot tub on the roof/deck area, and the pool wasn't heated so that was not available to us since it was cold during our visit. I definitely echo the other folks who suggested becoming an Omni preferred member so you can get the free wi-fi and other perks. We didn't have to worry about the parking, because we took the Amtrak to New Orleans and caught a cab to the hotel. Like I said, everything we wanted to see was within walking distance.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I went to New Orleans for a last minute weekend getaway. I booked our hotel on-line and thought I got a great deal. But, once we got there it was even better than we could have imagined! From the minute we pulled up, we were greeted outside by the front desk manager, who also arranged for our cab to take us to dinner. Our room was ready with fresh ice, water and a special local treat! They upgraded us as well to a luxurious room with two king beds, two bathrooms, on the corner - it was beautiful and so comfortable! Each time we walked into the lobby we were greeted and asked if there was anything we needed. We went into the hotel bar for a drink before dinner and got the opportunity to talk with Layla who made appetizer suggestions at the restaurant where we were having dinner. She was so personable and so helpful. We had a drink and after changing for dinner, our cab was outside waiting for us. When we came back, again we were asked by the front desk if we needed anything. At breakfast in Dress It, we were asked several times if there was anything we needed - it was a buffet - great selection which was awesome - everything was hot and fresh and again, the personal attention they showed to us was refreshing. As we went outside after check out and were waiting for our car, we were asked if we were checking out and how our stay was. The gentlemen asked if we would be coming back or if there was anything else they could do to make our stay better. We could not think of anything - it was perfect. As a matter of fact, we tried to book a room for the following weekend after we learned of all the festivals going on - but wouldn't you know it, they were sold out! No surprise - it was so nice to see true customer service at it's finest!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First, I want to say that the service at this hotel is fantastic. However, my stay was rather mixed and I want to highlight both the good and the bad. Good: the aforesaid fantastic service. The location is close to both the French Quarter, the Warehouse District, and only a block or so from the St. Charles Ave. streetcar line. My room was clean, with modern decor and a comfortable bed. The bathroom shower had lots of pressure. Bad: No doorman or bellman that I could see, but i didn't need one. My room did not have a luggage rack, so I had to call the front desk. One was brought immediately. My door squeaked loudly, so I again called the desk and, again, it was taken care of immediately. The air conditioner controls are rather basic (low, medium, or high) and the air blows right on you when you're in bed. The bathroom layout is horrible and there is no way two people could be in there at one time. There is only a half glass panel for the shower, so my bathroom floor flooded every morning. My biggest complaint was the noise. The windows are not double paned and so I heard every car with a stereo that drove by. On Saturday night there was an insistent bass thump coming from somewhere so at midnight I finally had to put the earbuds in my ear and fall asleep to R.E.M. Yes, it's quieter than the French Quarter, but that's a rather low bar. I was looking forward to 4 nights of great sleep and didn't get much more than in my noisy apartment back home. My room was next to the ice machine and the linen closet so during the day it was non-stop door slamming by the cleaning staff, which seemed to start rather early and precluded any naps. This is not a bad hotel by any stretch of the imagination, and has many advantages. If you're a sound sleeper, it's great. I unfortunately won't be staying here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Awesome for near the French Quarter”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was extremely happy with my three night stay here. Its a quick walk to the meat of Bourbon street, but out of the craziness. So you can party in the French Quarter and then rest your bones afterward in peace and quiet. The hotel is also just two blocks from the St Charles street and Canal Street streetcars. We actually stayed on the eighth floor where the rooms have very high ceilings. The HVAC controls were awesome and quiet. How many hotels have you been in where the freaking AC is loud? Flat screen HDTV was nice, but I'm still looking for the Holy Grail of actually finding HD programming in a Hotel. We weren't there to watch TV, so I didn't care. Bathroom was beautiful, but one nit....the shower glass only covered half the shower so invariably there was water on the floor. The bed and linen looked great, but the bed oddly sloped to the middle. They just need some slightly firmer mattresses. As an Omni select member (sign up for free) we got two free beverages each delivered to us in the morning. Normally I would say who cares, but after partying every night in this town, you need some serious hydration. There was a city wide water pressure problem our first night. We returned to the hotel and the water didn't work in the toilet, sink, or shower. It worked the following morning, but the city had a boil drinking water warning for the entire next day and a half. The water problem was not the hotels fault and probably effected every hotel in the city. The hotel supplied lots of bottled drinking water for us upon request. The open sky Jacuzzi pool on the 6th floor was a great surprise and the wife and I were able to hit it in private! Wifi was free for Omni Select members too. On the eighth floor Verizon 3G was three times faster than the hotel Wifi. Yeah, I measured it. I would stay here again at some point after I sober up from the trip.</p></li>

<li><span style="background-color:#808000">Bathroom</span> was <span style="background-color:#808000">beautiful</span>, but one nit....the shower glass only covered half the shower so invariably there was water on the floor.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#4363d8">bed</span> and linen looked great, but the bed <span style="background-color:#4363d8">oddly sloped</span> to the middle.</li>
<li>The bed and <span style="background-color:#4363d8">linen</span> looked <span style="background-color:#4363d8">great</span>, but the bed oddly sloped to the middle.</br></br></li>
<li>They just need some <span style="background-color:#4363d8">slightly firmer</span> <span style="background-color:#4363d8">mattresses</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>As an Omni select member (sign up for free) we got two <span style="background-color:#46f0f0">free</span> <span style="background-color:#46f0f0">beverages</span> each delivered to us in the morning.</br></br></li>
<li>Normally I would say who cares, but after partying every night in this town, you need some serious hydration.</br></br></li>
<li>There was a city wide water pressure problem our first night.</br></br></li>
<li>We returned to the hotel and the water didn't work in the toilet, sink, or shower.</br></br></li>
<li>It worked the following morning, but the city had a boil drinking water warning for the entire next day and a half.</br></br></li>
<li>The water problem was not the hotels fault and probably effected every hotel in the city.</br></br></li>
<li>The hotel supplied lots of bottled drinking water for us upon request.</br></br></li>
<li>The open sky Jacuzzi pool on the 6th floor was a great surprise and the wife and I were able to hit it in private!</br></br></li>
<li><span style="background-color:#ffd8b1">Wifi</span> was <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1">free</span> for Omni Select members too.</br></br></li>
<li>On the eighth floor Verizon 3G was three times faster than the hotel Wifi.</br></br></li>
<li>Yeah, I measured it.</br></br></li>
<li>I would stay here again at some point after I sober up from the trip.</br></br></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Disappointing experience at booking in”</li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I travelled across the US last month with my husband and two young adult children and remain bemused by our experience at this hotel. All our accommodation was pre-booked for our party of 4 with two rooms: described as a double/deluxe for my husband and I and a twin for the other two. We stayed in five other cities and were always provided with appropriate accommodation (ie two beds in the room requested as a twin). That was except when we arrived at Omni Royal Crescent where we were informed by front desk staff that both rooms had one bed only, that there were no rooms available with two beds and that a rollaway could be provided at a cost to us of $30 per night. Having booked the accommodation 12 months in advance (!) and paid well in excess of $200 a night (for each rooom) we found this expectation unacceptable. The young man dealing with us kept repeating the phrase "I'm sorry for the misunderstanding" and offered some implausible explantion about 'twin' referring to the dimensions of the bed, the implication being that the misunderstanding was ours alone, despite the fact that all the other hotels we stayed at in the country understood twin to mean two . That was not my idea of the excellent customer service I had expected as an Omni Select guest. We did consider contacting the manager via his cell phone, (as others noted, this was provided after checking in) however we decided just to get out and enjoy New Olreans rather than spend further time and energy expressing our dissatisfaction. As it eventuated we were not charged the $30 rate, presumably because a more experienced staff member thought better of it, yet there was never an apology provided or gesture of compensation offered during our 5 night stay. Other reviewers have remarked that it was a quiet location yet the Saturday night we were there our sleep was disturbed until about 4am due to the street noise. Apart from that it was quite a nice hotel, but I felt sorry for the housekeeping staff having to mop up pools of water in the bathrooms each day.</p></li>
