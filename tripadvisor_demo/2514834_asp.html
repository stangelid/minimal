The room we stayed in (superior) was very small, but well designed and included everything you would need. Close to Metro. It was pricey at over €300 a night, and for that we did not even get breakfast, But everything in Paris is pricey. Overall a very pleasent stay.</p></li>

Its staff are a delight, the ambience is superb and the location is excelllent being only a few minutes from teh Champs Elysees. It is also close to Metro Line number 1 which gives links to most of the major attractions. The hotel is chic and beautifully appointed. I cannot recommende it highly enough.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">LOCATION: Only 3 metro stops from the very heart of the city. Surrounded with nice restaurants and coffees. ROOM: small, but stylish. Ideal for weekend romance. :) ATMOSPHERE: trendy but in the same time cosy. BREAKFAST: limited assortment, but very fresh, high quality and delicious! Best I have had in the last year... SERVICE: nothing special, but they don't tolerate late check-out.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel was as described. We had a suite which was small but beautifully furnished with lots of high tech. Only downside was no view from our room. Honesty bar is a great idea. Did not eat here but nice bars and restaurants nearby. A little way out of town but metro station nearby. We liked walking so were happy to get to the big sights on foot (Arc de Triomphe about 15 mins). Would recommend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a great hotel to stay in. We booked this hotel upon recommendation from other trip advisor travelers. It was located on a quiet street but near to the metro, a large shopping mall and lots of cafes, restaurants and a large hotel that had a jazz bar. The staff couldn't be nicer. The concierge staff was excellent, we mostly used Blaise who gave wonderful advice and tips. The room was a junior suite and it was perfect. I would stay there again. Thanks for a great vacation!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stephane and his team work very hard to make your stay quite enjoyable. The Junior Suite is very nice, and the bed is extremely comfortable. Lounge area which opens to the Garden is fantastic with a terrific breakfast of cheeses, breads, pastries, wonderful tea and coffee. We enjoyed staying in the lounge that we almost forgot that we had Paris to fall in love with. While it is three stops on the #1 Metro line beyond Arc de Triumph, it is a 4+ star boutique hotel that is worth every Euro...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A special privately run hotel with attention to detail and delightfully helpful staff. The rooms are small but they are beautifully presented with some really nice touches e.g. nespresso coffee machine in every room, conditioner in the bathroom (not just the usual shampoo), chocolates in the evening and a daily weather card by your bed. Spotlessly clean, sound proofed rooms, comfortable beds and well located for the Champs Elysee. Contemporary style but still cosy. Recommended without hesitation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was really good. Stayed there for the second part of our honeymoon, and would go back.

My missus particularly liked the nespresso machine in the room and the range of (free) films on the TV. The surrounding area is non-touristy - we went to several of the local bistros, found ourselves to be the only non-french patrons and had some really good food.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is perfect if you are spending a long weekend in Paris. I was in one room with my wife (Young Couple); my parents in anothe rroom (over 50s); and my sister was in another room with her husband and baby (Family with young kids). We were all very pleased. It is near all the relevant points in the city, yet it is very quiet at night. The rooms may be tiny, yet they have done wonders with the space layout. Everything fits just right. I highly recommend Les Jardins for a comfortable weekend stay.</p></li>

Our room was small but well equipped with Nespresso machine and all other mod cons. The bed was very comfortable and we had the nicest romantic terrace. The hotel is well located for accessing all areas of Paris (the metro is 2 minutes walk), and the surrounding areas are beautiful and full of nice restaurants and bars. Highly recommended and we will stay here when we are in Paris next.</p></li>

It is 3 minutes away from the Arc de Triomphe and we walked the whole Paris from there. The rooms are small but very clean and cosy. After a long day walking the Paris it was a great place to go and rest. The bed was very comfortable and I am very picky when it comes to cleanness of the rooms and I have to say I felt like I was in my own apartment when it comes to that.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed in many hotels in Paris but have never been so delighted with what I found at this hotel. The staff are friendly. The rooms though small are exceedingly well finished and furnished. An example are the blackout curtains which were obviously chosen to fit the arrangement of the windows and as a consequence were much more effective than the usual hotel fare. Breakfasts at French hotels are best missed. Not here. A good selection of top quality breads, fruits and cheeses plus the usual hot items. I only wish I could have stayed longer!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wow, this hotel pays attention to every little detail. It's a small hotel (only 28), which I think is why they go all out. Everything is nice, from the sheets, bed, towels, to the tiny touches like chocolate and pillow spray every night. Stayed here for 2 wks for a work trip, and loved going back every night. I also happened to have one of the larger rooms, I believe, because my coworkers rooms were all smaller than mine. Two of my colleagues had trouble connecting to the internet from their rooms, but two of us were fine. Would definitely stay again for work.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I were visiting Paris for the first time. We stayed at this hotel for 8 days and couldn't have been happier with our choice. The hotel is cute, CLEAN, and the people who work there are so kind. We were able to take the Air France Shuttle from CDG and it dropped us off at the Le Meridian, which is just around the corner from this hotel. We stayed in the deluxe room, which was the perfect size for the two of us. The hotel is located right next to a subway station, so we used the subway the whole time! I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed at Les Jardins de la Villa and had a great time. Their attention to detail is amazing, including pillow spray (!?), chocolates to welcome us, use of the Nespresso machine in our room, lights in the wardrobe, the list goes on. It is very French and decorated to the max - I would describe it as luxuriously OTT (over the top), but it just works. The location is very handy as well, close to the Arc de Triomphe, as well as major train stations, and the huge park - Bois de Boulogne - is within an easy 10 minutes walking distance. Highly recommended. We will be back!</p></li>

The room was spacious, clean and comfortable, with free films, and thoughtful touches like chocolate in the evening. Excellent service, we really felt looked after by all the hotel staff especially Ludovic who could not do enough for us. The breakfast was excellent. They have an honesty bar, the first time we had ever seen that. Located on a very quiet street. Very comfy bed. We slept very well. What more can you say. No 1 hotel for a romantic weekend in Paris. We will definately go back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">So for a 2 week break in Paris this was a great choice. It's 10 mins from the Arc de Triomphe and 3 mins from a tube station with good links to most of Paris. Like all who have gone before have stated, the service is top notch; very welcoming, very accomodating. We stayed on a freezing cold weekend when it didnt stop raining and Les Jardins was a great respite from the misery outside! Couple of cracking little restaurants in the 17th as well - proper French Cuisine; simple and very well done.Sadly, I cant remember their names! Downside, the rooms are small but that doesnt REALLY matter.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a lovely hotel! From the moment you enter this wonderful boutique hotel you know you are in a special hotel. The decor is very bright and modern in the public areas and there was always enough seating. The 'honesty bar' was refreshing and much appreciated. My bedroom and bathroom were excellent and quite large for Paris (mine even had a small balcony with a seat and table). The hotel is a pleasant 10 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs Elysees. Nearest metro is Porte Maillot. I didnt take the breakfast as it seemed a bit pricey but there are plenty of cafe bars nearby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We did not have too much difficulty finding our hotel via the metro from the airport. The hotel is located on a small street just around the corner from the Palais de Congress near Neuilly Porte Maillot. The staff were very helpful and our junior suite room was beautiful. Very spacious (and luxurious) for Paris. There was free wifi internet (although the speed was very slow at times) in our room, or 2 computers available on the ground floor. Breakfast was not included in our room rate and we did not have breakfast at the hotel. In all, a beautiful hotel we would not hesitate to stay at again.</p></li>

The first thing I noticed about our room was how great it smelled - the towels, the toiletries, the little pillow spary. Our room was small but very stylish - very clean and tidy - everything had its place. The bed was so comfortable and the room quiet. Both mornings breakfast was delicious and the two different servers were very kind and helpful. Its in a great area, away from all the noise and traffic but has many restaurants and little shops. Its very close to the Metro as well. We would stay here again should we return to Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel just before meeting up with our family in Disney Paris. The location is central just a 10 minute walk to the centre of Paris. A great area to wander and some fabulous restaurants close by. The hotel staff were very friendly, helpful and gave excellent directions whenever we wanted to go directly to an area.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We really enjoyed our stay here - rooms are very stylish (though small, as other reviewers have mentioned), and the staff very friendly. It was our first trip to Paris though, and although the hotel is convenient to the Metro, we found ourselves wishing we had stayed somewhere more central - lots of back and forth trips to the center of town to see the Louvre, Notre Dame, St. Germain, etc. One quibble - our room was very stuffy, and we couldn't control the thermostat. We had to open the windows at night to get some fresh air (how nice to be able to do this) and then get up to close them when it got cold (Paris in December).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a wonderful stay. The rooms are small but beautifully decorated and the space very cleverly maximized. We did not feel cramped which has been my experience in other European hotels. The extra touches were wonderful. The nespresso machine in our room ( brilliant!) and flat screen tv.The service was excellent and the staff friendly and so helpful. Breakfast was reasonable by Paris standard and yum. Great little honesty bar and free wi fi.It's located right near the airport shuttle bus ( a pleasure ) and the port maillot metro ( very central) made it really easy to get around. We loved it and would definitely stay there again</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were here for 8 days and I found this experience to be exceptional. My husband is blind and the staff could not have been any more helpful. The rooms are gorgeous and the bathrooms are luxurious considering last time I stayed in Paris I had to sit on the toilet to shave my legs! If you want luxury and the little things that make it special, stay here. Every night your bed is turned down and they leave pillow spray and chocolates, the weather report and a gorgeous reminder of what you need to do before you go to bed. Right from when we arrived from Australia, we were made to feel welcome by Stefan and Pierre Luc. I will recommend to everyone this wonderful hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fabulous is the only word to describe this hotel. Our room was excellent with a lovely bathroom and very comfortable bed. Although the room was at the front of the hotel noise was not a problem. The staff are brilliant! Very helpful and knowledgeable as well as friendly and humorous. The hotel is well located being close to the Arc d' Triumph and the metro. Plenty of good restaurants are nearby that provide very good food at quite reasonable prices. Try 'Le Maison', the hotel staff will tell you where it is and will even book a table for you. This was my fourth stay in Paris and I can honestly say that this was the best hotel by far!! Would I stay again? Absolutely!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On a business trip to Paris, combined with a week-end to ourselves, we booked a hotel near the palais de congrès. Not only did this choice prove to be very convenient (the hotel is only two minutes from the palais' main entrance) but also a very good value. Though the rooms might be a little on the small side, they are very comfortably furnished and there is a nice boutique-y touch to the Jardins des Villa. But what made us choose "Excellent" over "Very Good" for the overall rating was the quality of the service. This is the first time in a hotel of this price range that the welcoming words of "do not hesitate to call us if you need anything" really meant just that. Great!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed our stay here. We had 2 rooms: hubby and I, our boys 17 & 22. We found it luxurious - everyone slept great! It was quiet, clean and comfortable. The breakfast was delicious with lots of choices. The staff was friendly and helpful. The wifi works great. There are lots of restaurants close by (some pricey) but we found a great raclette place down the street on Avenue des Ternes called Le Brasier that was reasonable priced and delicious. There is also a small convenience store 2 doors down and a produce store close by should you want to pick up fruits or snacks. It close to both the Metro and RER. The stream room and sauna are nice to have after a day of sightseeing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My son and I spent three weeks in Europe with seven days at Les Jardins de la Villa. As you can see from the pictures, this is a very chic boutique hotel. I LOVED the decor! The staff were very helpful with directions, etc. Located right around the corner from the metro, close to the Arc de Triumphe and the Avenue Des Champs Elysees we felt close to the wonders of Paris, but far enough to decompress in the garden or their lounge area. The staff assisted me with many travel arrangements (Versailles and Monet's home-which are a both outside the city, but worth the trip!) Make sure to go to the patisserie on the corner-SCRUMPTIOUS! If intimate and chic are your requirements you won't be sorry.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My girlfriend and I stayed in this hotel for a one night trip to Paris. The hotel is located in a nice area near the Champs-Élysées and although the rooms are not big they feel very spacious, are perfectly clean (almost feels brand new), well designed and no street noise enters the room. The restaurant we were planning to go to was fully booked but the friendly hotel staff suggested a few very good restaurants in the area, at the same time they booked us tickets to the Crazy Horse so they helped us very much in making the one night in Paris to become a great night. The next morning we had breakfast in our room which finally wasn't such a continental breakfast but a decent breakfast, Thanks!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">my usual paris hotel being booked, i decided to try this one - which, in fact, is opposite the street - and was pleased i did. relentlessly stylish it may be, but the welcome is warm, the facilities excellent and the location perfect. rooms are small and the decoration a little overwhelming for the size, but the beds are comfortable and the bathroom well appointed. best feature of the hotel is probably the interior courtyard which has been turned into a comfortable open-air lounge, with well equipped honesty bar, a small library and an internet point. if they provided snacks, i suspect many visitors wouldn't leave! a bit pricey for it to be a regular hotel for me, but i really enjoyed my stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in a deluxe room for one night when in Paris for the Christmas markets. Room not particularly big (but I gather rooms in Paris are renowned for being small) but very nice. The bed was AMAZINGLY comfortable, possible the best I've ever slept in. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel but used the honesty bar in the evening which was great to use as a night cap and cheaper than the cloest pub (the Irish one - do not go there!!). Location for us was fine, the metro was a couple of minutes walk away and they are so frequent, well connected and cheap it's easy to get around in Paris. Above all else the staff were exceptional. I would definitely stay here again and happy to recommend to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After traveling 13 hours from Asia and arriving at the hotel very early in the morning, I received a warm welcome from Chris, who took care of my every need until my room was ready -- set me up on a computer in the chic and beautiful lounge area, got me hot cappucino and cold drinks, and made sure my room was ready for me very quickly. How lovely! The hotel is chic, trendy, and very well decorated yet comfortable and homey at the same time. Service is attentive and personalized. We enjoyed the convenience and relative calm of the neighborhood -- a good mix of all you need when you walk out on the street without all the hustle and bustle. In all, we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel, and we'll definitely be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 4 nights. No complaints at all. Staff very friendly and helpful. The gym is very basic but has good quality equipment. Treadmill has hardly been used. The dining faclities are very basic, almost non-existent. Breakfast is available but no restaurant. Not a problem though as there are a few good quality places within 5 minute walking distance. Free wifi a bonus - and it works too. The Nespresso machine in the room was really quite good and a bit different from other hotels. Very strange bar facilities!!!!! No staff, just an honesty bar where you pay for what you drink, but as the prices are the same as the room's mini-bar.....you would have to be very honest to use it. Handy for the Metro - Porte Maillot 5 minute walk</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">a delightful small hotel in a quiet street right by Porte Maillot, with easy access to all parts of the city by public transport. The staff are outstanding and the welcome is warm and personalised - we were unfailingly given a name whenever they greeted us. Our room was well appointed (though I don't expect a waterproof mattress cover in a 4* hotel!) and extremely comfortable, with a walk-in shower in the bathroom and a small balcony. The breakfast buffet was excellent, but at nearly twice the price of that in equivalent hotels, I was not surprised to see other guests going out to the nearest boulangerie for bread and croissants, especially as there is a Nespresso machine in every room. We felt pampered and extremely well looked after.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is one of the newly refurbished boutique hotels of Paris. Its rooms are very elegant, though on the small side hence i do recommend staying in their suites. They offer free WIFI, they have an honesty bar which came in very handy. They have a small garden to enjoy. It is 10 min walking to the famous champs elysee. Dont worry about what other reviewers mentioned regarding the location. This is Paris for god's sake, there is a metro station right next to the hotel, you can use it to access any where you would like to go. The Concierge at the hotel is very helpfull, he went out of his way and called many restaurants around paris to find us a suitable location to spend valentines day there. Thank you so much for such an amazing experience.</p></li>

The Junior suite is slightly small but equipped with everything you need from an AMAZING bathroom with an extra large bath for two and great separate shower. The interactive television in the room has a selection of free films and music to keep you busy when you're not rushed off your feet, free coffee maker - just pretty much all you would need. The staff were friendly and helpful. All in all a worthwhile stay and i wouldn't bother writing a review if I didn't genuinely feel this way. Only negative I have to mention is the fact that the breakfast was 27 euro's per person but just next door are a selection of patisseries to choose from which are very reasonable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for three nights in September. Hotel is in a quiet side street, but near to the Congress centre, Air France bus and Metro. The hotel is very modern and tastefully decorated. The rooms are quite small, but comfortable, with coffee machine, large flat screen TV and modern bathroom facilties. My shower was a bit odd as it had no retaining shower tray and it was difficult to stop water running under the shower curtain all over the floor. The room was quiet and the bed comfy. Only "complaint" was the price eg 27 Euros for breakfast! At this price, most guests pick up a coffee and a croissant from one of the many cafes nearby. Cannot understand why hotels feel they can charge such ridiculous prices for breakfast. But there was free wireless access, which was nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel can be a bit far from tourist location but it is not far from the subway! As for me, I stayed in this hotel for a congress that took place at le palais des congrès which is 2min walk from the hotel. The suite is a little bit small compared to other big hotel but well-decorated and comfortable with a great bathroom. There is a small fitness center with 4 or 5 modern machins and a hammam and sauna also. The parisien breakfast really worth it: it's cheap and you eat very well, the bread is excellent and the marmelade as well. The only negative point was the service room, for a lack of rigor (for exemple, they forgot to clean the cup of coffee or forgot to put other coffee capsule etc...) So to conclude, I highly recommand this hotel which has a great family atmosphere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Boutique is absolutely the word to use. Fabulously, well presented and exceptionally clean Boutique Hotel. We have just returned from our weekend and very much enjoyed our stay. The staff are incredibly friendly and extremely helpful. It was snowing on the day of our checkout and we were not flying until 8.30pm. We asked if we could leave our bags and use the hotel facilities in the afternoon upon our return - and even though we had checked out, their words were - "we are here to look after you, this is your home" Tremendous service :o) The hotel is only a 5 minute walk from Port Maillot RER & Metro Stations & also from the bus that goes to Charles De Gaulle Airport, so very accessible to the main attractions/airport. We would highly recommend this hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel the first weekend in March and were really impressed from start to finish! The rooms are lovely, nicely decorated but it is the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff which impressed us the most. They were able to recommend and reserve fantastic restaurants for us, order taxis etc and were always pleasant to talk to. The waitress serving breakfast was really nice and served us breakfast even though we were a little late down. Breakfast is extremely expensive there though so we only ate there once and if you venture out you wil find a number of brasseries offering much cheaper alternatives. Location of the hotel is great, right across the street from the airport bus stop and walking distance from the Arc de Triomphe/Champs Elysees. Would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I cannot express enough how much of a pleasure this hotel was to stay in. We had gotten engaged a few days earlier and our trip to Paris was to celebrate. The most romantic city in the world lived up to its reputation as everywhere you looked there was a beautiful sight to behold. The hotel only added to this experience as I can safely say the decor in this boutique hotel is exquisite! To top it off we couldn't have wished for nicer staff, every member of the team was friendly and genuinely interested in helping you have the best possible experience during your stay in Paris. I would like to say a huge thank you to you all as you made us feel really well looked after and this added to how special our break turned out to be. You are a credit to the hotel. To finish I will jus say we will definitely be returning. Amazing!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Every positive review is a true reflection of this beautiful hotel. My partner and i booked a superior room for a 2 nights break in Paris for my birthday. We were immeadiately upgraded to a double deluxe as a gift. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by Michael who was extremely polite, helpful and very freindly. This boutique hotel (which is less than a year old) is small and intimate. It has a small gym, a sauna and a steam room. The rooms are beautifully decorated with perfect attention to detail. It is in a great location. It is 20 minutes from Gare du Nord station and cost 12e in a taxi. The Champs Elysees is less than a 20 minute walk and The Effifel Tower is no more than 15e in a taxi. I spent hours researching different hotels in Paris, reading every review. Do not hestitate to book this hotel you will not be disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Room has been boooked by email, always got an answer back. Nice welcome, could leave my luggage at the hotel, good breakfast. Just need to tell a bit more about the room service, that wasn't as good as I was expected for a 4 stars hotel...cups of coffee wasn't washed, expresso capsules and bottle of water were omitted, have to repeat three times for the sofa bed to be closed. When you stay in that kind of hotel you're not supposed to care of all about that, and not supposed to have the impression to disturb when you ask for something as well...unfortunately, that was the impression I had about the room service. The reception and persons for breakfast service were very helpful. So beautiful room, quiet, delicious breakfast, had a nice stay anyway, but Was just wondering what I was paying for sometimes...

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed there for three days and liked it very much. It was VERY clean and they pay lot of attention to details. Every floor has not more than 4 or 5 rooms, which is nice, so there's not always 10,000 people on the hallways. That brings me to the next point: it was really, really quiet. I think it's because it lies in a very short sidestreet. Our room was very small, but it did not bother once, because of its clever design and Layout. Nice touch: every room has a own Nespresso machine with free coffee/tea. The bathroom is very nice. Modern, very clean and with lots of cleverly placed mirrors (so that it seemed much bigger than it actually was). Even when this little gem of a hotel is not in the heart of paris, at least it is very near to the metro line 1, which is one of the most important lines to get everywhere quick. We loved it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">To summarize it: the stay in the hotel was simply perfect. The staff was extremely friendly and caring from the concierge to the porter. They also cared about the small things e.g. chocolate on the pillow, weather forecast etc. The whole hotel is very charming and is nicely decorated. Rooms are big enough and feel very comfortable and relaxing and very clean. I had a room with a balcony, which I really enjoyed. Also nice: every room is equipped with a Nespresso machine and capsules and tea for free. You can also get coffee and tea in the lobby for free the whole day. Wi-Fi was included and available at the room. The hotel is situated next to “Le Palais des Congres” (2 min walk) which contains the conference facility and lots of shops as well as M1 (Port Maillot) with which you can directly reach the city center. Thx for the great time I had.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If boutique hotels with style and great service are your thing you can't go wrong with this little gem in Paris. I choose this hotel based on other reviews which proved accurate in their praise. I booked through booking.com whose rates were the cheapest, even beating the hotel when I initially phoned to book directly. As we were keen to sample Paris's gastronomic delights we did not breakfast or take room service at the hotel put both looked extensive and well priced. Unfortunately we did not manage to squeeze in the use of the sauna/steam/ fitness room, although we did inspect and were impressed by how well equipped and clean it all was. Our room was small, but I had anticpated this being a city hotel, and it was more than adequate. Nice touches in the turn down service and a choice of free on demand movies. Would not hesitate to recommend or stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall Comments: Mixed feelings…a bit try hard, without the real facilities. Very small hotel with some limitations. Room: Very small but well though out with modern furnishings. Tiny bathroom, but again well thought out. Free movies and wifi are a plus. Location: Just okay…on the North West side of the city ten minutes walk to Arc de Triumph, but most of the main tourist attractions quite a distance. Good restaurants and bars nearby. Good access to Metro. Facilities: None to speak of. Gym is basic with a treadmill, step machine and that is about it. No restaurant, just basic breakfast. Food: None Service: Friendly but pretty hopeless. Parking: No parking is available, despite the advertising. You cannot even pull up outside the hotel without a queue of cars forming and beeping their horns. This hotel is not a place to take a car. There is a public underground car park nearby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and my husband finally went onto our honeymoon after being merried for half year. Our first destination was Pairs, France. Wehad a good time in Pairs and I Love the Hotel. The quality of serivce is equal to a 5 star hotel but you feel cozy and friendly being their guest. All the staffs speak proper English and they always have a smile on their face. It gave me a sense of "Damn, people over there really love what they do." Service: Staffs are friendly and professional. They make me feel very welcoming. Ambiance: Cute, classic, chic decoration. They have a small lounge right next to the lobby. It's a prefect area to have a glass of wine in the afternoon. The hotel is very clean and always smells good. Location: It's only 5 minutes walk from the Metro station, and feel safe in that neighbourhood. There are different kinds of resutaurant around the Hotel. Everything is within a walking distant.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Husband and I stayed at this charming boutique hotel between christmas and new years. It was fantasticly charming, the room was super stylish, cozy and comfortable. The bathtub was tres amazing and big enought to fit the two of us with room to spare. It's full of little details that made our stay extra special ! Little chocolates and pillow spray, lux coffe maker and lux tea all free and more. The toiletries were tip top as well and made bath time fantastic. There was also a tv in the bathroom which made it fun. The staff was top class, very helpful and willing to do anything to make us happy, there were great at recommending places to eat and visit around the area. Location is perfect, on quiite street but close enought to all the things that Paris had to offer. We did not want to leave it was hard. I can't wait to come back !! Thank you to all the staff for making our stay most amazing and stylish and cozy !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I just got back from Paris today and I wanted to tell everyone about what a nice service I received at this hotel. The rooms are small but contemporary and close to everything including the Arc de Triomphe. The service was personal and just plain five star. The location cannot be beat for having RER and regular metro service one block away which can whiz you to most tourist and central areas in Paris. There was no rude staff to be said and they were very understanding and helpful in getting us in the right direction. What I can say is that this is Paris and it is to be expected that the french are proud of their language and culture. When in Paris just go and enjoy this hotel it is worth the money! Also, the beds were very comfortable and with my bad back I hold my hand on the bible when I say it was heavenly for both myself and my wife. We are both discerning travelers and if I say it was worth it then it was worth it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here on business in October 2010. This hotel is VERY convenient for the Air France Bus from Roissy CdG which dropped me about 100 metres from the hotel for about 17 EU. Service was great and the rooms very well equipped and trendy. I was a bit shocked to see a small packet of Tyrells crisps on offer in the minibar for just 7 Euros, but maybe I just don't get out enough :-). I managed not to eat them . The room had a shower but not a bath. The shower was great though big dish head with loads of water. Quality toiletries as you'd expect at this exalted price level. The bed was fantastically comfortable - one of the best I have had in a hotel. I enjoyed the stay but would have enjoyed it far more without the fire alarm at half past midnight, caused apparently by another guest smoking in their room. Perhaps it would be unfair to be too critical about that though. If you are looking for a funky boutique hotel this could be the one for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent six glorious days at Les Jardins de la Villa on our first visit to Paris. As others have commented, the hotel is very stylish and comfortable and the staff is top-notch. The hotel location was great--close to both the Metro and RER lines--everything we wanted to see was very accessible. I felt very comfortable in the neighborhood which is outside of primary tourist spots--sure, you may not have the ambiance of the Latin Quarter, but our most delightful "local" encounters were just outside our hotel. In particular--we enjoyed eating dinner at lively Cafe La Maison which you can find on the walk to the Argentine Metro stop (on the circle). I cannot end this review without a special note of thanks to Stephane. He always greeted us with a warm smile and cheerful interest in our comings and goings, despite working many long days at the front desk. Thanks also to the concierge, Pierre-Luc, who helped us navigate the city and discover the best of Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great choice which we selected for our honeymoon stay based on trip advisor reviews. It has an excellent location, 2min from the metro and the Palace Congress (Very Upscale Mall) and 7min walk from the Arc de Triumph, and 20min walk to the Eiffel Tower. Close to the main street where lots of restaurants are with a choice of cuisine. There are convenient stores within 2min if you want fresh fruit and need to go to the pharmacy. The staff, oh wow, wonderful. Very attentive in every important way for a visitor and not over-bearing. The ambiance, oh soooo nice. Sophisticated and yet warm and inviting. Out bathroom was exceptional. The room was small relative to American standards, but wonderfully modern and sexy. Unlimited tea, coffee and snacks. My husband used the gym and sauna and rained praises. The only item on the wish list are movie/entertainment channels in English. The only English speaking channels are news channels. If you have never been to Paris, don't fear you will be making a good choice with this one!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lovely little hotel. The hotel was very clean (this is a sticking point for me...think OCD) & the beds were comfortable. In addition to the gourmet chocolates (ginger, lavender, lemon) they would leave little lavender aromatherapy sprays by the bed for the linens. Personally, a favorite scent. Our room had a small patio (no view) with two chairs which worked out perfectly as the weather was nice & we liked having a simple breakfast outside before venturing out. There was an espresso machine in the room & we'd bring in croissants to have with our coffees in the a.m. The staff we encountered were all very nice & helpful. I was unsure about the location as before I stayed on the Ile St. Louis which is a perfect location. There is a close metro stop & plenty of cabs are available just around the corner in front of the larger hotel. I enjoy walking in Paris, so I didn't mind the longer walks from the hotel to the area of the Louvre... The only thing I would change about this hotel is I would pick it up & move it to the Ile St. Louis... I will certainly stay here again!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Superb service with immediate availability of the staff when required Room was slightly on the smaller side but very cosy, also the attached small balcony compensated well for this. The hotel is 2 minutes walk from Palais de Congres the conference venue and Porte Maillot metro station which provide easy and quick link to the city centre and other attractions. It is only a pleasant 15 minute walk from Arc de Triomph. Close to the hotel are several good and traditional restaurants. This hotel was a very pleasant surprise to me and my wife who accompanied me. Although he rooms were on the small side they were very cosy and the very uniquely decorated and comfortable lobby was virtually next door this was manned by very friendly staff and had a 'honesty bar' attached to it with free coffee and tea available at all times. The decor of the hotel was unique perhaps almost psychadellic. It is a very quiet and extremely comfortable hotel with the most helpful and friendly staff which made our stay ver comfortable and memorable. Caution: Be careful of the pick pockets in Paris.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel after reading reviews on Tripadvisor and are very pleased we did! The hotel is small and the superior room we had was not huge but we had enough room for our three night stay. The room was very clean, with good quality bedlinen and confortable bed. The bathroom had the biggest shower we've ever seen! Nice touches made our stay extra special, like the bed being turned down each evening, with pillow sprays and chocolates. No outside noise made for a good night's sleep. We did not eat at the hotel, but we did take advantage of the honesty bar and good Nespresso coffee. There are plenty of places nearby to get a pastry and coffee if you don't want to take breakfast at the hotel, as that is rather pricey in our opinion. The location is great for the Palais de Congress, and the Arc de Triomphe is a 10 minute walk away. Tour Eiffel, approx 30 minute walk. Special mention must go to the hotel staff, to Stephane (Front of House Manager) to the Concierge and the housekeepers. They were all very friendly and helpful. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to friends.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is one of the best hotels I have ever been to. The hotel design is fantastic - perfect and of the highest taste and fashion. It is a small hotel so lobby serves as a lounge, and a place where free internet stations with 22" screens are located, and a dining room for breakfast - nicely furnished with very comfortable couches - perfect place to spend an hour in eve after walking through Paris. Rooms are big enough (for Paris - very big!) and our room had a huge bathroom with large two-door window. Everything is brand-new and not just clean - "Monica-clean" (if you are familiar with Friends TV show). Espresso coffee machine in a regular room (included into room rate) - never seen it before! Downstairs coffee and tea are also available 24 hours free of charge. Bar is self-serviced, which gives it really personal touch - you just take whatever drinks you want and report them after. The hotel also has a very nice little garden and fitness with sauna (I did not use fitness). Overall it is amazing how ALL little things and details are well-thought through and delivered in a special way.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Girlfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend and the hotel really was everything we had hoped for and more!! From the moment we arrived to when we checked out, the friendly staff were always on hand to deal with any request and did everything they possibly could to ensure our stay was perfect! We arrived at midday, and despite being told at the time of booking, that our room would not be available until 2pm, they managed to bring this forward so that we could check in straight away. The room itself was full of all the amenities you would hope for, with our own Nespresso coffee machine a great touch. The bathroom was very modern and the huge walk in shower was just great. The location of the hotel is great, situated in a quiet side street away from the main road and only a 15 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe. There is a taxi rank at the end of the street and the nearest metro station, Port Maillot, is only 150 metres from the hotel, providing easy access to the entire city. Jardins de la Villa really did tick all the boxes and I cannot recommend it enough! Can't wait to return!!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This review is based on a 7-night stay during a month long European vacation which involved about 7 different hotels in quick succession, so I have a lot to compare to. The hotel, service, rooms, etc. were all good - the only thing I'd caution other travellers about is the location. It's within walking distance to Arc du Triumph and Champs-Elysees, but that's about it. If you're a first-time visitor to Paris hoping to hit up all the highlights, you're quite a few metro stops away from the Louvre, Orsay, Eiffel Tower, Crypts, Pompidou Center, Notre-Dame, etc. If I was advising a friend, I'd recommend that they save themselves a bit of time and hassle, and stay closer to the action, even if it means paying a little bit more or getting a little bit less for their dollar. One last thing - on the morning that we were leaving, the hotel called us a taxi which wasn't really a taxi (no running meter). Ended up paying 65 EUR for a ride to CDG airport... it would have at least been nice for the hotel to ask me whether I wanted a regular taxi, or a flat-fee service for which they probably get kickbacks for.</p></li>

<li>were all good - the only thing I'd caution other travellers about is the <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.999">location</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>It's within walking distance to Arc du Triumph and Champs-Elysees, but that's about it.</br></br></li>
<li>If you're a first-time visitor to Paris hoping to hit up all the highlights, you're quite a few metro stops away from the Louvre, Orsay, Eiffel Tower, Crypts, Pompidou Center, Notre-Dame, etc.</br></br></li>
<li>If I was advising a friend, I'd recommend that they save themselves a bit of time and hassle, and stay closer to the action, even if it means paying a little bit more or getting a little bit less for their dollar.</br></br></li>
<li>One last thing - on the morning that we were leaving, the hotel called us a taxi which wasn't really a taxi (no running meter).</br></br></li>
<li>Ended up paying 65 EUR for a ride to CDG airport... it would have at least been nice for the hotel to ask me whether I wanted a regular taxi, or a flat-fee service for which they probably get kickbacks for.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Les Jardins de la Villa is a beautiful, if very arty hotel. It has been designed and built to the 'n'th degree of 'boutique-ness' (such a word?), more, it seems to show off the interior designers' skills. That's not to say it wasn't a very beautiful realisation; it was. Our 'superior' room was a tad small and the bathroom not very sound-proofed :-) but it was so very comfortable. It took a little bit to work out the lighting controls and the TV - which though telling us had English language programmes really only presented world news stations and not UK TV programming or SKY(UK). The breakfast buffet was really, really good. That said, I do appreciate if the waiter anticipates my need for salt and pepper and fetches it for me, rather than leaving me to seek it out because it was missing from the table. The hotel is in a very good location and the shopping centre under the Palais des Congres is a definite plus, as far as my wife is concerned. In summary then, an all too short a stay in a beautiful hotel that can still find room for improvement, but one we enjoyed very much. I would recommend it to my wealthier friends. :-)</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for three weeks on business. I was worried about staying in one place for such a long period of time, but Les Jardins was very clean, well-located for my purposes and has comfortably-sized rooms. My only complaint was in regards to the schedule of housekeeping and their respect for the "Privacy" sign. They cleaned the room at different times every day. On several occasions, I would return at 3 or 4pm for a nap after a long work day, and the room had not been cleaned. Well, that's okay, but even if I put the privacy sign on the door, they would knock and/or call to see if I wanted my room cleaned. It kind of defeats the purpose of the "Privacy" sign. I did tell them about this when I checked out, so hopefully they will be more respectful of future guests. Other than this, though, it was a very nice small-ish hotel. The beds were very comfortable, and the blackout curtains were great. They also have Nespresso machines in the rooms. The hotel is conveniently located near the Porte Maillot 1-line metro stop. Another reviewer mentioned that taxis don't know Rue Belidor, so to tell them to take you to Meridian Etoile, the big hotel right around the corner. I definitely found this to be true.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel as a surprise for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved it. The hotel itself is beautiful and very elegantly designed. The staff are attentive and do everything possible to ensure that your stay is as pleasant as possible. We loved the fact that they placed chocolates and scent on our pillows and they even bring you the weather forecast for the following day. The room, although not massive was spotlessly clean and the bathroom immaculate.... with the best shower I have ever experienced. Every detail has been thought of, from the coffee machine in the room, to the safe and the slippers and bath robes. We used the sauna on one occasion and were very impressed that the communal areas were just as clean and well designed as the rooms. The hotel is located right on line one of the metro so getting about is very easy, although I would consider staying slightly more central on another trip to Paris. It takes about 45 minutes to walk to the Eiffel Tower, 15 minutes to the Arc De Triomph and and hour and 15 minutes to city centre, however the metro will get you to the centre in about 10 minutes. All in all I cannot fault the hotel in any way and rest assured you will not be disappointed if you stay here.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was given a surprise trip to Paris for my birthday back in August (sorry it's taken so long to post this review!). It took us a little while to find it, but that was mainly due to our (my!) poor map reading skills...it also took us a little while to come to terms with the Metro lines and how to read those maps. Upon arriving, we were greeted by an incredibly friendly concierge who took the essential details and showed us to our room. It was a cosy room, but really nice - beautiful, minimalistic decor with a wonderful shower and incredibly comfortable bed (with turn-down service thrown in at no extra cost, as we discovered upon arriving back later that evening). All the staff we spoke to were incredibly helpful and respectful; can't rate them highly enough. The hotel was close to the metro, on the central line which takes you to all the main attractions (or most of them anyway). We didn't eat here, preferring to wander out and find little cafe's, so can't comment on the food - although the dining area looked lovely! The whole hotel was beautifully laid out with a very clean feel to it - lots of black and white, with pink accents (something I, in particular, appreciated!). Can't recommend this hotel enough. If/when we return to Paris, we shall definitely be staying here again. Thanks for a wonderful few days!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights in March - and it is a great hotel, close to the metro, nice area with shops and restaurants close by. The only comment we have is that the beds were a bit on the soft side for our liking. However, this is a personal preference and does not reflect badly on the hotel. Rooms are not bit (we are in Paris after all) - but the hotel is nicely done, very modern bath room and a very advanced gym downstairs (the Technogym Kenetics wall is something which we have only seen very few places - and it works very well). The breakfast may at first seem limited if you expect the classical breakfast buffet - however do take time to enjoy and you will see that the products are all first class, and the staff will refill on an ongoing basis. Compared with other 4- and 5-star properties it is fully comparable. Also: the hotel has a selfservice, honesty bar which is great for that afternoon drink/coffee before venturing out for a nice dinner. The hotel is 3 minutes walk from the metro - so do consider buying a daypass for the metro. For dinner there is a number of options close by - however the "Ballon des Ternes" which was recommended by the hotel (http://www.groupe-menut.com/BallonDesTernes/) is soo good that we actually went there twice during our short stay - the seafood is great and the steaks are very well done.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great hotel at a reasonable cost”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here with my wife for four nights at the end of July. We got a half price deal through Hotels.com, which made the price very good given the ratings the hotel had. We had a standard double room on the first floor of the hotel, which also had a balcony. The hotel is every bit as good as previous reviews had suggested. The small botique hotel has been recently renovated, and everything is very clean and to the highest standard. Rooms are relatively neat, and the bathroom is partitioned by a sliding door. This was the only downside to the room - not much soundproofing between the bathoom and the bedroom. We had drinks one evening in the hotel's honesty bar. A wide choice of drinks were available, and although a bit pricey, the sitting/lounge area was very relaxing. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel but ate each morning at small patesserie 20 yards to the right of the hotel. For 9 euros they do a great breakfast of croisants and toasted bread for one third of the price charged by the hotel - great if you are on a budget. Some reviews have stated that the hotel is a bit out of the way, which we didn't agree with. The Arc de Triomphe was a 15 minute walk away and the Ternes metro stop was about 10 minutes from the hotel. There are also a number of great restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner on Avenue Ternes, within a 2 minute walk of the hotel. Overall, this is a great botique hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Neat rooms - with the extra benefit of cigarette smoke, and a rip off breakfast”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here last May on back of good reviews. First the good/neutral things: 1) room is stylish and although not large by Paris standards reasonable; 2) location is convenient - plenty of restaurants. There are more salubrious parts of Paris but good for transport; 3) OK value for money. Downsides: 1) courtyard room gives the ability to open the window onto a nice quiet pleasant spot - until the smokers (who are now expelled to the outside and seem to dominate outside tables etc etc in Paris more than any other city), gather on the ground floor and the delights of cigarette smoke and conversation permeate the room, so window shut. 2) breakfast appalling value for money - Euro 29 for a moderate and a very limited cooked breakfast. I had thought it was included and my fault for not checking properly but when you get a good 5 star hotel full buffet breakfast or al la carte in London for similar price, I was flabbergasted . One day we had appalling service from the staff member responsible for standard things not available.. We were basically told to get stuffed by the staff member. Took this up to management who did acknowledge the poor service, but for the quality of breakfast and lack of choice etc, a fair price would be around Euro12. The positive was finding out how expensive it was, so we went to the boulangerie for breakfast afterwards. Overall recommendation - if you smoke and have breakfast outside the hotel - great. Otherwise keep searching one of the toughest cities in the world to find a really decent good value hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Finding a hotel in Paris, or any capital city for that matter, that offers convenience, reasonable pricing and quality in equal measure is a complex equation to solve. Usually one factor will override the others and you will be left feeling one factor is significantly lacking. Not so at Les Jardins de la Villa, it epitomises everything a small capital hotel should be: - Convenient, a few minutes from the AF buses that run frequently to CDG and Porte Maillot metro station. - Pricing, my room was 25% lower than other 4* hotels (Le Meridien Etoile, et al.) and when you’re staying a for a few weeks the difference is massive. - Quality, absolutely 1st class. The interior of the hotel and rooms is some of the best I have seen outside of 5* hotels. He attention to detail is meticulous. The room was on the small side but beautifully designed and decorated, the lounge and bar area were excellent and the honesty bar had a good selection of drinks and snacks. The room was completely sound proof and excellent curtains completely shut out the spring sunshine when needed. - Staff, all great and happy to help. Alexander at the desk was especially helpful and one of the best hotel employees I have encountered. In summary I can highly recommend Les Jardins de la Villa. The small hotel feel only adds to the experience. The only negatives I would make are: - Breakfast was a little pricey (27 Euros) considering all I really wanted was a coffee and croissant. - Complimentary Internet access was slow and occasionally disconnected. I would have preferred a pay option for faster and stable speeds. Really minor issues in the grand scheme of things.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just got back from five nights in Paris and had the time of my life. Les Jardins de la Villa was responsible in large part for my enjoyment. As most of these reviews note, it's a true boutique hotel--five floors with, as I recall, four rooms per floor. So the feel is intimate and cozy. I stayed in a suite on the top floor. It was not a suite in the classic sense of the word--there was only one main room and I didn't have a couch or any other true living room furniture. But it was perfect for my needs, comfortable and beautifully decorated. Even the bathroom was a treat with a rain forest showerhead and a tub that was literally big enough for me to float in (and I'm 5'5"). Everything is of excellent quality, with all the little touches that make a difference--a Nespresso machine in the room, chocolates every night and lavender scented spray for the pillows. The staff is so welcoming and kind, and really go out of their way to see to your needs. The location is terrific. I've seen some concern voiced that the hotel is off the beaten path. It may not be located on the Champs Elysees. But it's only a ten minute walk to the Arch de Triomphe and the metro is half a block away. You can be at the Louvre in 15 minutes. There are also several excellent bistros within a few minutes walk, and a fairly large mall under the Palais des Congres where you can find a Paul's, a market and other services. I loved the neighborhood. It was quiet enough that I slept with my windows open every night and had no trouble falling to sleep. This is an absolutely wonderful haven after a busy day of shopping and sightseeing. When I return to Paris, I know Les Jardins de la Villa will be my first choice when it comes to choosing a hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is very cute and unique in style. Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly receptionist who spoke excellent English! We had booked a standard (termed superior) room. I had read some reviews stating that these rooms were somewhat small so I wasn't expecting much space, however I was pleasantly surprised. Although certainly not huge the room was plenty big enough to store our luggage and move around comfortably. The LCD tv and modern style of the room were great and the free coffee machine was a nice addition. The bathroom was also modern in style and pretty luxurious, with toiletries and bathrobes provided. The only problem we had at all within the room was the shower. It was great to use but wet the majority of the bathroom floor hence the footing of toilet remained wet after you had showered, a poor design. Apart from this we were extremely happy with the room on the whole. The only other gripe was the rate we paid did not include breakfast and this was €29 each as an extra!! Very steep for a continental breakfast. This was not a huge problem however as we tended to eat in a local restaurant for approx €15 each. We didn't use the facilities such as the gym or sauna so couldn't comment as we didn't have the time - but all of the communal areas were luxurious so I would imagine they were good. The location was pretty good too - the metro is only a few minutes walk and it's on the line which takes you to hotel de ville ( town hall with open air ice rink) - a great experience! A short walk from there to notre dame - a must see - within a lovely district. Also easy to get to the champs élysées and louvre museum. Overall would recommend and would return to this hotel of we were to revisit Paris in the future.</p></li>

<li>The <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.999">location</span> was pretty good too - the metro is only a few minutes walk and it's on the line which takes you to hotel de ville ( town hall with open air ice rink) - a great experience!</br></br></li>
<li>A short walk from there to notre dame - a must see - within a lovely district.</br></br></li>
<li>Also easy to get to the champs élysées and louvre museum.</br></br></li>
<li>Overall would recommend and would return to this hotel of we were to revisit Paris in the future.</br></br></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">this hotel is located in zone 2 of paris and not zone 1 (ie central). however it is just 2 metro stops away from arc de triumph or about a 6euro taxi ride. the louvre is about 6 stops away. effiel tower about 5 aside from the negative bias towards the location the hotel is very good. the room was big, bright and furnished to a very high standard. modern decor. everything like new. lovely tv, wardrobe, bathroom (although no bath tub but the biggest shower ive seen can fit 4-5 people!), coffee machine, lovely carpet. however like the other reviewers the shower can have a tendency to overflow and partially flood the bathroom staff were friendly, helpful and presentable however my partner left some loose change on the table during the middle of our stay and we found it was gone! maid mistaken it for a tip we guess. also it appeared bottle of water was only offered on day 1. we never recieved any more bottles after day 1. also soap bars intermittently replaced. i advise you not to leave euros on the table! also my partner noticed the maid did not top up the coffee machine with water and inconsistency with the tea selection. one day we would get english breakfast but never again (weird). my partner also noticed hole in sheets but next day gone. so they did change the sheets! breakfast was not included and expensive. think it was 17euros. across the road there is a shopping centre and one floor down there is a paul and supermarket. the lunch dinner menu at hotel wasnt also much cop. however along the main road (boulevards des marechaux) from the nearest metro station (porte maillot) to hotel there a number of good reasonable priced restaurants i wanted to give a 5 but in the end we decided a 4. definitely recommended if you do not mind taking the metro/inconsistency with maid service. a strong 4 or 4+</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Wonderful stay which was sadly ruined.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband booked this as a surprise, romantic weekend for my 40th birthday. The hotel is located down a side road and what a hidden gem we thought we had found. All the staff that we met were attentive, polite and nothing was enough trouble. Our room was beautiful, we noticed that some rooms had balconies but were told that these rooms were smaller, I suppose it's what you prefer. We were impressed with the fact that many of the movies in the room were free, having recently stayed in the Savoy in London and being charged £12 for a film we were pleased that this hotel did not exploit this service.On our first night we were recommended to a most wonderful restaurant, located in a square and within easy walking distance of the hotel. We are both big "foodies" and have eaten in many fine dining restaurants, our meal was one of the best we have ever had, the place had a relaxed rustic charm and the food was sensational!!! I must also mention Stephane and Chris who were both delightful and helpful throughout our stay. Sadly our wonderful stay was ruined upon our return home. I had left behind a pair of boots and trousers, the boots were returned to me but after numerous phone calls and emails the trousers have not been returned. The only conclusion I can come to is that a member of staff has taken them which is totally unacceptable for a small luxury hotel. I hasten to add that my trousers were very unusual and expensive and were my birthday present from my children. I find it appalling that someone can take something that does not belong to them and I hope that the person reads this review and realises the impact it has on the hotel. I feel sorry for all the other members of staff who are working so hard to maintain the high level of customer service, I unfortunately felt I could not give the hotel a high rating. My advice to you if you do decide to stay here is to check your room thoroughly before you leave.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Hotel! - Beware of Special Offer”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I travelled to this hotel on the 3rd weekend in February and really did enjoy our stay. The facilities and general attention to detail were second to none. The staff I found to be generally helpful. This is a stylish yet quaint hotel that is nice to come back to once you have spent the day sightseeing. My only complaint concerns the booking of the room itself through the hotels website. I have since simulated a booking to check that what I am telling you is accurate: I was initially seduced by the free breakfast special offer. When you use this link, be absolutely sure that you have the free breakfast included in your rate once the website takes you through the booking procedure. I booked a Deluxe Room over a weekend for 450EUR having navigated through the special offer screen. It wasn't obvious on the confirmation page that the special offer had been included. I therefore added additional comments pertaining to the breakfast offer when given the opportunity - these comments requested the hotel to confirm by email that the free breakfast was included. The comments were also added to my final confirmation printout. I forgot all about the booking until the weekend in question. When I arrived at the hotel I queried the offer with the evening staff who said they would check. We took breakfast on the saturday morning but not on the sunday as we were time constrained. When we came to check out - surprise surprise the breakfast was not included. The hotel weren't giving any concessions when I discussed this with them and I did not want an arguement - so paid. I will add that the breakfast is very expensive, so do confirm and perhaps make your booking by phone to ensure you are able to clarify at the time of deposit payment. There is a nice restaurant around the corner which is far cheaper and it would have been nice to have that option in mind. I will add that the crisps from the minibar are the most expensive on the planet at 8EUR a bag! However, this was only a mild souring to an otherwise hitch free trip!</p></li>
