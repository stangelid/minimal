<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location. Friendly staff. The free breakfast was the best I have had yet at a Holiday Inn Express.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was very nicely located. It was only a 5 or 6 block walk to Times Square. It was also nicely located for the City Sights bus tour pick ups as well as the subway. The continental breakfast was okay. Nothing special, but there was plenty of food. Rooms were small, but that was as expected in the city. Housekeeping wasn't the best about replacing things, but the rooms were neat & clean. I would stay here again if I went back to New York.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is in a great location, only a few blocks from Time Square. It was very convenient. Going to Times Square and able to go back to the Hotel and drop of things or rest was very helpful. The hotel is surrounded by high end restaurants and some hidden local restaurants that serve delicious food. Wonderful Hot Breakfast and service. Service provided by the staff was great as well. The only downfall was the elevators. The elevators were slow at times.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This recently revamped Holiday Inn Express is in a great location, and very quiet. One odd downside-there was no toilet seat cover, nor a hook on the back of the bathroom door. One had to get pretty creative to change in the bathroom! Not an issue if you're travelling alone. The street can get a little sketchy at night, so I would not recommend a late night stroll alone. Nice free continental breakfast and a charming staff. No restaurant in the hotel though.</p></li>

We started searching for a inexpensive hotel an Holiday Inn Express popped up. We took a look around the area using Google and we were glad we stayed in this hotel. Penn Station, Times Square, Empire State, 5th Avenue, Broadway all within walking distance and for a price that did not break the bank. If you are looking for a basic place place to sleep and would like a central location, this is it.</p></li>

It was a last minute thing but all the hotels were extremely expensive we walked in Holiday inn Express and spoke to the front desk I believe her name was Juicy Villanueva not only was she nice and accommodating she gave us at such a wonderful price which made us decide on staying two nights instead of one. overall this hotel was affordable, comfortable and the staff is just amazing. also the location is in the middle of the city which makes travel so much easier.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just went to NYC for the first time and satyed in the Holiday Inn Express Time Square from Tues. March 13- Fri. March 16, 2012 This is literally around the corner from Time Square. It was not only a very convient location, but it was extremely clean (as I have a high standard of cleanliness and can be extremely picky). The breakfast area could have more room .. however, it is NYC. Great "free" breakfast. If I ever go back to NYC, this is the place I will stay. Staff was extremely helpful and pleasant to get help from.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was very welcoming and warm. Service from ALL members of staff was excellent. The room was small, but perfectly formed, had every thing we needed. it was only a short walk away from times square its self. we found a couple of really good restaurants a few streets away, which the reception staff helped us with. The best thing i can say is! 'stay there' its great. they even look after your luggage for you, after you've checked out. I'd definitely recommend this hotel. Oh and you get a really nice breakfast thrown in with the price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On our first trip to New York City we wanted to choose a place reasonably cheap and accessible from the key tourist attractions the city has to offer. Holiday Inn Express Times Square met these two criteria to perfection. Sure, the rooms are small but who wants to stay in a hotel room all day when in New York? The breakfast option was okay for a quick start to the day, if only a little busy. The room itself was clean and well appointed, and quiet enough on the 12th floor to get a good night's sleep. A great place to stay for a short trip to NYC.</p></li>

It was clean, staff were great, breakfast was really yummy and what an amazing location. We could walk right out the door and be right in the heart of things.

And the hotel is in a great location. We had a decent sized room with two large double beds. Bathroom was fine. Complimentary breakfast was wonderful. Staff did a good job keeping the breakfast supplies stocked with hot eggs, breakfast patties, cinnamon rolls and lots of fresh coffee. The room rates were very reasonable. Overall, I was very pleased. My family members were pleased and I highly recommend this Holiday Inn Express when visiting NYC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Holiday Inn Express is so close to so many NYC attractions! The hotel is clean and comfortable and the breakfast in the morning is always tasty. The hotel is fairly new I think and very clean (I can't sress that enough - I'm quite particular about cleanliness). My boyfriend and I stayed in one of the king leisure suites, which was still small, but it's New York, that's to be expected. We were only sleeping there anyway. The elevator was pretty quick and the hotel staff was approachable and helpful when asked for help. The price was right as well and I would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

The rooms are very small, we had two double beds. But it was clean and comfortable. All of the expected amenities. The breakfast, included, was fresh and delicious.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great hotel in a great location for the price. 2 blocks from a subway. Walking distance to times square. Rooms are clean and bed is comfortable. I don't know when, but the property seems to have been renovated recently. The immediate area is average ... not trendy, but not a slum. Felt safe walking to/from hotel at night. Small rooms, but that's what you expect in NYC. Free breakfast included cereal, juice, yogurt, scrambled eggs w/ cheese, biscuits, gravy, sausage, toast, bagels, coffee, fruit. Get down early though, because later it's a zoo. Staff was friendly and helpful. I'd stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My third stay in new york and this hotel was the best as far as value was concerned. Rooms are small but as expected. Given early check in at 11am. Front desk staff were excellent and heeded to my request for a third floor room. Breakfast was enjoyable and we were always there at 7:30am when it was always quite. Good location with easy walk to all attractions. For USD200.00 per night for a family of 4 including brealfast exceeded my expectations for a New York Hotel!! Remember you just need to plan to beat the crowds at breakfast and request a lower floor room..Therefore book early and youll also get the best rate!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for the weekend for the comic con and the place was packed. The room was clean, beds comfortable with reliable wifi service. Service was excellent all throughout. They guided me VERY well on where to go and told me the best place to eat when they found out I was alone. Breakfast was basic but fulfilling. Everything suited my needs perfectly EXCEPT for the noise! It seemed to penetrate everywhere! Location great because it's near times square and near West 46th and 9th avenue where the restaurant row is. It was also a very close walk to the Javits Convention Center where the event I was attending was located.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Learn from friends about this hotel. Also read up on reviews from other tripadvisor members. Find the place exactly as described. I like the free breakfast offered, especially with fresh fruits being provided every morning. The room is clean and beds comfortable after a long day of shopping and sight-seeing. The location of the hotel is good because it is only 5 minutes walk from 42nd st. subway station. Across the street there is a Starbuck coffee shop. Even though the hotel is located in the middle of the 39th st., it is quite save to walk back to it in late evening, especially after a Boardway show. Good deal for family visit in NYC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My parents and I have stayed in this particular Holiday Inn during our Christmas vacation in December 2011 from North Carolina. We are very impressed by the professionalism of the staff, particularly the Hotel Manager, Ms. Juicy Villanueva who went above and beyond her call of duty to accomodate us, and make our experience truly memorable. She is an ANGEL! In addition, the rates are reasonable; complimentary breakfast is excellent; the rooms are cleaned/nice/stylish, and the location is superb! It is right in the heart of Times Square. My family and I would definitely welcome another amazing experience in this hotel. We highly recommend it to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here from the 1st December for 3 nights and had a lovely stay. We werent in the hotel much as we were out and about exploring the sights! This hotel is set a little walk away from Times Square, but we walked in everyday so it was OK. Breakfast was.... questionable. It was OK but you can find nicer breakfasts out, but the buffet bfast was all complimentary so we didnt moan. Free Wifi, there are 2 computers to use in the lobby but i connected my phone to it and was great to have to keep in touch with the UK. Rooms are clean and beds are very comfortable. Bathroom very clean, What more could we ask for! Great Hotel and would reccoment to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On arrival I found that my booking had been cancelled due to my supplier (chase travel) going bankrupt. Hassan, the front office manager, took charge and sorted things very quickly,efficiently, and in a most friendly manner. The room was a little small but spotlessly clean. All the amenities were very good. Quality of food at breakfast was excellent. The only moan that I could have was that the breakfast room was extremely cold.. This however did not mar my enjoyment of our stay. Had it not been for Hassan we could have had a disastrous visit to the Big Apple. Would also mention a restaurant, Frankie and Johnnies on 8th Ave and 45th Street. STEAK TO DIE FOR.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not sure what this hotel is with only six rooms per floor. Paid $299 per night and had great expectations given its location. It is one of three hotels crammed into one building. Nothing is good about this hotel but the location. Tub had dents, carpet was worn, furniture broken. There are only two elevators for more than 30+ floors and they seemed broken all the time. The front desk staff were helpful but the remainder of the staff was a joke. Tiny lobby and down hill from there. The "breakfast" is help in a back room the size of a closet and not worth the time to look at. Mostly juice and a machine that makes rubber pancakes. There are better hotels out there. AVOID!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The staff was great, rooms were really clean, and no bed bugs! Got a room with a view so I could have that real NY feeling. If you do that, you must be okay with a lot of noise. Pizzeria across the street is really good. Had the hotel breakfast every morning and it was very good. Coffee is delish and so are the cinnamon rolls baked fresh! Perfect location. Walked to times square everyday and caught subway to all destinations. I felt safe even at night. Only two elevators so there is a wait at times. Very nice hotel for the price. It was a good first timer experience. I would go back today if I could get the room for free. For now, I will save my money for another visit next year hopefully.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A friend and I were visiting a friend in Brooklyn and at the last minute, we decided to stay in Manhattan to be closer to restaurants and to Broadway (and to be a bit more comfortable too). We didn't want to spend a lot and tried using Priceline and got this hotel for $100 for 1 night compared to the $300 advertised! The hotel was a quick walk to Time Square and the staff were friendly and efficient. We had a king size bed and the room was clean and roomy enough for the 3 of us. The bathroom was clean. It was a great stay. We were also up on the 23rd floor and heard no street traffic or noise. The only complaint was that some of the TV channels were fuzzy, but we didn't go there to watch TV.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When they say it's located IN times square, this is a LIE. It is a few blocks from "the" times square and is extremely small. The front desk is rude, we called for a travel kit (as the sign in the bathroom said if we needed it to call) and they did not give it to us. We waited about 45 minutes after calling about 6 times and still didn't receive it. The "lobby" is literally the size of my bedroom and the rooms aren't any better. They are very very small, can barely fit your luggage. We ended up taking the stairs most times cause the elevator was always full or taking way too long. After the first night we immediately changed to the Renaissance actually located IN times square, and had a VERY enjoyable stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned on Monday from New York. We had a great time. We paid a bit more for a King Size room with City view - it was so worth it! Our view had been that we would not be in the room much but it was worth it to wake up and go to sleep everynight viewing the landscape and Emplire State Building. Breakfast was included which was great and the staff could not do more to help us. I agree with others about the lift but would equaly say that there is nothing they can do about this - it is a towe block with three other hotels and we never had to wait more than 5 minutes. The hotel was very central and if you have been out for a long day there is a little restaurant and bar across the road that does great food and cocktails.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed four nights in this hotel and overall was a very good experience. Impressed with the cleanliness, the breakfast was better than expected - good choices for a healthy breakfast. Close to Times Square, a bit of a walk. Helpful front desk staff. We experienced no waits or problems with the elevators and we were on the 35th floor. The positives far outweighed the negatives for us. The ice machines were only on certain floors, ours being one so it was noisy in the middle of the night when people came to get ice at 3 in the morning. Rooms were a bit small but if you're just sleeping there, which we were, it was good. Air conditioner worked extremely well, the amenities in the bathroom were fine. We would stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location was quite central without being too much in the heart of it - noise and lights were not a problem. Roughly a 5-10 minute walk to the heart of times square. Room was comfortable but don't expect anything too flash. I thought it a little pricey for what it was, however it is quite close to all the action so you are most likely paying for location. Also had a great view of parts of the skyline from my room. Do NOT eat the breakfast here. It is all plastic American food served in a a small university type cafe which is crowded. The only good thing about it was the fresh fruit - grab an apple or banana and go out for real coffee! It was ok, not bad, not great. However, good location. The staff were wonderful and very helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is everything that you expect from a budget hotel. The rooms are very basic but equipped with all you need for a short city break. We were on the 34th floor (never had a problem with the lifts) and had great views of the city. An added bonus was the FREE hot breakfast every day! Unfortunately we were there on the "hurricane Irene" weekend so there was absolutely no public transport, all theatres and shops were closed and most of the restaurants. As a result all our sightseeing was done on foot and I have to say we could not fault the hotel in terms of its central position. The day we left the hotel arranged a taxi to the airport which was very reasonably priced and very efficient - arriving 15mins before the time booked.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had to come to NYC for a business conference and needed to be near Times Square, but my boss said it had to be less than $X per night. It was a challenge, but the HIE fit the bill perfectly. The price was right (even low for the area). The room was small, but comfortable with a nice view of the southern end of the city. It was within easy walking distance to Times Square. My wife went with me, and she was thrilled that the hotel was right in the garment district! The included breakfast made my company controller happy - no NYC priced breakfasts on my expense report! I became a fan of HIE when the brand first came into existence, and hotels like this one do a great job of solidifying the reputation of clean, safe, convenient locations. Great job!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived from London on the 28th Dec and we had booked two rooms as it was my sons 22nd birthday whilst we were in town. It was our first trip to New York and the hotel was ideally situated right in the heart of everything that was happening. We asked for adjoining rooms on a high floor and we had two rooms on the 26th floor - for 5 nights. The rooms were ideal and had everything in them that you need for a short break - there are only 6 rooms on each floor and there are ice machines and vending machines on four of the floors. There are only 2 lifts so you may have to wait a couple of minutes at peak times. Breakfast was good and plentiful - staff were constantly replenishing items and were more than happy to help out. Definitely worth the money ..</p></li>

My mom would personally like to express her thanks as do I for her birthday card, balloon and bottle of red wine left in our room, we were overwhelmed and very touched by your wishes. We were made to feel at home from the very beginning of our stay and were helped in every way possible. We did not want to leave! We would happily stay with you again. The complimentary breakfast was delicious as were the cookies and chocolates. The use of the internet enabled us to stay in contact with home and check all our fight details resulting in a stressfree holiday. Everyone was extremely frindly and helpful. Thank you again for such a lovely experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Selected this Hotel because it was near Javits Convention Center where a trade show was happening. A good start to the day with a substantial free breakfast, loved the cookies in the evening! Room was very neat and clean. Front desk was a great help when we had to extend our stay an extra day because of the weather. We did have to change rooms but the staff moved our bags while we were at the Trade Show. Front desk found a car for us to take us to the airport. Driver was great and the price was not anymore than a cab would be. Several comments about the elevators being slow - we didn't find that to be the case and were on the 25th floor. The Hotel does seem to host many student groups but they were fine - though it did make the breakfast area a bit busy!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was in a great location and the staff was very helpful. We arrived early after a red eye flight and they were able to find us a room where we could drop our bags off and take a quick shower. The temperature was perfect. The elevators are a little slow for such a busy hotel, but the location and everything makes up for it. The rooms are just the right size for a times square hotel. The only problem we had was after we checked we left something in the hotel room and had to call lost and found multiple times before some answered and even that time we had to leave a message but were assured that someone would call us back - despite those guarantees we still haven't heard back... Even so, would definitely stay at the hotel again, just next time I'll triple check the room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 1 week at the end of march with my girlfriend,checked in early which was a bonus, front of desk where so polite and friendly.room was on floor 25 was very clean and tidy. Free breakfast sets you up for the day it's amazing and the cinnamon rolls are perfect!! The staff working in the hotel are really polite. We could even checkout at 2pm this was a bonus because our flight back to the uk wasn't until 8pm so that was perfect,they even stored our luggage until we needed it and called a cab! It's these little touches me alot.My only niggle ( small one ) was sometimes you have to wait a little while for the lift but that's not too bad. Highly recommend this hotel as the location to times square and metro are perfect. Well done holiday inn express I would visit again 9.5/10</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in the hotel for about 10 days before flying back to the UK and thoroughly enjoyed my stay! First up, the hotel is in a great location, right next to times square, broadway and penn station. Rooms are small, but thats expected in the type of hotel it is! They are very comfy rooms though and clean! Free Wifi is also available! Staff were friendly enough but only really spoke to them at check in/out. Only problem we had was the breakfasts... which were very nice but it was always so busy that there would be nothing left! And I don't know whether it is because I'm British and enjoy a good queue but it was more or less a free for all and people would fight to get the food! But apart from that the hotel is great value and definitely a good place to stay especially for young couples!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wow, where do I start. Maybe the guy standing outside the front of the hotel urinating against the wall when we arrived. There is a very popular gay night club on the corner and it get very crowded with the outside lines. Saw a few alteration and fights on the nights I was returning to our room. It is a few blocks from Times Square so it is very convenient. Rooms are very small but the staff was helpful when the shower plugged up, air condition started smelling like it was burning. Elevator waits were long. Lobby was packed with luggage everywhere and no where to sit down in the lobby other than the four seats which were always taken. This was my 5th trip to NY and I have stayed in much nicer but costly hotels. So I guess the moral of the story really is ..you do get what you pay for especially in New York.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great experience through and through. I had a problem checking in (reservation made and confirmation number provided but no record on file.

The staff couldn't do enough for any request you had. Nice room. Cosy, but more than adequate. Warm cookies at 5pm! Rock on. Great proximity to Times Square and subway on 40th (which is the closest station and you can pathway underneath the surface away from the elements). Subway takes you anywhere. Must eat at Carmines but be careful they are the largest portions ever. AND the food is exceptional. Must shop at Century 21; awesome (this from a guy!!) Enjoy this great city.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here with my family for a couple of nights in April 2010 after becoming stranded in New York due to the disruption caused by the volcanic eruptions in Iceland. Clean, well-presented hotel with helpful staff. We had a decent sized room with two large double beds. Bathroom was fine. Complimentary breakfast was reasonable, albeit a bit of a busy scramble - possibly because the hotel was so busy with stranded travellers running short on money !! Staff did a good job trying to keep the breakfast supplies topped up in the circumstances. Central location within easy walking distance of all midtown sites eg Empire State, Rockerfeller Centre, Times Square, Macy's etc Seemed to offer reasonable room rates (outwith the unexpected peak in demand that we experienced). Overall I would happily recommend this as a good basic hotel for a short break in NYC.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was one of the better priced hotels that we could find on our trip. We took the bus from Newark airport to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, from there it is a brief, maximum 10 minute walk to this hotel. From the street it was hard to see, and once there the lobby area was small. Our room was on the 26 floor, which cost us a few dollars extra. This is well worth doing as there are only 2 elevators and it seemed like anyone staying lower than the 20th floor had to often wait for another elevator during rush times such as breakfast. There is no restaurant, just a continental breakfast. The room was small, but very clean & comfortable. If you are in New York to see the sights & are only concerned about sleep & not spending a lot of waking hours in your room, then you will be alright with this place. I would recommend this place for those on a budget visiting New York.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 5 nights in September 2011. Has all the usual features of a Holiday Inn Express being free continental breakfast and free wifi which works in the room. Bed was comfortable but I think the king is actually shorter than a normal king as my feet hung over the end (I'm 6ft). Close to the subway and Times Square. The only issue I had was that breakfast is quite busy and that elevators are slow. When we were one of the elevators was out of service so this made it worse but they did extend the breakfast timings. The sheets were not changed when requested with the sign on the pillow or every third day that they claim the change them regardless. Airconditioner was old and noisy, had to be used on auto versus low fan for any chance at sleep (so it cut in and out instead of continuous). Probably would try somewhere else next time. Was also woken at 0400 when the garbage was emptied on the street.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ok for the price. If you book early enough you can get a hotel closer to times square for the same amount. This hotel is about 4-5 blocks from Times Square. Our room was not ready when we arrived and was still not ready after 3:00 as promised, however, the staff did get us another room. This hotel is very clean and very quiet. Aside from the location being a little far from activities, the lobby and breakfast area are too small to accommodate all of the guests. There are only two elevators and NO SERVICE elevator. During breakfast time, it is impossible to get an elevator going down. (we actually had to go up and then down after waiting forever). Not many hotel amenities ie.. no stamps, gift shop etc. as found in most other hotels. Had to go down several floors for ice and vending and wait for the elevator. Overall staff was nice and concierge was very helpful. Ok place but for a few dollars more, I would stay more centrally located.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here mid september 2011 for 4 nights as a family. We had 2 rooms on the 5th floor, both quite small but adequate for our needs which were basically sleep and shower. We wasn't expecting huge rooms for the price in NYC and you shouldn't either, but they're not needed. Bathroom facilities were fine, bath and shower all we needed really. The breakfast here is nice, good selection of teas coffees and juices, pancakes, fruit, yoghurt, bagels and different hot breakfast foods, filled us up nicely. Breakfast room is quite small but we always got a table at 7-7.30am, it started to get busy at 8am. There's only 2 lifts so can be a problem if there's lots of people using them but it's just a case of being patient! Free wifi was great in this hotel, good speed and no problems. Good location, about 5-10mins from Times Square and more importantly about 10mins walking from Macys ;) All in all a good hotel in a good location, and we got what we paid for.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I originally wanted to stay in the Marriott Marquis in Times Square, but due to a last minute jump in airfare, decided for the less expensive Holiday Inn Express. The rooms were decent sized for a New York City hotel room. Everything was VERY clean and modern. The rooms featured the Holiday Inn Express bedding collection, triple sheeted, with a duvet and NOT a comforter. HDTVs are used in the rooms. We had a view of the city street below and some buildings. Very cool! The rate was incredible! I would even say DIRT CHEAP. I'd say a great value for the price. The hotel was in a great location...sort of "off the beaten path" of Times Square (less noise!) but well walkable to great dining and the theatre district. Also, it was conveniently located near the PABT transit location! I felt very safe in the area. If you're looking for a clean, convenient place to stay, you've found a great pick! Don't be expecting a mansion for a room, but expect free WiFi and breakfast!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">2 of my friends and I spent 2 days in NYC Times Sq this past Sun/Mon. The staff at this HIE were wonderful. Available, courteous, thoughtful and caring. Alex and Oksana particularly were exceptional. Concierge, parking valets, houskeeping staff - they were all excellent. We asked for extra towels...they were there in 5 minutes (no exagerration). Breakfast (free) hot and appetizing and a lot of variety. Assistance with directions around town - given pleasantly. HIE should be very thankful to have employees that are as conscientious as these men and women. I hope they're recognized and rewarded by HIE. This hotel was so nice, I was happy to walk through the doors each time we had to go back to our room. We have decided to make trips to NYC a little more frequently than we have been and we will definitely use this HIE. The location is absolutely perfect...enough of a walking distance to everything we wanted to do. Just thoroughly enjoyed our experience. Thank you Alex!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I think the Holiday Inn Express near Times Square is an excellent hotel. The employees are so professional, and service minded. Jaime at the front desk made us feel very welcome and he gave us lots of tips about restaurants and he was helpful about the subway. The breakfast in the morning was well stocked, there was everything we needed to start our day, eggs {3 kinds}, pancakes, toast, english muffins, bagles, yogurt, sausage, oatmeal, cereal and very delicious coffee. The mornings are extremely busy in the eating area and the elevators get extremely busy. The only negative comment I could make is not the hotel's fault, there is a big construction project across the street that start at 7AM, it woke me up 2 times. There are probably 5 hotels that are close to the construction, so everyone is being affected. I wish the construction started at 8AM. It looks like the construction project will last at least a year, so bring earplugs! The internet worked extremely well.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed our stay at the Holiday Inn. No bed bugs! We checked before staying on the first night. Not the most salubrious area of NY but lose (walking distance) to all requirements - theatres, shopping, subway, eating. The room was pokey - VERY but we had everything we needed. Breakfast was quite adequate, though the use of disposable plates/cutlery, became frustrating! Staff were amazingly polite and helpful. We called the front desk when we didn't have hot water GeForce a shower, but it was fixed ASAP and the engineer came to the room and apologised for the inconvenience. Not sure where the coffee/tea making facilities were meant to be used! But we ended up with it in the bathroom! Very little space or anything of that nature - again, plastic cups! Good hair dryer supplied, plenty of access to mirrors too -,used to make the room appear bigger, I'm guessing. Like many hotels - the main lighting was poor but we weren't in the room that much.

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for three nights at the beginning of May and have enjoyed our stay very much. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful in answering all our questions with a smile. The rooms were clean, our king sized bed and pillows were just perfect. The complementary breakfast was also very good in both quantity and quality: omelettes, scrambled eggs, sausages, pancakes, bagels, toast, yogurt, fresh fruit salad, cheese, muffins, cinnamon rolls, coffee, tea, fruit juices, etc. The only drawback to our great stay is the elevator service during breakfast hours. There are only two elevators for all 36 floors and the wait times are long. We found the solution though: press the up and down buttons no matter the direction you are going and get in the first one that arrives. If you wait for an empty one going your direction, you might have to wait a long time. Apart from the breakfast traffic, there were no excessive elevators waiting periods. We recommend this hotel whole-heartedly.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having stayed at many Holiday Inn Express properties in Canada and the US I have to say that this one is just ok. The staff were neither rude nor really pleasant, the room was ok - showing some wear and tear, particularly in the bathroom. The bed was somewhat comfortable, but not the best. As other reviewers have mentioned the location is not the best. It is in the garment or "fashion" district which really means it is sandwiched in between industrial buildings and wholesale fabric stores. It is a few blocks away from Times Square (not IN Times Square as the name implies) but it is still a good 12 block or so walk to most of the theatres. The food was disappointing compared to other HIE's. The biscuits were dried out and they staff seemed to ahve a hard time replenishing the breakfast room with enough food to feed the amount of people that were in and out of there every morning. We booked this room with Airmiles so we weren't that concerned but if I had paid full price I would have been disappointed.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was just what we were looking for; close to subway stations, shops, restaurants and a few blocks from Times Square. Set close to the fashion district, it may not be based in the busiest of streets, but after long day, sight-seeing or visiting friends. It was a place, my friend and I, were proud to call home for 5 days. When we arrived in New York, it was good to see Jamie smiling and helping us out in reception. The staff were very freindly and nothing was too much bother. Breakfast was a good kick start in the morning, and complimentary web access was avaialble near reception, to look up places for the day ahead. Before booking the hotel I had read reviews, that rooms at this hotel are small, that maybe so. However, although they are quite small, they give you everything you need for a comfortable stay. Good beds, a tv, desk area and a compact bathroom with shower and bath. We definately look forward to returning here in the future. Its clean, comfortable and friendly. What more do you need.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had to stay for 5 nights in this hotel on a business trip. The hotel has defined special rates with the company I work for. Otherwise I wouldn't have selected it. The room is ok and clean. Considering the fact that the hotel is located quite centrally in Manhattan the price is also ok. During my stay in January it was quite cold. In the first night the heating system didn't work at all. In the morning the room temperature was 13° Celsius. When I left the hotel at 07:30 in the morning I asked at the reception for fixing the heating mentioning the very low temperature in my room. When I returned to the hotel at noon the heating still didn't work. I had to ask a second time for fixing the heating. During the night you have to turn off the heating because of the noise of the fan. But despite I turned the heating off the fan went on from time to time for a short time. What was very unpleasant and it disturbed my sleep considerably. After the second night I again had to complain about the heating but they were not able to fix it.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall not very impressed with this hotel, room 701 is an accessible room which we were made aware of at the time of booking however it's either haunted or needs a maintenance overhaul! The door bell kept randomly going off at all hours and as the room is accessible this meant the bell was extra large with flashing lights! This woke us at least 4 times during the two night stay. In addition drainage was poor and a short shower would flood the entire bathroom and spill out onto the hall carpet which to avoid meant using the towels at the bathroom door as a barrier! Breakfast was very busy both mornings and not enough seating for guests. Finally beware of the dry cleaning service, I checked a shirt and trousers totalling $16.50 according to the slip in the room, when collecting the cost doubled to $33 and the slip I had completed wad not attached to my cleaning but a totally new one with very different prices! It took a while but I did get the receptionist to agree to amend the bill eventually! Overall poor hotel but good location.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got back from our stay in NYC from December 4 - 8th, 2009 and what a great place to stay at. The staff was wonderful, everyone from the front desk staff to housekeeping - they were all so courteous, polite and very accomodating. The Continental Breakfast was excellent! There was always enough food for everyone - never a shortage! The rooms were small but very clean! Location was great - just 3 blocks to Time Square. Also within walking distance to Broadway and 5th Avenue. 39th Street is not the greatest to walk down in the night as all the businesses close around 6:00 pm so it feels a little unsafe. You just have to take 8th Avenue to 42nd and you are fine. There is always a lot of traffic and people walking there! When leaving we were met by the bell man and asked if we needed a shuttle ride to the airport. Price was great and our driver was very professional, courteous and very friendly - got us to the airport quickly and safely. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is travelling to NYC for a great great vacation!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staff on front desk were very good - both at check in and out. They arranged for my bags (including computer) to be stored safely during the day and also organised taxi back to the Airport. A previous reviewer had remarked on the elevators being insufficient for the number of rooms - I certainly agree with this! Luckily I was on the second floor (of more than 30) - or British first floor - and when the lift didn't materialise it was an easy matter to take one flight of stairs. The rooms and bathroom was small, but adequate, with a coffee machine included as well as the usual desk and TV. Biggest problem was the aircon/heater. I was using the latter as I had arrived at lunch time on the day of the "big storm" ... many inches of snow. When operating the heater was very noisy - certainly too noisy to use at night when sleep would have been impossible. Breakfast selection was excellent with both cooked and cold items. However, the experience rather marred by the cramped breakfast room having to cater for so many people - AND cutlery and plates all plastic.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently spent a night at the Holiday Inn Express. It was a quick stay as I had a business meeting in mid town manhattan. The hotel lives true to its name with a quick and easy check in and check out process. The rooms are small, as expected in NYC. The breakfast was satisfying and COMPLIMENTARY. I recommend a change in the brand of coffee. One thing I must mention is the service I received at this hotel. The breakfast staff was friendly and helpful in finding me salt and pepper when I asked for it. I must point out the above and beyond custopmer service that I received from the front desk and concierge. Both Amanda and Nabela were exceptional with helping me when I needed assistance. Amanda went out of her way to get my luggage as the bellmen were not found. I was running late for my flight and Nabela personally went outside in the rain to hail me a taxi. I am one who travels very much and this would probably not have been a hotel I would have returned to due to the construction noise but service like this is what I look forward to when away from home. THANK YOU GUYS!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You would think by it's name it would be a good hotel, let me list the inconviences.. -When we arrived, it was 6 adults and 4 children. We ordered 3 rooms and 1 of the 3 werent ready..and it was way after check-in..so we into the 2 rooms to wait and we rtealized they gave us the wrong rooms. We went to talk to the concierge and he said when you book and they don't have the room available the give you the standard room..BUT THEY DONT TELL YOU AND YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY THE SAME PRICE. Funny part is, he knew it was not what we booked and didnt say anything at the check-in. -When we returned from our night out the room still wasn't ready, so we practically paid for a room we didnt use. -DONT VALET YOUR CAR..I WAITED 1 HOUR FOR IT!!! And when the valet guy pulled up he was doing about 65mph in my truck. Oh and parking was $55, you would think for that price it would be 1 minute. -One room had a doorbell that was broke and went off beeping all night and they never fixed it..we told them and they said "oh well" -When we tried to explain our issues to Oksana the receptionist, she had a terrible attitude and was annoyed at us because he hotel sucked!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is centrally located with great links for public transport. The area isn't the smartest but is safe and improving, 4 new hotels hace been built in the last few years on the street, more development is going on and there is a trendy restaurant opposite and in nearby Hells Kitchen. The rooms are comfortable, quiet and with enough storage for 2 of us staying for 3 weeks. Housekeeping is excellent.The rooms are not large but reasonable by NY standards with good quality furniture anf great bed(s). The highest floors cost a little more and those on the street side have really good views, ESB in one direction and the Statue of Liberty in the other. There are 34 floors but only 6 rooms on each floor, there are 2 fast lifts but at busy times you do have to wait. The complimentary breakfast provides a wide choice including cooked items, breads, cereals, yoghurts, fruit and pancakes and everything is replenished as needed. It is self service and very much a canteen setting but it is kept clean and there are trays so you can take breakfast to your room if you prefer. As well as tea and coffee facilities in the room, there are complimentary hot drinks and cold water available 24hrs in the breakfast room. Staff are helpful and friendly and overall this is a well managed, good value hotel that we would use again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for 2 nites this past weekend. The hotel is squeezed in between 2 other affialiated hotels, a candlewood suites and a hampton inn. Location is on 39th street,about 150 feet from the corner of 9th ave-- 4 block walk to times square. 9th is better to walk at night to TS as 39th street is mostly businesses closed by 6pm and deserted. Rooms are compact on the order of a Eureopean hotel room, with about two feet of space on the side of the K bed near the window. Breakfeast and free internet are available, making for a nice savings on the rate. Rooms are quiet-we were on the 32nd fl and heard no street noise nor from adjacent rooms-4 rooms to a floor, 36 floors. Hotel is less than 1 year old so rooms are fresh and comfortable. One of the elevators seemed to be fast and the other slow. Staff is friendly and hotel concierge is helpful. Nearest subway is 8th/42. Good restaurant choices in Hells Kitchen area/restaurant row-try our favorite, Hell's Kitchen for upscale mexican and Basiliica across the street for the prixe fixe pre-theatre special. For theatre tickets, 50% off tyr the Visitor's Ino Cetner at 7th/53. All other things being equal , because of the location, I would stay at the Marriott Courtyard Times Sq on 40th/7th as that hotel is better situated toTS and more amenities. See prior review.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very decent hotel, located in a quiet street in Manhattan. It's not exactly in Times Square (about 3-4 blocks from the actual Times Square) but not far to walk or difficult to find. The street itself was quiet - which meant a good sleep at night, but just don't be walking around late at night on your own! (Then again, this is Manhattan!) Rooms were a very good size with a very comfortable bed, good lighting and very nice bathroom. Housekeeping kept the rooms nice and clean every night and the temperature could be adjusted easily. Free Wi-Fi in the hotel is definitely a plus plus! The front desk staff were exceptionally helpful and always tried to help, even if they were very busy. Safety deposit boxes are available for free, and the front desk staff were always helpful and pleasant when we needed to go into them more than once a day! Only downside was breakfast. The variety of food wasn't fantastic, and the hot food was not the best. The selection was the same everyday - frittata, omelette, scones, muffins, sausages, burger patties and cinnamon rolls. The continental selection was acceptable though, and I enjoyed hot chocolate and oatmeal everyday, with a couple of types of cereal, 2-3 types of oatmeal, fruit, yoghurt and bread. Overall, decent for a 3 star hotel in Manhattan. If the price is right, will definitely be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I are professionals who live on Long Island and work long days in Manhattan and NJ. Between the 2 of us, we stay in hotels in Manhattan 1-2x weekly. Sometimes I arrive late the night before working so I won't have to commute the next day. While HI Express at 39th St. isn't in the best area and I could pay to stay in a more upscale neighborhood -- but the staff is so accommodating and the hotel rooms so clean and comfortable I keep coming back. Evening staff --specifically, Rudy-- is professional, courteous, and makes check-in a positive experience --even if it's 1 AM. Over the years I've had negative experiences checking in after midnight . On one occasion I pre-paid for a room and despite calling to say I'd arrive at midnight -- my room was given away. I received an apology and was offered a refund that took 2 weeks to process..... but needless to say after traveling back home at 1 am and missing work the next day, I want nothing to do with that hotel chain (a big name in the industry, begins with "M"). At this HI Express --not only will they hold your room and offer the best available location but if you arrive late and are a Priority Club member, they offer late checkout. Add to that free breakfast and lovely Christmas decor in the lobby. I doubt there's a friendlier, cleaner, more comfortable hotel at this price in Manhattan.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Inn for only one night but we were there for 2 full days. Staff was friendly and efficient. They held our bags at 8 am until we came back later and checked in around 3 pm. The room & bathroom were very clean and actually matched the pictures shown. Beds & 4 pillows per bed were comfy. The room had all the basic amenities (iron/board, hairdryer, coffee & maker, toiletries) and the elevators were pretty quick. We didn't use the wi-fi, but they offered it for no charge throughout the hotel & in the room! They also have two computers & 1 printer in the lobby that we did use to check into our flight & print our boarding passes. The FREE continental breakfast was actually more than just a danish. They had bagels, yougurt, eggs, biscuts, fruit, yougurt & more. An outdoor enclosed patio was opened that morning to accomodate the breakfast goers with tables and chairs, nice. We check out early the next day and they held our bags again. I truly enjoed my stay there. I paid half the price that I did last year for another hotel and it was in bad condition. This one seems like its taylored for the business traveler, but it worked for us since we just needed a place for a night. Closer to Port Authority Bus Terminal than to Times Square, but not too far from the subway (couple of blocks). Although it looked full, we didn't hear anything from the rooms next to us. I would visit again!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If I compared this hotel, to other hotels we have stayed in, it would not rate highly. However, this is New York, and I have to take into account, that people are prepared to pay more to get less, given the location. In this case, the location is within walking distance of Times square (though a few blocks away), Macys/5th Avenue, The Empire State Building etc. That said, the location is not particularly "desirable", there was garbage left on the Street for the first 2 days (it was a holiday weekend), with the accompanying unpleasant smells, and hobos in residence. It was safe though, infact after a (self imposed) 32 year absence, the best thing I can say about New York, is that it seemed very "safe". The hotel itself was ok, a tall slim building, with only 6 rooms on each floor. The 2 lifts were inadequate to meet the needs of guests, with long waits at any time of day. The rooms were small, but clean. Ther beds were surprisingly comfortable. The maid did however, forget to leave adequate towels/shampoos etc, on every day we were there. They seemed to be in short supply, as we were given Candlewood Suite shampoos on our last day. Breakfast was ok, with a large variety on offer. Get up early to avoid the queuing. I personally, would not choose to come to New York again, as I am not a fan. However, this hotel is good for those on a budget (New York hotel prices are unreasonably high), this hotel is in a central, if not the smartest, location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One of the major advantages is having an excellent location; you're withing walking distance of Times Square, 5th Avenue, Top of the Rock, Port Authority Bus Station (3 minutes away!) The staff was very pleasant and helpful, the rooms were a bit on the small side but comfortable enough. And it's not like you're going to be spending a lot of time on your room anyway, you're in New York! The complimentary breakfast was of good quality with sufficient choice of food, even for my vegetarian co-travellers. Some comments; - there are only 2 elevators for the entire thirty-something floors, and one of them was regularly blocked for use (by staff?), whilst the other one sometimes had problems to speed up so it would take ages to get to our floor (which was the 18th...) - you could clearly hear any loud neighbours, people walking through the hallways or stairs, elevators making bing-sounds all night long, etc. So bring earplugs - Good thing was that there was the possibility to store your luggage after check-out so you could make the most of your day exploring the cities. And the luggage was tagged and behind closed doors, so not like anyone going to take your laptop from you. - The staff in the entire hotel was friendly and helpful. I especially recommend Jamie for any questions you might have on places to go, things to do, restaurants to eat at. He's been very helpful for us and had a good insight into what travellers want when they have a very limited amount of time to spend in New York.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I can say that our family was satisfied with our stay at the Holiday Inn Express. We requested for adjacent rooms since we were a big group and we were getting 3 rooms and wanted to be near each other, this request has been granted. We also requested for early check-in and happily this has been granted as well. Rooms were a little small, but knowing New York we were already ready for this. Beds were very comfortable and rooms were clean. We were very happy with the free WIFI and free breakfast every morning. There were a lot of choices for breakfast and we always left the hotel very full and ready to hit the pavements. There was also a computer at the ground floor for guests who did not bring their computers with them. Front Desk and Concierge staff were friendly and ready to help for any queries. There was an Italian restaurant just across the hotel which served very good food and was recommended by Lonely Planet. Also a sandwich bar just around the corner for quick bites. There are a lot of restaurants near the hotel for diverse choices. It is quite a walk to Times Square though but location wise, it still gives you value for money. Only problem we encountered with the hotel was that the elevator would get quite full during the breakfast rush, we would just sometimes use the stairs because the 2 lifts would not be enough to accommodate all the guests. My advice would be either to take breakfast very early or late just to avoid wasting time by waiting for the elevators. All in all, we were happy with the hotel and would recommend it to anyone who will ask.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Let me start out by saying NY is an expensive place to visit! We were looking for a family (for 4)  friendly clean place that we could walk to times square. We selected this place based on a special offer email we received. It was still something like $160 a night, but we went for it. It's easily the most bizarre slice of hotel we'd seen (not counting londons doubletree) It was a narrow grouping of 4 rooms per floor, and went a ways up. Somsandwiched between a days inn and something else. We were cool with it though until we saw our room! For a family of 4: - the 2 queen beds were built into the walls with a small floating shared nightstand - there was a window ac unit (you needed to climb on our bed to access it) - there was no way to lay down suitcases to access, as there wasn't enough floor space. So we kept our bags packed, and pulled them onto our beds to extract items, then place them back on the floor upright. - the bathroom was unfinished, and had a pedestal sink. There was no toilet cover, so you had no choice but to lay your clothes and essentials on the floor. - maid service was very noisy in the entire hotel(you're right next to exerything) - the free business center is in a basic bomb shell area with no wifi, just ancient desktop pcs! I had to conduct my businiess phone meeting with vacuums and lots of people. - no bar to grab some wine or snacks - there was however breakfast offered All in all.... What you'd expect in NYC. It wasn't perfect, but the price was right. Dirty rooms, good locale and crackerbox tiny! Maid service sucks Wake up call never came</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Overall very satisfied with the hotel but good luck getting a cab to the airport”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was slightly uneasy about selecting a hotel in NYC for a trip with two girlfriends this past weekend because of the current bed bug issue and our relative unfamiliarity with the city, but this hotel was nearly perfect for our needs. The rooms were very clean, the beds and linens were comfortable, and the location was pretty central. We actually had a phenomenal experience dealing with the staff - the front desk and cleaning staff were incredibly helpful and polite. It would have been a flawless experience had it not been for the very last part of my trip. When I was leaving the hotel to catch my flight out of LaGuardia, the bellman offered to hail me a cab. After approx 5-10 minutes it was clear he was having some difficulty getting a cab to the airport. He informed me the hotel contracted with a private car company and I could take one of their rides for $45 - a rate that included all tolls and gratuity. I was skeptical since I had heard these rides were a scam, but he assured me this company was affiliated with the hotel and trustworthy. Since $45 was around what I was expecting to pay in total for the cab and I confirmed with him THREE times that this was a flat rate, I agreed. Not five minutes into the ride was the driver attempting to get more cash out of me and saying that the $45 did not include toll fees. Unbelievable. I persisted and refused to give him any additional money but it really left a bad taste in my mouth. I would not recommend any hotel guests use this option, and I would recommend the hotel seriously consider switching the company they work with for this service or at least audit the drivers or bellman. Other than that I would highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you come to this hotel BEWARE of the rude, arrogant staff. The front desk personnel is very rude especially ALEX. Several occassions I had problems with my room (the toilet) and went to the front desk. (Alex asked me what did I do to the toilet. He claimed each time I reported it they came and fixed it. I am sorry but I don't destroy others property! I was in shock to be accussed.) They acted like you were bothering them when you expected them to help you. The nerve of me to ask them for help! My sister and I stayed there for 7 nights. On the 4th day, our toilet clogged up. It took me three days of complaining before the lady in charge of maintenance came to our room and told us that we should have called her department to report it. Who knew that telling the front desk was not the good option? Anyway, the night before we were to leave, she came up with the solution to leave the plunger in our room for us to use in case it clogged up again. SERIOUSLY, I AM PAYING GOOD MONEY TO HAVE TO PLUNGE MY OWN TOILET?? I would have put up a big fight except for the fact that we were checking out the next morning. THANK GOODNESS! Needless to say, it got old and smelly having to put up with a broken toilet for those last days and nights. I wrote a personal email to Mr. Hunter's email and after a week, still have not gotten any type of reply. It makes me feel as though he does not believe the horrible experience that we had. I visit NY twice a year and decided to try this hotel this time. I must say that I have never been treated this way by any other hotel in NY. If you are expecting good service from this hotel, you are warned. They do not know what good service is. They should also give their front desk staff training in customer relations as they certainly do need it!!</p></li>
