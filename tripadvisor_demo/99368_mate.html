<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">enjoyed our stay I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in mid Oct. I got $209 per night weekend rate which I think it was a pretty good deal by its location. The hotel seems got remodeled recently. I like the new room d茅cor, much better than the one I saw two years ago. I gave it 8 out of 10 score.</p></li>

The front desk staff was friendly, everything was clean, and the room was taken care of. It is very centrally located and has some nice restaurants nearby. I would definitely stay there again when I go into manhattan for a show and stay overnight.</p></li>

Price was extremely reasonable for a hotel 2 blocks from 42nd/Broadway (Times Square) ! Plasma TV was a nice plus. Although no inhouse room-service, there are LOTS of restaurants close by that are open late and will deliver right up to your room. Highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Feel at home In the midst of the hustle and bustle in New York City, on the south side of Times Square lies the closest thing to home you can get! The Courtyard typically seems to have a good rate, is very clean, and makes you feel at home. That feeling is hard to achieve in a typical Manhattan hotel. There were no disappointments with this hotel besides the fact that they do not offer room service.</p></li>

If you can get a rate which includes breakfast all the better - unfortunately we couldn't.</p></li>

This hotel exceed my expectations. The staff were genuinely friendly and gave a very warm welcome. The location of the hotel was perfect. Times Square was only a block away . The room itself was very spacious and spotlessly clean. Terrific Value. The Courtyard will now be my hotel of choice on my next visit to the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nothing wrong, but also nothing special There were a lot of good things about this hotel, great location on a quiet side street but still near Times Square and subway stations, really a WONDERFUL bed, friendly staff, clean, etc. But is was also nothing special. The furnishings, artwork, facilities, etc. were uninspired. I would really suggest the Affinia 50 for roughly the same price you want a truly elegant and unique hotel in New York.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic - Location, Service - Everything!! This Hotel is FANTASTIC and I will definitely recommend it. It is a little gem in the heart of New York - not expensive at all, very clean, friendly staff, wonderful atmosphere - we enjoyed every minute we stayed at this hotel. The location is excellent - near all the attractions. We stayed there over christmas - it was a wonderful experience. I will definitely return to the Marriot Courtyard!!</p></li>

Great location: near to it all, but quiet! 5 pillows for each double bed, view of Empire State Bldg, intimate size- not too busy, elevators always quick and readily available! Hotel breakfast not worth it when coffee shops abound and free coffee is in the lobby!</p></li>

We took advantage of the complementary breakfast (offered with our Amex rewards points that we used to book the hotel), walked easily to all the surrounding sites (Times Square, Empire State Building -- we could see it from our windows, just as I had requested!), and the staff were prompt and courteous.Definitely recommend this!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel Great Staff I spent only 1 night here on my way back from a long weekend in DC. The place was great, king size bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. Room a good size, flat screen TV is great. Bathroom a little small but more than adequate.Only one slight complaint. Ice and soda machines only on the lower level. (I was on the 30th floor). Other than that, everything is great. Staff is very nice, efficient and helpful. Will stay again.</p></li>

I booked directly with the hotel.I was able to pick a room location on line. I prefer lower location rooms. I was given a second floor room. I was very pleased! The room was a good size. Very Clean! The bed was so comfortable, bedding was nice and soft. The pillows were amazing. It actually was better than my bed at home. I would definately reccomend this hotel.</p></li>

Our room - with 2 queen beds - was a generous size by NYC standards. The room was modern and clean and the beds are the new Marriott beds - quite comfortable! The front desk staff and the concierge were both extremely helpful in making arrangements for dinner and the trip to the airport the following morning. For the price, location  staff courtesy, this hotel is highly recommended.</p></li>

(there is another Courtyard down the street, I don't know about it) Have been to several hotels in Manhattan and like that this is right around the corner from all the action of TImes Square yet quiet at night. Nice sized rooms. Friendly and very helpful staff. Nice to have complimentary coffee and tea always available. Can easily walk either downtown or uptown. Easy to get to subways. This would be our first choice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location, location, location It's like the real estate people say -- location really does matter. If you're into theater, this place this perfect. Only about 10-15 minutes' walk from the theater district, but thankfully away from the madness of Times Square. Just a block from Grand Central (meaning lots of subway connections), right off of Fifth Avenue . . . I mean, what else can you ask? What's more -- given NYC prices and the neighborhood -- it was fairly priced. Clean, comfortable, good service, all that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, clean room, overall good choice! My husband and I stayed at the Courtyard last Saturday night and were very happy with our stay. The hotel is within easy walking distance to all the theatres; the room was very clean and comfortable; the gym is adequate for a simple workout and the staff was friendly. As previous reveiwers mentioned, the elevators can be a little slow, but it wasn't a major problem. For the price, I think this hotel is a bargain for New York City and would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pleased, once again! This was my third stay at this hotel. Everyone that works at this Marriott is extremely helpful and friendly. They go out of their way to offer assistance. My son (11 yrs old) and I were visiting NYC for a fun 3 day vacation together. Chris helped us navigate the subway and get to our Yankee Boat and Merrit helped us hail two cabs. The room that we had was just fabulous-quiet, clean and the beds were super comfortable. We were also able to use the computer in the lobby to check our email. We will be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good Find Spent one night at this hotel. Was happy with the room on the 27th floor facing 40th St., although there is no view. Room was small but comfortable. Check-in was fast and check-out can be done by voicemail. Free wireless Internet reliable. A personal safe in the room was big enough to hold a notebook computer. There were few inconveniences. There is no ice or vending machine on the floor. You need to go down to the lower lobby level. But once you're there, there is plenty of drinks and snacks. Also, the drain in the bathtub is very noisy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Thank you for your reviews I read all available reviews of this hotel before I made a reservation. The hotel was just as good as expected. The check in and check out was superfast. There was a flat tv in the room and we got a room with a view to the Empire State Building without asking it. When we arrived to the room we got a phone call from reception and they asked if everything is ok in the room.This is a hotel near Tmes Square and Macy's so whatyou can concentrate on them and the hotel will take care of everything else. So what's more to be expected !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">everything was great From the helpful, friendly staff to the delicious coffee in the lobby this hotel was everything a hotel should be. The location is close to the theatre district and several good restaurants. There is a subway station close by too. The room was clean and new looking. I can't say enough about the staff; the concierge was knowledgeable and friendly. She made reservations for us for dinner. We drove in and our car was parked for us. The hotel is simple to get to from the Lincoln tunnel and getting out was just as easy. I will stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great theatre district choice Have stayed at this hotel several times for its proximity to both transportation hubs. For a no-frills place they do everything well and right. Warm welcome, nice-looking though smallish lobby, rooms are quiet and immaculate.Great breakfasts (no dinners at most Courtyards), huge snack selection on lower level and pleasant employees make this a great choice for either business travelers (very swift checkouts!), those wishing to cover the midtown sights easily or, like myself, a purchaser of early-morning Amtrak tickets.Highly recommended!</p></li>

We were there on vacation and enjoying NYC for the first time.Our room was a double/double on the 20th floor. The room had plenty of space for the three of us (mom/dad/son). The bathroom also had plenty of room. My only complaint about the room was that the door to the bathroom would not stay open and so the bathroom smelled somewhat stale.The front desk staff was friendly and helpful with recommendations.For the location and price, the hotel was well worth it. We would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved it! I drained our Marriott Reward acct for a 4 night stay in December 2006 when hotels are reeeeaaaaalllllllllllly pricey in NYC. (I made the reservations 6 months in advance.) The room was not ready til about 4PM (I arrived at 8AM on the red eye). But it was worth the wait--- a spotless, comfortable room with a big cushy bed and a dead-on view of the Empire State Building which was all lighted up in red and green. There was soft Christmas music playing when I walked in!Free internet. Fast elevator. Fantastic location. I was in heaven andit was free (the rooms were going for $500 a night that week!)</p></li>

The concierge was great! Very friendly and helpful. She pointed me to some very good restaurants. With the exception of one person at the front desk who must've had a very bad day, the front desk crew was very friendly. The only negative is that the in-house restaurant is closed in the evenings which is the first time that I've encountered such a situation at a Marriott property.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great place to stay in NYC! We have just spent Christmas in NYC and stayed at the Courtyard Times Square South. This hotel will not disappoint! The rooms are very clean and very comfortable. The front desk and concierge staff are extremely friendly and very accommodating. The location can't be beat - - - just steps away from the 42nd Street subway to the west and the Bryant Park subway to the east. Breakfast available in the hotel, although we didn't partake given the high prices. Walked everywhere - and this is possible because of the central location. We will DEFINITELY stay here once again - great value, great staff, great price, great hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Solid hotel for business trip! I went to NYC for a conference that was held at the Marriott Marquis. Rooms weren't available there so I looked for something close. This was a 5 minute walk from the Marquis. I was impressed with this hotel, and I'm not one to be easily impressed. Reasons include:It was efficient. The service was great.Internet was free. Bed was comfy with lots of pillows.Flat screen tv with enough channels.Shower was great.Quiet.Only thing I didn't get was a view. (But this is nyc... what can you expect.)If my trip was personal, I wouldn't stay near Times Sq, but it was close to Penn Station, and close to the conference. Great hotel to choose.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Made in Manhatten The Courtyard Marriot is an excellent choice for a hotel.It is right in Times Square next to the Theatre Districtand the staff always goes out of their way to be helpful.The reception area is very nice and everyone makesyou feel welcome.I was surprised by the big room, as a lot of places inNew York have very small rooms. And the room whichwas located on the 29th floor was quiet. No soundsof traffic or garbage pick-ups.Included in our package was a full breakfast every morning with your choice of buffet or different items from the menu.Of course staying in Manhatten is Magnificent, with Theatre, Museums,Shopping and the best restaurants!!!!Enjoy</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location This hotel is in a great location - walking distance to Times Square, excellent shopping, ESB, Top of the Rock, good restaurants. It is also close to the subway station which is a huge bonus.Staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean. The decor was fine - nothing fancy, but just fine.Bryant Park it just half a block away. We would grab breakfast from the Pax deli on the corner (good, and very reasonably priced) and sit in the park to eat, drink coffee and people watch. This is not a luxury hotel (it is a Courtyard after all) but for this category/type of hotel I would highly recommend staying here. We will stay again on future trips.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Gem in New York City Stayed at the Courtyard unexpectedly for 1 night, May 24th 2007, when we missed our connecting Delta flight to Rome. We have stayed at many other Manhattan properties, but for the money, this was truly the BEST!!!. Efficient and friendly check in, exceptional rate ($199.00 in NYC at Times Square), clean modern and comfortable rooms. They even allowed a late check out until 2PM so we did not have to hang around the airport more than necessary. Since our bags did not arrive with us, they even gave us a small pack of laundry soap to wash out our essentials. A big thanks to Marriott for helping smooth out the bumps in our trip. We will be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Couldn't be better Just got back from staying here with my daughter for 4 nights. Absolutely fantastic. We had a great room on 26th floor overlooking Empire State building. Staff extremely friendly and welcoming every time we entered hotel. Great location - oasis of calm just off Times Square. Room was large - two double beds, very comfortable, clean with all amenities, even an iron and board. Coffee machine in lobby which was free and always a fruit bowl or candy bowl in the lobby. Concierge gave great advice on restaurants in the area and bell hop Merick booked us taxi back to airport and looked after our luggage etc. Easy check-in and out.Would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

Had quoted ESB view, but there was certainly no view of empire state from my room. Not fussed thou.Room was clean, beds comforable. Only issue was on second night was noisy other residents at 3am for half an hour running between rooms shouting.Hotel is located in excellent locality.Overall a good place to for our first stay in NYC for 2 years. Would reccomend.Whilst in new york visit the Ground zero museum in the meat packer district - superb.</p></li>

It is a fairly new tall and narrow building squeezed between two larger ones so there's little natural light, but the rooms are what you'd typically expect from a Marriott Courtyard, and surprisingly roomy for Manhattan...clean with comfortable bedding and plush towels, free internet, good in-room coffee (avoid the lobby machine stuff), flat screen TV, and most of all, a very professional and helpful staff. (We did not choose to use their breakfast option). And the price...$299 for a king-size... is matchless for a nice place in midtown. We will definitely return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location and quiet We just stayed for 3 nights at the Courtyard in Times Square. It's got to be the quietest hotel on Times Square. We never heard any noise. Maybe because it's on 40th street; just far enough so you're not in the major crowds, but close to everything! Breakfast was wonderful, but pricey. Everyone was very friendly. Our room was typical, but we never spent much time there. The only problem we had was the night before we left, the front desk told us to come 10 minutes before we needed to leave and they would flag down a taxi for us. The next day, they said they couldn't do it and we'd just have to do it ourselves. We did, but it took a while. We'd definitely stay here again.</p></li>

Comfortable room, friendly staff, the coffee and fruit in the lobby was a nice touch.Good location, subway station on the corner, drug store next door for those things you've forgotten, two blocks from Times Square.There's also a park on the corner of 6th Ave so a nice place to have a coffee or sit down for a while.There's an excellent deli on the cnr of Broadway and 41st called Dukes - serves everything from sandwiches and bagels to Asian soups to Sushi and good salads - that's a very convenient place for a breakfast or a quick lunch.Overall an excellent stay - not cheap, about $300/night with taxes but it is a Marriott in Manhattan so that's to be expected.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very Friendly We have just returned from a 6 night stay at the Courtyard at Mariott in Times Square New York. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the hotel was central and not far from the attractions. We received a very warm welcome from the friendly reception staff. The reception area was very clean and smelt lovely. Our room was small but clean, the bed extremely comfortable. Our telephone charger did not work and the staff went out of their way to find a charger for us. The only disappointment was no bar in the hotel although there were many bars in the surrounding area and actually did not matter. Breakfast was good and again the staff were extremely friendly and helpful.We would definately go there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Friendly hotel in good location We recently stayed 3 nights at the Courtyard Marriott Times Square South. We arrived slightly ahead of check-in but it was no problem for the staff. They were always helpful with a smile on their faces. We even received a late checkout (2pm!) when we asked. The bed was super comfortable and the room and bathroom were very clean. The street itself was quiet for being so close to Times Square. The subway was just on the corner and Bryant Park was also nearby as a welcome patch of green in the city. Ate breakfast at the cafe nearby - Harrie's Bakery. All in all, good standard and friendly staff. However, not unique or exciting. Value not great, but about average price for New York weekends!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Couldn't have been better! I have stayed in several hotels in NYC and this was the best for the best price. The room was large for NYC standards and the pillow-top mattresses were perfect after long days on our feet. Location was awesome...next to all of the attractions but still in a place where sleep was not disturbed by noise. The biggest plus though was the staff who were always extremely courteous and helpful. After we left we realized that our cellphone was left on the bed. We called and someone was sent to the room while we were still on the phone. The phone couldn't be located and we were disappointed but an hour later the manager called and said he had sent someone to look in the laundry and there it was!! We will definately stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Tripadvisor gets it right I stayed at this hotel 12/25 to 12/27 and found it to bea very nice hotel which was quite luxorious for theprice. Staff were excellent in every respect. The roomwas very clean and well lit with bedding that cancompete with the best hotels. Very quiet with excellentsound proofing. Location is perfect for subway travelto all parts of the city. I had to go to Soho and did soin less than a half hour including the one blockwalk to catch the number one subway to Franklin. Sameease of travel for going to the upper east sidearround Madison. My only complaint is the $45 forvalet parking, but they got my car for me in twentyminutes when I had to leave. Very easy to get to fromthe Lincoln Tunnel, just go straight up 40th street four blocks and you are there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Friendly reception The hotel is very convenient to the subway F train, and to times square. Upon arrival, the staff at the reception area were very warm,friendly and welcoming. Although we reserved a king room, only a room with two beds were available, probably because we arrived aroung 6:30pm. But we were put in a king room the following night. Room with the two beds had a small refrigerator, but the king bed room had none. The bathroom door in both room did not stay open, so had to squeeze a small towel under the door to hold it in position. Rooms were clean. Coffee machine in lobby convenient. They should offer breakfast to elite members like the Hilton guest program, but otherwise i would definitely stay here again if the rate is good. Staff at the front made you feel safe by acknowledging those who entered the property.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very Nice We stayed at this property for three nights in early April. The location was excellent, near Times Square but far enough off of Times Square to avoid the noise, lights, and bustle while trying to sleep. Subway stations are very close, making it easy to visit areas outside of walking distance.We did not use the breakfast room, though it looked and smelled very nice. We opted instead for bagels in Bryant Park, which is very near. Service at the hotel was excellent. We arrived near midnight on a Sunday night without our luggage, thanks to a cancelled flight, and the staff was very accommodating. They had a nice supply of free emergency toiletries available that they were quick to dispense. When we checked out, the bellman was prompt to assist us with our bags.The room was clean and roomy and the bed was very comfortable. I would highly recommend this property.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Basic hotel - concierge useless We came here for 4 nights including new years. The hotel was clean, nice rooms although sort of small, but ok for manhattan. The location is a 4 min walk from Time Square and the theaters and only about $10 cab ride to Canal street. No issues with the hotel itself EXCEPT the concierge services. If you are going to stay here, make sure you don't need concierge help. They were really dissapointing. We asked them to make New Years eve reservations and then went out for the day. When we came back to the hotel we found out that the concierge didn't make the reservation and as a result we didn't have a reservation for New Years. Then thier internet went down and for 1.5 days they couldn't do anything for us. This told me that as a concierge service they didn't really have any contacts, just the www same as me. They really screwed up our new years eve plans.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good choice This was my first stay at this hotel, and I was pleasantly surprised- I have had mixed luck with sub-$300 rooms in NYC in the past, but this property was clean, updated, and pleasant. It is a few blocks off of Times Square, seems like a good location for tourists and theater-goers. I was in for business so did not get too upset that my room looked out to the gloomy, nondescript back side of the office building next door.The room was clean and comfortable, and reasonably roomy. The bed was very comfortable, apparently had all new bedding. Front desk and bellman staff were very friendly and helpful, and even though there is no taxi stand at the hotel, they went out of their way to flag a cab for me. Security seems good, too- the elevators require a keycard to operate, and the staff was vigilant about checking that people using the common areas were indeed registered hotel guests.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect Location Decent sized room, clean and comfortable and the bed was brilliant. I see that small rooms are normal in NY, but not here. They are about the average size you would expect outside of the city. The location is also excellent for Time Square and Bryant Square. Subway on the corner and right next to a Dele and an Irish Bar (good pub grub at a reasonable cost). If walking is not a problem to you then you are perfect in this hotel for all the local attractions. Macys is about 10 mins as is 5th ave. Time Square 3 mins and central park about 15 mins. If I return to NY, I will look this hotel up right away. Staff were all friendly and helpfull without exception. One thing missing is a restaurant on the premises for evening meals and snacks, but with so much on offer outside, this is no big deal and there is a breakfast room and this was very clean, smart and with a good selection.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Comfortable stay After reading the reviews above, my husband and I stayed at this hotel on Dec 24-26, 2007. I think the reviews were representative of the stay--the room was on the 24th floor, it was very quiet, clean, and comfortable. The room and bathroom were a little on the small side, but that is New York. The important thing is that it was a clean, well-appointed room. We slept well. All the hotel staff we dealt with were very nice and accomodating. Liked how they had free internet (with printer) in the hotel lobby. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant on 12/25 and it was more than adequate and reasonably priced for a sit down breakfast. Note that the rate we paid per night was $150 (this is the AAA rate from the Marriott.com website). Considering the price (assuming I could get this rate again), location (steps from Times Square/Bryant Park) and the room, I would definitely consider staying here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect We stayed here for 3 nights this week having chosen carefully from the reviews on this site, and it was perfect. I was dreading arriving and being disappointed with the room or noise etc, but it was absolutely ideal. It is justifiably in the top 10(ish) of most popular hotels.The hotel could not be in a better location being minutes from Times Square, Bryant Park, Penn Station, Macy's, Grand Central and the Empire States Building.The hotel is shoe-horned into a slim space betweeen two office blocks, but is incredibly well-kept and quiet. The staff were extremely polite and welcoming, the concierge was excellent, and the room was lovely. It is true that the bed was the comfiest I have ever known!I can be quite critical, but cannot find a single fault with this hotel. If you are able to afford to pay about $300 per night, definitely stay here.I am hoping to return to NY and will certainly be back at this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location This hotel is in a perfect location and our stay was out of this world. Times Square is a 5 min walk!! The hotel itself is currently being updated and our room was fine and the bed was amazingly comfortable...Don't bother with the coffee in your room as there is free tea and coffee machine in the lobby.. Use this....Be warned however that the price quoted DOES NOT INCLUDED LOCAL TAX. A typical 4 night stay will add a further 拢120 to the quote you get from this website...For those wishing to do New York on a budget I would pay more to get a better quality hotel as the the additional travel costs make it not worth it..... Location fantastic, close to Macys, Empire State Building Broadway Shows Times Square..However, when we were there the broadway shows were still on strike. We had an amazing time and nothing was too much trouble for the staff.I would highly recommed this hotel. Would we go back??? YES.RegardsLee</p></li>

The picture on their website did not look very appealing and certainly does not do justice鈥e were pleasantly surprised  very impressed when we arrived. I can assure you the rooms are very reasonably priced and extremely clean. The beds were made everyday  we were provided with fresh towels everyday too! The location could not be any better 鈥?literally on the doorstep of Times Square! The staff were extremely polite, friendly and helpful. 鈥lso very good on security! Get complimentary coffee machine in the lobby, which we used frequently! There were no faults that we could find 鈥?thoroughly enjoyed our stay! It really would be rude to ask for anything more!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hot in NYC but Cool at the Courtyard Our family of four (parents and adult sons) stayed in two rooms on different floors, even though we requested to be on the same floor. Your key card allowed you to take the elevator to your own floor making getting back and forth to the other room tricky. This was really the only downside for us. The night clerk when we arrived was surly and rude about our request and our effort to connect with the family members who arrived before and after us. On the upside: We all agreed the beds were comfortable; there was a great shower with lots of thick towels, and the rooms were clean. Loved the buffet breakfasts with omelets made to order and very fresh cut fruit. Loved the coffee pot in our room and in the lobby. The location near Time Square was perfect for what we were doing - subway was close, taxis always available. Concierge staff and others at the front desk we spoke to were very helpful. And the air conditioning kept us cool!</p></li>

I didn't want to leave.* Rainshower and new/clean bathroom fixtures.* Over look and comfort -- new, bright, clean and fresh were adjectives we used to describe the room.The okay (nothing was bad):* The price wasn't bad, especially because we needed to sleep 3 adults (I found cheaper deals on higher level area hotels, but only offering 1 bed). * The view -- really, there isn't one at all, but I wasn't expecting much.* Room size isn't very big, but again, we didn't expect very specious accommodations for NYC.I recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to do tourist activities in the Times Square/Theatre District.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Superb value, particularly for the location! I spent one night at the Marriot Courtyard Times Square, and if I have any reason to go back to New York, this will be my first choice.It's always the little things that make the difference. In this case, the hotel staff always seemed to do just a bit more than expected. For example, I showed up at noon, and my room was ready. (I rarely expect to be able to check in until 3pm.) The housekeeper politely asked me (in understandable English!) what time would be most convenient for her to clean the room. And everyone was particularly friendly... a boon to any tired, lonely traveler.The room was small (this is NY after all) but beautifully appointed, complete with a small frig, upscale shower, and LCD TV, and I was never bothered by outside noise. Plus the location can't be better -- it's right across the street from Bryant Park (which is behind the big library). And, as a NY friend commented when I told him the price, For NY, that's practically free!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good Mid Manhattan hotel choice Value and location makes this Marriott Courtyard property a great choice for theater and sightseeing visits to Manhattan. I stayed here five days while attending a business meeting nearby. After price shopping on line, I found this matched my needs and location. Easy walk to the Browadway theaters, so no cab rides required! Friendly reception staff were helpful with directions and suggestions. Room was perfectly clean, great bed, adequate bathroom. Housekeeping tends to arrive late afternoon, but did a fine job. Flat screen TV is nice but remote control did not work well. There are good casual dining options within the block, including a great bar and grill directly across the street. The Times Square name is slightly misleading, since it's a three block walk to actual Times Square--not a problem, but don't expect to see the neon glow from your room. My room view was a brick wall. There is another Courtyard a few blocks farther from Times Square, so check exact address.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent! Great location and good service from hotel staff... Stayed for a weekend to see the sites in in Manhattan. It's a great location that's central to Broadway, RCMH, Rockefeller Plaza, Central Park (via the train), Grand Central Station, etc. It is very close to Bryant Park where there is an open market (may be for Christmas only?) and ice skating. The only problem we had was pressure in the pipes woke us up several times throughout the first night with a rather loud humming noise. I mentioned it to the front desk and we were compensated with a complimentary breakfast. Maintenance must have worked on the problem as the noise was not as noticeable the second night. The beds are very comfortable and the room has a flat screen TV. No noise could be heard from the busy city outside.Hotel was nicely decorated for Christmas and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Bell Captain will store luggage on day of departure and will call you a cab to the airport. We will be staying here again in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">An Oasis Just returned from a 6 night stay at 'The Courtyard'. This is an excellent hotel that I can't fault. It is just 2 blocks from the centre of Times Square and yet as soon as you walk in you feel calm. It is also only one block in the other direction from Bryant Park which is a very peaceful haven on your walk through to 5th Avenue. As for the hotel, well I travel quite a lot with my job in England and usually stay in 4* and this hotel was equal if not better. I can only extol the virtues of the quality of the room. The cafe/mocha in the lobby was my saviour after a long day of walking and luckily there was a coffee machine in the room for our breakfast drink (as we were on the 30th floor). The staff were very friendly and efficient, and the hotel had nice touches like apples on reception every morning(The Big Apple) and sweets in a bowl in the afternoon. Definitely stay in this hotel if you want to be near the bustle of Times Square but need a peaceful retreat.(the open top bus even leaves from here)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The reviews are spot on! Although diffificult to book this hotel (only seemed to be able to thought Marriot.com) it lived up to all the best reviews on TA.Check in staff were friendly. We booked a King/King room and requested a high floor. We were lucky and ended up on the 29th floor with a view of (half) the Empire State building. The most comfortable bed I've ever experienced, anywhere. The room was incredibly quiet and a nice size. In the same way as other reviewers I did find the bathroom a bit odd. No extractor meant that you was to leave the bin there so the mirror would clear to dry your hair. Not really a problem but quite unusual! Lifts were also a little annoying as they quite often took a while to come but these points are incredibly minor in relation to the all the good points. Which are:- friendly staff- very clean- good sized room- free coffee and tea in the lobby- FANTASTIC location- the BEST beds in the world EVER- good price - 5 night stay with the weekend averaged at $220 a nightHighly recomended!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not one complaint! We chose this hotel based on price. Comparable hotels were almost double in price, and I can't imagine that I would have been any more pleased at any of them. I do not have one single complaint about Courtyard Times Square. From the time we checked in, until we checked out, from the bell staff to the maintenance workers, we did not pass by one employee that did not acknowledge us with a smile and a hello, good morning, etc. Our standard room was exceptionally clean and spacious enough for us and our 7 year old. The shower had the extra large raindrop head, as well as a handheld head. The buffet breakfast was included in our rate, with something for any type of diet or taste. Again, even the omelette chef was happy and friendly. The location was perfect. Centrally located, an easy walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Neil Simon Theatre, and more. I have never been more pleased with a hotel experience based solely on rooms, location, and staff. The staff is what really made the experience exceptional!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good location Stayed in a double room on the 26th floor. it was quite dark as a result of the closeness of the surrounding office buildings. Opening the curtains at 8am to look sideways into an office a few metres away was unusual ! The room was fine, the bathroom was very small but everything worked.However the location was excellent for being able to travel anywhere. The subway is at the end of the street and it was a hub for several lines . If you want to stay by Times square, Broadway and the shops ( all within 5-6 minutes walk ), then this hotel is good.The breakfasts were really good, ranging from cereals, fruit, and breads to freshly cooked omelettes or hot buffet. The breakfast staff were lovely.reception staff were helpful although there seemed to be a different concierge on duty every day and we only found one ( Susan) who had any personality and came up with suggestions and recommendations. the others didn't seem to know a lot.It was extremely useful to have internet access ( free ) in the lounge , as was the free coffee.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel was a little disappointing I booked this hotel based upon the reviews on this site. I have travelled to NYC before, but years ago and this time was special with my husband and step-son (10 yo). It was their first time. The location is great...right off Broadway near Times Square. The hotel was smaller than I thought. The reception was great, however, the room they assigned us (1202, I think) was very musty and had black mold-like stuff on popcorn ceiling in bathroom. We immediately requested another room and was offered one for the next night. (Plus, they gave us breakfast vouchers for the inconvenience.) The new room (1701) was better, although I wouldn't consider it above a B- in quality. I think the hotel rooms generally need a make-over. They show several years of wear and tear. The common areas appear to be newer than the rooms.Despite the rooms, I must say that the staff were extremely pleasant and friendly during the whole stay. We enjoyed it in the city and would stay again...but probably at another hotel to try something different.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good Hotel but slow elevators and limited views We stayed at this hotel on December 26, 2007 and had a partial Empire State Building view on a high floor.The lobby area was small but well decorated and the room was a good size for Manhattan and well decorated. We paid a special rate of $169, direct from Marriott.I would rate the hotel as a 3 star. It has both good and bad qualities.The good:- The location is great - a block or two from Times Square- The staff were friendly and helpful- The price was good for the areaThe bad:- The front of the hotel was under renovation and was not much to look at.- With over 30 floors, the few elevators (also used by service personnel) are not sufficient. This results in long waits at times.- The view from our room on the back of the hotel did include part of the Empire State Building but also included a poorly maintained old office building directly across the street.I would recommend the Courtyard Times Square South if the price is right. There are probably better choices in the area but not at the price we paid.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good location, Internet problems The location of this hotel, southeast of Times Square, makes it a good choice for the business traveller.On this trip, however, I had major problems with the Internet. On my first room on the 5th floor, my laptop could see one access point, but couldn't connect. I called the help line, and they reset the router. To check that it wasn't my computer, I went down to the lobby, and connected immediately to the network.I requested a different room, and was moved up to the 15th floor. My computer can now see three access points, but doesn't seem to connect to the closest. Internet access is extremely slow ... which makes it impossible to do any real work.I wrote a note to the management this morning, about the Internet problem, saying that I had more reservations at this location this month. The Internet is still a problem tonight. I've now made a reservation to move to the Residence Inn across the street for the weekend. On Monday, I may or may not check back into this hotel, because I normally get a lot of work done in the hotel ... but not on this trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A little gem!! Well this was my first trip to New York so i wasn't sure what to expect, but this hotel was a lot better then I thought it would be. For starters we asked for a high room with a view of the Empire state building and that's exactly what we got. The room was a good size with 2 double beds which were extremely comfortable and the bed linen was so soft (comment from my wife!). The bathroom had a great power shower and was good enough without being amazing. There was also a tv, an ipod player and a free safe and fridge. It's always good to have a safe!!As far as location goes, you would be hard pushed to beat it. It's just 2mins from Times Square and the theatres on Broadway ,and about 10mins walk from the Empire State Building, Macys and 5th Ave shops.Central Park is a little further away at about a 30min walk but you can catch a cab for about $10 so its not that far.All in all the hotel was really nice and much better then the website portrays, and the staff were very nice.Oh and just another bonus is that it has a free coffee and tea machine which is just great. A real little gem!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Mediocre Although the hotel was decent, I was underwhelmed. I was ignored at check-in, and the staff actually checked in someone who arrived after me. The room was a decent size by NYC standards (which still means small). The room and bathroom were very clean. I had problems with the door to the room, which became quite obvious when I noticed that the door was ajar when I first entered. The door would not close all of the way unless you pushed or pulled (depending on whether you are leaving or entering). Shortly after I had checked in, I mentioned this to a cleaning staff member who was across the hall. She just giggled and said that you have to make sure it is closed. I thought about calling downstairs, but I was only going to be there one night so I figure it would be okay. Another problem was that the bathroom lights did not always completely turn on and it took 15ish minutes for them to heat up and turn on (these were the main lights, not some shower light). I did like that the hotel seemed secure and relatively quiet. One final negative is that there was no ATM machine in the hotel, which of course is a necessity in NYC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Can't go wrong with this hotel - brilliant location, service and comfort. Husband and I (mid 30s) stayed here for 4 nights from Tues Nov 25 - Sat Nov 29. Superb location (less than half a block from the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade down Broadway). Breakfast is not included but there are plenty of places close by - some good self-serve breakfast buffets in Times Square. We already knew from Trip Advisor that there are no exhaust fans in the bathrooms, but that's really the only complaint we could make. Staff were friendly, housekeeping was great, free internet access allowed for daily blogging. We requested and were granted a room with a view of the Empire State Building. Hotel was very clean and quiet and the room was spacious with a comfortable bed. If you're not used to tipping and accidentally tip Merrick who handles the luggage downstairs twice, he gives you a big hug (as my husband found out!) Heightened hotel security around Thanksgiving was reassuring. A perfect hotel if you are exploring the Big Apple for the first time like we were. (ps - The closest fresh juice place seems to be across the road from the Public Library.)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent room and location I took my two daughters (aged 26 and 19) here for a long weekend treat. We shared a room with two queen doubles - THE most comfortable beds we've ever had in a hotel. Really lovely mattresses and linen. Plenty of space in the room, which also had a desk, desk chair (no armchair, but that's OK), chest of drawers and wardrobe with good mirrors. Bathroom quite small but fine; shower over bath had good pressure. TV and clock radio with I-Pod docking station. Safe in closet. An added bonus to our very comfortable stay was that we had a brilliant view of the Empire State Building; we were on the 25th floor (I had requested a high floor in my booking and we were delighted). The staff were pleasant and helpful. Free coffee in the foyer. We didn't breakfast at the hotel as it wasn't in our deal, but there were lots of local places to choose from. Absolutely brilliant location. So easy to get everywhere we wanted to go, either by walking, subway or taxi. Close to Times Square for the night time buzz, but not disturbed by any noise from there as we had a room at the rear of the hotel. Would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Expectations fulfilled We booked this hotel after reading wholly positive reports on Tripadviser and were not disappointed. We requested, and got, a room with a view of the Empire State Building. Room was immaculately clean. Beds really comfy though I practically needed a stepladder to climb in over the mountainous layers of mattress toppers/duvet and pillows.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Really nice ! Having stayed at this wonderful hotel was a great experience, thanks to Tripadvisor where we found it with good reviews !Nice lobby with classical music in the entrance, nice staff, nice room, and nice view. But you have to ask for a nice view to the Empire State Building because only a few rooms have this kind of amazing view.Our room was on the last floor (33rd), and was very big : 2 armchairs, a sofa, 2 really comfortable king-size beds, 2 flat-screen TV-sets, a table with a working chair. I think it was one of the best rooms in the hotel, room 3301 if you want to ask for it.But I disliked the lightening in the bathroom, that was a little bit gloomy, but otherwise everything was perfect. The breakfast was expensive, but very good. And the free coffee in the lobby was the tastiest I have drunk in NYC !Even if we arrived quite early (it was about 11 am), we got the room, and they gave us a call to know if everything was all right.And the location... I think a better one couldn't have been possible !If you are looking for a wonderful accomodation in NYC, don't search anymore, you have found it !Thank you Tripadvisor, and thank you Marriott !!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">GREAT HOTEL!!! This hotel was near everything. Room was very quiet. The view wasn't the best but it was fun to watch people working in the building next to us while we were on vacation.The room was a good size for new york. The bed and the pillows were excellent. I haven't been able to find those pillows since we returned - wish i could. The bathroom was big enough for 1. Would have been nice if it was bigger but i wasn't in new york to stay in the bathroom.The staff at the hotel were great. They always tried to make sure you were satisfied. We got there early and they had our room ready. They held our luggage on our last day so we could see more of the city before our flight. The best - they all deserve raises!!!There is a great restaurant right across the street that has excellent food - giggles. After 7pm the place turns into a mini night club with spanish music. It was a blast - we went almost every night. The front desk will refer you to jake's or dave's (can't remember) down the street - very, very expensive if you go. Giggles is more affordable and we enjoyed there food better.For the price this hotel made new york more affordable and the stay was a blast.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Unresponsive staff and at least one filthy room I stayed here for a business trip. I called ahead to tell them I'd be arriving late. They put me in the last room they had, or so they told me when I checked in. The room was on the 2nd floor right by the elevator, so not plum location, but I was OK with it was I was getting in so late and wanted to go to bed.As soon as I got in the room, all looked find. Went to use the bathroom, and there were tiny flies all around the bathroom. Maybe about 25-50 of them. Disgusting! When I called down, they said they didn't have any room to move me to, and that they'd send a guy up to check out the scene.The guy came up, checked it out, and was also grossed out like I was. He radioed down to the front desk guy but from the hallway (didn't want me to hear what they talked about). The guy came back in and said they'd move me to another room. So much for me having the last open room!The new room wasn't awesome but at least it was clean! But the real kicker about this whole thing is that I was paying like $350 a night to stay here!! Insane. You'd think I'd be sleeping in some palatial digs for that amount or at least getting awesome service. No such luck.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Can't go Wrong Husband and I went to NYC for our one year anniversary. We've always had a great experience with Marriott (wedding reception and honeymoon as well as other travel and business meetings). This place was perfect for our trip. It is an easy 5 minute walk from the Port Authority (bus station) on 8 Avenue/42nd Street. It is 3-5 blocks from the main attractions in Times Square. We saw The Lion King just 5 blocks from the hotel. A nice walk to 5th Avenue shopping and fashion district. Walked to Rockefellar Center. A $12 cab ride to WTC/Ground Zero. From WTC, we walked to Chinatown/Little Italy/Canal Street. And then an $10 cab ride from Canal back to the hotel. The hotel staff were all friendly and courteous. Everyone greeted us warmly. They even let us check in at 10:30am instead of making us wait until regular check-in at 3pm. The room was nice. Linens were new, clean, fresh. The view wasn't great (buildings all around) but we really didn't come to NYC to look out our window. They stored our luggage the next day while we went around town before catching a late afternoon bus home. Absolutely no complaints about this place. Will definitely stay here again next time we head to NYC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">will stay at a differnet hotel next time i visit My family and I stayed at this hotel for more than 7days. The LOCATION of this hotel was EXCELLENT... walking distance to many activities/ places. New York/Manhattan on the whole was a great place to vacation... I would surely return to NY but stay at a different hotel...There were some problems we encountered with some of the staff of this hotel... one concierge was a WASTE of time while the other was apparently the hotel's operator (always on the phone). one of the bellboys were totally CLUELESS of what was happening around him.... no help at all to 1st timers!! There was a strong sense of RACISM in this hotel!!! The room was quite small... but manageable!!! however there were BEDBUGS... they should really consider changing the sheets more often!!! In addition, even though there were only a few rooms per floor... the walls were paper thin... we heard when 'our neighbours' slammed the doors in the middle of the nite and also when they flushed the toilet!! The water they offered was $7.00.... what a rip off... take a walk and go to duane reade at the end of the street. Lastly, if you stay more than 5 days.... the staff starts to IGNORE and STARE at you!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our First NY Vacation For starters I have never wrote a review. However, I was so please with this hotel, I felt as thou I needed to share my opinion on my stay. I had checked on the Tripadvisor and read several reviews which I was so please to see that nearly all of them were positive. So indeed, I was ready to make the trip with little worry about my hotel stay. I have only all pro's to comment on. We stayed 3 nights.Some of my most vaulable memories which may seem small to some but I loved!!! To begin the staff was very nice. The guy that handled our luggage remembered us when were leaving that I had a fraigle piece of luggage. He rememebered. Yeah! They kept our luggage for apprx. 7 hours on our day of departure. We were in our room at about 11 when check in wasn't until 3. How wonderful was that! Ours rooms where clean everyday, replenished with fresh towels daily. The beds were to die for and I loved the magnified extended mirrors and removal shower head in the bathroom. Flat screen T.V.They had a very nice gym as well. I loved it there !!!!!!! We could not have had a better hotel. In additon, we were told that at the rate we paid we got a very nice hotel. I would stay again and pay more if necessary.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved it! We were going to spend Christmas in NYC so we thought we would book a hotel that wasn't too expensive but would be conveniently situated in the heart of Manhattan. This hotel was certainly no wrong choice.The service staff in the hotel are like none other. Not only do they greet you when you come back from a long day's sightseeing, the lady at the concierge desk even worked overtime just to ensure that we would get our taxi to the airport on the night we were departing. We certainly felt that all our needs were taken care of when we were at the hotel.The rooms are well equipped with a buffet of pillows, such that I felt that they could have given less pillows. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was well equipped with amenities. The complimentary WiFi access in every room made our stay even better for we could search information about the places we intended to visit before setting foot each day.The hotel also has a coffee machine in the lobby that dispenses coffee/hot water all day long. The gym at the basement is sufficiently sized with treadmills and a few weights. Bring along your earpieces if you're going to run, for the treadmills are boosted with individual TV sets with access to all the TV channels the hotel has. Certainly a good choice!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">valentines weekend My wife and I have just returned today from a 4 night stay at the hotel for valentines weekend. We booked the hotel after reading the reviews on trip advisor, which has become our reliable holidaying guide. The hotel: LOCATION - 500 yards from times square, 6 blocks from Macy's and empire, 1 1/2 blocks from 5th ave, subway on corner, Bryant park (which is lovely) 1 block away, overall an excellent location. Also stayed on high floor so absolutely no noise. ROOM - Not the most modern but accaptable, after all we didnt go from Scotland all the way to New York for the room. STAFF - Extremely happy and helpful throughout the entire stay. WOULD WE STAY THERE AGAIN - Absolutely, If you are on a budget and want a value hotel then this is the one. If you expect luxury then this is not for you.Overall new york was wonderful. Breakfast at the Red flame diner on 42nd and 6th, is FAB. O'lunneys Irish bar on 43rd and 7th was great for both drink and food. We tipped the barman $2 every time we bought a drink and every 3rd drink we would get 1 on the house. Woodbury common (a 1hr bus ride from port authority) for bargains is unbelievable, especially if you're British because of the dollar. A horse and cart ride for $34 in central park is also wonderful.The End</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not bad but nothing special Stayed here for 3 nights last week.Location is good, 5 minutes from from Times square but tucked away from the street and so very quiet inside. Bar area but I never saw it open.Rooms are fairly large for NY and as mentioned, beds are very comfortable. LCD TV a nice touch but otherwise basic with no mini bar. Bathroom basic but clean. When we arrived the flush was broken (can't beleive the cleaner wasn't aware of this!) but after some badgering at the front desk it was fixed within 30 minutes....good but the room shouldn't have been let in that condition.Staff were freindly and helpful though no doorman made getting a taxi on the (relatively) quiet street a bit of a chore. Of course, you could walk 2 minutes to 6th Ave but a bit of a pain when you have luggage to haul.Overall, a clean, well located hotel but very average and without the wow  factor, hence my rating. I have stayed in the Sofitel and the Sheraton New York both of which were much better standard and suprisingly a similar price (not sure if Marriot have hiked their prices based on top rating on this site?) If your a tourist and it's your first time in NY, you could do a LOT worse than stay here but if you're looking for something a bit more special then I would suggest trying elsewhere</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fine place to stay, but don't expect luxury or anything special The Courtyard Times Square South is fine. The hotel is in a good location, you have nice views of the Empire State Building, and the staff is very friendly. However, it's still just ok- there are a lot of other hotels in the same price category that are nicer and offer more amenities (for example, the Residence Inn right around the corner which is newer and much nicer for roughly the same price, or the Millenium Broadway which is also just around the corner and is also a better stay). I'm actually really surprised that the Courtyard is ranked so high on trip advisor, I've stayed at a lot of hotels in NYC, and this isn't one I'd place in the top 20That being said my only real complaint with my stay is with the bathroom- it could use an update. It felt very dated and was incredibly small. I did appreciate the free wireless internet- that is a very nice feature that I wish other hotels would offer rather than charging $12 or $15 a day. And, as I said before, the hotel staff deserves high marks for being friendly and accessible.All in all, the Courtyard is an ok stay and if you get a good deal, you'll enjoy your stay. If, however, there are other Times Square-area hotels about the same price, I'd stay there instead.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Definitely a place to return to in NYC! I have stayed in this hotel three times already and have a reservation to return in July. I have nothing but good things to say about the Courtyard Times Square South! Its proximity to the subway can't be beat; and this is how we always travel when we visit NYC. It is right next to Bryant Park, which offers a great place to sit, people watch, eat (try breakfast or lunch from 'Wichcraft), and even take your laptop (free WiFi in the park). The rooms are a great size for NYC. We've stayed at three other places and keep returning to this Courtyard. We've never had a problem with cleanliness; the rooms always smell fresh and look clean upon arrival. We've managed to get an Empire State building view once; and usually have a small fridge in the bathroom which is handy for storing soft drinks/bottles of water. As mentioned in many other reviews, there is free internet, a safe in-room, and coffee 24/7 in the lobby. We've had to store our luggage with the bellman each trip; sometimes because of early arrival and no room avaiable yet, and each trip because we weren't leaving the city until later in the day and needed to leave our bags at the hotel until time to head for the airport. For the price and location, you couldn't ask for a better room in midtown.</p></li>

<li>It is right next to Bryant Park, which offers a great place to sit, people watch, eat (try breakfast or lunch from 'Wichcraft), and even take your laptop (free WiFi in the park).</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect place My husband and I stayed here recently for 6 nights and we had an awesome time. The moment we walked through the doors we were greeted with friendly smiling faces. The staff here are amazing, right down to housekeeping. They were always willing to help make our stay in New York memorable. Nothing was a bother to them. The hotel room was huge !!! We had 2 double beds, a baby crib and 7 suitcases and there was still plenty of room to walk around. The hotel location is perfect. Its only a couple of minutes walk to Times Square. We found we walked to most places whilst there as it was so close to many attractions. Theres free coffee in the lobby and also apples and oranges at the front desk which was good to take for a snack. There was a large modern gymnasium with flat screen tv's all round. Best of all there was a laundry which we found very useful as we had been travelling around for a month before we arrived in NY. We didnt eat at the hotel as there are plenty of places close by but a couple of times we ordered takeout which was delivered to the hotel. The hotel can provide you with a list of menus. I have nothing bad to say about this hotel and I found New Yorkers to be the friemdliest of people. I would definately stay here again and recommend it to anyone. I cant wait to go back !!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location,Location,Location! My daughter and I just returned from a quick overnight stay at this Courtyard. What a great place! We arrived via train through Grand Central. Hotel is a quick 10 minute walk from there. We were able to check in early (11:30am) and head right over to the TKTS booth to grab matinee tickets(1/2 price ). After the show we walked around a bit and decided to grab take out and retire early. Checked out the next morning at 9:30 and left the bags with Fred (very nice gentleman) and headed over by foot (10min) to catch the Grayline downtown tour. Got off at Battery Park to take a Circle line cruise to Statue of Liberty. If you want to go inside Statue it is best to reserve online at Statue of Liberty site as daily passes go very quickly. Back on bus to South Street Seaport to enjoy the sea and street performers. Returned to Courtyard with claim tickets for our bags and headed back to depart from Grand Central.The rooms are spacious, immaculate,and most of all very quiet. Didn't hear a thing outside until morning when the street cleaners/garbage trucks went by. The hotel is in a perfect location for walking to Times Square/ Rockefeller Center/ 5th Ave and even Empire State Blding. Beds are ultra comfy and all personnel are very courteous and nice. We can't wait to return and stay longer next time!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great business hotel...great staff, location, rooms I stayed at this Courtyard a few years ago and returned recently for a 3 night stay on business. What a change! I had debated staying here or at the Benjamin, and I was very glad I chose to stay here...The rooms are beautiful - nice new carpet, plush linens, comfortable bed, flat screen tv, immaculate bathroom. The staff was outstanding - from the front desk to the bell staff, (particularly the bell staff!! great guys) to the concierge, (always busy, but very helpful). Anything you need or would like - ask, they are extremely accomodating here. The location is perfect, right near Bryant Park, Times Square, plenty of subways and always a taxi nearby.The gourmet coffee machine in the lobby is a nice touch, as is the laundry and workout room downstairs.Complimentary, reliable internet access was very appreciated!Only two things to note, and neither of these are the hotel's fault. Heavy construction is going on down the street - keep your windows closed or it will wake you up. With windows closed, you hardly hear it. During the day between 11:30 - 4:30, stay out of the lobby as best you can, it's always jam packed with people and you will wait for whatever it is you need.They have plentiful staff, but things just get impossibly busy there from what I saw.Great hotel, great stay. I would absolutely stay again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Value In places like NYC, I tend to prefer a more unique hotel experience and like to avoid the chains. However, I found a rate of $199 at this property and couldn't resist the deal. And trust me, for that price this is a BARGAIN!LOCATION-Pretty much couldn't ask for any better location. It's far enough from Times Square (4 blocks) to escape the madness, but still close enough to enjoy. It's right off Bryant Park (think Project Runway) which is my absolute favorite spot in NYC. Plenty of restaurants all around.SERVICE-For NYC, pretty good. The staff was friendly and helpful and had no problem accomodating an early check-in. However, on a negative note, the hotel missed the mark on my special requests as a Marriott Gold member. No big deal, but it just shows a hotel's organization and attention to detail is lacking.ROOMS-Marriott Standard. Average size hotel room, which is large for NYC! Very comfortable bedding and mattress. Large bathroom with nice amenities. I could not get the in-room WI-FI to work and there was not a DSL connection.Overall, I enjoyed my stay here. It was a mostly American crowd staying here with lots of kids. If you want a nice, predictable hotel expereince with all of the amenities you usually expect, this is for you.I would definetly stay here again if I once again found a great deal . Otherwise, I'd probably try somewhere else for a bit more unique experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Absolutely wonderful hotel We spent the weekend in NYC and had a great stay at this hotel. The staff were super friendly (we would like to have brought Merrick home with us). It was wonderful to be greated each morning by Merrick's broad, warm smile. He was the best. Free coffee (brewed by the cup) was nice in the lobby. The entrance to the hotel was pretty with a waterfall along one entire wall. We stayed on the 20th floor with a view out the front of the hotel (nothing spectacular to see), but the room was fabulous! The bed was simply the best, comfy, comfy and the linens were the nicest I've ever seen, absolutely gorgeous. Our room was exceptionally quiet, right beside the elevator, as was the hallway. We did not find the room to be small at all by NY standards, perhaps due to a different layout than a typical square hotel room. My husband particularly liked the flat screen tv. A computer is set up in the lobby with internet access, nice to check the weather and other events. The hotel is very close to Bryant Park, a green space bordered by the public library and only a couple of blocks from Times Square. We felt very safe walking back to this hotel, even at midnight from Times Square. Our room keys were checked as an extra level of security when we arrived late, a nice feeling of security. When we travel to NYC again, no question, we will definiately be staying at the Courtyard, Times Square.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel with one flaw. We just returned from a weekend stay at the Courtyard. We found the hotel to be in a GREAT location for everything, extremely clean and priced reasonably (for NYC that is). Its best features are the beds/linens, coffee machine in the lobby (free and absolutely delicious), friendly, helpful staff, and flat screen TV's with extensive cable. The rooms are small by American standards but more than adequate. The one true downfall is a design flaw that they can do little to correct. The bathroom doors open outward and therefore are set up to remain closed to allow you to go in and out of the door to the room. This has caused them to smell very musty. We were initially checked into 607 but the bathroom smell (like urine/urea) was so offensive and strong that we immediately asked for a room change as it was making me ill. We were placed in 1907. The bathroom smelled also but only about half as bad as the first one. I believe they are very aware of this problem because they maids use a strong deodorizer and prop the doors open with a trash can. My thoughts are that if they remodeled this hotel only one year ago and the bathrooms already smell this bad then the future looks bleak. I told them at checkout that we had absolutely no problem with the staff or ANYTHING else and that I realized this problem was out of their control. I find myself saying I would stay there again because everything else was so terrific.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First rate hotel. Just returned from a five night stay in this lovely hotel. Arrived very late and tired and we were checked in and in our room within minutes. Had requested a room with a view of the Empire State Building and we were not disappointed. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room facilities were excellent.The location is perfect, just off Broadway, close to Time Square. We would recommend the open top tour buses that have a 'hop on-hop off' facility, making it the perfect way to get around if you are on a short stay. We booked this through the hotel and the concierge suggested that we paid the 'All Loops' inclusive price, this meant that for $49 we were able to travel downtown, uptown and, best of all, a night time tour across the Madison Bridge to Brooklyn, enabling us to get the best view of the Manhattan Skyline at night. The ticket can be used over two days and well worth the money.We had breakfast in the hotel on the first morning, this was good value but there are so many places to eat in close proximity to the hotel so we tried an assortment of places for the rest of our stay. We made use of the free tea and coffee machine that is located at the rear of the reception area although there was also a coffee maker in the room. It was just so easy to pop down in the lift and collect early morning/late night tea and coffee!All in all, a great trip and when we go back to New York, we won't hesitate to book this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfection ! From reading reviews on TripAdvisor I had high expectations of the Courtyard and I wasn't disappointed. From the moment we checked in until we returned to collect our luggage on the last day we couldn't have asked for more. We arrived slightly earlier than the stated 3:00 check-in but there was no problem with us checking in. The clerk on reception was exceptionally helpful and also provided us with complimentary tote bags which came in very handy for the journey home.The whole hotel is smoke-free with hefty fines for anyone caught smoking in a room. Rooms are spacious and very clean with good storage (wardrobes/drawers) and also a safe. The bathroom is also excellent with a wonderful rain drop shower head and more than enough towels.The beds (twin queen sized in our room, as requested) were the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the hotel is very quiet with hardly any traffic noise audible from outside.Location-wise it is ideal - very close to Times Square and a number of the key attractions with a good number of taxis passing the front door both during the day and in the evening if your feet are tired from pounding the pavements.The concierge was very helpful both with information about attractions and restaurants and there is also a PC with printer available in the lobby which guests can use to access the Internet and check-in for return flights etc - at no charge !All in all a perfect place either for business or leisure trips to the Big Apple.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, great price, simply a great hotel Having stayed at the Marriot Courtyard on 5th Avenue, I happen to like this one better. The hotel is superbly located. You are one block from the subway and minutes away from the theatre district. Bryant Park is a block away. This property is only 2-3 blocks away from the other Marriot Courtyard but again, I think a bit better located and somehow a bit more pleasing in my opinion.By Manhattan standards I thought our room was huge. We had a room with a king size bed. Like all Marriot Courtyard properties the bed was soft and luxiorius. We however found the bed too soft for our liking. Our room featured a vice nice and large LCD TV and large closet.It is worth noting the building the hotel is located in is exceptionally narrow. As a result there are only 6-8 rooms on each floor. Our room was very quiet and heard very little from adjoining rooms.If we had a complaint, it was the bathroom. The door had an awful creaking noise when we opened and closed it and we suspect waked others on the floor. The bathroom lacked a fan, so steam would linger in the bathroom for hours.Staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel has a small snack area where you can buy drinks (including beer) and other small items. Breakfast is served in the lobby as well but we did not try this and presume this is not included in the room rate.Overall, an excellent location, comfortable room, and having stayed in 6-8 different NYC hotels on prior visits possibly the best I have stayed in, keeping in mind I am more of a budget traveller.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Will Return to the Courtyard Times Square My husband and I booked this hotel for our Thanksgiving getaway. I've stayed in a number of other NY hotels and have had semi-traumatic experiences, so I was naturally anxious to see the quality of the rooms at the Courtyard. We were not disappointed. The rooms were spacious by NY standards, and, more importantly they were very clean. The beds were incredibly comfortable. The only complaint about the room was the size of the bathroom - and the fact that the bathroom did not have an exhaust fan - which can make getting ready in the AM a challenge. The staff was amazing and super friendly. The free coffee in the lobby helped compensate for the over-priced breakfast. There is a Pax a couple blocks away where you can get a reasonably priced breakfast. Also, Bryant Park is nearby that has a wonderful cafe and great little shops. The location was great - centrally located to all the sights and w/in minutes of the subway. Waiting for the elevators at the end of a long day was a minor inconvenience. This hotel is also a great locale if you are wanting to watch the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade without getting crushed by the crowds. We were able to watch the parade, while also having the convenience of going in and out of the hotel to get coffee and take breaks. If you are looking for a trendy NY boutique - then this probably isn't the place. But I also know from experience that these hip boutiques can sometimes be a huge disappointment in terms of comfort and cleanliness. This hotel will not disappoint if comfort, cleanliness, locaton, and friendliness are your priorities.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Consistent Courtyard quality We stayed at the Courtyard December 16-19 of 2004. I booked the stay using Marriott reward certificates for some of the nights and was told I was only eligible for a king/smoking room with a rollaway for our third person under the reward terms. I called the hotel a few weeks ahead  requested a double/double non-smoking if available and was pleased that the request was fulfilled even though the hotel appeared to be booked to capacity that weekend. The room decor was typical Courtyard style and surprisingly big with a good sized bathroom (unusual in NYC!) much to the delight of us three gals that were staying together. The espresso machine in the lobby was a nice treat as well!The staff was pleasant, professional, courteous, friendly, and very accomodating, especially the cafe staff who were clearly overwhelmed each morning we were there. The cafe area seemed a bit small for the size of the hotel  did cause a 15-20 minute wait each morning before we could be seated but, considering the breakfast was included in the room, I can't complain.The only pitfall I found in our whole stay is that outside street noises were very loud from within our room on the 19th floor, especially considering that we faced a nearly blocked in courtyard between two other buildings (sirens awoke me at night and nearby construction work awoke me in the morning). Admittedly, I have never stayed so close to a busy area in NYC so perhaps I'm just not used to being that close to the action. At any rate, it was a small issue in an otherwise good stay that reminds me why I like the consistent quality of Courtyard so much.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location Vacation Relaxation My wife and I stayed at the Times Square Courtyard one weekend in August. We have stayed at a number of 2 and 3 star hotels in Manhattan and this was our best experience. We walked from Penn Station in about 15 minutes. The hotel was pretty busy but clean and pleasant. Use of the elevator requires your room keycard, which is a nice security measure. The room was roomy (for NYC) and very clean. Our room had no fridge or microwave as most Courtyards we have stayed at do. The ice machine is in the lower lobby, requiring an elevator ride to get ice. We bought two airline bottles of Jack Daniels from the desk-side mini-market without asking the price - $10 each plus tax! When we checked in we were given the key to a room that was occupied - fortunately no one was home but we could have been quite embarrassed. The situation was resolved quickly.Times Square is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. The subway is right at the end of the block. We took the subway to Lincoln Center; the stations are confusing to those of us accustomed to the simple layout of DC's Metro, so we had to hunt around to find the correct platform. The heat on the platforms was stifling, even though on the street it was in the low 70s. We took a cab back from the show, which for two people was not much more than the train. We had a delightful weekend, enjoying South Pacific, the Circle Line Cruise, and the Dali exhibit at MOMA. I highly recommend the Zen Palate Restaurant (all vegetarian) on 46th Street and the Thai place next door. Avoid Viva Pancho at Time Square - the food was fine but nothing special and it was kind of dirty in there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very good place to stay! The hotel seems to have been built in the vacant space in the centre of the block. As a result the surrounding buildings absorb the noise of the street. Slept with the window open and wasn't disturbed at all.There were only 8 rooms per floor and couldn't hear any noise of TV's, people closing doors, or noise from other rooms above or below.Hotel is about 7 yars old so everything in fresh and new.Air-con/heating in the room is whisper quiet and works well.Rooms very big and comfortable and so was the bed. Bathroom also large  well lit.Staff very friendly and helpful, within 5 minutes of checking in someone was on the phone to make sure the room was upto standard.Location is fantastic. Mid-town Manhatten and a 3 minute walk from Times Square.Didn't use breakfast room as it looked a bit pricy and with a quintillion delis and diners 5 minute walk in any direction I went native. Saying that I noticed cops having breakfast in the hotel and I'm sure they wouldn't eat there if it wasn't upto scratch!Free coffee (and very nice!) on tap in reception 24/7Good fitness room in hotel together with vending machines and laundry room.Negative points:- Shower not brilliant- Waiting for a lift/elevator a 'peak-times' was a pain, but then my experiance is that all hotels are.- Muzac in public ground floor areas wanted to make me scream- being in the courtyard of the block the views were not great. I was about 10-15ft away from the window opposite and natural light is restricted, but then again if I wanted views I wouldn't have stayed there.WARNING: If you sleep in the nude, careful when you open the curtains in the morning ;O)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good hotel in central Manhattan I think the reviews are mostly about right. This is a conveniently-located hotel, within a stone's throw of Bryant Park. The staff are helpful and courteous, and the rooms while not particularly spacious are for the most part clean and pleasant.Downsides? Well, the room I was in faced a neighbouring building and got almost no light even on sunny days, so I had to have the lights on all the time. You don't want to stay in the room much -- but then, if you're in Manhattan, you probably shouldn't be in the room at all.And although the staff were mostly pleasant, I did have some trouble with the bellman on one occasion when he made a big deal out of storing my suitcase for a day. He agreed to store it saying that I was a special case. Well, I didn't like that because either it was permissible or it wasn't, and if it wasn't I could have made alternative arrangements. I'm not sure what he was trying to say to me, but I just felt it was inappropriate.Besides that, the staff were uniformly anxious to please. I was especially impressed by Joseph and the other staff in the cafe-restaurant downstairs at breakfast. And the concierge, Bridget, was very helpful when I phoned her from Chicago to ask her to arrange for a car to meet me at La Guardia airport.The Marriott charges quite a lot for this hotel. I paid between $300 and $400 depending on the night I stayed. I think, frankly, that was too much given the standard of the hotel overall, and although the place is very well managed and well run, I will try and find somewhere that at least gives better value for money next time. The Affinia Dumont charges around the same amount and gives you a much nicer room for your money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Watch your belongings To start, I was suprised that the double room we reserved was so big! For a New York hotel the room was huge. We arrived early and our room was ready before noon on a Saturday, also a big surprise. The extremely friendly and professional staff had us checked in quickly. When I first walked in I thought the room looked very clean, however, after a long trip I had to use the bathroom almost immediately and dismay set in. The bathroom had stains on the floors and the countertop. Although those were the most obvious, the bathroom just didn't seem like it had been cleaned in a LONG TIME. After seeing the bathroom I must admit that I lifted the sheets and checked for bed bugs, I am happy too report, there weren't any. The bed and linens were clean and there were plenty of extra pillows. The second night I was there I had money stolen from my room. Although it amounted to only about $15.00 in change that I left in a cup on the desk, it was still gone. Then I had to go through all my belongings, check for all my credit cards and jewerly, and hope that I didn't miss anything. I was worried the rest of the time that I was there that something else was stolen. Even weirder, when I complained to the front desk, it almost seemed routine the way they had me sign a petty cash slip and handed over the $15.00. No continential breakfast, the ice machine is way down in the basement where there is no security, the coffeee was from a machine and terrible and the phone in between the two double beds didn't work! There was no climate control, it was either hot or freezing.All in all, out of all the hotels in NYC that I stayed at, this was the worst. The price was right, the room was big, but the rest just stunk! Literally, the room stunk!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Clean and well-run, convenient location My wife and five month old infant stayed here for three nights in mid August.With baby along for the trip, we needed a way to sterilize bottles. Before arrival I had assumed incorrectly that the hotel would have an in-room microwave, as I've seen at other Courtyards. There wasn't a microwave set out for public use in the common breakfast area, either. We turned to the desk manager to see if there was any kind of microwave available. He offered the one in the kitchen.Twice during our stay, the hotel staff took our microwave steam sterilizer and put it in their kitchen microwave. Without their cooperation, we would have been stuck with two expensive alternatives: buying bottles and throwing them away, or buying some kind of hot plate or other device to to use in the room. We were especially grateful to the desk manager and kitchen manager who helped with our bottle problem. Every single member of the staff was consistently friendly, helpful, and cheerful. The lobby is nicely decorated with comfortable seating areas. There's a European-style automat coffee grinder that will in about one minute's time dispense a hot cup of coffee, free to guests in about a minute. For the breakfast buffet, expect to fork up about $13 or $15 if you add cooked-to-order omlette. Our room had enough space to set up our traveling pak-n-play for baby. Bed was comfortable and bedding was at the new high standard set by most Marriott and Hilton properties: plush, all white bedding with no busy paisley pattern to hide stains. We walked to Gypsy one night, and Some Enchanted Evening was waiting for us just up the Broadway line (South Pacific at Lincoln Cnter). Bryant Park is down the block to the east. You can get anywhere from here.Elevators were busy. Our longest wait in the lobby was approximately five minutes. Two to three was more typical.Rates vary by day, so do not rely on the price coming back in the search engine to necessarily apply for your whole visit.</p></li>
