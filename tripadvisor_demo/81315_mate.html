<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stale odor The check-in was quick, the valet was quick, the room was clean and had a nice view (corner, 25th floor) but the non-smoking room had a musty stale odor. For $350/nt, I should smell nothing. After 30 minutes I checked out and went across the street to the Palomar, which accommodated me without a reservation, for $199/nt and the room had no odor whatsoever. The Palomar is also a quiet, low key boutique hotel, whereas the Marriott is overcrowded.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good Pick On the plus side: Great location, very friendly staff, and breathtaking views make this hotel a good choice for both business and pleasure. Impressive lobby and clean rooms. Check out the View lounge on the top floor for a drink with an impressive view of the city after dark. Negatives: Beds are stiff and uncomfortable and badly need to be updated to compete with Sheraton, Westin, etc. My room lacked a coffee maker (coffee bar in lobby is probably the reason) and had no minibar.</p></li>

You have to hit the cable car ride at certain times to avoid the lines. (for those of you who dont know a trolley is the tourist version, but the locals call them cable cars because they are actually operated on underground cables). If you want to enjoy the exciting life of the Long wharf piers then stay closer to them and do your homework on which hotels are the closest.</p></li>

Chinatown and Union Square are pretty close by. There were lots of restaurants nearby. Bring your nice and comfy shoes. I would give it a 5 if we got a great deal on the rates. We came in at conference season so most of the hotels were fully booked. I will definitely recommend if you get a good rate. Room: Bed and pillows were decent as expected from a Marriot. Bathroom was modern and clean. 35  plasma TV screen.</p></li>

Excellent location close to Moscone convention center, restaurants, cable car, and shopping. I really enjoyed Yerba Buena Garden right next to it and the bar with a terrific view on the 39th floor. My only complaint is that there are three sets of elevators going to different floors which was confusing for the first day or two. Guests have to transfer elevators to get from certain floors to other floors.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice Marriott I stayed here the weekend before Christmas for two nights for a conference. The conference was at the hotel. The lobby was under construction, so the front desk was temporarily moved to the second floor. There seemed to be some confusion with traffic and where to go. Starbucks was in the lobby. My room was on the 16th floor facing Bloomingdales. The rooms were nice, just about right for a Marriott. The location was perfect for within walking distance to Union Square, Macy's, and great restaurants. I would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent but overpriced I stayed 8 nights in this hotel. for a conference. While it is a great place, it is very pricey, there is no breakfast and the place is very impersonnal. The room was nice, clean, confortable but i did not think it was worth the $250 a night price tag. Room service was expensive and very average: we ordered a burger which was burnt and uneatable. Location is ideal though and staff as helpful as may be expected in such high standing hotel. The sky bar is fantastic and well worth the view but i did feel pressurised to keep ordering:</p></li>

Our room was spotless with nice furniture, new carpeting, and a granite countertop in the bathroom. There were aways two people staffing the consierge desk to help with tourism needs. The cocktail lounge on the 39th floor has a great view, and breakfast is excellent with a lot of fresh fruit. The best part is the location with great shopping and restaurants a half-block away. The trolley and cable-car stops are up the street to take you to Fisherman's Wharf.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Outstanding Location is perfect if you're in town for all the traditional sights: Everything from 24-hour diners to world-class shopping is within easy walking distance, and transport to more distant attractions is a snap. Service personnel were exceptionally helpful and courteous (but never instrusive); rooms were spotless and well-insulated from external noise, and on-site facilities were first class. Unlike so many other establishments of its caliber (and there are quite a few in SFO), a four-star property that actually delivers on every promise. Highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Quite pleased except for parking fee Enjoyed the prime location of the hotel and the plush amenities of remodeled rooms. Rate was $151/night for two weekend nights. Didn't enjoy the view of the internal courtryard (room of low-rise portion of hotel) from the 4th floor - though I asked for a low floor - so have nothing to really complain about.One real bummer was the $49/night (incl tax) valet parking. That's the steepest I've seen, NYC or otherwise. Had a $100 Marriott gift certificate to use - so didn't think twice - but this would perhaps sway my vote on another trip...</p></li>

We had no problems with dirty windows, staff, or any of the other things described by others here. The beauty, however, was not the hotel but the location and easy access to public transportation. You can go anywhere in San Francisco from here without a problem, and many interesting places are an easy walk from here.Having a pool and spa were important to us. Both were superb in this hotel.Restaurants were lacking - deserted - but we never wanted to eat there. Why eat in the hotel when you are in San Francisco?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good choice We got a fabulous deal thru Priceline. Sure, if I was going to pay over $200 there would be other choices, but for $60 we were thrilled. Very nice, large rooms with VERY comfortable beds. We had a 28th floor room with a nice view. The public areas are very nice. There's a small Starbucks coffee stand in the lobby with was handy.The location is good, about a 2-3 minute walk to the cable car turn around at the bottom of Powell.The Meteron is right behind the hotel, as is a small park. It's a good walk to North Beach, but, hey, San Francisco is a walkin' town! Overall, very satisfied.</p></li>

The hotel was well located, only minutes walk from most of the attractions, and in very easy reach of the convenient public transport system.The staff at the hotel were always helpful and friendly, and knowledgeable about the local area. The staff offered help without having to be asked, for example, providing umbrellas on wet days.Food in the hotel was good and varied, between upmarket restaurants, through the sports bar, to the coffee facilities.I would definitely stay in the hotel again if I was in the area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Thank you for the room change!! My wife and I were staying at the Marriott Downtown for December 30 and the 31st. The first night our room was adjacent to some early New Years Partyers. We kept thinking the noise would stop so we did not call security. The next day we voiced our concern with the front desk and we were promptly given another room on another floor. No questions nor hesitations (I am sure the hotel computer showed us as Priceline guests.....not a mention except for apologies for our inconvieniences). New Years Eve night was great.. Thank you to the management for making our stay First Rate!</p></li>

We usually stay on Union Square, but this was only 2 blocks from there and the cable cars, and around the corner from Nordstroms. We wanted an early check in, and got it. Our room was very comfortable and clean, with not much of a view, but for one night, we weren't in it long enough to care. My husband avoided their parking fee of $46, and used the public lot at 5th and Mission for $22. There are no in and out priveleges, but once parked, we walked or rode the cable cars. We would probably stay here again.</p></li>

The conference area is in the basement of the hotel so there are no windows. That starts to get to you on a 6 day business trip in meetings all days. The location wasn't too bad. I walked just about everywhere, but there is also lots of public transoprtation and shopping near by.Overall the hotel is fine, but nothing that makes it special or above average in my opinion.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good but not great Stayed here for a builder's convention....nice beds, good location. That is about it. Oh, there is a Starbucks downstairs....besides that this hote has no charm and must be located near a fire station because I heard sirens a lot more than when I used to stay at the Grand Hyatt up the street on Stockton. During our stay I threw a party in the Presidential Suite for my company and the room was so poorly decorated it was straight out of a 1980's movie. Just outdated and poor use of space. If you are staying in the city and want a great hotel, go to the Hotel Vitale. Way worth the money!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">LOVED the bed! We stayed in the Marriott Downtown for 3 nights in mid-July. We really enjoyed our stay. The room was small, but very cozy, but we really loved the feather bed and pillows. As we got in the bed, we just sank into it. And we actually slept better in this bed than our own bed. In fact, we decided to order our own feather bed to put on top of ours at home. Everything was very clean and we really enjoyed our stay. We didn't have a good view, but we weren't in the room very much. They had a great breakfast buffet. It was pricey, but very good. We would like to stay there again if we ever make it to SF again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Stay! Just spent two nights at the Marriott. I've been to this hotel before for brunch and other things but never actually stayed the night. Our room was perfect. We had a corner room on the 29th floor with an incredible view of the city. The bed was super comfy. The bathroom was large enough. The great thing about the Marriott is the location. We like that it's on 4th Street and walking distance to shopping and a quick trip to just about anywhere in the city. The bar on the top floor was pretty cool. We had a drink up there late Friday night and it was a good atmosphere. Overall a great stay, would highly recommend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Better bring ear muffs Very nice hotel with many features. It does function as a convention hotel. But the rooms! They are small and the hotel floors are huge. It took me a good minute walk just to get to the elevator. And the worst is the noise! You can hear everything from the people next door to anyone in the hallway. And of course forget about sleeping in as it being a convention hotel you hear the water running in the adjacent room early in the morning when it is shower time.The location is great, right next to Union Station and next to the city's transporation systems. But I am sure there are better hotels that can muffle the noise.</p></li>

The hotel has a great bar at the top with fantastic views over the city.The only gripe is that (like many hotels on our trip) they were unable to confirm a room with two queen beds and we were given a sinlge King (for our family of four) on arrival. Fortunately they upgraded us to a King Suite when we complained so, although the kids were on camp beds, at least there was space to move.The breakfast buffet was very good and whilst not cheap for adults (c$20), was very good value for the children (c.$7.00)</p></li>

It was a great conference property, large lobby, plenty of meeting space. Location was great for shopping- walk just a block or two and you will find a large selection of stores, ranging from Ross and Old Navy, to Macys and Nordstroms, up to Gucci and Armani. Short walk to cable car turnaround, about 8 blocks to Chinatown, 8 blocks to ATT Park. You will have to either wait for the trolleys to get to Ghiradelli or Fishermans wharf, or take a cab- they are not within walking distance. Never a wait to get a taxi at the hotel, doormen and conceirge are a great help.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Disappointing This hotel has a rather impersonal feel to it. It's like staying in an enormous dormitory.I expected noise from the street, but I couldn't believe it when I could also hear half of the conversations from the room next door. I ate at the Garden Terrace restaurant - the service was almost nonexistent. Expect to pay about $10 for a bowl of cereal and a bagel.If you're in San Francisco on business and someone else is paying for the room, then it's probably alright. But for $180 per night, I expected a much nicer experience. I could have stayed at the Best Western for half of that price, and I probably would have been just as happy, if not happier.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nothing special Staff was very accommodating and friendly. Rooms clean but VERY small  non descript considering this hotels rating  price. About 1 blk to San Francisco shopping center and close (by close I mean within 3-4 blocks) to the theater and cable cars. Parking is $43.00 (incl tax  unlimited in  out privileges) per day. Lot across street is $20 a day (no tax) but in  out privileges at additional cost. Every concierge employee (6) recommended the same restaurant. I suspect the hotel is being paid to recommend it. It was not good. I have stayed at lower rated hotels in the city at a lower cost. They had larger rooms that were much nicer. We would not stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">great location, parking is expensive and painful The hotel location is great, close to all the shoppings, and easy to get to where ever you want to visit. The room is clean, the bed is comfortable, the bar at the top has great views, and the lobby is nice too. The parking is expensive, and valet parking only. that could be an issue if you go in and out all the time, sometimes we have to wait for a while for our car if they were very busy.When we got there, my bf run to use restroom, so I unloaded all our luggages from our car. Amazingly, no bellman came to me to offer service. I ended up pulling all our luggages into lobby myself! But other than that, we enjoyed our stay very much.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good Stay by The Bay The good: Very fast check in. Friendly and efficient staff. Room service dinner was fast and tasted good for  hotel food. The area is has plenty to do and is close to BART.The bad: Never got the 4am wake-up call I asked for and almost missed my departing flight. Checked in late and had things all over the bed when  I left the room the 1st day so I put the do not disturb  sign up. It didn't matter has housekeeping still  entered the room and cleaned it and moved things around.The hotel is fantastic if you need to be in the financial district but it's almost so big and impersonal that if the hotel errors the response given is more ho-hum then trying to get it right.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not Bad, Great Location Nice hotel in a great location -- downtown and near many things to see and do. My husband and I stayed for one night and were disappointed that the View Bar was closed for renovations. The limited contact with the staff was good. The rooms were small - but typical by San Francisco standards. While the bed was quite comfortable and the room was clean, the room seemed a bit in need of an update (particularly compared to the Park Hyatt where we stayed several months earlier for close the same price.) Valet parking is a whopping $45 (but you're paying for convenience.) While I wouldn't pay the rack rate for this hotel, not a bad place to stay in the heart of San Francisco.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very Nice Hotel Stayed here for a couple of days. Loved the hotel and many things to see and do within walking distance or a short cab ride away. The staff was great, the room was somewhat small but nice. Didnt care much for the hospitality snacks and bar. The slightest movement and you'll be charged. Which happened to us. But they took the charges off. We walked to the wharf from here but it's a couple of miles so unless you like to walk I wouldnt suggest it. Too many homless people in S.F. and the parking prices are absolutely ridiculous. A major rip off to say the least. The food wasnt bad and the beer was cold. We enjoyed our stay and would stay again for sure. The Marriott beds are the best !</p></li>

We had a couple of minor problems during our stay, that turned into much larger problems because the hotel staff was very rude. I don鈥檛 think I have ever been treated with less respect at any hotel I have stayed in. If you do stay here, make sure to ask for a written confirmation of the room rate at check in. Hotel policy appears to be that they don鈥檛 mention the rate until check out, and by the scene at the front desk the day we checked out, the rate people thought they were paying was sometimes different than the rate they got charged. The rooms are pretty standard, the room service food was poor, and almost every staff member we dealt with was less than friendly.</p></li>

Brilliant hotel in a brilliant location.We booked a double double room and it was very big with a large bathroom (by hotel standards), stylish decor and massive flatscreen TV.Beds were super-comfy and the we had a great view of downtown SF from our 16th floor room.The 39th floor view bar was also great with view over the whole city.When we were there the hotel was rennovating the ground floor but this made no difference to us (there was no noise or mess) and ALL the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly especially the concierge, doorman and receptionists.Great location just off Market St, a stones's throw from the major stores and very near to the Powell Street Cable Car terminus (just get there early!!).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Terrific Hotel Stayed for a night to do some shopping in San Francisco. The hotel was not crowded during Christmas week and we were able to check-in at 10a.m. The Front Office Manager was at the front desk and when we asked for a non-connecting room, he personally picked out a good one for us. Room 2640 was a corner room with a great view of Yerba Buena Gardens and Moscone Center. It was an oversized, nicely decorated room and had an extremely comfortable bed. The location was terriic, just 1/2 block from 4th and Market Streets (Nordstrom, Bloomingdales next year)and two blocks from Union Square and the major shopping area (Macy's, Saks, Beiman Marcus, etc). I highly recommend this hotel. If you do have a car, park in the 5th and Mission Garage across the street for $22 a day vs. $49 at the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Reliable choice This hotel is in a nice location and the room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff was accomodating and check-in was a pleasant experience, even at midnight. The only complaint that I have is that the hotel is currently undergoing construction (which they did warn me about) and so getting from lobby level to your floor is somewhat of a challenge. We had to take an elevator to floor 4, walk around the corner, and take another elevator on up to higher floors. The same goes for going back down, and the wait for the elevator is sometimes long as everyone is trying to figure out how to get from point A to point B. Other than that, the experience was fine. Nothing special. Oh and also, charging for internet access in the room (not even wireless) is a bit silly, especially for a business-friendly hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good Location and quality We picked this hotel as we wanted something reliable in a good location. We weren't disapointed. You are right next to the best shopping mall Downtown (Bloomingdale's/Nordstom's) and only 1 block from the Powel St cable car and Union Sq. The hotel was well maintained and the room well equiped, but no mini-bar or fridge. We did have a wide-screen HD television and a good selection of channels. We didn't have a great view but could just see the bay bridge between other buildings (on 29th floor). The room and all common areas we well decorated and clean. The viewing lounge on the 39th floor is well worth a visit. The only bad thing to say was that if you wanted to use the decent swimming pool you had to either change in the toilet or pay $5 each in the health club, which we thought was free from the web site.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Awesome Place We booked our room through Priceline.com and got a beautiful room for $125 a night on Friday and Saturday. Everything and everyone from the valet service to housekeeping was fantastic. The valet was full of information and was extremely kind. The bellboys were awesome. The front desk people more than went out of their way to help us. And the room was clean, newly-renovated, and extremely comfortable. The beds were to die for. The only drawback was that parking was $49 a night at the hotel. The valet recommended that we park just down the street at the Mission and Fifth Garage...we parked there for the whole weekend for $46. This hotel is close to shopping, close to the Powell/Market cable car stop, and is within footsteps to some of the world's best restaurants. Even the breakfast buffet at the hotel was great. We would stay here again any day!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">San Francisco Marriot- a great place to stay Spent the Labor Day weekend at the Marriot. We had in tow two small children and found this hotel to be in the perfect location. It is one block from the Yerba Buena complex which has a children's museum, a playground and a carousel. it is one block from excellent shopping, from the F train old fashioned trolleys and the BART. The staff is super friendly, the buffet breakfasts were delicious and very fresh and the room was large and clean with very cofortable beds. We will stay here again when we are in town. We booked on expedia and everything went smoothy which is important when you are travelling with children. The only criticism is that the tile decking around the swimming pool was very slippery and so one had to be extra careful not to fall. All in all, we had a wonderful stay and look forward to a return visit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Awesome Marriott We had a great experience while staying at the San Francisco Marriott. The location is awesome! The rooms beautifully decorated and the bedding so cozy. The beds were just a little too small (my husband is 6'3 and am 5 ft. and we were a little too close for sleeping in the double beds it was hard to move, they are just a tad bit small, I'd prefer the queen size). They have Starbucks coffee downstairs and it is easy to get anywhere in the city. Public transportation, great restaurants and entertainment is all at your disposal and all within blocks. The service was good. The View Bar upstairs had an awesome view of the entire city. My only complaint was the price of the drinks were high. The fitness center was excellent and it had a great equipment, a wonderful pool and spa. We truly enjoyed our stay at this great facility and would definetly come back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Best location for conferences I stayed at the Marriot in September for a conference in the Moscone Center. San Francisco is a great place for a business trip because you can do all sorts of things without having a car, and I like walking. However, my usual hotel, the Omni, is a bit far from the Moscone Center, where most conferences are held. Depending on corpoate travel rates and the like, the Marriot may be more or less expensive than the Omni, but it's right across the street from the Moscone and the Metreon, and a short walk from the Financial District.My room on this stay was pleasantly large, clean, and well-appointed. For a business traveler or a conference-goer planning on a few extra days, the Marriot is a great choice. For a traveler on vacation, there may be better deals and more personal hotels than this behemoth, but the Marriot would be comfortable and convenient.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Big hotel but personal service At first sight, this hotel seems like another big convention hotel (and there were several conventions there during our stay). But the service is very personal - all the staff are very friendly (special mention for Margaret at the concierge desk - great tour and restaurant recommendations, and how did she remember my (full) name when she deals with hundreds of people each day??!!).The buffet breakfast is great if you can eat that much in the morning (if you can, it will keep you going until dinner); if not, there is a Starbucks in the lobby. We had a room on the 28th floor with great views of Twin Peaks. The room itself was very large, very clean and comfortable. The hotel is located more or less at the junction of Stockton (leading to Union Square) and Market (a major (the main?) shopping street), so we had no complaints about location. Overall, 10 out of 10.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A very busy place! I came away with several impressions from my three-night stay. First, the Marriott is a very bustling and busy place. Lots of covention traffic. While I was there on vacation, the lobby was a vibrant center of activitiy. Yet once on my floor and my room, this was a great place to unwind and relax. I loved the oversized desk that overlooked the San Francisco skyline. No complaints at all with the room. The breakfast buffet was all I could ask for. Hotel location close to some good shopping and transportation to tourist attractiions. Staff was friendly and helpful. Visited the lounge on the 37th floor and it offered a great view, although a bit too crowded for me to enjoy a drink. But I can't fault it for being popular. This is really a business/conference hotel and probably is not geared to the typical tourist. Nonetheless, I was very satisfied with the accomodations and location of the Marriott. for my needs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Affordable luxury It was a pleasure staying here. The lobby is beautiful and the staff was friendly and welcoming. I stayed in the high rise section in a double and the room was huge! The beds were also large and comfy and the pillows were divine - you'll never want to wake up!The indoor pool is cold but the jacuzzi is so relaxing you'll forget to dip back in the pool.The View Lounge is spectacular. A view of San Francisco in this lounge will take your breath away. A little pricey for small plates so if you want to splurge go right ahead, it's worth it with the view you're right next to.The hotel is just a walk to Union Square and Westfield's San Francisco's Centre. Public transportation such as the BART and cable car is also a short walk away! Everything you want to visit is in walking distance.I recommend going back to this hotel if I'm ever in San Francisco and actually have been back in November =) It's worth staying in such affordable luxury!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel with great location! YOu cannot beat the location of this hotel. It is a BART ride from the airport. The BART stop is literally outside the door of the hotel. It is next to the huge mall with great gourmet fast food. Beard Papa is behind the hotel and you can get yummy cream puffs. It is an easy walk to Union Square, China Town, etc.. The staff is very professional and courteous. I get such attitude if the room is booked via Priceline when I am at ANY Hitlon. So naturally I was a bit apprehensive. Well I was so wrong! The check in lady could not do enough to accomodate my needs!!! I was shocked! Had a room that overlooks the bay bridge. Room was immaculate! The housekeeping staff is the best. We had an offer for turn down service nightly with the best chocolates!!! On the last night, we were given more chocolates and a beautiful post cards. Hated to pay for internet but that is a minor issue. I will stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not that great We stayed here for a meeting/convention at the Moscone West Convention Center. The hotel is about 2 blocks from the convention center. It's not too far, but the newly built Intercontinental Hotel is actually closer than the Marriott. The hotel was under construction at the time we were there, which made for terrible traffic inside the lobby area. Construction began right at 7am, so you might hear noises depending on where your room is. And because of the construction, you have to take different elevators to get to your floor. This added to a lot of inconvenience. To all readers, before thinking about staying here, check to see that their construction is completed. I don't think you would get your money worth if the construction was still going on. Otherwise, the room is nice. Very modern and hi tech. Every room has hi-def TV. Bathroom has granite counter. Hotel is situated in a very convenient location. It's close to restaurants, shopping, etc.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Honeymoon Bliss My fiancee and I decided to get married at City Hall in our favorite city in the world - San Francisco. Our stay at the SF Marriott proved to be a perfect decision as the location and staff were all top-rate. The room was spacious, the bed complete with down comforter so comfortable we'd like to buy it and the view from our corner room was spectacular both day and night. In particular, the concierge - Jeff Clavin, went above and beyond to make sure our honeymoon was perfect. He arranged for a florist to deliver my bouquet, sent champagne and chocolates on his own accord as a surprise to our room on our wedding day and suggested restaurants we might enjoy for a special night out. Even the maid service respected our privacy and ensured we would be left alone unless needed. The entire staff heard about our upcoming wedding and we received congratulations from employees we hadn't even met. We would definitely stay there again and highly recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect Location This hotel is right across from the Metreon and a block from the new Nordstrom's mall (Westfield). Couldn't be more convenient to see a movie at the Imax or regular theatre, ice skate or bowl at Yerba Buena, shop at the mall, and walk a few blocks to Union Square. For tourist families, it's ideal! The staff were incredibly friendly and we never had any problems with cleanliness or service.Family things within a block or so:--movies (one at Metreon and one at Westfield)--ice skating--Yerba Buena park--bowling--Zeum--MOMA--cable car station--BART stationWe actually took MUNI to the wharf, but you can also take the cable cars. Easy $1.50 on the old Italian(?) buses to get to Fisherman's Wharf, Maritime Park area, Ferry Building, Pier 39, or Ghirardelli Square. Kids were $0.50.Hotel negative: The only thing is that they charge $55 for parking for the night. Figure that in to your total price for the night--most hotels charge a lot, so I guess I was used to it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good hotel, but bring earplugs We stayed here for one night, a Saturday. The hotel was full with convention-goers but seemed to be run efficiently. Check-in was easy, the staff was great and the concierge was able to get us a great last minute dinner reservation.The location can't be beat - right by the Powell Street BART station and lots of shopping (Bloomingdales, Nordstrom, etc.). I'd recommend taking the BART into the city and leaving your car at the station. Otherwise, parking is about $50/day at the Marriott.The room was very nice, clean and the bathroom is large for San Francisco standards. The main problem with our room was that the walls were so thin that we could hear people talking in the room next door. And in the morning a child was blowing a whistle or something, and we REALLY heard that.Also, the breakfast is very expensive, so go across the street to the Mel's or Denny's.We got a great deal on Priceline - half price. So all in all, we were very satisfied with our stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not So Great stay Stayed at the downtown Marriott. This place has a great location and central for everything you may need. We stayed on the 4th floor (4019) where our window overlooked an alley and service entrance. Very early in the morning (both days) we had a very large sewer truck parked under our window with workers making a great deal of noise. There was also a lot of street noise that penatrated the closed windows. There is also a ton of remodeling and contruction in the hotel and the location has the ambience of total disarray. The staff has the attitude to match when I asked which of the three different elevator to use. There are plenty of great hotels nearby and I would avoid this property until they get the contruction done and realize that they are in competition with some great hotels nearby. Oh, I almost forgot, it cost $50/day to park at the hotel (which I did) and to top it off my car was damaged by the valet. As a loyal Marriott customer, avoid this place if you can.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice Stay at the Marriot Stayed here on a Saturday night after attending a SF Giants game at SBC Park. The hotel staff was very pleasant and accomodating. We arrived early at 10:30 AM. Thought by chance they may have a room available which they did and cheerfully checked us in. Parking at the hotel using the valet parking is $45 per night. The front desk staff made the suggestion that we park across the street from the hotel at the public garage for about $20 per night which we did. They have 24 hour security patrol there. We were able to walk to SBC park for the 1:00 game time. It's about a mile away.The room on the 28th floor was very nice, quiet and comfortable with a great view althought the window was a little dirty. The bed was very comfortable too. The view lounge at the top was very nice, and the atrium lounge was very comfortable with the sofas and overstuffed chairs.A short walk to union square and shopping galore made this hotel an excellent pick. We would most definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Three Years in a Row... Year three in San Francisco at the Marriott for our Fall Show.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good Location for Convention; not the greatest room Location is excellent for conventions at Moscone Center. It is within easy walking distance to the Convention Center and located near several nice places to eat (also walking distance). I had a room on the 5th floor that I felt was below average for a Marriott. The room itself was average, but the bathroom was a disaster. The tile floor was chipped and cracked and had an L sticker (assuming this was from a previous guests new shirt) stuck right in the middle of the floor. It stayed there for my entire stay (4 nights) which indicated to me that the floor was not being cleaned. Also, there was hair clippings in the soap indentations in the shower ... ewwww! I left a generous tip for housekeeping hoping things would get cleaned up, but no such luck. On a positive note, the TV was outstanding. I am not usually impressed by TV's, but I watched a football game with some friends on one of the room TV's and we were all very impressed by the quality of the room TV.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Marginal for the price For the level of hotel this was, I was a bit disappointed. The rooms were not laid out very well. The host in the concierge lounge was not helpful (we resorted to talking with the concierge downstairs with better success). The indoor pool was nice, but the chlorine was overpowering. The workout facilities were small but had all the cardio equipment--plus small TV's on each piece of equipment. Nice touch. The valet service, while expensive, was top notch and in and outs are allowed and free. The front desk and bell hops were very good. Overall, for the price, I would probably stay at the Parc 55 or other top-o-the-line hotel. When I re-read this response, it sounds negative. The hotel was not bad in any way. It was a very nice, clean, quiet hotel. However, since I travel for work on a weekly basis, I was expecting more from this high-end hotel. From that perspective, I was let down a little. This is still a very, very nice hotel with excellent amenities, a great location, and a fair price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent Location, Otherwise just OK I stayed in this hotel on several occasions (from seminars to just a weekend in SF for fun) - the location of the hotel is great, just couldn't be better. You're walking distance to Union Square, a lot of downtown stores and restaurants, BART (which incidently takes you straight to SFO), Metrion, etc.; As far as food, we found it to be average, a bit overpriced (for a plain meal of steak  mashed potatoes or basic breakfast items), there're much better dining establishments in SF, so dinner at the Marriott is not worth your time; The rooms were a bit old, but overall quite large and comfortable, everything was in working order and functional; the showers were a bit small, but clean and in working order. If you'r in town for a few days I would certainly recommend this hotel (much better then other Marriott properties in the city), it could get a bit pricey, but you're getting quality for your $$..if you want true luxury, opt for the brand new St Regis, Fairmont, PanPacific, etc.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Trip We just got back from a weekend trip to the San Francisco Marriott. We love San Francisco at Christmas and the Marriott was a great place to stay over the weekend.We did a lot of shopping and the proximity to Union Square and all the surrounding shops was excellent. They were doing some work on the lobby area and it was a little confusing getting around but there was always someone nearby to lead us on our way. The room wasn't very large but there was plenty of space for my wife and I to not feel cramped. The flat screen lcd tv was a plus and it's location in the corner of the room near the window opened up the space in the middle of the room. The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. We booked the hotel through a $94 bid on priceline and were very happy with what we got for such a great price. We had a king size bed on the 20th floor with a great view. The parking was pretty expensive ($50/night) so I'd look into parking at a nearby parking lot and saving some money there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I listened to Tripadvisor about this one As usual, Tripadvisor hit the nail right on the head! This is an awesome hotel and the reviewers helped me tremendously. I asked for a room in the high tower facing St. Patrick's Cathedral and it was delightful. One thing to be warned about, however: the double beds are more like enlarged singles. Actually, the man at the reception desk told my husband and me that he had a quiet bed with two beds in it. Hmmm, maybe we should have asked how large the beds were! Aside from this minor flaw, our stay was delightful. Dan at the concierge desk is the best and everyone we came in contact with in the hotel was very professional. Loved the pool, and yes, does have a bit too much chlorine. Did not like Mel's Diner, way too noisy and overdone. Had a very simple breakfast daily directly across the street at dear old Denny's. Had fantastic Chinese food at Far East on Grant where they have private rooms (!) and Kan's directly across. Try the Peking Duck. I want to go back just writing this!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Typical Marriott, good location The San Francisco Marriott is a great choice if you are attending a convention at Moscone. Only a block away, it's a relief not to have to walk too far after spending a whole day on your feet at a convention.It is a standard, full-service Marriott. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are an okay size for being downtown. Overall, it didn't leave me with an overwhelming impression one way or the other, which is sad because I really wanted to be impressed by the hotel. The service was good and the bellmen especially helpful. Room service was the typical Marriott menu. Yet, I'm frustrated by the charge for internet service.There are several good restaurants close by, with a movie theatre across the street. The Whole Foods Market is a few blocks away if you want to get some nice snacks. I would probably stay here again for convenience sake because how close it is to the convention center. However, if I was staying in San Fran for other reasons, the Fairmont and the Palace would be my first choices.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Marriott should be ashamed I attended a large conference at the San Francisco Marriott in January of 2007. I attend alot of large conferences, so I have many experiences to compare this to. There were two dreadful things about this hotel. First was the fact that four people in our group reported having blood stains in their rooms. Either on the floor or the bedsheets. These were official reports made through security. Who knows how many other stains were found and not reported. The second abomination was the food. Every single meal, from buffet to formal banquet was horrible. I did not eat at any of the restaurants or order room service, so I can't speak to that. Other than those two glaring negatives, the hotel is mediocre. It's biggest benefit is its location near Union Square. The second floor bar area was nice, and the bartenders friendly. The rooms were worn and old-looking. There was no mini-bar, safe, robe, or other nice amenities. I've stayed at many other hotels in downtown San Fran and would certainly consider those before returning to the SF Marriott.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Be Careful When Booking this Hotel! I stayed at the Marriott SF on April 5, and the first minute I arrived, the problems started. First the entrance to the hotel is NOT the hotel address. It's about 4 blocks via one way streets. I missed a turn and spent 10 minutes getting back to the entrance. The parking was an astronomic $45 a day! I am a Marriott rewards member, so I was confident I would get a nice room on a high floor. When I walked in to my 35th floor room, I found that I had a great view of the air conditioner units. I immediately called the front desk, and was politely told I could have a 4th floor room instead. When I complained to the manager, she gave me a 14th floor room, overlooking piles of garbage on the roof of the hotel's other wing. It was terrible! The room itself was OK, especially the bathroom, but the high speed internet costs another $13 a day. This hotel is dedicated to taking your money as efficently as possible. In conclusion, I would not rate this hotel as a 4 star, and I give the management a resounding F as in extremely poor. I will not stay at this Marriott again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's the location! We stayed here as part of a special christmas present for my three teenaged daughters. Here are some of the pluses. If you check the Marriott website they have specials which include parking in the hotel room costs (a $40 a day savings!). The room was nice, only a partial view but the beds were lovely and the bathroom was clean. The staff was friendly and very helpful. We live in the bay area and I wanted to stay close to the curran theatre and A.C.T. (both a easy walk). The girls loved being near union square (sephora, hm, DSW, urban outfitters, macy's, betsey johnson - you get the idea). I'd recommend the hotel to anyone coming to the city for theatre or shopping, you are close to the meteron and to muni/cable cars/bart. In the past we've stayed at hotels in union square (st francis, etc.) but the marriott room was a great deal for the money and still close to everything. I'd recommend eating at one of the hundreds of great restaurants in the city and just having coffee or drinks at the hotel (the view bar is lovely). We will probably stay here on our next after-christmas fiesta!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great central location especially for 1st timers Went to SF for the first time with my husband for a conference which was held there. We got the room for $140 via priceline. The hotel itself is in a great location, in the heart of downtown, close to Chinatown and steps from the BART (metro). I was a little upset because when we called they told us that the only ways to get there from the airport were by taxi ($45) or supershuttle ($16/pp) a nd so we took a cab. Turned out, you can take the metro (which we did on the way back) for $5/pp. to the POWELL station which is a block away from the hotel.The beds and the pillows are amazing, it is like floating on a cloud. I actually looked up the pillows brand to get some for my bedroom. The coffee offered in the room is really good.WARNING: parking at the hotel is $50 a day so try to find an alternative solution if you dont want to spend that much in parking.TIP: internet is about $13 a day in the room or $4/15min in the busin ess center. Right across the street at Organic coffee you can use there computers of a lot cheaper or yours for $5 a day. Someone told me there was a SOny station across the street that was free butI did not see it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">good and bad Standard convention center hotel.When we booked hotel, we asked for and were promised room with city view. When we arrived, guy at front desk was being rude and said none were available. I had a feeling he was just being a lazy a-hole, so we went up to our room with the intent of talking to manager, but not in front of that guy. The room we initially received was on a low floor and had a view of a back alley. When I called down and spoke with the manager, she said plenty of view rooms were available and immediately moved us into a corner view room near the top floor. She also gave us 4 drink tickets for the bar on the top floor. Our new room had a an excellent view of the city and bay. The room was very clean and had contemporary decor.The bar at the top of the hotel has an awesome view. Probably the best of any hotel lounge in the city.Despite the rude an unprofessional front desk staff, we would most likely return to this hotel. Can't remember his name, but one of the concierges provided excellent advice and was extremely helpful during our entire stay. One of the best pieces of advice he gave was to park in the structure behind the hotel at a fraction of the cost of the ridiculously overpriced hotel parking.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Check your bill for incorrect charges Stayed at this hotel for a business convention Aug 3 through Aug 7-total of 4 nights. Checked in at front desk and was told I was assigned 19th floor/city view, handicap room. Advised front desk I did not require such a room and they should reassign that type of room to another traveler with special needs. Reassigned the 11th floor/King size bed. Room was big, clean, and well laid out. Room Service and wake up calls great. Wednesday around Noon I returned to my room to find a worker about to set up a carpet cleaning machine...WHY ? I told him to leave since I needed to make some phone calls. He must have come back later because the carpet appeared to have been cleaned. I checked out Thursday and did not look at my bill close enough. On Wednesday, there was a charge made against my room for the Refreshment Center for $10.96. Guess who helped themselves to a beverage !!! I called the hotel billing number and they stated the bill would be adjusted. It alarms me to know that people are coming in and out of my hotel room and things are being charged without my knowlege. I expect more from Marriot and so should the public. As for San Francisco; its a nice city with some wonderful places to visit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very close to everything via San Fran Transportation Systen We were there for six nights for a convention. This hotel has a great location and we could walk to Bart, bus, and trolleys, Cable cars are also close by but use only if you are a first time visitor to San Francisco....the wait if too long for anything but a one time ride. No one we were with, ate breakfast in the hotel, it was too expensive. We went diagonally across the street to Mels Diner where you could get breakfast for $10 a personDrinks in the 39th foor lounge are a one-time must but very expensive as is the bar downstairs. The sports bar on the corner is owned by the Marriott but is less expensive for cocktails. A lot of people also ate there. We didn't so can not give a review. Please check my restauarant reviews...we had some fantastic meals including Frascati, which any of you foodies will love.This was your standard four star convention/business hotel with a lot of activity in the lobby (which I like). Room was very clean and beds were soooo comfortable. Since we had another week down in San Diego and had four suitcases we did ask for a corner room since we couldn't fit in luggage and clothes. By the day after check-in they had accomodated us.We would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel REALLY wants your money! I stayed here for 3 nights while attending a huge conference. The rooms were extremely comfortable and tasteful, and the bathrooms so modern, clean and big...nice towels, but their shampoo smells weird. They were doing a lot of construction in the hotel, so that made for difficult elevator use--lots of detours. Not to mention the intolerable disruption to so many of our conference presentations!My big gripe with this hotel is that it's already VERY expensive and I guess they figure only filthy rich people stay here because they try to get a few more dollars out of you at every turn. Wireless is very expensive and the signal terribly weak. To change your clothes in the locker room at the pool/health spa is 5 bucks. And most offensive of all, if you even TOUCH anything on the minibar (which includes such insults as a $4 Snickers) a SENSOR underneath it automatically charges you for it!!! So when you check out, pay attention to your final total, because you're likely to have paid out the nose for stale candy bars that you didn't even unwrap.A really great Asian fusion restaurant right around the corner is called Straits. Not too expensive and very classy. There's also a nice cheap and good Thai place a couple of blocks away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good location and facilities; look for bargains Stayed 3 nights at the Marriott after getting a deal ($101 a night) on Priceline. This enormous hotel has a good location, within walking distance of the convention center, business district, trolley, buses, and square; and if you are fit for an uphill trek of a few minutes, Chinatown.Beware that parking at the hotel is hideously expensive ($40 a night), so if you must bring a car, I suggest you find an alternative place to park (there is a large garage a block or two away). Also, traffic in the area is terrible. Best bet: avoid bringing a car.The rooms are recently refurbished, and the furnishings are fairly pretty. Everything is of middle to very good quality. Unfortunately, the windows were embarrassingly filthy on the outside.The top-floor bar has a spectacular view and acceptable (for a hotel) prices. The indoor pool is large enough, and the exercise room is well equipped. I didn't use the hotel's food service, because many eateries are within walking distance, and Chinatown (yum) is nearby.Service is ok but entirely impersonal due to the hotel's enormous size. If you are paying over $150 a night, don't stay here. But if you can get a room here for around $100 a night, I think you'll feel you got a good value for your money -- parking excluded.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A good all-round hotel Just returned from a long weekend in San Francisco. Found the hotel to be a good choice for those keen to be staying somewhere central (close to Union Square, Cable Car turn around, shopping, restaurants etc) and in a hotel which offers a good standard of accomodation and facilities. Excellent pool, spa tub and gym (cardio and weight rooms). In-hotel dining good (buffet breakfast will sort you out for treking around San Francisco). No major negatives. A good hotel for short breaks. Given that the SF Marriott serves mainly as a business hotel and therefore is slightly corporate and inpersonal you probably wouldn't choose to stay here for a long period of time. However, I think it is a good pick overall as SF hotels go. Just for comparison, I was recommended to stay close to the Fisherman's Wharf area. Glad I didn't in the end. It's interesting enough a place to visit, to catch the ferry over to Alcatraz and try out some of the seafood restaurants but with its illuminated sea front strip, numerous souvenir shops and fast food restaurants, it is a little tacky and for me personally, doesn't really capture what San Fran is all about. As it is only a short cable car or taxi ride from the SF Marriott / centre you can get down there easily enough anyway as and when you need to. Hope this helps. Enjoy San Fran....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Extremely clean and comfortable!!!!! My husband and I just stayed here for our third anniversay this past weekend, and we just have all great things to say about this hotel!!!! It is super clean, spacious, comforatable, and central to downtown union square and close to the financial district! We loved it so much- we stayed in a corner room so the view was awesome- we could see the busy street w/ all the people and yet could barely hear a thing (and we were only on the 6th floor!) The bed was so nice too- the mattress was super comfy and the bedding was very clean and crisp and comfy! The TV was a large flat screen (which my husband loved) and the bathroom was very nice and modern with granite(?) type floors and large bath tub. Even the smell of the room was nice! The location is so great as well- it took us only 5 minutes to get to the Bart station off of Powell, and three minutes to get to a Walgreens for water or snacks. The location also feels very safe and within minutes to great shopping and places to eat. We didn't rent a car- all we did was walk and maybe catch a cab if we were to go to fishermans warf (only $13 BTW via cab) We actually walked to Fishermans warf from our hotel and it only took us about 20 minutes- we cut through the financial district and it was such a pretty walk. You should stay here - well worth it and the staff is also super friendly and helpful!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful Rooms But Expensive Add-On Charges We stayed at the SF Marriott downtown in order to attend a convention nearby. We booked the room via priceline for $150 a night (about $175 with taxes and charges). We had a room on the 15th floor with a view of the surrounding downtown buildings. Overall, the room was very nice - it was large, clean and seemed newly remodled. The hotel overall was exceptionally large and laid out in an odd fashion (check-in is on a different floor than where you pull your car in etc). The main concern about the hotel were the add-on charges. Parking was $40. Items in the rooms (snacks etc) were also very expensive. The hotel also provides a number of services that it seemed were required (cab flagging service, luggage hold, bellman service and such) but that also require tipping. I was surprised at how much additional money was spent on tipping and parking for our one-night stay. Overall, it added about $75 to our nightly bill. The location is in the heart of downtown and walking distance to Union Square. It is a bit of a walk to the Emarcadero and there are closer hotels to that area if you seek it out. The rooms were quiet but given the sheer size of the hotel it was a pretty noisy place in the common areas. I'm not sure that I would stay here again even though the rooms were nice just because there are equal hotels that are cheaper with a better location in the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent Hotel We spent a long time trying to find a decent hotel at the right price in SF. Eventually we settled on The Marriott and were not disappointed. The rooms were of ample size although I would suggest asking for high rise room. The indoor pool was a good size and nice and warm although we could find no changing rooms. On our last day we experienced a very enjoyable breakfast in the hotel. Yes it is a little expensive but is well worth it. If you do not require in house breakfast there are a couple of diners round the corner especially Loris and Dennys. Next to the hotel is a large multiscreen cinema and Sony centre which if you have teenagers with you they will thoroughly enjoy. Union Square is a 5 minute walk away and there are many shops in close proximity. The Tram buses to Fishermans Wharf are 2 minutes away and the cable cars are about 5 minutes. A word of caution was that there was no internet computer in the lobby therefore we had to hunt for an internet cafe which was 10 to 15 mins away. At night it can be easy to get lost and as you move away from the centre the area becomes a little dangerous to be around. Several people had mentioned this to us and during our stay in California we found more beggars on SF than any we visited. In summary the hotel was excellent with great views from the top floor at night. We spent 4 nights there and would certainly return to visit a number of places we ran out of time to see.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Typical Convention Center Hotel When you think of a convention center hotel, this is probably what you have in mind. However, if you're headed to a convention - especially one at the Moscone Center, this is fine place to stay.The rooms are small but clean. They have been updated recently and have comfortable beds with good bedding. The curtains are especially good at blocking the light if you like a dark room. There's a flat panel television with a good selection of digital channels. The hotel had internet available via ethernet; however, I was able to pick up a free wifi signal from outside the hotel. That was probably just luck and I didn't see a hotel wifi.The bathroom was also small, but had good, soft towels. The water pressure was fine.I checked in late and left early, so I didn't see much of the staff. However, the gentleman who checked me in was quite helpful. It was late and I was looking for a decent meal outside of the hotel. He gave me a great choice.If you're looking to have a drink in the hotel, there's a bar on the top floor with amazing views of the city.All in all, this isn't some amazing must see destination - especially for a city with so many historic hotels. However, if you need a place to spend the night, check your e-mail and then get to a convention, this will do just fine. (Also, don't take this to be condemning the hotel with faint praise. Rather, it's just a good way to say the convention center hotel is what it is.)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Concierge staff superb I recently spent three nights at the Marriott that was part of a tour. We arrived earlier to spend some time with my daughter who lives in San Francisco. First, I agree with many reviewers that the windows are dirty but I found this to be common in many hotels. We were on the street side so there was a constant noise even in the early hours and an annoying sound at night.However, the hotel is very hospitable and the concierge staff great. They had wonderful recommendations and kudos to Jeff Clavin and his staff. They seemd to be constantly on duty even in the early morning hours. They had some good tips about local transportation. The Marriott is in a great location. Take the bus almost anywhere for $1.25. If you want a cable car ride, ride early in the morning or you might have to wait a really long time. We took the cable car to Alcatraz at Fisherman's Wharf and had no problem at 7:30 in the morning. Buy your tickets on line to Alcatraz before or you might be disappointed. We went on a Saturday and the next available ticket was Tuesday. However, there is a standby line with no guarantees, but all the people in the stand by line were able to get on the boat to the island.The breakfast buffet at the Marriott was superb, and the beds were very comfortable. The lobby is very lovely and the staff at the front desk also was very accommodating. All and all, my staff at the Marriott was very good and I would not hesitate to return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Genuine rip-off My partner and I stayed at this hotel that we booked through priceline, and it felt as if we we're treated as lower tier humans for doing so. When we had a complaint, the clerk at the front desk made it a point to remind us that we booked our room through priceline, making us feel belittled and unworthy of staying at their establishment. Our complaint was that the clerk that registered us in charged $100 to our card, unbeknownst to us. The front desk manager, although apologetic and polite, stated he would call our bank and reverse the charges. The next day he promised us he did make the call. He never did, and our bank verified that no call was ever made. He told a bold faced lie right to our faces. And this was their manager! All of the front desk personnel we were in contact with really needed an attitude adjustment and/or a severe refresher course in good customer service.Unless you paid full price for one of their rooms, expect less than great customer service. The location and room itself were so-so, and as a previous poster said, they do try to gouge you for your money at every turn. No coffee pots in the rooms, which, for a 4-star hotel, should be a given. $13/day for internet; most other hotels I've stayed at offer free Wi-Fi. No alcohol can be brought in; they say it's the law (although I haven't found it anywhere online), even though they can serve it to you in their lounges and restaurants and charge exorbiant prices for it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not recommended We arrived and checked in to a room which had been used by a previous guest. They did not seemed surprised by this but did move us immediately to a clean room. The bell staff jump on you (literally) to get your luggage and we politely declined help on three occasions. Still they came to drag it away from us and in the process made us trip over them and send the luggage flying. They fight amongst themselves to get to the guests first so they can get a tip which is rude and intrusive. This only seems to happen in the States and I believe that gratutities should be at the guests discretion. I believe in rewarding good service. Also I do believe that it is their jobs to provide a service to guests and this service (if it is good) should be rewarded. If I want to take my own luggage then I should be able to do this without feeling that they want a tip for just opening doors or smiling. One of the concierge answered an outside call when we were in the middle of talking to him. The rooms are adequate but without a fridge. Beds are very comfortable. Housekeeping turned the air conditioning on and then left the windows open. What is the sense in this?! Location is good. Staff appear disinterested and lacking in common customer service skills. If you must stay here then I advise:Do not park here. They charge $50 a night PLUS TAX and you can't take your car out and bring it back in the same day without being charged another $50. Park at one of the public car parks which are close by and significantly cheaper (5th and mission or gardens)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Choice My family of four (including a 6 and 8 year old) stayed here for 5 days in late July. We had a very positive experience. The room was clean and service was efficient and unobtrusive. The gym is presently being redone, but all of the equipment is available in carpeted conference rooms on the 4th floor and this should be done in August. The pool was great for San Francisco hotels, with a large hot tub. The hotel atrium restaurant was actually a pleasant surprise鈥攖he service quick, food good and prices comparable to other local places. I found the location of the hotel to be good, mainly due to proximity to the excellent public transportation in the city. There is a Whole Foods supermarket that has prepared food 3 blocks away; the cable car and Union Square are equally close. I would strongly urge travellers to familiarize themselves with the public transportation before going鈥攚e did not have a car and felt no need to have one. You can easily and cheaply get to all attractions with public transportation (including an inexpensive trip to the airport on BART with a station a half block from the hotel). For example, we took the trolly bus (# 30 or 46 both work) to a Giants game for $4 for the 4 of us. ATT Park is about 7 blocks from the hotel. A cab from the airport is $35 before tip. My only complaint is that some parts of the surrounding neighborhood is a little rough around the edges, with more homeless people than I am accustomed to similar areas in Philadelphia or New York. I never felt threatened, but this did come as a surprise to me. Overall, I would definitely return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Beware priceline guests! Expect a very poor front desk attitude when you book through priceline. I haven't stayed at the hotel yet but based on my phone room request i guess i won't have a high expectation, and just have to manage fine without expecting service. I won the room through priceline for $89 a night, what a steal right? Why would i be complaining already? Well i was very excited, right after my reservation was confirmed, called the hotel directly for room request eventhough my trip to SF is still 4 months away. Priceline stated that special request on rooms should contact the hotel directly, so i did. I never ever been treated so low before at any other hotels i've stayed in. Through some of the reviews i read i guess a lot of people that have booked the hotel through priceline feel the same way? I'm not really fussy at all when staying at a hotel, my only request was just to have a room with 2 queen/2 double beds and maybe a refridgerator since i'm still breastpumping. The lady i spoke to (Georgia)refused to let me make any special request and keep stating that I book my room through Priceline( as if I don't have rights to make any special request, and just be happy that i even got a room at the hotel for such bargain) And she also didn't want to even let me know what type of room i'll have. Feeling frustated I contacted Priceline and they took care of me. This is the first time I booked hotel through Priceline. I really recomend Priceline for their customer satisfaction and profesionalism but Do Not recomend this hotel even if you have a good deal. I will write another review after my SF trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very comfortable stay We took two rooms at the Marriott for three days. Our room had a beautiful nighttime view of the city and the other room overlooked the center for the arts. Both were very quiet. The bed was exceptionally comfortable. The robes provided for our use were very, very nice. All areas of the hotel were very well maintained.The lobby was lovely. It was busy, but they moved the lines very quickly and the staff was professional. Dan the concierge was EXTREMELY helpful and even gave us his personal phone number should we need to call him. (Which we did!!)The exercise facility had bikes, ellipticals and treadmills as well as weights. They had individual TVs in the treadmillsthat played movies and complimentary headsets. The fitness area also had a spa- but I didn't get a chance to use those services. (Next time.)We had a great breakfast at the hotel every morning. They made omelets to order. Try the salsa! The lobby kiosk for the Starbucks had a long line one morning, but there was an excellent coffee shop right around the corner from the hotel and another Starbucks store across Market Street. (Out the door, make a right. Another right at the corner of Market, one block up and you are there. I think it was called the Coffee Beanery. Starbucks was across Market street from the Beanery -near the Bart station.)The 15, 30 and 45 buses stop right in back of the hotel- in front of the Office Max (Office Depot? some office supply store.) They will take you up to North Beach or Chinatown.Easy access to transportation. Quiet, comfortable beds. Friendly, helpful staff. I would not hesitate to stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location The location of the hotel was excellent. Walking distance to Union Square, Sears Restaurant on Powell (great breakfast), San Francisco Mall, CrateBarrel, HM, Anthropologies, William Sonoma, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, Metronome, Moscone Ctr. etc.... It was also very close to the cable car and BART. The rooms were very clean and the size just enough room for two. I was disappointed that they did not have a coffee machine to make a cup when I get up or even making hot water for tea in the evening or a small mini bar. They do have a coffee kiosk downstairs in the lobby but there was a long line with only one person working there. I preferred to go to Coffee Bean for coffee around the corner on Market Street for its mocha ice blended coffee. We rented a car for couple of days and found the overnight parking was extremely high of $45.00 and you had to have it valet parked so by the time you add the tax and tip try dishing out $50.00 (that's more than the rented car per day) I found a public parking on 5th and Mission across kiddie corner from the hotel which was $22.00 for 24 hours.  I noticed on the floor where we stayed the room service tray was not picked up right away and were sitting out all day.  The water pipe made loud noises when the neighboring guest were using the bathroom. Going to and from our rooms were great with the low, mid and high rise elevators. We didn't have to wait for the elevators at all and stopped on every floor.I love staying at the Marriott Hotels and I guess I am spoiled staying at the Marriott Resort Hotels in San Diego and Monterey Bay which were excellent hotels with all the ammenities.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location  As Marriott Rewards members, my husband and I accrue points for staying at Marriott and Courtyard hotels, and recently we decided to use some points for a free night at the SF Marriott. We visited family and saw the sights while we were there.Marriott treats its Rewards customers like royalty. No standing in line to check in; rooms are upgraded at no extra charge whenever available; service of all kinds is outstanding. Our room was in the corner with a gorgeous view of the city and a peek of the Bay between buildings. The king-sized bed was the second most comfortable I've ever slept in (the best was in Zagreb, Croatia--a bit far to go for a good night's sleep!). The linens were smooth and fresh. The room temperature was perfect, and although the hotel is located in the middle of one of the busiest areas of the city, it was very quiet!The bar on top has an excellent view of the city, and although the drink prices are a bit high, one is also paying for the view and the good service. We did not dine at the hotel that evening.I was only disappointed with two things: The buffet breakfast, which contained an excellent variety of dishes, was cold. I especially can't stand cold scrambled eggs, and theirs were cooler than room temperature. The meats and french toast weren't much warmer.The other shock (it is San Francisco, I realize) was the $50 per day parking fee. Wow! I was prepared for $25 or $30, but that was a bit much. I highly recommend the hotel, however, if you can stand the parking fee. You might want to walk up the street to Sears Fine Food (not affiliated with the dept. store) for pancakes for breakfast or to one of the bakeries nearby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Enjoyable stay at SF Marriott I recently stayed at the San Franciso Marriott on business, and I would recommend this hotel without hesitation to others seeking a nice hotel at a reasonable cost. The hotel was within a 10-minute walk to Union Square, and a $10 taxi ride to Fisherman's Wharf.Check-in was quick and courteous, and my requests for a high floor and city view were honored. As my Marriott Rewards profile indicates that we prefer a refrigerator, the person doing check-in offered to have one delivered, as that particular room did not have one. I declined, but thought it nice that it was offered.The room itself was very comfortable. The long desk was along the window wall, from which I had a glorious view of the Bay Bridge. The large, flat screen TV was a nice touch. The hard-wired Internet connection worked very well and log-in instructions were easy to follow. I slept well as the bed was comfortable and outside noise was at a minimum.My only negative comment about the room was that there was no safety deposit box. These were available at the front desk, yet I'd much rather have one in the room.My business associate and I sought the concierge for advice on places to dine and received wonderful advice. We had lunch at the Sushi Boat, near Union Square, and dinner at McCormick  Schmick's. For the latter, the concierge suggested we arrive early for dinner, and we were seated with no wait.Visitors desiring a hotel closer to Union Square and/or tourist attractions might think this hotel somewhat inconvenient -- in fact, we made a wrong turn walking back from Union Square, but found our way again courtesy of a map provided by the concierge. Still, I would certainly stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">five days We recently spent five days in the hotel, my two children and I, aged 18 and 12. The staff were very friendly and helpful and assisted at all times. The concierge arranged to get some football tickets for the Falcons game and the seats she got were good. We ate out most of the time as the hotel was very busy with convention folk. Across the street, Annabelle's Bar and Bistro, had a good atmosphere at the weekend and the food was really good, the early evening menu having a good choice and being well priced. A late evening beer for me yielded some good conversations with friendly locals and out of towners like myself.The hotel rooms were ok and well cleaned but not inspiring. The views from the top floor were great and worth a look. The staff though I could not fault and that goes a long long way.The location of the hotel was excellent and we took the BART in from SFO airport which was less than $5 each and it dropped us virtually on the doorstep. The five days were well spent and the hotel was a good base. At night there was lots going on around the hotel area but we never felt the least bit threatened or intimidated. The museum of modern art was fabulous and only a couple of minutes walk, the kids loved it, as did I.The city itself was a real treat and the weather was fantastic. We did the usual things such as Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge and these lived up to reputation. The local shopping was really good and my twelve year old daughter made the most of it. In addition my wife, who stayed at home, gained a nice watch as a present when we got home.We'll go back and certainly consider the hotel as our first choice. It was a really good location. Incidentally we got a great deal off Expedia UK at about $99 US per night for a room. All in all a winner.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First class accommodation With close to 1500 rooms this is a huge property. The facilities were first class and the staff very responsive and cheerful. All in all a great place to stay. Good location. There is lots of shopping around and plenty of restaurants. The cable-car is just around the corner off Market St. and that鈥檚 where you will also find the F train, the Muni and BART. In other words, all the transportation options you want are right around the corner. By the way, if you use the transit system (excl BART) and plan to be in town for three days or more, get yourself a three-day pass for $18.Ask the very helpful concierge service for restaurant recommendations and even to make you a reservation. I highly recommend a family-run Italian restaurant a short walk away called Pazzia. It鈥檚 very small so make a reservation.My room was good but quite small. The bed was comfortable.The interconnect connection requires an ethernet cable and they claim to charge $12.95/day for the right to connect, which in my opinion is a money-grab. If you need it, see if you can get internet connection thrown into your room rate.The bathroom was very small. If anyone from the Marriott is reading this review, please pass on to the hotel manager that it would be a good idea to have more than one towel hook in the bathroom for wet towels. I am certain I went through more towels than I would have, had I had a place to hang them to dry. In other words, a towel rack would actually pay for itself in terms of reduced laundry costs.The fitness facilities are currently under renovation and all equipment is located in temporary conference rooms. Having said that, the equipment is brand new and fantastic. Will be even better once the TV connections to the cardio equipment are properly installed.Overall a great place to stay.Safe travels - thedonk</p></li>
