The nearest metro station is just a 5-minute walk. The room is a little small, but we are okay with that. The staff is very nice and helpful.</p></li>

Very safe residential neighbourhood. Great value for the location and service. Breakfast was included and quite delicious, a nice variety of food. Rooms were small and the bed was quite firm, but can't expect luxury size and bedding for the price paid. Free Wi-Fi was a nice bonus.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A group of 8 of us stayed at Eiffel-Kennedy; Bernard, Simone and all staff were very accomodating & helpful. Clean & safe, great area for touring, shopping & eating. Great convenience to have breakfast on premises. I would definitely go back and stay with them again ! Keep in mind this is Europe.......so rooms are smaller than most North American hotel rooms........... but charm makes up for it ! Julie.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was in a good location for touring and easy reach to shops/bars and 15 minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower. The rooms were basic but adequate. We do not think that we could have found a better hotel with all the search engines we had on the world wide web to search for this hotel. Bernard, the manager was so helpful and kind to us and also others. The night manager was also helpful. We would certainly go back to this hotel.</p></li>

Very well located hotel for the Eiffel Tower and the river, although about 10 minute walk to Metro. Rooms are small but very well appointed and clean and more than adequate for a visit to Paris. Hotel is well maintained and the service is very good from the moment you enter the hotel to checkout at the end of your stay. The staff are incredibly helpful. Highly recommended!</p></li>

You can walk to the Eiffel tower in about 15 minutes and also the bus took us everywhere. The staff was very helpful and friendly! Would recommend the hotel for a short trip to Paris.

I can't say enough about satisfaction with Bernard and his team. And breakfast turns out to be a bargain when I traveled more in Europe. Up to 15 euro at once place that wasn't even as nice! Access: RER C is closest but Ranelagh is close to. Even better is a whole fleet of Velolib rental bikes out front (provided by the city). I like the restaurant next door too: Cafe de la Fontaine?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was an excellent hotel, given the price, for both a business and a leisure trip to Paris. The room was clean and very quiet (even though facing the lively corner - good sound insulation), the bed was very comfortable the bathroom was well functioning and the breakfast was very good (very nice staff working in the breakfast room). The location was good (great for evening walks down to the Eiffel Tower). All in all a great hotel covering most peoples every need in central Paris for a reasonable price.</p></li>

Very friendly and service minded staff. Breakfast buffet was nice. Location was i a quiet area but still with plenty of restaurants and café's available within short distance. Also public transport available within very short distance. The nearby RER line from Avenue du pdt Kennedy brings you close to all the sights in Paris. And the Eiffel tower is a very beatiful 15 minuttes walk away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Bernard and his staff extend a warm welcome, nothing is too much trouble for them. Lovely clean, well maintained hotel, excellent breakfasts, the cakes are to die for. Windows well soundproofed so a good night's sleep is guaranteed. Only 5 or so minutes from Ranelagh metro, or RER, and buses 72, 70, 52 get you just about anywhere comfortably. The "swan" island provides a lovely evening walk. Just up the rue Boullainvillier is a great shopping area with lots of little artisan shops. Cannot wait to visit again.</p></li>

We were put in a hotel room with a window facing on to a wall - no natural light whatsoever. There was a stale smell in the room and the toilet was the smallest one we had ever seen - only room for 1 person at a time. The room itself was also very small. When we complained, we were informed that nothing could be done as the hotel was completely full at the time. I would never ever stay in this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Charming hotel that epitomises all that is good in Paris! Bernard, the owner, was friendly and very helpful. He helped us feel at 'home' as soon as we walked through the door. The room was gorgeous and romantic and if we hung out the French window we had a view of the Eiffel Tower. There is everything you need near by. A laundrette, a supermarket, a Patisserie and a cafe beneath the hotel for cafe au lait and watching the world go by. The room was spotlessly clean and well equipped. We highly recommend this lovely hotel.</p></li>

I disagree with other reviewers who say that the rooms are too tiny... Yes, the rooms are a bit small compared to standard U.S. hotel rooms, but they're bigger than cruise ship rooms, for example. The rooms were plenty big enough for my husband and I with all our luggage. In summary, I would definitely stay in the Hotel Eiffel Kennedy again if I return to Paris.</p></li>

Everything was convenient and the cafe at the corner was a great place to end each evening. The bakery across the street and the upscale supermarket nearby were nice additions. Access to buses and taxis and subway were remarkable. Our walk to the Eiffel Tower was not difficult, and we needed the exercise. We would stay again. Sandra M.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We came across this hotel after being turned on to it by other TA members. We can immediately see why. We were greeted by a charming man who provided us with a map and all the information about Paris. As it was our first visit to the city, he even gave us cute little eiffel tower keychains which was a nice touch. The hotel is walking distance to everything and has a slight view of the eiffel tower depending on your room. Its also in perfect distance to the metro which makes it very easy to get around. I would defenitely reccomend this to any first timers in Paris. There were also alot of tourists, so it is tourist friendly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location of the hotel is good, close to Eiffel tower, however the rooms were tiny and we could not open all our bags. When we were in Paris (3rd to 6th June) it was very warm and since our room was on the fourth floor, it would get very warm. However the airconditioning would not work for more than 5 minutes and that would leave us in a sweltering room. Repeated requests to get it fixed fell on deaf ears, and we were told that since it was a weekend they could not get it fixed, well, they could house guests in the weekend! We tried to stay out as much as possible, however the rooms would be unbearable in the nights as well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked to stay at this hotel following the rave reviews on Trip Advisor and the very competitive price. I arrived before my partner and immediately cancelled our booking for the following two nights. Not sure where we went wrong but ALL we are able to say is that the hotel is cheap and has free wi-fi. It has nothing else to recommend it. Rooms are so small that it almost claustrophobic, bathrooms are dated and no-where is particularly clean. It is not well located. If you don't know Paris you assume that the Eiffel Tower is in the centre but it is not. I wouldn't say don't stay here but I would just say be aware that everyone has different standards!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this wonderful hotel from 4-8 July. This is an outstanding hotel for a number of reasons. The area is completely safe for singles and families, with shops and an ATM just across the street. The bus nearby travels along the seine into the city and the walk to the eiffel tower is easy and safe day and night. The rooms are very clean, bed is comfortable and if you are staying in summer the airconditioning is fantastic. As other reviews have stated the reception staff are friendly, very helpful and speak english well. Another feature is the free internet in the lobby. This hotel comes highly recommended, and I will not hesitate to stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Hotel the night of the England France Rugby World Cup semi final, which we went to ! This Hotel is really nice, clean, smart and very comfortable. Our twin room wasn't big but more than adequate, bathroom was immaculate. It's in a lovely area of Paris not far from the Eiffel tower and the Brasserie on the corner (shown in their web site picture) was also excellent. Great steak fun lunch on Saturday and we missed breakfast at the Hotel on Sunday (no surprise there) and had brunch sitting on their pavement tables at the brasserie as well.......also excellent. My advice is book this place, I'd go again. Forgot to mention v.helpful and friendly staff !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My 2 adult daughters and I stayed at this charming hotel for 3 nights. Although the triple room was small, that's how most hotels in Edinburgh/Madrid/Dublin have been for us. The room was clean and had a nice view of the street. The best part was the location - walking distance to the Tower and shopping areas. Good local restaurants too! The staff was amazing. We only speak a few words of French but we were trying so hard. Everyone was helpful and we actually picked up some phrases and words. The staff speak English and that certainly was a plus. We were given outstanding help in using public transportation to the Lourve and Versailles. I can not recommend this hotel any higher!</p></li>

I couldn't have asked for more. The rooms were alwasy very clean and this was the cutest hotel I have ever seen. Rooms are smaller than North American Hotels but I didn't care. There was a cafe downstairs that had the best Cafe Creme. I want to thank Simone and her Staff for making our vacation one of the best...

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got back from Europe, and loved our stay at the Hotel Eiffel Kennedy the most out of all of our stops! The hotel is adorable and in a great residential quarter so you get the feel for Parisian life more than you would in another hotel. The owner and his staff do a great job of making you feel right at home and speak English well. They are more than willing to give you maps and directions to anything you wish to visit.

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our perfect 3 day stay started with a warm welcome from the owner, who gave us a map of Paris with tips on the most convenient bus (72), metro and train (RER C). We had 2 separate rooms (213-214), connected by a small corridor, which could be closed and locked. It was a great set up for 2 adults and 2 children, with their own bathroom and privacy. The view on the tip of the Eiffel tower was a plus. The hotel was immaculate with a charming breakfast room in the basement. There was an exceptional variety of food, mostly baked and cooked by the owner's wife. This hotel high rating on Trip Advisor is well deserved and offers excellent value for money. I know where to stay next time we come to Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am very happy to say that our one week stay at the hotel was a very pleasant and enjoyable experience. The hotel is very conveniently situated the center of Paris with easy access to bus and underground train stations. Our room although a tad small, was very cosy and clean, very comfortable to rest in after a day of running around Paris. The reception staff where very helpful in providing us with vital information which helped us make the most of our time, and where never to busy to provide us with assistance at any time of the day. Breakfast was delicious with a wide choice foods to choose from, and again was made even better by the terrific service provided by the hostess. Definitely recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived in the morning and the front desk staff didn't make a fuss about checking us in early (9AM) without extra charge. The rooms were very compact, but still adequate for two (Asian) travelers with one luggage each. Taller and more un-light travelers may find it too tight. The bathroom was clean, the lobby was charming, the staff were very friendly, helpful and always ready to extend assistance. The breakfast place at the cellar was quite unique and their few but quality breakfast buffet items of quiche, fresh fruits, caramel flan, breads and cheeses never disappoint. The location is in a quiet residential neighborhood, and walking to the train stations add to your delightful Parisian experience.</p></li>

Hotel has good location within walking distance from RER Av.Kennedy ( 5 mins ) as well as from METRO. Staff was very friendly and helpful, all wishes fulfilled in few minutes. Rooms are little bit smaller, but very comfortable and well equipped. Bathroom was large and well equipped as well. Just across the street are food shops, under hotel nice café and drinks shop. Breakfast was great surprise; it was rich with lots of choices ( ham, salami, eggs, quiche, cheesecakes, apple pie, cornflakes....and much more ) This hotel I would like 100% recommend to all travellers. It combines excellent quality, friendly atmosphere and excellent services.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just can't say enough about the treatment we received from everyone at the hotel. When the infamous one-day transit strike hit, Bernard helped our group of 8 secure a private car to get us to the two events we had planned for that day. I'm not sure what we would have done without him. (And that was just part of the daily treatment we received.) Everyone was so friendly & helpful and I would highly recommend this hotel. The rooms were very clean and the breakfast was fresh and delicous. Since I plan to visit Paris again, I will definitely stay there again. The location was fabulous (just a short walk to the Eiffel tour, Seine and all major transportation). Thanks for making an amazing trip just that much better!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a weekend break in Paris, staying at the Eiffel-Kennedy. We got a good deal through Expedia - approx. 530 euros for 3 nights including a great breakfast each morning. Our room was small (not too small) and had air-conditioning, mini bar and a good-sized bathroom. Despite not 'phoning in advance to check, we were able to check in early on the first day. The hotel is located in quite a quiet area near the Sienne about a 20 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. A few restaurants & small shops nearby, but if you want more nightlife then you would need to venture further into the city centre (using the excellent Metro). The hotel's main plus point for us was the extremely friendly and helpful staff.</p></li>

Mrs. D really bakes some wonderful french treats for the great breakfast buffet optional for fee or included. Wonderful neighborhood tho parking a car might be tedious - we used only public transport. Internet in lobby very handy too. Some interesting restaurants, ATM's and shopping all convenient.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a very good small hotel in the 16th arrondisment. The staff could not have been more friendly. The rooms of cpurse are small if you are basing your standards on North American hotels but spacious enough by European major cities. Spotlessly clean and a very comfortable bed. Probably would have given it 5 stars if the breakfast had have been more interesting. There are a variety of restaurants within a few blocks. The cafe next door is not the best of them from a quality and price point of view. Despite not being very central there is a bus stop almost outside the door and a Metro and PER station within a short walk. Currently about a 20 euro taxi ride from the Gare Du Nord. Well worth considering and we would happily return</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Eiffel-Kennedy Hotel for 3 nights via a Eurostar train-hotel package. The room was small, but clean and very nice, with a recently renovated bathroom that was a nice surprise. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our bed was a bit uncomfortable, since it sagged in the middle, and the pillows were hard and lumpy, but linens were clean and changed daily. It's important to note that the hotel is located in a quiet residential area, a bit far from the main tourist and more lively areas. However, the hotel is a less than 5-minute walk from an RER (train) station, and the particular train line that services this station goes along the Sienne River so it is very easy to get to the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, Louvre, etc.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Eiffel Kennedy for 7 nights at the end of December. Very clean, relatively quiet. Staff was very pleasant and friendly and spoke excellent English. Breakfast didn't have tremendous variety but was very tasty. WOW, the room was tiny, though. Being a reasonably priced hotel room in Paris, I expected a small room, but our room was so tiny that with two beds, two persons and two suitcases there was barely enough room to move. Also, the hotel was a little further out from the city center/Eiffel Tower than I expected. At a very fast pace it took a little over 20 minutes to walk to the Eiffel Tower. However, being that far from the tourist hub also means a quieter stay. And we loved the little cafe next to the hotel - we ate there three times!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was our 1st time in Paris and as everybody worned us we were expecting to find an old 3* hotel with small rooms. We were pleasently suprised by the staff who were very helpful in offering from the very beginning all the basic information we needed for treveling and visiting. And then we were again surprised to discover nice cozy rooms. Now I really believe that if they would have been bigger, they would miss a bit the existing charm. And is a must to be said: the rooms are extremely clean, which I consider counts a lot when returning after a long walking/visting day. We stayed for 10 days and every day the room was very well cleaned. As regards to the position: there are 3 metro, RER stations close to it, which makes it very simple to reach any destination.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for four nights in June. The location is in a safe area of Paris, away from the bustling crowds of the more "touristy" areas. It is near several transportation options, the River Seine, and the Eiffel Tower. Bernard, the owner, and Simone, a receptionist, spoke English very well and were very helpful with all our questions. The rooms were small (which I always expect in Paris), but they were extremely clean and had everything we needed. The wifi was spotty, but it mostly worked and was free. We didn't try the breakfast - I believe it was 10 euro. Our windows were sound proof, and we heard nothing even though we were 2nd floor with a window right on the front. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris, and I hope to stay again some day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent three nights at this lovely hotel and there were a number of things which stood out for me. Firstly, all the staff were incredibly friendly, even the night porters, and were happy to advise on ideas of things to do. The room was quite small, but bigger than some rooms I've had in Paris, and you don't get big rooms here really. The bed was incredibly comfortable - two single mattresses with a double duvet and sheets with nice soft pillows. The bathroom was immaculate and a good size. Breakfast was in the basement and for 10 euros I was surprised at the choice, with quiches, cakes, cold meats and cheeses, croissants, juice, cereal, etc. The location was a little out of the way, but the area itself is interesting, with a good Monet gallery just up the road.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this gem very last minute - the day of arrival. After an interesting experience at another Paris hotel (we checked out early) to arrive at the Eiffel Kennedy was heavenly! It's a smart, well situated and excellently run 3* hotel with much character. The lady who checked us in couldn't have been more helpful or welcoming - she even carried our 22kg suitcase up the stairs as the lift was out of use!! She was also very kind to our young daughter and gave her a mini Eiffel Tower. The rooms, although small are excellently arranged and furnished with everything you need and spotlessly clean. The Tower is a pleasant 15 min walk away and there are several Metro and RER stations close by. We would without a doubt stay here again and would highly recommend to others.</p></li>

The hotel had a fantastic postion for all the famous sites and the staff were extremly helpful in directing us to bus stops or metro stations. It was like staying with a family member, we were treated with respect at all times and felt so relaxed and at home. The breakfast was beautifully served. The room was clean and the food offered was fresh, with good a selection. I would definately stay here again and recomend it to any one travelling to Paris. Thank you for making our stay so comfortable and easy, as women travelling abroad can be daunting, however we thoroughly relaxed and loved every minute.</p></li>

The hotel is very close to 4 metro stations, we could reach Eiffel by walking just in 10 minutes and the staff have even welcomed us with their warm wishes for our marriage, they were all very friendly and helpful while we are searching for ways to reach many places. The rooms were smaller than i expected and then they were seen in pictures, but it did not surprised us so much, because most of Paris hotel rooms were mentioned as small during our previous searches and we were outside nearly all time! The rooms and the bathroom were clean. As a result, i can say that , for a next possible Paris holiday, we can choose Eiffel Kennedy again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Paris was a wonderful experience for a first-time visit to celebrate our 32nd wedding anniversary. We stayed one week starting September 16. We would have to attribute our great experience in part to the owners of this lovely family-owned hotel. Our itinerary was ambitious. We wanted to immerse ourselves in the local culture and visits to the amazing museums and other highlights of the city. We could do this because we were able to use the great transportation systems (bus, metro & RER). We could not use the systems without the help of the management. Bernard should have his own Office du Tourisme! I have to disagree with another traveler about the breakfast. We thought it was simply amazing every single morning. The baked goods were fabulous. We look forward to coming back, maybe for our 35th anniversary!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room for a couple is comfortable. Storage is adequate. Bathrooms are clean and the shower/tub/toilet was in good working condition. The relatively quiet a/c unit helped on a couple of warm days. The room was non-smoking but on a couple of occasions, cigarette smell crept in from other rooms -- not a major problem. The breakfast is good. The hotel is within walking distance to Eiffel tower and also 150 m from the Boulainvilliers station which connects to almost all Paris attractions (D'Orsay, Rodin, Louvre, Notre Dame, Concorde, Invalides, etc.) within 1/2 hour. In addition, there are a lot of cafes, restaurants close by and also an ATM machine right across from the hotel. The Wifi access was sporadic but you must take directions from the staff to connect to the modem on your floor. The hotel is reasonably priced.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked a 6 day stay at the Eiffel Kennedy Hotel for myself and two teenage children. I choose this hotel because of its location and the fact that I wanted my children to experience the charm of a smaller hotel nestled in a neighborhood. My hopes were surpassed in every respect. We stayed in a snug triple with windows that opened to flowering geraniums and a view of the Eiffel Tower. Even though we were in a neighborhood, it is but a short walk to excellent transportation. The hotel staff gave us wonderful directions and were very kind to my family. The neighborhood surrounding the hotel provided a feast for our picnics as we would stop at the bakery and fruit stand to purchase supplies for our many picnics. There is a lovely park steps away from the hotel that was a favorite retreat. In short, the Hotel Eiffel Kennedy is a treasure!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed in the Hotel Eiffel-Kennedy this March. We highly recommend the hotel. Our room was normal-sized for Paris. The room was well-designed to take full advantage of the space. Our room was over a busy street, but with the windows closed we rarely heard any noise from outside. The windows must be some kind of special triple-glazed windows designed to inhibit noise. We brought our laptop, and after putting in the hotel password, we were up 24/7 for the rest of our stay, with no interruptions. The breakfasts are the highlight. The food keeps coming, freshly baked and in a great variety. I was partial to the fresh plum tarts and the fresh pear tarts. The coffee they use is very tasty, and is a special blend available only to French restaurants. The staff was uniformly knowledgeable and pleasant, and gave us several good ideas for travel in the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a residential area but at the same time near the sightseeing places. The rooms were small but nicely decorated and comfortable - better than the other European 3 star hotels I stayed in. The bath was a bit small but then most single room ones are. My parents were in a double room which had a good size loo with a tub. The breakfast was awesome infact one of the things I loved about the place and the staff was unfailingly curtious, helpful and friendly. The hotel has a computer, in the lobby area, connected to the net which you can use free of charge which was a nice bonus. The metro is a few minutes away as is the taxis stand so transportation was never a problem. People, in general, were helpful - all we had to do was say hello in french and once they realized we were making an effort to communicate in their lingo they recipocated and helped us out :).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Super location in the 16th arr. --- 2 blocks from the Seine -- convenient to bus (scenic ride along the Seine to Hotel de Villle); nice neighborhood; lots of children going to school, etc. Hotel was fabulous. The staff was most helpful in recommending restaurants, transportation, near-by places to visit. The rooms are French-efficient. Hotel has free wi-fi in every room -- great for taking my laptop. Patrons are business people, families on vacation, singles, and retirees from all over: USA, Australia, New Zealand, France, Great Britian, etc. For us, the hotel was very accommodating when we needed an extra bed for a few days. The breakfast is one of the best I have ever had. In addition to the usual fare, the madame bakes various fruit tarts, quiches, breads. Wow!!! The evening/weekend staff and the maids were most polite and efficient. This is as close to a "Bed and Breakfast" as one can get!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">An owner operated hotel in Passy, far away from the crowds is a great choice if you want to be in a residential district with fewer tourists. Great location if you're a walker--4km romantic walk to the Louvres along the docks..the 72 bus is direct if you get tired and metro is very close by.. Rooms are small by N/A standards, if you want Vegas, you have to pay 3-4X the price of this hotel in Paris . If you book, ask for the rooms with windows in the bathroom,these rooms are 2 sq meters larger than the other ones and it makes a big difference. A big plus are new sound proof windows and great a/c. room cleaning is very good, beds are very comfortable. Very friendly staff including owners who work the breakfast anf front desk.t Affordable bistros ( for Paris) nearby, including a one star Michelin (ask the owner to reserve on your first day) My wife and I travel to Paris frequently.We will book there for our next time!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found the best value for money hotel in all of Paris! A very charming and unassuming hotel in a quiet neibourhood with all of the attractions Paris has to offer nearby. The staff were very freindly and extremely helpful (thanks heaps Bernard!) and nothing was too much trouble for them. Our check in was speedy and our rooms were very nice with a fabulous view of the Eiffel Tower! The rooms were a good size with nice furnishings and very clean. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows soft and fluffy. The bathroom was clean and a good size but the towels could've been a bit softer. Hotel Eiffel Kennedy is close to the metro, RER & bus lines and all easy to use. Jocelyn's breakfast was fantastic; a great selection of breakfast items and very filling and at 10 euro, a bargain. All in all, this is a great hotel and l would recomment it to everyone. It exceeded our expectations and we would gladly go there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My niece and I stayed here in September and it was perfect! I had booked this hotel because I wanted separate rooms for us. I booked a "suite" expecting a sitting room with a pullout sofa and a bedroom. Much to my surprise, it was so much better! We had a section of the hotel that was separated from the other rooms by a door we could lock. When we got into our section, there were two full bedrooms--each with its own bathroom. We each had our privacy yet we were together. This would be a perfect situation for a family who wanted kids in separate room but still away from other guest rooms. When we were in Paris, the weather was perfect. Slept with the windows wide open! (there are no mosquitoes in Paris) Had no problem with noise. Also loved the little restaurant around the corner where we had a nightcap each night. The staff was terrific and helped us with our sightseeing plans. I would highly recommend the Eiffel Kennedy!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel Eiffel Kennedy is located in an elegant, quiet, safe area of Paris, about 20 mins walk from the Eiffel tower. Excellent bus and RER/Metro links make it easy to get into and, just as importantly at the end of the day, out of the city centre. If you walk out of the hotel and turn right up the hill you will walk through some peaceful and typically Parisien streets - a lovely way to unwind after the hustle and bustle of the city. The hotel room we had was a bit small, although I believe this is normal for Paris, but it was spotless and very comfortable. The staff are all extremely helpful and friendly which is something that you certainly don't always experience in Paris! The hotel had its share of those ignorant, inconsiderate, uncivilised guests who bang doors and talk loudly while preparing for bed, but that is not the hotel's fault. Overall, this hotel is a very safe bet in a very unpredictable city. Recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a wonderful hotel. Clean! Very friendly and helpful. Simone was especially helpful. She provided us with maps, showed us step by step how to get to places, even circling the train/bus stops .Firenze is a local restaurant near the hotel, on Rue de Versailles, that has tasty food. My husband really enjoyed the salmon. Location has easy access to many train and bus routes. No need to waste money on cabs. The train system is easy to figure out. Especially if you come from a big city like New York. The Eiffel Tower is a short walk where it is easy to hop on a tour bus. The River Seine cruises are also by the Eiffel. You also past their Statue of Liberty along the walk. We took the Les Cars Rouge bus tour. Very fun. I also recommend going up to the top of Notre Dame. Stairs are a killer but the view is amazing. Take water. Great photo opportunities. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again. I LOVED PARIS.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I along with our 20 year old daugther stayed at this hotel on our way to visit family in Cyprus. We chose this hotel based on recommendations from trip advisor, and as usual member reviews were right on. The small family run hotel was indeed conveniently located to experience the sights of Paris. Mass transportation was very convenient. The neighborhood had ample services. The english speaking staff were very accomodating, helpful and friendly. Our rooms (we took two) were small (this is Paris after all) but were impeccably clean and nicely decorated. We enjoyed breakfast each day at the hotel. It was reasonably priced and had a nice variety of choices. The room rates were a good value for Paris. As a matter of fact, we stayed at the hotel twice, two nights on the way to and four nights on the way back from visiting family in Cyprus. My family and I felt the Eiffel Kennedy was indeed a great choice and a good value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hi All, We came to know of this hotel from Trip Advisor and booked it Online. The hotel, though small, was an excellent home away from home. It was worth spending the money. The people at the reception were really warm people and helped us in deciding and planning the trip/visits. They really made us feel comfortable. We stayed there from December 11 till December 13,(with wife and kid). The hotel was at 15 minutes walking distance from Eiffel Tower. Furthermore, it is very well connected to the main attractions of Paris. There is also an Indian Resturant nearby which offers vegetarian food as well. The breakfast offered at the hotel was also very good. Only downside is that they do not have a bell boy for assistance with luggage. Overall, it is one of the best hotels in 3 star category. I strongly recommend this place to all, who are planning to travel to Paris with family. Manish Kakkar New Delhi, India kakkar_manish@yahoo.co.in</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a honeymoon in August of 2010 and travelled throughout the France. First we stopped in Paris and spent 4 lovely nights in Eiffel Kennedy hotel. This is small, private hotel, which we would like to come back to again. The rooms are French-typically small, but very clean and convenient. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and sincere. Owner, whose name is Bernard, is a very nice man. He spent about 20 minutes on the phone to talk to local cell-phone company and select a Plan for me. Breakfasts are cooked locally by his wife, so we enjoyed home-made tasty cuisine and bakery. First we didn't realize the benefits of the location, but having spent only one night we've done! Hotel is in a quiet place, however very close to couple of metro (tube) stations, line of quick metro R (or however it is called in France) and in a walk distance from Tour Eiffel. If travelled to Paris again, I'd definitely come back to stop at Eiffel Kennedy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in this hotel while being on a business trip to Paris. The hotel was just perfect for the purpose of my trip. It was conveniently located close to the place of the meeting as well as to main tourist attractions. There are two RER stations and a metro station about 300m away from the hotel. Eiffel Kennedy is a small charming hotel in a nice area near Passy area and the Eiffel Tower. The rooms are quite good for Paris standards, much better than other hotels that you can get for a similar price in this area. The bathroom was spacious and recently renovated while the room furniture was a bit outdated. The breakfast was ample and delicious. While most of the hotels in Paris offer a very basic breakfast, Eiffel Kennedy offers a considerable variety of choices each one worth tasting. The hotel staff is very friendly and willing to assist with anything that you may need. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel for either business or as a base for exploring Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Reserved for two people for special birthday stay with view of Eiffel Tower. When we checked in we were given a very tiny single person room that smelled so badly of smoking that we could not even unpack. Small window faced alley wall 3 feet away with no sky visible and hardly any daylight. We were stunned. We immediatly requested another room (offering to pay more). The manager who claimed to be the "owner" refused to provide another room (no availability) and refused to cancel our reservation. When we refused to accept the room he threatened to call the police if we did not provide a physical credit card to pay for the room. We payed for the room and immediatly left to stay at another hotel. We are a nice couple that have stayed in Paris before and understand what is reasonalbe to expect from a moderately priced Paris hotel. This was an awful experience that felt like being mugged. Do yourself a favour and don't stay here. There are so many better choices for the same money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just got back from a short weekend break in Paris. We stayed in Eiffel Kennedy Hotel. When we arrived we got a very warm welcome and were shown to our room on the 2nd floor..The lift stopped and 2 steps later we were at the door. The hotel is tiny. The room was very small and spotless. We did not have a view of the Eiffel Tower unfortunately. The ensuite bathroom was very clean also. The walls were very thin and I could hear everything going on in the next room. I found it quiet noisy ,especially in the early mornings being so close to the lift. The hotel is 15-20 mins walk to the Eiffel Tower, which we enjoyed as we are avid walkers. The walk to the local metro station on Saturday night was tough though with high heels on. You do need to get the train to all other areas and proper footwear is essential as you do a lot of walking. The breakfast at the hotel was excellent, plenty of choice and you can eat all you want. All in all it was very quaint and friendly and the staff were fantastic. elliemay5</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in February 2010. My wife and I had one room and my 2 kids had the room next door. The hotel is really well placed; 15 minutes walk from the tower and close to some nice places to eat. The people in the hotel were very friendly, offering recommendations for restaurants and giving some advice on travel. The hotel is located just behind the Radio France building. This is a good landmark. It is also 2-3 minutes walk from the river the Statue of Liberty (The smaller, newer French one) Try and catch the number 72 bus. This takes you down a great route past the tower and down to the Louvre. One small concern is that they are building on the Radio France site. This is a bit noisy in the morning; we were on the top floor, so I would ask to be located there. We had rooms 427/428 and in 428 there is a view of the tower. These rooms are also next to each other and great for putting the kids next door. The rooms are small but very nicely decorated. Overall, we really enjoyed staying at this hotel and would have no hesitation in staying there again and recommending the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From minute one the Eiffel Kennedy people were friendly and acommodating (no pun intended). They ensured that we were looked after at the end of 26 hours travelling, preparing our room ahead of the usual check-in time so that we could rest if we wanted to. They could not do enough for us. Breakfast was a highlight of each day with a range of fresh baguette, quiche, cakes and omelettes with STRONG coffee, all served in a beautifully decorated cellar area. The room was small, as we expected, but was comfortable, having everything we needed to rest : and to recover from our extensive periods of sighseeing. The location was ideal. A short walk to the Eiffel Tower (seen from our window) in one direction and the Boulainvilliers Metro station a short walk in the other. All of Paris is very accessible from here. In fact, almost all of the most obvious sights of Paris are within good walking distance of the hotel. Slightly further up the road from the station is a market street, offering the best of prepared food and fresh. The fruit was great! We recommend this hotel highly, and will definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked a triple room because we were travelling with our teenage daughter. The central location was very good - a short walk to the river Seine, about 15 minute walk to Eiffel Tower, and a shopping centre about 10 minutes walk away. The buffet breakfast was very nice, including french cakes! The reception staff spoke English, and the Manager was friendly and helpful. The hotel was very clean. There was free use of a laptop and the internet. Our room was extremely small for three people - there were three single beds pushed together with very little space around the sides. The beds and pillows were not very comfortable - the worst on our one month Europe trip. They need new ones! The thing I disliked most though was that the room was very stuffy and smelled of stale cigarette smoke. The walls were covered in fabric, not wallpaper, and it seemed to have absorbed the smell of previous smoker occupants. I asked for a non-smoking room, but from what I gathered there is no such thing. Perhaps some rooms smelled better than ours though if they had not recently been occupied by a smoker? But overall we enjoyed our stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Out stay at the Eiffel Kennedy was very enjoyable and we would not hesitate to book a room again on our next visit to Paris. We found the hotel location to be in a nice area of the city, not too busy and yet not far from the city's major attractions. The location was very convenient to bus, train, and metro as well. We found excellent restaurants, shops, a farmer's market, and cash machines close by the hotel. The rooms were European in size, nicely appointed and quite clean. We enjoyed being close to the city without the noise found in many other close-in hotels. The hotel is owned an operated by a local family and they do an exceptional job of taking care of their guests. Any information required or recommendations we sought were quickly satisfied by the knowledgable staff at the front desk. Overall, the staff were very effective and pleasant. Another highlight for the hotel is the breakfast prepared and served under the direction of the owner's wife. The breakfast buffet had a variety of delightful dishes and was well worth the additional cost of 10 euros. Thank you Bernard for the great experience during our stay!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived in Paris on Bastille Day and the celebrations were fantastic. We arrived at the Hotel a little early and Bernard gave us a wonderful welcome and we asked him where we could have lunch and he recommended the Cafe La Fontaine which was excellent. When we returned to the hotel our room was ready with a beautiful view of the Eiffel Tower and our bags were already in the room. A lovely gesture! Our room was excellent, with excellent soundproofing, air-conditioning, and a lovely bathroom. It was also extremely pleasant that our bedlinen was changed each day with new towels fantastic!!!! Bernard and Simone are absolutely lovely and even helped us develop our poor French and were very patient with our attempts. Nothing is a problem to them and they are wonderful hosts. We really enjoyed the area as we were near to all the sights and we used the no 72 bus which runs right along the Seine and was recommended by Bernard. We also explored the area and found some nice shops on Avenue de Mozart with some lovely cafes and great Croque Monsieur! Two nights was not long enough and we have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as we will certainly return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was extremely happy with our choice of the HEK. The room was not teeny tiny, the bathroom was really clean with great hot water and shower pressure. The beds were comfortable. The location was great, i would definitely stay in this area of paris again. The staff was SUPER friendly and helpful, they could answer all of our questions, with great recommendations for hotels. The only issues i had were: if it were summer it would have been very noisy - with the window open it was noisy, and there is a construction project going on next door that started up around 7 am. with the window closed it was fine, but the weather was cool, so it was fine. The wifi was great when it worked, but there were two nights out of the five that it just didnt work and the guy at the desk didn't know what to do, or didn't try to reset it or anything. My friend who had an adjoining room said that her neighbors were quite "noisy" in the night, and she could hear it all, but i didn't find that. My room was 426 and i didn't hear any of my neighbors. the breakfast was good, and reasonably priced. and the brasserie right downstairs was awesome! good salads and wine and very convenient.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We took our chances and booked our stay here through British Air when we bought the plane tickets. Yes the room was tiny, but the beds were comfortable and the bathroom big and clean. The staff could not have been nicer or more helpful. And the breakfast was completely amazing! Fabulous coffee (such a treat after a week of awful coffee in London), an incredible array of pastries, croissants, baguettes, cakes, tarts, fruit, yogurt, cereal... And all homemade and everything delicious. For extra cost you could order eggs or an omlette, but we were very pleased with everything that was included. The location is away from the main sites, but in a neighborhood with a very homey, friendly feel to it. Lots of people walking dogs, lots of people with kids, etc. When we had dinner nearby, we were the only Americans each time, and that was great, we felt we really got a taste of the local scene. Great shopping is nearby. There's a bank machine right across the street, as well as a great bakery and nice convenience store. Bus #72 is a few blocks and the 20 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower is on a pedestrian walkway in the middle of the Seine, it's fabulous! Can't recommend this hotel enough.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked a triple room here for a long weekend in May. We arrived in from the eurostar and took the metro. The hotel is about a 5-7 min walk from the metro station through pleasant residential streets. The location was quite convenient, with a great bus route that passes through many tourist spots. Our checkin with the concierge went very smoothly. The front desk was so friendly and helpful with tips and advice. We followed their advice for dinner recommendation one night and it was great! The hotel is about a 20min walk to the Eiffel tower, very lovely stroll during good weather. The room itself was too small, the triple beds fit side by side to become one big bed. That was not comfortable. There was hardly any room for 3 people to put their luggage in the room. Also sharing the one key between 3 ppl created some hassle even though the key was to be left at the front desk when leaving so it wasn't too much of a bother. Having keycard entry may have been more convenient. The bathroom itself was very large and there was a flat screen tv mounted on the wall. Overall, would recommend this hotel for the price and location, though for triple room it is definitely on the small side, even for european standards.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Parisians are known to be less than cordial to Americans. Not so at this hotel! The front desk staff spoke English willingly, and went out of their way to give us directions and little tips on touring. They even have various tourist books (Frommer's, etc) in the lobby for people to use! We arrived early in the morning, having taken an overnight train. Our room was ready and we were able to check in! The room was clean and comfortable. Since we were traveling with our daughter, we booked a triple, which was a room with three twin beds. There is a coffee shop next door, a bakery across the street, and a market with plenty of fresh fruit about 1/2 block away. The room had a mini-bar with a little extra room in the refrigerator, so we were able to store fruit there. My husband ate the hotel breakfast each day at a cost of $10 EU, but my daughter and I preferred to shop the neighborhood stores and ate much cheaper. The location is a good - about a three block walk to the subway and RER train station. The number 72 bus stops about 2 blocks away. That bus goes right past the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre. You can find newer hotels and fancier hotels, but if you want great service and good value for your money, the Hotel Eiffel Kennedy has it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Eiffel Kennedy is a little gem! It is off the well-known tourist path and is all the better for it. The area around the hotel is mainly made up of apartment buildings - some of which look quite expensive! There are small supermarkets, a boulangerie, a wine shop and plenty of cafes and bars within a two minute stroll. For a special night out try 'Restaurant Chaumette'. Beautiful food and fine wine. There is a bar/cafe beneath the hotel which is open until late. The hotel itself is small, as are the rooms, but beautifully kept and with friendly staff. The Bois de Boulogne and the Eiffel Tower are a pleasant 30 minute stroll away and the Allee des Cygnes (a narrow island in the middle of the Seine) is a very pleasant way to walk to the Eiffel Tower. The nearest Metro is Ranelagh (about 10 minutes away) and the RER line to Versailles (Javel station) is around 15 minutes walk. The breakfast room is in the basement and, as it is small, there can be a queue at times. However, Madame makes most of the breakfast fare herself and it is both plentiful and delicious. There is free internet access in the lobby and the reception staff (who all speak English) can book numerous excursions, etc. from the front desk. The Eiffel Kennedy is well worth considering for a real taste of France.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My dad and I stayed in this hotel for four nights in the middle of July. It was simply perfect. The room was clean and air conditioned, but also had a great window that swung open to reveal a view of our cute neighborhood in the 16th Ardt. The staff was super helpful--they could give us recommendations on everything, from what to do to where to buy chocolate (the man at the front desk recommended a shop that his family has been shopping at for 50 years!) They also gave us tips on how to use the super convenient 72 bus line (it runs along the left bank of the Seine past all of the major sites and is less than 5 minutes from the hotel) and the subway. They even had power converters that they let us borrow so we could charge our cameras and cell phones! There was free and fast wireless in the room which allowed me to use Skype to call home to the States and to check my email. And did I mention the breakfast that was included in our room rate? It was fantastic! A full spread of fresh pastries, croissant, tarts, boiled eggs, fruit, cereal and yogurt each morning. And they would make omelettes and hot chocolate on request. All in all, this is one of the best hotels i've ever stayed at in Europe. I would recommend it to anyone, and I will definitely stay there again on my next visit to the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in Hotel Eiffel Kennedy for 2 nights on 19th Sep and 20th Sep. The hotel is nicely located and is pretty close to both the bus stands, RER station and Metro station. The hotel seems to be pretty old but has been kept clean. I stayed in Room 425 (corner room). The room was too small for my liking but it was OK since I was only there for sleeping over. The toilet and shower room were small and movement inside was pretty limited. The breakfast was just OK. Nothing hot was available except the toast bread and tea. The gentleman at the reception (Bernard and one Indian person) were very good but one lady and another one old person were not too forthcoming. In fact I was wrongly guided by the lady once when asked about directions to Notre dame. I took the bus from the other side and went half way in the wrong direction. The older person also was promoting the Yellow Van taxi service and discouraged me from taking the RER to the airport. He was unable to get me a booking for the taxi service and then I had to take the RER which was pretty ok. However, all travellers who wish to take the RER would need to carry their baggages up and down the stations. Overall the hotel stay was fine. I didn't think it was value for money for 130 EUR per night with breakfast but I guess Paris is like that only.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I regularly visit Paris and have found myself in some pokey and over-priced hotels. This is not one of them. The room price was reasonable adn the location good, though not very central. Metro, RER and good shopping and restaurants are within 5-10 minute's walk. There are basic facilities very close to the hotel. My room was small - you learn to expect this in European city hotels - but adequate. A comfortable 3/4 size bed (which may have been a squeeze for a couple, but was fine for a lone traveller), compact wardrobe, newly fitted bathroom with shower, excellend double glazed windows that shut out all street noise, good TV, good desk space, power points, lights and nice furnishings. I was impressed with how efficinetly they had used space to create a comfortable room. Heating was great - if anything the room was too warm. Free fast internet is provided. Reception was efficient checking in and out, adn staff were always very friendly and spoke good English. The breakfast room is in the cellar. Breakfast includes a great selection of home made quiche, omelettes, cakes and pies that are pretty irresistable, as well as fruit, pastries, bread etc. I was happy the hotel was close to the River where I ran each morning! I likes the Eiffer-Kennedy enought to go back another time, in favour of the standards or tatty cheap hotels.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you want a neighborhood hotel and experience the charm of Paris, this is the hotel for you. The location is good with cafes and bakeries around. You can get to the Eiffel tower by walking in about 15-20 minutes on a nice walk along the Seine river. From there you can walk to the Invalides for another 15 minutes. The walk is worth it. If you don't like walking, there is a bus line that goes along the River all they to the Louvres. The bus station is close to the hotel. You can also find a subway station a few blocks away from the hotel. The room are small as expected in an old building. The elevator is small as well. The owner/staff was super friendly and useful. He setup the hotel with a WIFI station at every floor, so the Wifi quality was the best we found during our 3 weeks trip in Europe. It was free as well. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel as we wanted to go to local cafes instead. Don't drive in Paris; it's not worth it. The bus/subway system is very good and parking spaces are hard to find. The only drawback at the time was that the hotel is next to Radio France building, which was experiencing some renovation. So the front of the hotel was in front of a construction field. IT was not a problem at all since they stop working quite early. I definitely recommend this hotel if you want to experience the typical Paris feel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Myself and my wife stayed at this hotel from 13th July and were there for bastille night 14th July (spectacular time to be in Paris - but extremely busy!). The room was small but we were expecting this due to the previous reviews on tripadvisor and reviews of most hotels in Paris. It was probably all the size you would need if you aren't planning on staying in your room all day - which we definatley weren't! The guy who works on reception at night is a right pain - he was disinterested and didn't want to be talked to too much. However the day staff (i think its the owner and his wife) were fantastic. They were very willing to help and non-critical of my poor french (lol) and spoke in English if we prefered. The breakfast was nice (not too much variety but nice all the same). The restaraunt on the corner beside us had a great view of the eiffel tower from outside however being a vegetarian I found I was able to eat nothing there - and they didnt vary the menu at all while we were there. Found a fantastic veggie restaraunt on the web (La Victoire, Suprême du Coeur) but it was quite a bit away so we got a taxi - but I highly recomend the happy jose burger - amazing!) All in all a good base to visit paris from with a choice of two metro stations (one up the hill and one down the hill). Room was very clean and tidy and noise levels were minimal.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great stay & near Ranelagh metro station”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My mom and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and thought it was great. The staff speak wonderful English, so if you're worried about how to get directions -- or just worried about language in general -- you won't have any problems at all staying at the Hotel Eiffel Kennedy. The hotel is a nice walk from the Ranelagh metro stop, so if you don't want to have to transfer using the nearest RER line, you only have to walk up Rue L'Assumption, which isn't a bad stroll. I'd say it takes about 10 minutes, depending on how quickly you choose to get there. One tip: When first arriving and exiting Ranelagh station, regardless of the side of the street you emerge from, you'll want to simply turn around and walk towards the way your back was facing as you exited the stairs of the station. You'll quickly hit Rue L'Assumption, and simply make a left. Walk to the bottom of the slightly inclined 'hill' and you're there. Yes, the rooms are small, but that's Europe. And quite honestly, how often are you in the room anyway? You'll be out seeing the sights. Bernard is wonderful and so is the night staff and Simone. They go out of their way to help you, and they were quick to inform us of strikes on the RER line that might interrupt our plans to travel to Versailles -- or any other destination. It would be nice if the hotel were closer to the metro, but all in all, it served as a great spot to stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We took the RER and metro from the airport and found it surprisingly easy. You need RER line B to gare du nord and its well signposted. On arrival at Ranelagh, the nearest metro to the hotel we asked at the information desk and the attendant explained the way to the hotel. It's only a 5 minute walk. We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights in late august and it was very quiet. We only encountered 2 other guests, once, in the reception area. After reading reviews and after prior experience in Paris we expected the rooms to be very small, however ours was good in size in comparison to others we have stayed in. The bathroom was very clean and well equiped. The staff were all very friendly and happy to help with any queries. We stayed on a room only basis although the breakfast did look very good. The location of the hotel, for us could not be any better. We enjoyed the brief walk down to the eiffel tower, which took about 25-30 minutes. There aren't many restaurants near the hotel as the area is residential, however, as mentioned the nearest metro is only a brief walk away and the latin quarter is a short journey. There you will find lots to choose from. There are also a few near the eiffel tower. Other attractions such as the Louvre, Arc de Triomphe and Montmartre area are also only a few stops away. Overall, we enjoyed our experience of Paris and would definetly recomand this hotel to others.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of 4 arrived in Paris for a 4 night stay after staying in a cramped room in London for a week. We were so pleasantly surprised! The owner greeted us at the desk by name before we even introduced ourselves! Guess we looked like the "American family of 4". We were given 2 adjoining rooms down a small hallway with its own locked door so we felt very secure allowing our 13 and 15 yr olds to stay in their own room. View of top half of Eiffel Tower. Desk staff very helpful in giving us subway and bus route advice. Close to small grocery stores, lots of restaurants, a great bakery. 5 minute walk from the original Statue of Liberty (smaller than I thought). Maybe a 30 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower- we hopped on the bus. The only thing I didn't like about our room was the handheld shower in the bathroom. Our wall attachment was missing (our girls had one) so you really do have to hold the shower head (hard to wash hair). Not a huge deal. Nice sized bathroom. Must shut the windows at night to drown out the significant city noise. We did this and put the air conditioner on and slept fine. We ate at 4-5 restaurants all within 1-2 blocks and liked them all EXCEPT the one attached to the hotel (no connection). Ate the 10 Euro per person hotel breakfast a couple of times downstairs but none of my family eats enough to justify the price. Went accross the street to the bakery and store and fed entire family for less than 10 Euro. Food and beverages expensive in Paris. Always ask for tap water in restaurants or you will pay big bucks for bottled water. A Coke costs 4-6 Euro! Free wireless internet throughout the hotel also a plus.</p></li>

<li>Maybe a 30 minute walk from the Eiffel Tower- we hopped on the bus.</br></br></li>
<li>The only thing I didn't like about our room was the handheld shower in the bathroom.</br></br></li>
<li>Our wall attachment was missing (our girls had one) so you really do have to hold the shower head (hard to wash hair).</br></br></li>
<li>Not a huge deal.</br></br></li>
<li><span style="background-color:#e6194b" title="p=0.998">Nice sized</span> <span style="background-color:#e6194b" title="p=0.998">bathroom</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>Must shut the windows at night to drown out the <span style="background-color:#A00000" title="p=0.999">significant</span> <span style="background-color:#A00000" title="p=0.999">city noise</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>We did this and put the air conditioner on and slept fine.</br></br></li>
<li>We ate at 4-5 restaurants all within 1-2 blocks and liked them all EXCEPT the one attached to the hotel (no connection).</br></br></li>
<li>Ate the 10 Euro per person hotel breakfast a couple of times downstairs but none of my family eats enough to justify the price.</br></br></li>
<li>Went accross the street to the bakery and store and fed entire family for less than 10 Euro.</br></br></li>
<li><span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">Food</span> and beverages <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">expensive</span> in Paris.</li>

<li>Always ask for tap water in restaurants or you will pay big bucks for bottled water.</br></br></li>
<li>A Coke costs 4-6 Euro!</br></br></li>
<li><span style="background-color:#d0d0d0" title="p=0.999">Free wireless</span> <span style="background-color:#d0d0d0" title="p=0.999">internet</span> throughout the hotel also a plus.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I found the Eiffel-Kennedy listed on Booking.com while I was searching for a hotel in Paris. The plan was to find a clean and relatively central place to stay with my parents. All I was interested in getting was a fairly spacious triple room with a bathroom and an uncomplicated path towards the most important Paris amenities. When I looked at the Eiffel-Kennedy website I had a careful look at each room and, comparing the reviews, it seemed to offer good value for money. Moreover, the people who did their reviews seemed to be enthusiastic about it. I had a bad surprise when, in entering the room I found that it had nothing to do with any of the pictures posted on the website. The room wasn't even a triple: a very small bed with wheels was added in an already tiny space. On top of it, the noises coming from the pipes/toilets flushing (without even counting the noise coming from the adjacent rooms) was at times unbearable. The room rate per night was €179.00 with a night discounted to €149.00... What really got me though -and my review on Booking.com has been truncated at that point- is that a small pack of crisps and peanuts was placed in a basket along with four clean, empty glasses -I thought- as a welcome gesture. I took it as such because there was no indication of the contrary (there was no minibar at all in the room nor any tag/menu brochure with prices). It turns out that, at the end of our stay, I got charged over €20 for something I did not request. Moreover, Monoprix was so close by that I could have bought something like that for a quarter of this ludicrous charge. I thought it was just so petty, compared to what I have experienced in other hotels. Oh, and a 3 star hotel? It would be useful to know who has given away such a rating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The 1st think which I should be mentioning is about Bernard. He is always helpful and eager to help. We had some problem in reaching the hotel as we took the RER B trains from CDG2 airport and got down at St Michaels but we could not eventually change at St Micheals and had to take a taxi from there and end up paying 20 Euro. However once we reached the hotel it was a nice soothing experience. The lady who was at the reception helped us in checkin and we could do all the formalities in exactly 3 minutes. I forgot the name of the lady at the reception, but she was quite prompt. The best part is that she spoke to us in english. Our room was small but nice. We could see the Eiffel tower from our room. And it looked beautiful when the lightes on the Eiffel Tower was lit in the evening. The bath was spacious and adequately filled. Next day morning we met Bernard and he was very nice and explained us [in details] what and how we should roam in paris. Even to the extent that he came out of the hotel to show us the street we should take to reach the Eiffel Tower.... Bernard you rock !!!! Breakfast - another attraction of the hotel.... fully spread breakfast with lot of options of bread, homemade cakes and pastries and we were also offered hot boiled egg.... we were really surprised... Thank you Jociline..... Shekhar, the gentleman who stays at the reception after 8, is from India and was equally helpful in booking the airport pickup for us. The hotel is very conveniently located.... 15-20 minutes walk to the Eiffel Tower, and on the way you could see the Statue of Liberty [specially made for Paris] as well....... Bernanrd call us at 4 o'clock in the morning to say goodbye, which was quite unexpected and we will remember him for this gracious attitude. We will definitely stay at Eiffel Kennedy next time we visit Paris....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On arrival at the hotel our first impression - very tastefully decorated and well maintained premises. That impression stayed with us for all areas we used - from the exterior, reception, stairs, bedrooms, breakfasting area. In addition, from the word go through to our departure we received a friendly, helpful service from Bernard and his colleagues/staff at Reception and from the girls serving le petit dejeuner. Le petit dejeuner, which we opted for every morning offered a healthy variety and good value for money at 10 euros per person (at time of visit because there was three of us sharing a room which included our teenage son, we benefitted from an offer 3 breakfasts for the price of two). It was also a bonus when Bernard advised us on arrival, that a triple room was available to us for nights 3 and 4. At time of booking, only available accommodation for 4 nights was a double room with an extra bed ( 2 adults and our son) which didn't pose a problem for us as we considered it purely a base to return to after a day of sightseeing but must say we were very grateful for the extra space. The hotel is at busy junction but effective double glazing shuts out traffic noise. Excellent air conditioning to counteract the effects of hot, balmy summer nights! Transport links to/from hotel to Paris are excellent - a five minute walk to the nearest Metro station and 2 minute walk to bus stop for the regular number 72 service which is a 10/15 mins bus ride to city centre passing landmarks including the Eiffel Tower, Place de la Concorde, Tuilieres Jardins. The Eiffel Tower is a comfortable 20 minute walk from the hotel. As a family we are great walkers so for 3 out of the 4 days of our stay we chose to walk the 40 minutes each way it took to get to the Champs Elysee and back. There are several brasseries/restaurants in the vicinity of the hotel - we had a delicious meal and good service at the nearby Chinese restaurant on the first evening and twice at Fiorentinis.</p></li>
