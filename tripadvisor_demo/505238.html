The Princess Hotel is located at the end of the Diagonal, just next to the Diagonal Mar shopping center (Fnac, Media Markt, Zara, Mango, Vips, Cortefields...) ; the best in barcelona! Rooms are not very big but the view makes up for it! There is a roof top swimming pool with a superb view over the sea!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great modern hotel This is a great hotel. Very modern decor, great views, nice rooms. It's out of town, but Barcelona has excellent public transport so it really is not a problem. There are some decent places to eat on the plaza behind the shopping mall. I've stayed there twice and would definitely recommend. Very good value for Barcelona.</p></li>

Lie in bed and flcik those motorised blinds to reveal all of Barcelona. Swim on the roof - wow! Cold? Then jacuzzi and sauna. Helpful staff, great bar, good shopping and easy links to the centre. What a place - look out for Steve the taxi driver - he charges nothing and takes you for a drink. We found even better places than Bar Boobie in London.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wow We stayed at the Barcelona Princess about 1 year and a half ago and were so impressed. For the price we paid, we couldn't believe how nice it was. We were pretty tired from traveling by train for a whole day upon our arrival. The bed was amazing! Blackout shades made the room so quiet and dark - best sleep I've ever had in my life. And the hotel was just beautiful. Everything was so clean and modern. Service was impeccable. I highly recommend this place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel A fantastic modern hotel. Not in the centre of Barcelona but does have a shopping centre and restaurants next to it. We stayed on the 26th floor so the views were fantastic and you can see the major tourist sites and the sea. About 5 mins from the beach. Staff were friendly. Free minibar but limited drinks (one beer, one coke, one lemonade and two bottles of sparkling water.) Breakfast is not included and quite expensive - There are lots of restaurants and cafes around the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Absolutely Gorgeous Hotel! We have just returned from the Barcelona Princess Hotel. The hotel is incredible and their services were magnificent. It was so hot and busy there, we couldn't wait to get back to the peace and air-conditioning of the hotel. The two pools are extremely small for such a big hotel, but the views from those floors are so unbelievable, that you actually forget about the size of the pool.Overall I would say that, for a fussy person like myself this was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in on.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great views Good welcome, spotted it was my birthday the following week and upgraded us to a 19th floor Junior Suite. Room had sea view, very restful - and workspace had city view. Free internet great, free minibar, robes, slippers all nice touches. With metro five minutes walk getting to city was straightforward; pity we weren't there in summer when tourist bus comes to the door. We got breakfast included in our deal, which meant it was good value! Only disappointment was that we came down with terrible colds - but that wasn't the fault of the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">loved it! This is a really nice hotel and perfect for exploring Barcelona. It is so easy to get around - the tourist bus stops right outside, tube line 2 min walk away which takes you directly to the best nightlife, restaurants, bars etc). I found the staff to be very helpful and the rooms clean and well equipped. It is attached to a brilliant shopping centre too if you like a bit of retail therapy! I got it at a great price, including breakfast which was well worth the trouble to find! Loved the pool and views! Cant fault it, would definately go back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Service? What Service This is a four star hotel with completely indifferent service. It is well below the 'Spanish' norm. We stayed for 3 nights for a conference. We were ignored or told incorrect information regularly. High point was getting a view of the Med lying in the bath! Breakfast at Eur17 is outrageous and does not make up for the free room bar. The 'razors edge' pool is exciting and the basic design is interesting although standard of finish is variable. Really surprised that other views here are positive at this category level. Don't go for the beach, its concrete!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ultra modern and very nice Stayed for two nights and each day took the no.41 bus to and from the city center. Interesting to travel with the local people. Check in was fast and the staff are friendly and superb in every way. Using the free internet on the floor above reception I was having problems finding how to put the @ on an E mail and one of the staff took the time to come upstairs to show me. The room was spotless and everything worked but we really did not like the openness of the bathroom...picky us! Overall we enjoyed our stay and also the shopping and eating in the mall next door.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fab hotel Absolutly loved this hotel. Rooms were a decent size with nice clean bathrooms. The pool was clean, i cant say the same about the jacuzzi though!We were on the 22nd floor which gave aus a fantastic view. I would suggest asking for a room on the higher floors (although it does take a while for the lifts to get to you!!!). The hotel is a few miles out of the city, there is a train station only a few meters away. Also you can catch the tourist bus from outside the hotel (look out for the green bus stop, as you walk out turn right then right again).Overall a great hotel and i would stay again.</p></li>

Superb breakfast selection.If only British hotels could match this price and service!!You can always find little faults if you want to, but, the main thing is that this is a great hotel and for value for money you will not beat it.Barcelona rates as one of the best cities ever visited, couldn't do it all and will have to go back.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Too far from La Rambla and main action This is a very nice hotel and a good bargain at 100E a night. It is next door to a large shopping mall with places for breakfast. The rooms are very modern and the staff friendly and helpful. We thought the Barcelona Tourist Hopon, Hopoff bus went by the hotel but found out this is only in the summer and we had to take a tram and metro to get to the Tourist Bus stop which was okay but took time out from sightseeing. If you have a week or more and can't find a bargain like this closer, I would stay here but not for 2 nights post cruise like we did. I'd find something closer to La Rambla or the tourist attractions.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Feel like a princess! We had a very happy few days here on a brillant Expedia deal, where the room worked out at about 拢50 per night. Our two rooms on the 21st floor were perfect with everything we needed to feel pampered-we were 2 mums and 2 teenage daughters on a girlie mini break. Took breakfast in the Diagonal Mar shopping centre next door, then caught the nearby metro or tram to the sights of the city centre and the Olympic Port. Very helpful hotel staff gave us directions and reserved restaurants for us. Recommend eating at Espai Sucre on Princesa street in the Born district: not cheap but food and ambience are wonderful-every course is a desert!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fab hotel at a great price I researched many hotels in Barcelona and landed on this one after reading multiple reviews and visiting the website. It turns out I made a great decision. A truly modern hotel with excellent amenities: free internet cable, free beverages in the mini fridge and an excellent breakfast buffet. It was a little outside of the city center but very close to the Maresme metro stop and a quick walk to the beaches. The only downside was the limited number of chaise lounges by the pool, but the rest of the hotel more than made up for it. For the price we paid and the quality of the hotel I would 100% stay here on my next visit to Barcelona</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent views! I stayed at this hotel in July for a (this is embarrassing) hen party. It was an excellent hotel, make sure you get a room with a city view, mine was 24 floors up with an amazing view of the whole of Barcelona from the Sagrada to Monjuic!!The pools are both pretty tiny, but great for an afternoon cool down, there is also a sauna and a spa pool with a bar that serves excellent spanish beer.It's a little far out of the centre, so if you want to be part of the Barcelona life, and don't mind paying slightly more, I would recommend a place in the Bari Gotic. But over all, nice hotel, good service, just in a slightly souless, built-up modern part of the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">excellent hotel Hotel was excellent in every way.Very clean, very new, spectacular use of glass thoughout the hotel. Fantastic views from the bedroom. Good pools, bars etc.Free room safe and free mini-bar, re stocked each day.Excellent price of expediaLocation good. Near an excellent shopping centre with good places to eat, near the beach. An easy 5 minute walk to the metro and 10 minute ride to Jaume 1 which is close to Barca Cathredal and gothic quarter, then through the gothic quarter you can walk quite easy to the rambals. (get a T10 metro ticket, 10 journeys for E6.90. you can use this on the Metro, and the bus.If back in Barca I would have no problem staying again</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic Hotel !! Have just returned from the Barcelona Princess, a hotel chosen because of the reviews I had read on Tripadvisor. The hotel is fantastic, staff are so friendly, the rooms stunning and it was everything you could hope for. The location is not a problem, getting into town is easy on the metro, and only 8 euros to come back late at night from the Olympic Port. The shopping centre and quick walk to the beach is also a bonus. It was my first visit to Barcelona, and i fully intend to return. I would definately stay at the princess again. Not sure about negative comments on here.. internet access was quick and free, check in was also quick and our room was fantastic (26th Floor!)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic Hotel I loved this hotel! One of the best Ive stayed in. Its a little far from the centre, but theres a metro stop right outside the front door, and 20 minutes takes you into the city.I choose this one because we were going to a show which was very near it. The receptionist was very friendly at check-in and gave us extras time to check out the next day because we had a later flight.The room was impeccable, very modern, everything clean, and the views were spectacular from the 11th floor. Then there was the two swimming pools, albeit quite small, the rooftop jacuzzi and the fitness suite. And the breakfast was amazing; a gigantic buffet.I dont really have anything bad to say about this hotel really!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Too Far out for me I,m afraid This was my second stay in Barcelona and I was swayed towards the hotel as the reviews indicated that the location was not a reason not too stay. I have to say that this was not the case in my opinion. The hotel was so far out that it felt like staying on a housing estate. It lost all of the feeling that you get from staying in the Rambles and Port Olimpic which is one of the nicest spots on the beach was a 40 minute walk away. Dont be decieved by the comment that it is 300 metres from the beach as the beach up this end of town is uninhabited. That said the rooms are good and spacious and the views of the city are great. if you dont mind being out of the hub this still may be the hotel for you</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Views are fabulous. Hotel staff was helpful and polite. Enjoyed the complimentary minibar and the great bathroom shower. Bed was firm but comfortable. The blackout shades on the window and glass bathroom wall worked well. Even though the hotel isn't very close to the main tourist areas, we had no problem using the subway and tram to get around. When connecting to different lines in the subway, there are often many stairs involved so this may not work well for someone with limited mobility. Barcelona is beautiful, with lots of interesting architecture. We went through Casa Battlo and saw other Gaudi buildings. Also enjoyed going to the Olympic stadium and Spanish Village on Montjuic.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">fabulous hotel great hotel in a lovely quiet area. easy to reach by train and metro but takes about 1 hour - loads cheaper than a taxi though. We used the metro system a lot and found it to be very reliable, clean, cheap and safe. On checking in at the hotel, we had to leave 150 euros as a deposit as we don't have a credit card so be prepared before you go for that. Other than that couldn't fault the hotel or staff. Rooms are fantastic, pool gets a bit crowded so late afternoon we went for a 5 minute stroll to the promenade for a couple of hours - no beach, a wooden decked area, very safe, clean and cool with the sea breeze. Good shopping centre next door with plenty restaurants and shops. No complaints at all, can't wait to return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This relaxing hotel complements the city hustle and bustle I love this hotel! The location, while just a little far from the centre, was good. Close to the beach, and away from the noise of the city. Very close to the metro and tram too. Our room was very stylish with a very comfy bed. We were lucky to be high up and have a balcony so that we could enjoy the views across the city. The amount of glass walls and walkways was rather unnerving at first but I soon got used to it. Only 1 beer per couple in the mini-bar though. I loved the rooftop pool with the views out to sea.The breakfast was plentiful and varied. And the service was excellent.I think our trip to Barcelona would have been very different if we had not been in this hotel. I would definitely stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent Hotel My husband and I have just returned from Barcelona and we both agree that this hotel was great. We stayed for 7 nights and this was a perfect length of time to enjoy all that Barcelona offered. The rooms were extremely clean and very modem and the free minibar was a nice touch as there is a strict policy against bringing your own food / drink into the hotel (although a rucksack did come in useful!!). Th shopping centre beside the hotel is good and there are also plenty of places to eat out in. There is also a metro about 2 minutes from the hotel and a taxi to the Olympic Port is only about 6 euros. It is worthwhile taking the Tourist Bus which leaves from outside the hotel as it takes you all around Barcelona and you can on and off it as often as you like.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Check out the Shower! We stayed here some while ago and have been very remiss in writing a review for it. In essence, it was a joy! It was far enough out of the city to show more of Barcelona than we would otherwise have seen but close enough - a few minutes ride on the metro - to be in the midst of everything in no time. The food was nice though the room service was better, our room on the 24th floor had fabulous views and the most spectacular shower we have ever encountered! Just how many places for water to emerge can a girl manage at any one time? At the time, we assumed all the rooms had the same sort of facilities but, having read some of the reviews, clearly not! All I can say is that the hotel gods were obviously smiling on us that day and for that, I thank them unreservedly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good basic hotel I travelled to this hotel with my wife and son to visit my parents who keep a boat in Barcelona. From the website the hotel looks very impressive.On arrival the check in staff were friendly and helpful. We stayed on the 19th floor and our room was clean but a little small and not child friendly at all. The hotel is ultra modern and has all electric blinds, sharp edges and glass everywhere, not great when you've got a 6 month old crawling round.To visit the pool you need to have a strong stomach to cross the glass bridge on the twenty something floor between the two blocks. The pools are dissapointing and very cold, although you have the benefit of splashing people on the pavement below.I would not rush to stay here again, it lacked warmth and charm but did the job none the less.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">An absolutely fantastic hotel! We have just returned from 4 nights at the Barcelona Princess Hotel. The hotel was fantastic! We had a room on the 17th floor and the view to the city was amazing! The block out blinds worked well to block the lights at night and the room had the best massage shower - I wanted to take it home with me!!The hotel is right next to the shopping centre, which made it easy for meals when we were too tired from sightseeing to go to the city.The staff were friendly and were there to help with any question that we had. They also recommended a flamenco show for us to see - a definate must when in Barcelona!We found the hotel central enough for our needs, as we didnt mind travelling the 15min on the metro to the city.Well Done Barcelona Princess! You made our holiday an enjoyable and unforgetable one!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic Hotel Couldn't find fault with the hotel. It isn't in the centre which may put some people off but it really shouldn't. The staff were incredibly friendly and always on hand to answer any questions. The room was larger than expected and the bed was extremely comfy.The tram stop is a 2 minute walk away from the hotel and there are regular buses to the centre too. We also took a taxi a couple of times which cost around 10 euros each way. The shopping centre next door provided us with something quick and easy to do while the rain poured down.The one problem we had was the rain, it would seem that the building didn't cope well, there were a few leaks from all of the glass. Staff were constantly making sure water was dried up so this didn't matter.I would definately recommend this hotel don't be put off by the location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Five Stars!!! Barcelona Princess is a really nice hotel for everyone who want to visit Barcelona. It is located near everything that is important for a tourist: bus stations, undergound stations, roads, a shopping centre, a large park and a wonderful beach. Furthermore, its accomodation is superbe. The rooms are really modern and spacious, the bar and the restaurants are confortable and serve good meals and there is also places for fun, such as big rooms, gymnasium and swimming pools. It is also necessary to mention the fact that the staff is very friendly, suportive and helpful. I had a medical accident there, and if it wasn't for them, I would have find trouble to solve it in an unknown city for me! Final recommendantion: book your stay to Princess Barcelona Hotel, because you will never find such a friendly and comportable hotel like this!</p></li>

I could watch from our window my husband swimming in the open-air pool on the 23rd floor. However, the bedrooms are a triumph of design over comfort - very designer-stylish but with only one uncomfortable chair, superb 3m. wide bed but with a large, square extra pillow that was too large and hard to use.....and if you require complete privacy in the bathroom, this hotel is not for you!Reception staff could have been more cooperative but when a booking mistake was pointed out changes were made immediately.Super cleanliness in bedroom and bathroom - everything provided in bathroom you could ever need or have forgotten, including toothbrush, bathrobes and slippers.About 20 minutes from city centre by frequent metro trains.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good choice for me! I stayed at the Princess this past week. I found it to have excellent service and fairly clean. The bed was comfortable and the temperature controls 鈥?both air conditioning and heat worked well. Having the refrigerator stocked with sodas and water at no charge was a nice plus. On cleanliness however, hair on the bathroom floor and shower from the previous guests is difficult for me to deal with, as well as the dirty shower curtain.The Princess is off the beaten path. However, the subway station is one block away 鈥?the L4 line. And the L4 line takes you to the Jaume I station, without transferring. Most of the sights are within walking distance of the Jaume I station.So, all in all, I highly recommend the Princess for a quiet vacation. Now, if you are a clubber, then you are better off staying closer to the action as there is very little to do in the hotel鈥檚 neighborhood.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Almost Perfect! I went to Barcelona Princess in January and it was absolutely amazing. From the moment I stepped into the hotel I was awestruck! It was fantastic! The staff on reception were generally very friendly, and if not friendly then still very helpful. The room was fabulous, breathtaking, I was very impressed and I would recommend a city view room as high up as possible. We were on the top floor (the 26th) and you get a great view. If you want to be right in the centre then it isn't but there is a very good metro all around the city and a tram service as well right outside. There is also a shopping centre right next door, the biggest is Catalunya I think. The only advice I have is do NOT order room service!!! We did for out first evening meal and it was miniscule and very pricey. However, the breakfast room service is huge and although also pricey it is very large. Overall a great stay!</p></li>

<li>I went to Barcelona Princess in January and it was absolutely amazing.</br></br></li>
<li>From the moment I stepped into the hotel I was awestruck!</br></br></li>
<li>It was fantastic!</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1">staff</span> on reception were generally <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1">very friendly</span>, and if not friendly then still very helpful.</li>
<li>The staff on <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1">reception</span> were generally <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1">very friendly</span>, and if not friendly then still very helpful.</br></br></li>
<li>The room was fabulous, breathtaking, I was very impressed and I would recommend a city view room as high up as possible.</br></br></li>
<li>We were on the top floor (the 26th) and you get a <span style="background-color:#808080">great</span> <span style="background-color:#808080">view</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>If you want to be right in the <span style="background-color:#008080">centre</span> then it isn't but there is a very good metro all around the city and a tram service as well <span style="background-color:#008080">right outside</span>.</li>

<li>There is also a shopping centre right next door, the biggest is Catalunya I think.</br></br></li>
<li>The only advice I have is <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1">do NOT order</span> <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1">room service</span>!!!</br></br></li>
<li>We did for out first evening meal and it was miniscule and very pricey.</br></br></li>
<li>However, the <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">breakfast room service</span> is <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">huge</span> and although also pricey it is very large.</br></br></li>
<li><span style="background-color:#fabebe">Overall a great</span> <span style="background-color:#fabebe">stay</span>!</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic place for a city break! I stayed in this hotel with my boyfriend for 3 nights at the end of a fortnight's holiday in Spain - and really loved it. Having visited barcelona before and been stuck in a souless hotel out by the airport, we had wanted to stay in the city centre but found prices too expensive. This hotel is a great compromise - it's just a short taxi/metro ride from the centre, and you get much more for your money than in a city centre hotel. It's a really chic modern building and the rooms are fantastic: spacious and equipped with all mod cons. We had an amazing view over the coast, which was only beaten by the view from the open-air pool which is virtually on the roof of the hotel! We didn't eat breakfast as it seemed quite pricey, but found plenty of places nearby instead. Overall - I'd definitely recommend this hotel - and will be back there whenever I'm next in Barcelona!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stylish hotel for New Year We stayed at this hotel with friends for New Year 2008 and had a great time. Upon checking in it did appear that they didn't have our rooms; however I think this was more down to Expedia's fault than the hotel's and was swiftly resolved by the multi-lingual check in staff.We stayed in a normal room and it was great - very clean, free mini-bar, views of the sea and a super king bed. There was no bath. but the shower was powerful with extra jets.The only bar open when we were there was the Corner bar on the ground floor - this was probably more to the time of year - it was nice and clean with friendly, helpful staff.If you're staying here for business then you probably can't do better. If you're staying for personal holiday, then it's very nice and I would recommend it. If you're after an intimate, cosy, boutique-style hotel, then this probably doesn't quite fit the bill.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic We have just returned from a 4 day break in Barcelona. it was our first visit and it certainly won't be the last. We had a view of the city to die for. The level of the rooms are fantastic, everything you could wish for, including a complimentary bar which was stocked each day. The room service was second to none. All staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful.All the facilities of the hotel were excellent, the swimming pools were clean, saunas, jacuzzi were just amazing. The bar prices were just like any other bar in the city.We visited a few of the most amazing buildings, Sagrada Familia, Nou Camp and the Olympic Stadium were just brilliant.Eating out was a joy, plenty of bars restaurants around the hotel andthen 5 minutes away your into Port Olympic were the nite life and restaurants were fantastic.If you are planning on a long weekend break then this is a must.....excellentSimon  Melanie</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Modern Barcelona We stayed in the Barcelona Princess for one night before departing on a cruise through southern Europe. The room was reasonably priced and very modern in style. After the long flight from New York, the BLACKOUT blinds in the room made our midmorning sleep refreshing. The room was smaller than a standard American room, but very comfortable. Hotel staff members seemed nice and helped to minimize the language barrier. My wife managed to flood the bathroom shower (in her defense the drain was slow) around midnight, but the hotel staff quickly responded to soak up our sixth floor Lake Victoria. The exercise facility was small and horribly appointed and the pools are tiny, but those amenities were not factored into our choice of hotel. We would definitely stay at the Barcelona Princess again in the same situation. If we were going to Barcelona to stay there for a week or two, we would stay somewhere else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">View to die for My husband and I stayed for 4 nights. I booked through 2 different companies 2 nights with each which worked out cheaper and didn't have to change rooms half way through which was good. B/fast was included for the first 2 but was pricey to pay for the second 2 at 16 Euros each, so didn't bother. Modern rooms with the most spectacular view of Barcelona, we stayed on 23rd floor and I would recommend to anyone to stay above say floor 15 to appreciate the view available. Shower in the room was fantastic after a long day sightseeing.We were quoted 45 Euros fr a taxi from the airport so caught airport bus to Catalunya Square - Euro 3.20 and then Metro to hotel (10 underground trips for Euro 6.30). Need to use the Metro to get into town but they are every 5mins or so, cheap and it only takes about 15mins. Worth the journey out of town to stay in a quality hotel like this, rather than a same priced lower standard hotel in the centre.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not too bad I was in this Hotel for only 2 nights at Christmas 2005. The room was small, kind of German style, black roof, electronic curtains, with the thickest matress I ever seen, big two beds together.I must recognize that the black, orange and wooden colours make this Hotel to be fancy, and the glass between the bathroom and the room is quite modern and original. Unfortunately the bad smell coming out from the shower was unbeateable. I complaint but nothing was done about it, maybe cause I am from Madrid (just kidding but hey! it is possible!) The little bar at the ground floor and free internet is a plus. The gym was too small and nothing was working, the two saunas were OK, but the jacuzzi room was closed and I couldn麓t use it. A small swimming pool is next to the mini-gym. The mall next to the hotel is great and the metro and tranvia also quite close to go to downtown.It is a modern, stylish hotel but I would not come back over there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Best Hotel Ever! My boyfriend and i went to the Barcelona princess for our first holiday and loved it. It was a little out of the centre but the tourist bus stopped right outside the hotel and the trams and metro were less than two minutes walk away. The hotel was very modern and clean. The room was cleaned every day and the mini bar- which was free was restocked everyday too. There are rules regarding taking your own food and drink into the rooms but we didnt find this a problem- we were never stopped taking our purchases upstairs. Our room was the top floor which meant a lift ride up 26 floors- great as the lift was glass and you could see for miles. This was great for views of the Sagrada Familia etc. Room was fairly big with a large comfortable bed, great power shower and blackout blinds and sky TV. Staff were friendly and always willing to help. Room service was avaliable. I would definately book the Barcelona Princess if i return to Barcelona.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic views This hotel is fantastic. We arrived for a 4 night break at around 11 o'clock and were pleasantly surprised to be able to check in instantly. Not only that, we were offered a high or low room with city or sea views. If the same choice is offered take the high option with a city view. It's fantastic in daylight but as the sun goes down the panoramic views just get better. The room itself was extremely clean with black out blinds that leave you wondering where the morning went as they're that effective. The other plus point is the fantastic shower.Admittedly the location is out of the centre, but it's about 15 minutes on the metro. For the metro there are various options such as 1, 2, 3 or 4 day tickets available. This however is purely for the metro, whereas the T10, the ten journey tickets can be used for bus, tram or the metro which gives more flexibility. Overall if I was to go back to Barcelona I'd happily go back to the Barcelona Princess</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A bit too far out... The hotel is not bad, clean and well maintained. Bedrooms are on the small side and as the beds are quite large it feels a little bit claustrophobic. Extras such as breakfast and laundry are expensive. The staff seemed not bothered most of the time and I often had to grab someones attention even though I was the only person standing at the counter! However, my biggest gripe is the distance from the centre of Barcelona. Despite previous comments I found the journey arduous. The Metro is quite close but it's still a 20 minute ride to Cataluyna station. It was sometimes hard to get taxis in the evening, particularly from 8 o'clock onwards and cost about 12 euro to get to the city. However Barcelona can be difficult to get a taxi from in the early hours and I spent over an hour trying to hail a cab one night wishing my hotel was more central.The princess is not a bad hotel and the beach around teh corner is great however I would highly recommend staying more central.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It truly is fit for a Princess We, being my girlfriend and I, stayed at the Princess Hotel for three nights, Sat to Mon.After reading some of the extreme range of views posted on this website, we were a little apprehensive. Some people said it was excellent and others that it was a dive.After our stay, I am under no illusion as to the fact that this is a magnificent hotel, truly deserving of it's 4 stars.Upon arriving at reception, we were greated by helpful staff who spoke better english than we spoke Spanish. They showed us the way to the local metro station, El Maresme I Forum. The location of this station is a major plus point for this hotel. You are no more than two hundred yards across from the Metro, linking to all the major sightseeing areas of the city. As such, the location was not a factor and don't let it be the deciding factor in your stay.All together the hotel is fantastic, the views from our room facing the city on the 20th floor were fantastic. I cannot over recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Awful in many ways!!not My husband and I spent 5 days at the Princess as part of a conference group. The location is terrible. While public transportation is nearby, the hotel is quite a distance from the city center and all the sights. Each taxi ride into the city cost 11-15 Euros. That very quickly added up to much more than we had anticipated.The room was attractjve but small. The bed was very comfortable but the bathroom left much to be desired. The separate shower was next to the separate toilet and the shower leaked onto the floor into the toilet area. Not pleasant. The view was great.The signs in the lobby forbiding guests from bringing in outside drinks or food made it feel like a dorm or a hostel and not a deluxe hotel. Concierge services were non existent and the front desk staff were not knowledgeable or helpful at all. The breakfast buffet was very limited and unexciting.So it seems that what this hotel has going for it are low rates and a modern design look. I would not stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic Hotel If you are afraid of heights, do not stay at this hotel unless of course you're on the 6th floor or below.There's masses of glass and floor to ceiling windows. Glass elevators, glass walkways and of course the infamous glass bathrooms.Getting to the pool on the 23rd floor was a no-no for me due to the height/glass walkway issue but I hear that it's very nice.The reception staff were incredibly helpful and polite and check-in was efficient and quick.The one and only negative comment would have to be about the shower. The temperature fluctuated from freezing cold to scalding hot and that was without even turning the tap sometimes.The blackout blinds in the rooms and the largest beds that I've ever slept in definately made for a restful night. The free mini-bar was a really nice touch as well.All in all, a great hotel and coupled with the excellent transport links on it's doorstep (metro, tram and buses - including the tourist bus that stops right outside the door) it's definately worth a visit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great showers, but grumpy uncaring staff and bad location. What a shame. This is a stunning building with great views and lovely showers. However, the staff are grumpy and there is a big problem with noise at night from a nearby club.When we stayed the metro branch that went near the hotel was closed for maintenance (which was told to us with an uncaring shrug from the reception staff) so we went by bus. Full of local colour but very slow, stopping every 25 metres or so. The area around is dead (except for the shopping arcade next door) and very unlike the rest of Barcelona which is buzzy and fun.I didn't feel like the staff cared who came and went, or whether we were enjoying ourselves or not. A very contemporary, minimalist interior. Which is great, except that it is really starting to show signs of wear and tear already. To sum up, this hotel lacks a feeling of care and attention (either to the guests or to the fabric of the hotel itself).In retrospect we would definitely have stayed nearer the centre of the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel Stayed at the Princess Barcelona on Nov 3-5, 2005 prior to sailing on our Mediterannean cruise on RCCL Splendour of the Seas. We had a beautiful view of the city from our 16th floor room. Execellent hotel. Very European decor. Extremely modern  clean rooms. Professional and very pleasant staff. Excellent service. Security at front lobby door 24 hours. Food is pricey, but you can go across the street to the Ramblas and have a good breakfast for a fourth of the cost. All that is in the room fridge is complimentary - so is the bathrobe and slippers - they don't tell you that upon check-in. Free high-speed internet is offered on the second floor. Hotel is adjacent to a large mall you can walk to. It is not centrally located but you can easily reach the center by train. Taxi from airport to hotel is about $25USD. Always negotiate the price of the taxi fare before accepting. We were robbed by the cabbie from the hotel to the ship-port - charged us $70USD. Would definitely return and recommend this hotel. Book it with confidence!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">best hotel in barcelona Had read all the reviews on this hotel but still did not want to build up my hopes. We need not have worried as this was the first time i have stayed in a hotel and found it to be exactly as it was in the reviews and the photos. The staff were great and the rooms are stunning along with the facilities and the views were amazing. The only fault i had was the breakfast. It was awful. We arrived on friday 29th of sept my sister my father and myself for his 65th birthday. The location is fab as it is covered by the tourist bus the main bus line the tram and the metro. If you dont wish to use these then its only 10 euros for a taxi into catalunya square. We even met some lovely people while we were staying at the hotel. The shopping centre next door was great with some fab restuarants. The only other problem i would say someone could have would be the shower as ours was broken so the waterfall was more like a trickle against the wall but if you are over 5'10 you would probably struggle. Apart from that this a 10/10 hotel for me.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Clean and modern Overall, the Princess is a nice hotel. I stayed in a double room, which I thought was quite large for a European hotel room. The furnishings were contemporary and the linens and towels excellent. The bathroom was relatively small and didn't have a tub (though I can do without a tub). Housekeeping kept the whole thing spotless.The blackout blinds were a nice touch, as was the very much appreciated free minibar (soft drinks, water and beer, 5 bottles total per day, and included in the cost of the room!).The EUR 16 breakfast, though a little steeply priced, was a hefty buffet with hot and cold items. And of quite good quality.The front desk staff were a little hurried and not especially friendly, but not unpleasant either.The only major drawback to the hotel is its location in El Maresme. It's next to the giant (yet mostly unexciting) Diagonal Mar mall, but is otherwise in a primarily residential (and equally unexciting) neighborhood. But the inexpensive and reliable metro is close by, and the real Barcelona just a 15-minute ride away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">loved the hotel but not the location Stayed here for 2 nights whilst the football was on. Found the staff very friendly, on check-in we were offered a sea or city view room. We chose a cityview and were located on 24th floor - the views are amazing! The room itself was lovely, spacious, very comfy bed, the minibar was included in the room rate with water coke and beer which was refilled every day. The bathrooms were a bit odd. There is a glass partition between the bathroom and the bedroom which there is a blind to pull down but our room didnt have a door to the toilet! the shower had 3 settings with small and large jets and I loved the bathrobe and slippers.Room service was pricey, one night we tried for 15 minutes to order food and noone answered the phone.The location is the only thing that let this hotel down. The public transport is great and there is a bus and tram stop just down the road but if you want to be in the action dont choose this hotel. It takes a good 15/20 minutes by public transport to get to the ramblas and costs 10 euros by cab.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Would stay again - hopefully soon!!! I took a group of my friends here for a long weekend for my hen party and we all agreed the Barcelona Princess rocked!!The previous reviews about no food being allowed into the hotel are correct, but we solved this by hiding any shopping bags in our beach bags - so no problems there!! The room service is not too expensive anyway but as we were only staying a couple of days this was not an issue.The rooms were beautifully decorated, the shower definately sorted out any kind of early morning hangovers we had!There was a great shopping mall just next door to the hotel with a lovely tapas restaurant on the top floor.My room was on the top floor(26th ) which had great views over the city. Some vertigo sufferers may want to mention this upon check in as some of the rooms are accessed via a glass walk way!!I would recommend anyone to stay at the Barcelona Princess again as although it was a little way out of town, cabs to the main bars at the Olympic Port were only around 5 -10 euros, and this was well worth the peace and quiet of the location!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Glassed Bathroom March 2006 - 4 of us stayed here for a long weekend, we had adjoining rooms which was great. Check in was a little slow as was check out - staff were friendly but slow. The bar staff went out of their way to make our stay memorable, nothing was too much trouble for them. As all hotels the drinks here were more expensive than bars - about 40% more. Breakfast was not included in our rate-we were charged 16 euros each. The selection was fresh fruit, cold meats and cheese, hot grill, cereals,toast,muffins etc. It was as one would expect from a 4* hotel.Dont get too excited about the swimming pools, they are very small but welcoming for a quick dip after a long day sightseeing. This hotel is a 10 euro taxi ride into the centre. Near the hotel was a shopping mall. If I return to Barcelona for a short stay I would choose a hotel a little nearer the centre, but this is an individual choice.The hotel bedroom was very clean, and the bathroom a little different with a glass partition dividing this area from the bedroom - we were on a high floor with spectacular views of the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the view, not the stairs!! We chose the Barcelona Princess largely due to a lot of good reviews on the Trip Advisor website and everything we read was true . . .We arrived at 11am and couldn't check in until 2pm but were able to leave our luggage at reception. The staff spoke good English and this was hassle free.Our room was on the 26th floor, at the top, magnificent views over Barcelona and the sea. The room was definately the best we've stayed in - very clean, stylish and yes, the shower is unbelievable!!The hotel is a 20 minute tube ride to the city centre - we found the easiest way to get around was the tube, and purchased a metro ticket that enabled us to make 10 journeys for just under 7 euros. The metro tickets can be purchased from a ticket booth which has English instructions. The only downside of the hotel was that on our last night in Barcelona there was torrential rain and the lifts in hotel were out of order. We had to walk up 26 flights of stairs to get to our room without an apology or any explanation from the staff - their customer service could definately be improved!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall Great Value This hotel was a great value: Good price (about $100 a night from Expedia), close access to Metro, Clean, Nice Views, and a free minibar. The Bathroom was very European. The tub had glass that covered only half way so there was a lot of water splashes on the floor (being an American, this is one of my pet peeves about European showers). There were no face towels. They provided a free toothbrush, shaver, shower cap, shampoo, and soap.We arrived on a Thursday and the taxi cost us 鈧?5 Euro. We checked out on a Sunday and the taxi cost of 鈧?5 Euro. Apparently, there are two tariff rates. One for Monday - Friday. And a more expensive rate for Saturday and Sunday. Plus, there is a 鈧? Euro charge for the airport and 鈧?90 charge for luggage...so don't freak out when you see the fare start at 鈧?.90. The closest metro station is Maresme-Forum. When you exit out of the hotel, cross the street and continue straight two minutes. The metro station will be on your left. There is also a mall next door to the hotel called El Diagonal Mar with many restaurants. The food at Pizza Marzano was really good!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very nice and elegant hotel, staff unfriendly and incompetent! The hotel is indeed very nice and elegant, classy and stylish if you like the cool understated modern look. Especially the location is extremely convenient for participants of events at the Convention Center next door. Also, the pool(s), although small, are spectacular. The rooms are a bit too small but again very very stylish. Once you have figured out how all the gadgets work it is great, they also provide a certain amount of free beverages from the minibar.Unfortunately, the staff are really not up to the task of running a 4-5* hotel. They clearly lack commitment, some of them are outright unfriendly and grossly incompetent. Eeven though we were a large group attending a convention many of the employees would not even try to help us out with simple things like inquiring for lost baggage, a taxi or other tourist informations. Valet parking only, costs 16 鈧? but we had to wait almost 25 minutes to retrieve our car.All in all, a lost opportunity for good hotel management. At a price of 250 鈧?a night, you should be able to expect most of the things to work.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent Hotel Stayed here in Sept 2007, Found the staff friendly  helpful. Hotel is located approx 50m from an entrance to the Diagonal Mar shopping centre.The centre has loads of quality shops located over 3 floors, Plenty of restaurants are available on the 3rd floor  i would recommend the Yellow Thai curry at the thai restaurant !.Transport is great from here, The tourist bus stops right outside the hotel, Recommend you buy the 2 day pass (only costs you an extra 4 euros!), Journey into the city takes about 15 mins, You have 3 routes that will take you all around the city (If you get the chance recommend the Gaudi Park on the red route, Walk right to the top of the hill for some amazing views !), Only downside is the last bus is at 9pm. The metro is only about 2 mins walk from the hotel.The rooms were great, Excellent beds  the power shower was fantastic !. The views from the 23rd floor are good, The lifts are made of glass  are on the outside of the building so grab your camera's for some amazing views frm the top of the 26th floor !. Overall i would recommend this hotel to anyone, It's just the right distance from the city.......  madness of Las Ramblas ! lol</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Modern Hotel top marks This is a great Hotel, very modern, we went through check in very quickly, our hotel was on the 19th Floor and you would pay top money anywhere in the world to get the view we did, truly fantastic.The rooms are extremely modern and i think you need to like the modern/ urban chic look to really appreciate the hotels style, i know my parents would not like it at all as they appreciate more the traditional scene, i would say this hotel would really appeal to younger people.The metro station is just on the doorstep and the best way to get around, i would advise against trying to walk into the centre, we tried on our first day and what we thought would be a 40- 50 min walk is more like 2 hours and simply not worth it, particularly as the Metro is so efficient and gets you where you want to be in a matter of minutes, its really easy to use, almost identical to Londons Tubes only cleaner and air conditioned.We did not eat in the Hotel, to be honest the menu did not appeal to us at all however next door is the shopping mall with plently of places to eat and Drink, the hotel bar was good though and not too expensive that you feel ripped off, all in all a great value for money hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Poor Service The Hotel Barcelona Princess was clean and modern as depicted on the various websites we searched. HOWEVER, my boyfriend and I had trouble figuring out why the entire hotel staff was not accommodating in the very least. For a so-called 4-star hotel, the staff (manager, and receptionists included), were discourteous and rude. They did not help with our luggage, and upon check-in informed us that we would have to wait over 6 hours to access our room as others simply had not yet vacated. We addressed staff in both Spanish and English and did not find them to be any more friendly as a result of our efforts. The hotel manager was especially obnoxious, imposing a phone tariff and dirty looks for a meager LOCAL call we placed to a friend informing him that we would be stranded for 1/2 day out of our 3 day excursion OVER SEAS. This was definitely a huge discomfort and left a very bad taste in our mouths, along with the absurdly overpriced $16 Euro breakfast. BE WARE: taxis from the hotel to other parts of the city include an automatic excess fee of 5 EUROs as the hotel imposes it on the drivers. You should not encounter problems in any case as staff will never lower themselves to calling one for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very good value We have just returned from staying at this hotel and found it to be very good value for money. The room we had was very comfortable, with a huge bed. We had a lovely view of the sea and made use of the electric blinds. Plenty of toiletries and the free minibar was very handy. The shower was a bit daunting to begin with but we soon discovered if you adjusted the showerhead, that solved the problems. We thought it would have been more helpful if there had been more drawer space. However, we managed. If the green line had been operational it would have made a big difference to us for getting around, this stops in September. We used the tram and the metro which was a very slight hassle to reach the tourist bus. We were so tired with all the sightseeing that we would go to the shopping mall to eat before returning to the hotel. The choice of restaurants was great and suited us just fine. The downside of this hotel was not being able to bring food in. We thought this rule was a bit ridiculous, especially with there being a superb supermarket in the mall. Ok this hotel was not in the main centre, but it was a lovely hotel, very comfortable, quiet and made a very relaxing break for us. We would go back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Would definitely recommend! I visited this hotel with several of my friends (for my best friend's hen-do) in August 05. We had booked via the internet and got a really low rate so weren't expecting much. We were delighted with what we found. The hotel was immaculate, stylish, air-conditioned and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. It's a little out of the way in relation to the city centre but there's a bus stop next to the hotel, a metro station nearby and reception were able to call taxis within a few minutes for us. We decided to jump on the hop-on/hop-off tour bus which takes you all round the tourist sites in Barcelona and were very pleased to find that one of the stops is outside the hotel....very convenient. There's also a sizeable shopping centre right next tour with a great selection of fashion stores, restaurants, bars and a supermarket. Ideal for our group!The only down-side was the lack of balconies. I'm not sure if the larger, more expensive suites have balconies, but ours didn't - just a huge window with electric roller blinds. Would have been nice to be able to sit out on a balcony, but the view was great nonetheless!Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and I hope to return again soon!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Swimmimg on the 23rd Floor !!!!! Went with my wife for 13 nights in August clean bright modern funky relaxed business hotel.Combine a Beach (cleaned everyday and a 10 minute walk away)and City holiday (6 stops direct on the Metro plus bus and tram to Centre.)Staff young and helpful but English is limited in Barcelona so they lack confidence understanding and using it.They could tell you more about special offers on Metro tickets and Museums etc.,Exceptional value in August when there were no conferences- 拢50 a night double.Fantastic views of the City along Diagonal and located on the side of a very large out of town shopping centre and food court(try Zagardi Basque/Cider Bar Restaurant)Mixed but safe and interesting local environment.Smallish rooms but ingenious design makes the most of the rooms with fantastic electronically controlled blinds !! Two small pools swim out on the 23rd floor terrace- what a view of the city.Breakfast price reduced to 12 Eros during our stay but evening meal price of 35 Euros was too high for most non business Residents- Go into TownEven if you don't like football go and watch a match Barca v Juventus pre match like a mini Olympic games Will be back as soon as I can.Any questions ????? just ask</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fit for a Princess!! Booked this hotel last December based on trip advisor comments, was a little wary as some of the comments since were not all positive. However, my husband and I had a most brilliant time, we checked in late and still received our requested sea view, and our very own balcony with facilities to sit out and enjoy the sights of Barcelona, Fabulous for fireworks last week!The staff were excellent, free mini bar a treat, rooms were clean and though about 20 minutes from city centre on metro it is very convenient to the tram, metro station, bus and and bus tuiristic!There is a large shopping centre next door (Diagonal Mar) with many restaurants and great shops and the beaches are a short walk away. There was a market and music in the forum across the road at the weekend. There are two computers available on the 1st floor for internet, though may require some queuing at times.We stayed in Princess for a week and saw all the sights in Barcelona, we did not encounter or witness any problems with thieves but were vigilent. We paid 鈧?4 for a taxi to the hotel fro airport and 鈧?8 back to airport from hotel. We did not eat in the hotel but found huge choice in Diagonal Mar centre and in city centre.Overall, excellent!!</p></li>

<li>There are two computers <span style="background-color:#d0d0d0">available</span> on the 1st floor for <span style="background-color:#d0d0d0">internet</span>, though may require some queuing at times.We stayed in Princess for a week and saw all the sights in Barcelona, we did not encounter or witness any problems with thieves but were vigilent.</br></br></li>
<li>We paid 鈧?4 for a taxi to the hotel fro airport and 鈧?8 back to airport from hotel.</br></br></li>
<li>We did not eat in the hotel but found huge choice in Diagonal Mar centre and in city centre.Overall, excellent!</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great! This was a great hotel. I used booking.com, they had really good rates. The price was very reasonable. The front desk staff were extremely helpful and patient about every question and request. They give you free lemonade, beer, and water in the minibar which is cool. The room was beautiful and the view was excellent. The shower was great, there were 6 different water spouts. The only problem is the water comes out on the floor, but this was a minor problem. The glass wall for the bathroom was an interesting, pretty touch. The room was very nice, it was great to wake up and go to sleep to that view of the city. You can take the metro to the hotel very easily, and you can take the tram to many different places. Just be careful, the area seems very safe and far apart from the main mix of things, but I had my purse stolen not too far from the hotel. There is a great mall right next door for shopping and also to grab food and snacks at the last minute. I loved this hotel; it's great for family or friends, and especially a romantic trip. I would stay here again definitely. They also give free robes and slippers, which they continually refresh! Also, they clean the room whenever you leave, even if it's in the afternoon (most rooms are only cleaned in the morning!).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent, Fabulous Hotel All I can say is this was the perfect hotel to stay in. The Metro is literally 2 minutes away. There are buses and trams but the metro was so easy, didnt need taxis or any other transport. The room was fabulous. The minibar was re-stocked every day, 2 swimming pools, sauna, small gym and jacuzzi (all free). They had robes and slippers, shaving gear, toothbrush etc. In fact if you just had your passport with you, you'd have no problems here. There's a Shopping Centre right next door. There was a carnival / fairground overlooking the sea less than 5 minutes away. The view was unbelievable, overlooking City Centre. Honestly I cannot find one thing that is bad to say about this hotel. The staff were really friendly. The breakfast buffet is probably one of the best I've ever had in all of the places Ive been to in Europe. It was so easy to get around Barcelona and really nice to come back to a place that was peaceful. The airport train leaves you in Station de Franca (train was free from airport !) and go around the corner and get the metro to Forum, up the steps turn right and less than 2 minutes the Hotel is in front of you. I read all the reviews before I left and was worried it was far away from the sights but that is so not true. Enjoy it was absolutely wonderful!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Truly a Princess! Me and my boyfriend stayed in Barcelona Princess last October and couldn't be more satisfied with the hotel and also with location. Before going to Barcelona (and also traveling anywhere else) we learned that it is better to have a hotel located outside the center of a city, maybe in some financal, business area and have good public transport (that is subway) that takes you to center and back in a matter of minutes. (This year we did the same when traveling to Paris and stayed in La Defance area, which is almost the same as staying at starting point of la Diagonal). Also, hotels are newer, rooms bigger, fascilities, showers and everything else is brand new and nicer. Plus the prices are normal. We like modern, urban and stylish look, so Princess is just what we wanted. Hotel staff was so nice and helpfull, although we didn't have any complaints and problems. Interior is superb, BB Italia sofas, great shower with amazing view, fascinating swiming pool on the roof top! And we had such luck they gave us this big, romantic suite, so our visit to this beautifull city and staying in such a good hotel was all in all fabulous! Metro is few steps away, huge shoppping center with some great shops and Starbucks Coffee :) right next door! What else do you need? Will defenitely come back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent Hotel with an Excellent Location Just returned from a 2 night break in Barcelona staying at the Hotel Barcelona Princess. This hotel was very clean, comfortable and modern with excellent facilities and the staff were all very helpful. On arrival at the hotel we were met by a porter who later brought our luggage to the room and answered any questions about the hotel. In our room there was plenty of information about the hotel and city attractions. We were staying on the ninth floor and had a fantastic view of the sea. The minibar was complementary and was re-stocked upon request and room service was also available 24 hours. On our first night our shower leaked over the bathroom floor but within 20 minutes a maintenance person came to the room and resolved the problem.I had been worried when booking the hotel that we would be too far from any of the main attractions but we were just minutes from the beach (making the temperature more bearable) and there was a huge shopping centre right next to the hotel with plenty of shops, bars and restaurants. The hotel was also located right next to metro station which is a very easy and cheap way of getting around the city (the metro trains are also air conditioned). To sum up I thought the hotel was fantastic but 2 nights is not long enough in this amazing city. I will certainly be going back and will definitely stay at the Hotel Barcelona Princess again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nessun Dorma.... The Barcelona Princess is an ultra-modern hotel a couple of miles out of the city. The shopping centre next door has a variety of OK restaurants  bars  the adjacent Forum Conference Centre, surrounded by a huge concrete park and marina, makes for an interesting location. Some correspondents have commented on the showers - I enjoyed the multi-jet experience, though mopping up afterwards due to the ill-fitting door became tiresome. There are some terrific aspects from the lifts  high rooms, and with some more welcoming staff the hotel could move from good to great but for one thing outside its immediate control...'Espacio Movistar'. Adjacent to the Conference Centre, this marquee-like music venue pumped out rave at a volume sufficient to rattle the glasses on the shelf in our 18th floor room until 5am on Saturday morning....even my ipod at high volume in my ears couldn't drown out the beat. Reception were sympathetic (saying they had called on the police to intervene) but could offer no help, nor, when I asked them the following morning, a change of room (the hotel being full and anywhere 'it won't make much difference'). The following night's prog rock was better - it wasn't as loud and finished at 4am - but still cost us several hours' sleep. If you're thinking of going to this hotel at the weekend, unless you're deaf, a raver or the hotel have assured you there's nothing on down the road - don't.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very nice, close to mall and the beach My husband and I got a great deal at Barcelona Princess when we booked our stay early, 2 nights for a total of 160 euros. We were nicely greated and given a room on the 25. floor. We did not see the ocean, but had a great view of Sagrada Familia and the city. This came in handy when there was an amazing fireworks show our first night!Our room was nice, very quiet/soundproof, big bed, cool interior design and free minibar.The hotel is close to the beautiful beach, approx 10 minutes walk. We enjoyed our first 2 of 4 Barcelona nights at the beach. Also there is a big mall next door, The Diagonal Mar, with lots of stores and restaurants. The third positive thing with the hotel is that you can catch the metro from the station Maresme, only 2 minutes walk. Within 10-15 minutes you can reach Barceloneta, Port Olimpic, Barri Gotic or Placa Catalunya, because the yellow line passes all these great places.The negative part at the hotel was a problem with the air condition, which was very cold no matter how warm we set it. Even at 35 degrees it was freezing, so we could just keep it on for shorter periods and not during the night. We told the hotel about this, but it was not fixed.It was also a bit disappointing that the pool area on the 23. floor was closed for maintenance. We would have liked to see the view from there.But all in all we were very happy with our stay and would absolutely return!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">OK When you first walk into the Barcelona Princess your initial thoughts are all positive. It looks stylish and has a nice ambience. It feels like a good 4* business hotel. After 90 min wait to check in because of 鈥榗omputer problems鈥?your enthusiasm wanes but the free drink helps the time pass by. On walking into the room I was initially impressed until I realised that it was a twin room rather than the ordered king size bed. After another wait and battle with the receptionist I get moved to a better room but still without a king size bed she promised. Apparently the hotel is full and I don鈥檛 fancy queuing another 30 mins to try and change rooms again!My new room has a balcony which is rendered useless because it has no table and chairs and over looked by the whole hotel! I have a proper bath with shower, but the cheap shower fixing has broken in a previous life and has been super glued together. Every time I turn the shower off the shower head falls off and either hits my toes or head! The sink is also badly designed鈥? It has no plug! Also no soap dishes鈥?when you turn the tap for hot you get cold etc. The only saving grace is the excellent blackout blinds. Made me late on one occasion!Lifts鈥ifts鈥ifts! Lack of them! This hotel has 3 lifts for 26 floors. It needs at least 6. At peak times you can end up waiting 10 mins for a lift! RidiculousOnce you start seeing the cracks in this hotel they just keep on coming. It will look very tired in another 2 years time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just satisfactory We chose to stay in the Princess because the children were offered a free connecting room. This was great as they had their own room, bathroom and facilities. I found the staff pleasant and helpful, though as pointed out in previous postings, slow to book in. But we were on our holidays and time was not a problem.The rooms are very dark , quite small but clean . Our shower leaked all over the bathroom floor, so much so that we had to use quite a lot of the towels to soak it up. Yes, we too had the knob inside the toilet stuck on with selotape!! But the toiletries were lovely, towels spotless and fluffy and replaced everyday. The pool was very cold and never seemed to have the sun shinning on it. I realised quite quickly why no one was in the water or sunbathing. The pool area was in the shade most of the time. The seating in the bar area was faded and had seen better days.The location of the hotel is 15 mins by metro from the centre. We are well used to travelling so this was not a problem. The shopping centre next door had the whole floor of eating places with lots of choices. We enjoyed seeing how the local people lived and their children playing in the little play areas. There was a huge play area both inside the shopping mall and acroos the way beside the Forum which kept the children happy.We enjoyed our stay at the Princess but if going back to Barcelona would stay somewhere more central. Hope this helps anyone making a decision as whether to stay or not.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">awesome! Amazing very modern hotel suitable for all kinds of visotors, we stayed on the 18th floor with a city view which was amazing, especially at night time when the whole city was lit up, the rooms very beyond comfortable and offered many great things such as free mini-bard which was topped up daily free of charge with water, beer, coke, etc. The rooms were cleaned daily and towels replaced, free television with about 30 chanels including sky news and mtv. The shower was great very powerful with 3 different settings, the bathroom is all glass and silver and looks amazing and is seperated from the bedroom by electric blinds which were great! the electric blinds for the window were great as well as they offer complete darkness if you fancy a few winks. the kingsize bed was very comfortable as well! The hotel as is the whole city no smoking (apart from a few small bars/cafes) so if you smoke like me you have to go outside, or alternatively theres a nice little bar directly opposite the hotel called la rambla which allows you to smoke and also sells very cheap beer and does food as well. The metro and tram are both outside the hotel and the metro is about 7 stops into the city centre, be careful though as one british tourist standing next to us got her purse stolen out of her bag on the metro when it was busy, the pickpockets are very clever when doing it. The room service however was poor, very expensive, poor portions and the food wasnt all that great. Amazing city and an amazing hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good Quality Hotel Just got back from a weekend stay at this hotel which I booked on lastminute.com for my Mum's 60th birthday. Getting to the hotel via taxi was easy and not too expensive, around 拢25.Check-in time was adverstised by lastminute at 2pm and when we arrived we had a bit of a delay in checking in, but it wasnt a major problem. Leaving bags wasnt a problem though. Rooms were nicely furnished and the free mini bar with water and beer was a nice touch (only one bottle of beer a day though!). On the first day we headed into the Diagonal Mar shopping centre which has a great selection of shops, and the bars/restaurants outside on the 3rd floor offer somewhere to handy and reasonably priced to eat and drink if you cant be bothered heading back into the city after a hard days sightseeing!After trying the tram, we found the metro station which was much easier. Buy the T10 which allows you 10 journeys for about 7euros - its good value if you're there for a weekend. The Metro is really simple to use and quick to get to the centre. Didn't try the hotel for breakfast or dinner as there are other options in the cafe opposite or in the shopping centre. The area around the hotel is fine - part residential, part commercial. Some interesting buildings nearby too. Tried the pool on the 23rd floor - nice and warm (even in Oct!). Its a bit of a novelty factor really, but an enjoyable experience.Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't mind the Metro and wants good value in a nice hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent Experience I stayed here for 3 nights recently with my boyfriend and we were both extremely impressed with the hotel and the services offered. We paid a little extra for the Wellness Package which proved to be excellent value for money. We had a room on the 18th Floor which provided spectacular views over the city. The robes, slippers, free mini bar (replenished free of charge every day), toiletries (including toothbrush and toothpaste, comb, nail file etc) were very much appreciated and the included breakfast was second to none (everything you could possibly want...and more).I took advantage of the included free massage (1 per day if you want it - 1 hour for 1 person or 2 half hour sessions for both) which did wonders for my back and my boyfriend tried out the hot tub/jacuzzi and sauna.We found the staff to be always professional, helpful and friendly.As for the location? No complaints there at all. The hotel is very close to the beach and line 4 on the Metro (5 mins walk) which has many of the must visit locations including Passeig de Gracia, Barceloneta etc. There is an impressive shopping centre 3 mins from the hotel which houses a huge supermarket (should you need extra drinks, food etc) as well as many other shops.All of the above contributed to a very pleasant stay. I would rate this hotel as a very good 4 star if not a 5 star (and it's a very close call). We wouldn't stay anywhere else if (which is very likely) were to return to Barcelona in the future and would certainly recommend it to all of our friends.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Bad Attitude I booked my room in Barcelona based on the raves on this webpage. I figured I'd sacrifice prime location for a luxury stay. However......First, we did not get the room that we booked. We booked a double room but instead got a twin. They fixed this by pushing the beds together. This might have been ok without the staff's rude take it or leave it attitude.Second, many of the so-called attractions of the hotel closed early (or maybe were never open). Twice we went up to the 23rd floor bar to have a drink and enjoy the view and it was never open, even during hours it was scheduled to be open 10.30 through 20.00.But most frustrating was the staff being rude, possibly even deliberately. Twice we asked for simple directions, such as the best way to get downtown, and was told incomplete and even WRONG information. We were told to get on the tram in the opposite direction and transfer train lines. This is completely unnecessary as the Metro is just around the corner - we just couldn't see it at first. (Note: if you are staying here, it is unlikely that you should need to take a tram). Later, we asked a different person if a bus would have been a more direct route to where we were going and we were given a curt yes without giving us which bus line to take and we ended up going all over the city. We also saw staff members giving condescending looks to a group of tourists that were just having fun.In short, the location ended up being ok with the proximity to the Metro, but the staff was so unfriendly and unaccomodating that I would not recommend staying here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great new year...great hotel! we have just returned from barcelona this morning and felt it absolutely necesarry to leave a great review for other travellers.This hotel is excellent, its clean, modern and greatly situated if you dont want to stay right in the hussle and bussle of las ramblas. Our room did not have the glass bathroom wall like on the website but im sure we were compensated as our bathroom was huge and we had our own balcony.The metro is literally on your doorstep and is easy to use and is not intimidating at all. I even shot into las ramblas alone one morning and felt completely safe. it very cheap about 90p for a single trip, however i recommend a 2, 3, 0r 4 day pass as its very cost effective.There is a great mini trafford centre right next door to the hotel with many places to shop, eat and get snacks. Its got a bowling alley and a cinema, however none of the films were in english.All in all we had a great new year and we will definately stay here again and we will be returning to barcelona for sure.Please dont be put off by the location as it is about 20 mins on the metro from the centre. trust me if we can find our way around anyone can and we give it a huge thumbs up!we were warned about pick pockets and handbag thieves in barcelona but if you be sensible and dont advertise yourself as a tourist i.e... have your camera out at every opportunity or hang it around your neck, flash your wallet and leave your bag unnatendended you have nothing to worry about. remember, its not rocket science just common sense!!book now you wont be dissappointed!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great quiet location I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with my boyfriend and could not be more thrilled with our choice. The check-in was quick and easy and the room was lovely and tidy, with amazing views. The house keeping was spot on and the shower is simply devine. Furniture and decor is very modern, with a nice european chic about it. As mentioned before, the electronic blackout blinds are great, but be warned that it does make you oversleep! The location of the hotel is nicely situated outside the hustle and bustle of the city centre. However, do not let this put you off, as the Metro station (Maresme Forum) is less than a 3 minute walk from the hotel. The Metro is very convienient and is about a 10 minute journey to the city centre and many other attractions, such as Sagrada Familia, La Rambla and L'Aquarium. The hotel also facilitates a sauna, jacuzzi and two swimming pools. Massages are also available for about 50 Euros. My boyfriend said the massage was superb and almost fell asleep! The room service is fast and not hugely expensive. There is always a security guard at the door, which is a nice safety precaution. Though, I'm sure he is not really needed as the area is pleasent and quiet. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful, although with limited English, but they do try and help in anyway they can. There is a big shopping centre 2 minutes away and has everything you need. Many restaurants are located on the 3rd floor of the mall, with a wide selection to choose from. I would highly recommend going to Araguil, which is a tasty Lebanese restaurant.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Must Be A 5* I am not being snobbish but i have been to many 5* hotels around the world, and to think this hotel is not 5* is just incredible. It is in fact considered 4* superior and is very good at that. The rooms are very modern and clean. The staff were very polite and helpful and assisted us whenever possible. We arrived to the hotel at 12pm and requested a high floor room. We were told our room would be ready at 1pm so we went to have lunch on the beach, leaving behind our luggage in the hotel. We returned to the hotel at 2pm and were given a sea view room on the 25th floor. We were told that the minibar was free which included coke, lemonade,a beer, still water and sparkling water. The room was lovely. I have been to Barcelona twice before and stayed in 4* hotels and the rooms were much smaller that this one. The shower was powerful and massaging.It was a true pleasure to be in the hotel room and looked forward to coming back to the room. The only negative point i think is the tv which had 30 channels, but the only 3 english channels are CNN,bloomberg and eurosport. The blinds in the room are great, and make the room pitch black and difficult to wake up in the morning, so have an alarm ready to wake you up every morning.There are 2 computers in the first floor which we found always empty and used for the internet, but there is internet available in each room so thats another bonus. Hotel location can be annoying after a while. The tram is an easy way to reach the beach taking about 10mins and the metro takes 12-15mins to the centre. Overall, i cannot stress enough how impressed i am with this hotel and would definately stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful Hotel, spent our 5 year wedding anniversary here! My husband and I are from Massachusetts and were visiting my husbands family in Ireland for 2 weeks. While in Ireland we booked a 3 day/2 nite visit to Barcelona to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary. We were in the Barcelona Princess May 4th, 2006 evening and May 5th, 2006 evening. We booked the hotel based on the reviews in trip advisor. We loved the Barcelona Princess and only paid $106 per nite from hotels(--) You would never find a hotel of this quality at that price in Massachusetts, or most other places in the USA or Europe. We were on the 11th floor and had a view of the Mediterannean. The room darkening shades were great! The first morning I woke up and it was pitch black in the room so I thought it was 4am..turned out it was almost 9am!There were a bunch of young English Tourists on a trip and were very loud in the bar. We were afraid we'd hear them coming back from a big nite out but luckily we did not. Since we were only in Barcelona 2 nites we were only in the hotel to sleep. As the other reviewers pointed out, yes it's a mile or so away from the city center but the subway is right outside the Barcelona Princess. We had a 2 day Barcelona pass so we used the subway which was very convenient. I worked out on the outdoor stairmaster one day which wasn't a great stairclimber but it was okay. I didn't go in the pool but some of the English tourists were in there. The Sky Bar at the top was closed.I would recommend the Barcelona Princess. It's a great deal for the price. However as someone else wrote, the rooms may be a bit too modern. It took us awhile to figure out some of the light switches/shade controls.</p></li>

<li>The first morning I woke up and it was pitch black in the room so I thought it was 4am..turned out it was almost 9am!There were a bunch of young English Tourists on a trip and were <span style="background-color:#A00000">very loud</span> in the <span style="background-color:#A00000">bar</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>We were afraid we'd hear them coming back from a big nite out but luckily we did not.</br></br></li>
<li>Since we were only in Barcelona 2 nites we were only in the hotel to sleep.</br></br></li>
<li>As the other reviewers pointed out, yes it's a mile or so away from the city center but the subway is right outside the Barcelona Princess.</br></br></li>
<li>We had a 2 day Barcelona pass so we used the <span style="background-color:#008080">subway</span> which was <span style="background-color:#008080">very convenient</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>I worked out on the outdoor stairmaster one day which wasn't a great stairclimber but it was okay.</br></br></li>
<li>I didn't go in the pool but some of the English tourists were in there.</br></br></li>
<li>The Sky Bar at the top was closed.I would recommend the Barcelona Princess.</br></br></li>
<li>It's a <span style="background-color:#fffac8">great</span> <span style="background-color:#fffac8">deal</span> for the price.</li>
<li>It's a <span style="background-color:#fffac8">great</span> deal for the <span style="background-color:#fffac8">price</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>However as someone else wrote, the <span style="background-color:#557585">rooms</span> may be a bit too <span style="background-color:#557585">modern</span>.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Barcelona Princess will blow you away before or after your cruise! As always when using a discount site, I was nervous about this hotel, especially when I got a $95 each room rate for two rooms on Expedia for my wife, myself, and our two teenagers. Not only did they get us adjoining rooms, they were adjoining on a high floor.We stay in 5-star places (Grand Wailea, Atlantis, etc.) in great suites, and this was easily a set of rooms worth $400+ combined. Like the rest of Barcelona, the design is amazing, and if you are a gadget person, you'll love the power window shades, power screen room dividers over the glass wall to the bathroom, cool showerhead system, free unlimited internet, wake up call built into the TV, decent cable, etc. The only thing you may want to do that we didn't is bring the two prong adaptors and voltage regulators, but they did provide (I brought an ethernet cable with me, but they provide that, too).We had nearly 10 bags and they were courteous about storing them for 2 hours until our room was ready at noon. The staff was universally courteous, and sent two guys that loaded us IN our cab for the airport the next day as fast as an Indy pit crew.If you have tiny kids, you might want something less avante garde, but for teenagers, the chic pools, free stocked minibars, $10 euro cabfares to Olympic Village or Avenidas Ramblas, etc., made this the wonderful surprise of the week. You are also just a block from the Hilton, next door to a very nice mall, and a very short walk to the largest public beach in town.BOOK THIS NOW before other people hear of this first class hotel posing as only a 3-star! If I ever go back to Barcelona, I'm all over this place! You will not be disappointed!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A true Princess! My wife and I stayed in the Barcelona Princess for 3 nites in late May 06. We booked it with [--], about 鈧?00 for 3 nites!..Like most previous reviewers, i was a little apprehensive about the somewhat varied reviews.Yes, the hotel is a 15 minute Metro ride from the city centre, but the top floor view we had of the entire city more than made up for this. On top of this the open top tourist bus stopped right outside..this is the only way to see Barcelona. Also the tram ran along La Diagonal right outside also. The huge modern shopping mall next door was lovely and airy, never too busy or loud, had loads of nice restaurants for breakfast or lunch, and some very trendy stores.I would definitely rate this as a 4 star hotel. It looks great, ultra modern, staff are friendly and efficient, nice sauna and jacuzzi, swimming pools are small and don't get the sun after mid afternoon, but you aint in Barcelona to sunbade!!The rooms are very contempory, with wall to floor windows,blacked out electric blinds. A glass wall separates the bedroom area from the bathroom, which also has an electric blind for the more humble!.The shower though is amazing, the really powerful waterfall and body jets really invigorates you after a long days sightseeing. Room service was prompt and surprisingly tasty and fairly ok with regards price. The air con worked perfectly and was a must.The only negative comment was the constant humming noise, which i reckoned came from some sort of air con motor on the roof..but we were the closest room to this, being on the 26th floor, and besides we got used to it after a while.All in all..i would totally recommend this hotel and you will get far more value and quality than what you pay for.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved this hotel- definitely going back My family and I stayed in this lovely hotel in July 2006for 3 days before embarking on a Mediterranean cruise.I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor, and they were very accurate. The mini fridge is stocked with beer, lemonadeand pop each day , and is free. I had a large bedroomfacing the sea on the 20th floor and the view was great.The room is very modern, the King sized bed was comfortable,the room darkening blinds were very effective. Only 2 peopleper room - even little kids can't stay in the room with you. Mysister has 2 small kids and she had to book a separate roomfor them. But my entire family (15 or us in total ) loved this hotel.The shower cubicle is separate from the toilet cubicle for eachroom. The kids (and I ) loved the shower- all over body shower.The toilet cubicle could be a problem for larger sized people ,and for claustrophobic people because the door goes upalmost to the ceiling so you have the sensation of being closed up. The toiletry area is outside the shower andtoilet cubicles.There is a room safe for valuables. The only negative is the security staff is very strangely adamantabout not bringing in any outside food. I had read this on a review before I left, and it was true. My mother was stopped and questionned about her bottled water which I thought wasridiculous.We had a wonderful dinner in the hotel restaurant on my lastevening. The portions were small but very tasty.The beach is nearby - walking distance. There is a largeshopping mall with lots of places to eat just a few stepsfrom the hotel. The tourist bus goes by outside the hotel.We bought a 2 day pass, and hopped on and off the bus.Pay attention to the routes though .I will definitely go back to this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">very upscale feel The Barcelona Princess is a wonderful hotel. The rooms are extraordinary in that the views are spectacular, and the features within the room are divine, right down to the faucets. Some of the rooms actually have balconies, and though those rooms don't have DIRECT ocean views, they give you a span of Barcelona well worth the (moderate) price of the hotel. Those same rooms are larger than the ocean view rooms, with a much more unique layout.  The spa facilities are filled with young (attractive) visitors on holiday, and the pool itself, at the top of the roof, seems like an ad for Hedonism, with all the sun bathers. Had I not been there on business, I too would have whiled away many hours taking advantage of the tremendous spa facilities. The breakfast is actually one of the best I've ever had. It is, like 90% of hotel breakfasts, a buffet, but the choices are extraordinary. In reading the reviews before choosing the hotel, I had a couple concerns about the attitude of the staff. There were very few moments when I felt the staff wasn't exemplary. One has to know and understand Spain a bit to understand the attitude. No one is likely to get preferential treatment, but everyone is going to get great service. (I was able to check in when I arrived before noon, but I was only lucky.) The only complaint I have is not against the hotel itself. The location is not terribly accomodating if you're on holiday. It's great for the convention center, and it's great if you want to go to the mall. BUT, if you're in Barcelona to experience classic Barcelona, I would look to stay elsewhere. Otherwise, you'll be exhausted just getting around. For business, or a holiday with teenagers who want to hang around the hotel while YOU go experience Barcelona, it's perfect. Brilliant, in fact.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location, great room but noisy neighbours We spent three nights at the Princess at the end of November/beginning of December for my husband's 50th Birthday treat.We caught the red eye from Luton so arrived at the hotel not expecting to check in but fully prepared to leave our bags and go out exploring, but the very nice chap checked us in and whispered that we would get a junior suite as the hotel was very full, which was a definite bonus. The room on the 10th Floor had a sitting room with sofa and desk, the main room and a bathroom with shower. We found the room to be clean, of a good size and with plenty of storage space (especially as the sitting room had a wardrobe as well). It is a very modern hotel but we like this style; it may not be for everyone. The views are great (although the bridge between the two halves of the building was a challenge for my husband!).We stayed from Thursday to Sunday and the hotel definitely emptied out at the weekend when all the corporates left.Earlier comments about the noisy neighbours are spot on. At the weekend the local rave venue is very noisy and does go on well in to the early hours. Fortunately we did so much walking we were too exhausted for it to keep us awake but it has to be said that it is extremely noisy and was on every night we were there. We walked to Port Olympic from the hotel which was lovely especially on Sunday morning when the place is buzzing with families, cyclists, roller bladers, etc., enjoying the sunshine.Port Olympic is definitely the place to eat. We would particularly recommend Sylvestre which was very lively with friendly staff and the sea food out of this world. All the restaurants in this complex looked great and were very popular with the locals.Getting around the city is a breeze with the Metro being very efficient, clean and safe. The two day unlimited pass was very good value and very convenient.We had a wonderful weekend at the Princess with the only downside being the noisy neighbours.</p></li>
