<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Only stayed one night. Excellent beach and large pool. Room had full size refrigerator, microwave and two electric burners. This would be great to save on meals. The only negative I would say is the food quality at the H2O restaurant. The service at the restaurant was excellent, Nikki, our waitress. A very good value at $128.00 in August.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great view, clean room, loved the free internet. Our only complaint was poor service at the restaurant, which had mediocre food. It was nice the kids ate free, and we got 2 complimentary drinks, but we experienced extremely slow service and mistakes in our order. An 18% gratuity is automatically added for all parties, which could eliminate any incentive to provide good service. Nice to see you read and reply to all the reviews posted here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Though we didn't actually stay here we did visit relatives who were. It's a nice enough place, but no way a 5 star hotel. The room was large enough, a typical size for hotels along this stretch of the Atlantic coast. It should be noted that 1/2 of the hotel has swimming pool between ocean and hotel and the other half has parking lot between hotel and ocean. So if the hotel were busy or booked it could get pretty noisy right below your room.</p></li>

I love the easy access to the beach. But the best part is the view from all the rooms we had. An amazing sunrise over the ocean.

We had a Suite with a private balcony overlooking the ocean. Room was very spacious with a separate bedroom area for privacy. Bathroom was quite large as well. Kids really enjoyed the pool area and it stayed open until 11pm each night. Convenient beach access was a plus. Very clean with friendly staff. Housekeeping did a great job each day cleaning the room. Would stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My children and I stayed for a weekend getaway. The front desk clerk was so friendly and courteous. They advised us that there was a free breakfast and a child activity center that the kids could get involved in. So we went for the free breakfast and we were greeted at the door by Bill Netcher. He made sure the kids were happy and that made me happy. Jose was our server and I felt he went over and beyond his job. This is the only place I have ever gone where they REALLY welcome children.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I rarely leave reviews, but our experience here was so wonderful I wanted to share! The ocean views are beautiful, the rooms are updated and clean. The service was excellent. Even when we had problems booking correctly through the national reservation line, the local front desk helped correct their confusion. The resort has an excellent location and the pool and fire pits on the beachfront are clean and relaxing and my kids had a blast in the baby area. We will be returning in the future!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We came to Daytona Beach by mistake. My family and I were leaving Disney and going back to Nashville and got lost so we decided to stay one night at the beach. The front desk staff was so helpful and friendly that our one night became four days. The staff here is excellent. The activity director was the best and did some really great things with the kids. If I had to say anything negative it is that the rollaway bed is hard as a rock and not very comfortable , so if you think you might need one bring a blow-up.</p></li>

They even closed off one entrances so that we were conveniently parked. The hotel was beautiful! The rooms were so comfortable and clean. All the rooms face the beach and over look the gorgeous pool area that even had 2 fire pits. It is so close to everything. We were able to walk to the pier and enjoy a movie, shopping, and dining. This is by far the best hotel I have stayed at in the area. We enjoyed our stay and plan to go back soon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ok, so after reading some of the reviews I was expecting the worst. All I can say is WOW. It's obvious that they spent a lot of money on the renovations. The rooms are clean, the kitchen rooms are very useful if you are traveling with a family and dont want to eat out every meal. The view form the rooms is fantastic. WE loved the pool deck. The kids had fun in the splash park, my wife and i enjoyed drinks around the gas fire place at night. Very romantic. Finally the staff are superb, they actually remember your name.</p></li>

I want to thank the housekeeping staff for great service, I don't have her name but the young girl from Jamaica we want to thank for her smile and making our day. We were there for a graduation and were glad we chose the Holiday Inn this time in Florida.</p></li>

The kids enjoyed the pool with the color lighting up at time. We enjoy all the ammenties playing bingo, beach volleyball. We really enjoyed out stay and will be back again. We were there from July 27-29. The only thing we did not like was the parking, but that not the hotel fork. Also the fire pit at night is great to sit by when the wind is blowing from the ocean. Loved everything.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a beautiful property. The rooms were great. Everything is remodeled & modern. The pool deck is wonderful. There is a kid pool with splash areas. The main pool is nice with a waterfall fountain. There is one hot tub. My favorite was the two gas fire pits on the pool deck. We ordered dinner & breakfast on the pool deck. The staff was super friendly. Kids eat free. Only thing that could be better is the elevator. It is slow. But I'm sure this property is older. Not a deal breaker for me. I will stay here again when I need a get away.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Grew up in the Daytona Beach area and my family and I were on our way to Orlando for a week's vacation, but we knew we were stopping for one night before arriving. Ended up hearing about the renovations and took a chance. I can't honestly say these is a diamond in the rough in Daytona. While I call the area home, Daytona has a long way to go in cleaning up A1A, but this was indeed a pleasant surprise for my family. The room was very nicely appointed and our daughter LOVED the kiddie pool and being right on the beach. All in all, a five out o five for our family.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Whether it's for a week long vacation or a theraputic getaway, The Holiday Inn Resort in Daytona Beach is the place to be. From the moment we checked in the friendly staff made us feel right at home. This was our second time in 2 months, and will be returning as much as we can. The rooms are beautifully updated with Flat Screen TV's and brand new bathrooms, very clean and comfortable. Enjoyed a Frozen Margarita pool side and a delicious lunch at the hotel restaurant. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to stay in Daytona, you will not be disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our 2nd stay at this hotel and once again we loved it. We absolutely LOVE the pool area and the outside dining area to relax at night. The rooms are average rooms but clean and nicely decorated. Some of the items that might bother people, but have not really bothered us because we are really interested in a nice pool area, (a) the elevators are slow, (b) parking is tight and not always available late at night, and (c) the service at the bar is not always fast or even there. Overall though the hotel is a great stay and the employees are very nice and helpful.</p></li>

The price was over 170.00 for the night, felt it was a little high considering we booked direct with hotel and didn't receive what we had expected, an Oceanfront room..overall average, also didn't like the dimly lit outdoor halls in the evening.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is right on the beach. The oceanfront suite we had was spacious and clean, and had a lovely balcony. It was also very quiet due to the soundproofing. The staff there are the best. By the second day Becky (at the front desk) knew my name and was very helpful. We ate dinner at the restaurant (outside) and the food was reasonably priced and quite tasty. The location is close to the downtown Daytona Beach but actually very quiet which made it nice for us. There is also a 711 right across the street where we bought snacks and beverages. Would definitely recommend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My son and I took a trip to see the last shuttle launch. We arrived rather late and ended up with a first floor room with a patio that opened onto a parking lot. The consolation was a cooktop, fridge and microwave. We stayed in this room (although we could move later in our stay) but chose not to. We were able to walk down the corridor, turn left and walk across the pool to reach the beach. With a 16 yr old boy in tow, the kitchenette was a good deal. The pool and pool deck were neat, with two fire pits, a nice pool. The restaurant and bar were good too. Overall, a great stay!</p></li>

It is a beautiful hotel..staff are pleasant & accommodating. The rooms are very nice, we had a mini kitchen, the bathroom is large with a great shower, everything is spotless. Great pool, restaurant/bar. Fantastic view of the Atlantic Ocean. All the rooms are smoke free as is the hotel. Maid service was excellent, especially Jasmine (she told me she was from Turkey)..very nice, hard working, young woman. I would definitely recommend this hotel, you will not be disappointed.</p></li>

Lots of room for a family and it even has a full size fridge, microwave, toaster and electric stove top. We ended up eating in most of the time. Room was spotless and seemed very new. loved the walk in shower with the height adjustable handheld shower head. Great view of the ocean as well. Beds were super comfortable and the pull out bed was way better then the typical sofa bed mattress and my boys loved it. Will definitely stay here again the next time we are at Daytona Beach.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We couldn't have asked for anything better. Staff was fantastic, the room was incredible and the ocean view was perfect!!! This is a must stay place any time you are in Daytona. We will be back every December and we will be staying here. Perfect hotel and Daytona was so easy to get around.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My daughter and I were on a road trip to move here from Colorado to New Jersey and decided we needed a little R&R in some warmer climates so we headed south to Florida for a couple of days and stayed in Daytona at the Holiday Inn Resort, Oceanfront in Daytona. The room was very comfortable, the view from the balcony that was overlooking the beach was spectacular. While breakfast was not included we ordered it up and sat outside and it was wonderful. We hit it just right, the weather was gorgeous, 80 degrees in mid-January, very mild. The gentleman at the front desk was very helpful and gave us a late checkout.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent hotel. All the staff members were very friendly.Service was fast and professional. The pool, bar and restaurant were great. Right on the beach, you can’t beat that. I would recommend the Ocean-Front rooms, the view is great, especially at sunrise. I did see the view from the non-ocean front side, and that's nice also. This hotel is in a good location, close to all the local fun stuff. I traveled alone on this trip, but this seems like a great place for families. I like that Daytona Beach is getting away from a Spring Break/Party Town type of place,to a more family-friendly, fun place to be. And I think this hotel exemplifies that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family stayed for 7 days at this location July 16th to 22nd. The staff went above and beyond to ensure our confort and safety. The parking is the only real issue here - all the renovations make for a great experience, but the parking is engineered for much smaller vehicles than standard. Parking available across the street, but its a walk across lanes of traffic. Take into consideration a few careless parkers, and you need a can opener to get in your car. Overall, well worth the trip... great beach access and pool sanitation as well. If changes could be made, revamp the parking and ventilate the elevators a touch. Otherwise, a 4 out of 5!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My children and I stayed in an oceanfront room with a kitchen. The view was fabulous. The room was exceptionally clean when we arrived. The towels had even been folded into swans and placed on the beds. That is a little touch we have only seen on cruises! Our room was maintained with that high level of cleanliness throughout our stay. A huge thank you to the person responsible for cleaning room 619 on July 6-9! The pools were lovely and the atmosphere was very family friendly. We had an amazing stay and hope to come back again. Thank you Holiday Inn Oceanfront Resort for providing us with a family oriented hotel with exceptional rooms and service!</p></li>

The atmosphere was just too good; the place is child friendly, the staff were very pleasant and helpful. The restaurant was a nice place to sit together and enjoy meals or a nice cup of coffee. With the beach view at your disposal it was just heaven! The rooms were too good of course. Every small detail had been taken care of to satisfy the needs of the customer. The beds were very comfortable and spacious to enjoy a good night's rest. I would definitely come again. I personally liked the suite rooms because they had a mini kitchen so its ideal for families.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in Daytona for five days in this great hotel. We found the beach in front to be clean and easy to get to. Our check in/out was quick and painless, especially since we were upgraded to an ocean view room for free. The beds, oh wow, were some of the most comfortable I have ever slept in anywhere!! We also like the fact that there was a parking garage to protect the car from the blazing heat as well as the freak thunderstorms. The only bad thing about the hotel is the $6 resort fee for a hotel that doesn't really meet the definition of a resort, to me. If I come back to this town, I would definitely look at this property first before other locations.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pluses: We had a wonderful balcony and ocean view, kids loved the pool and beach. Location is convenient to shops and restaurants and there is a pool bar and restaurant. Minuses: Had to ask for extra towels twice before they arrived, you have to "check out" pool towels and return before getting new ones, the AC unit blows directly on the person (me) sleeping in one of the beds. The AC unit is only a few inches from the face. If you are a person who sweats at night you would love freezing air blowing in your ears, up your nose, etc. but I didn't like it. As soon as you turn up temp one degree, it goes off and you sweat so I stayed up all night switching it. Bring a sound machine if you are noise sensitive.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed one night 10th Sept the 2 young girls on reception in the afternoon/ evening where great plenty of help and smiles even ringing the room after check in to see if everything was OK. Breakfast was good and the view from the room stunning. 2 downsides, the towels for the pool very very thin and not having cushions on the sun beds didn't help and the very noisy air con in the room but I have to say the attitude of the staff was more than enough to make up for these couple of things. As some others have said a little tucked away but nothing a short taxi ride can't fix! I stay at IHC all the time and am a platinum member which was fully recognised at his hotel, thanks and well done everyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Quite a busy hotel but the room was quiet. All fixtures were new - bed was very comfortable, bathroom was very well equipped. Balcony overlooked the pool and beach - very pleasant. The big disappointment was the restaurant food and service. We ordered one drink and none came near us after that for about an hour. We had to buttonhole someone to get a menu - it took ages for someone to takes our order adn another long period of time for the food to arrive. When it came, it was poor in presentation and quality. The waitress did apologise later for the inadequacy of the service. After going back to the room to sleep, we had to listen to a dreadful singer on the patio - eventually we complained and someone shut him up.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has been recently renovated and the rooms are very nice and new. I used priority club points and never know exactly what to expect but the hotel upgraded us to a beachfront room with a full kitchen due to my member status which was really nice. The room had a fill sized refridgerator and stove. The beach was right out the door past the pool and the hot tub whixh were both in great shape. There is also a fire pit at the pool that they keep burning at night. The front desk staff were great and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. I only used the restaurant for coffee and a drink so I can't comment on the food. Overall it was a relaxing stay and I would definitely spend a couple of days here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Found this hotel with the help of Trip Advisor, and was not disappointed. The room was a bit small, but totally fine. The pool was large and clean and there were lots of chairs available. The beach was also very clean. The restaurant was delightful for al fresco dining for breakfast, and nothing fancy but fine for the dinner we had, as well (The restaurants in Daytona Beach seem to be an issue in general--so why not eat here where the kids also eat free!) The cleaning staff on the 5th floor was wonderfully friendly and helpful. We arrived before noon and were able to check in immediately--which was great. I also thought it was lovely that the front desk called to check we settled in OK and whether we needed anything. In all, is not a luxury place, but great for families and clean! Give it a try!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Found on TA and was not disappointed. Asked for a higher floor (better views of the beach) was put on a middle floor but still had nice views. Parking was tight and we had to park across the street at a store that was closed. I would have liked to have parked on hotel property but it turned out fine. I saw on their website that the hotel was cheaper during the week. I called to extend my reservation and asked for the cheaper rate on the phone. They said I had it but then when I got there I did not. It took three trips to the front desk and finally a manager over rode the price on the extra nights so I did get the lower cost. One might want to make two reservations if they are staying on the weekend and then during the week to get the lower cost. Nice hotel with nice views. We would come back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our vacation at this hotel was great! We went with friends and stayed for a week. What a relaxing and stress free vacation. The hotel was clean and updated (the beds were more comfortable than ours at home!) and the staff took care of whatever we needed. The pool, fire pits and outdoor dining were a plus for us. The one complaint I had was that the lady bartender wasn't very nice....I'm hoping she was just having a bad couple of days and that she isn't always like that! I forgot to pack my dolphin anklet and when I called about it, they said they had found it and mailed it to me immediately. Thank you! We will definitely be returning to this hotel in the future. There is not enough space here to tell you how nice our experience was at this hotel in Daytona Beach! You'll just have to go and find out for yourself!</p></li>

The sunrises were magnificent! The hotel has a spa that was very clean and relaxing. And they had fire pits to sit by at night. The pool was clean and very big. Becky at the front desk was very helpful and professional. The hotel would have activities everyday, the ones I enjoyed the most were, bingo, arts and crafts, scavenger hunt,and water arobics. Sheena the activity leader was very professional and very helpful and friendly. All the staff were right there if you needed anything. This vacation was the best I have had in a long while. Thanks to the Holiday Inn Resort Daytona, I had a great time. If I can make a suggestion please buy Sheena a CD for the water arobics, Thank you.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">this was our last stop from a week trip. When we check in Dawn in the front was so pleasant to talk with. We were traveling with two young kids and gave us a room on the second floor with easy access to our car. hotel rooms: wow very clean and nice. looks like it was recently remodeled. the view from our balcony was beautiful. the beds were so comfortably.plenty of space in the room.very impressive for a Holiday Inn. Pool area- beautiful pool area that at night lights up different colors, there is splash area for the little ones to play in. the only down fall was there was NO Shade and it was hot. it would be nice if there was umbrellas so that we could have had shade especially for the little ones. The beach access was great foot steps from the hotel. it would have been nice to have breakfast included in the stay. I would definitely come back to visit again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have experienced a wonderful time just by reading all of the fantastic reviews. I searched diligently to find the perfect resort for our upcoming 25th wedding anniversary. I want to make this a very special occasion. I chose Holiday Inn Resort based on all the excellent comments. I am extremely excited and will be there from July 29th - August 2nd 2012. I too spoke with Steve after booking through the 800 number. Steve enlightened me on a few questions I had regarding the King Oceanfront Hot Tub room that I've booked. I was elated to find out that this room is actually a suite!!! Hey Steve although you don't know, it is our anniversary celebration, and you made my day. I informed him that he better be there when we arrived because he was just so much fun to speak with!! I hope to have a memorable time in which my husband and I shall never forget. I have a good feeling that we will not be disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived earlier than planned the front desk was so accommodating getting us in our room without delay. Our room was clean timely and thoroughly daily, hats off to the housekeeping staff and management. We normally dont eat breakfast in the hotels but my wife and I were pleasantly surprised by the service and food. As our week progressed when we passed the staff in the hallways everyone spoke with a hello, or a thank you for staying with us. There is a nice game room my children enjoyed on a nightly basis , and an activity center great for kids during the day to take a break from the sun. An absolute MUST is the fire pits ( great idea Holiday Inn ) at dusk they light the pits and there are a few chairs by both pits and the heat mixed with the cool air off the ocean is amazing great for couples in the evening. Without a doubt will return to the Holiday Inn Resort Daytona, and strongly recommend especially families with children.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place was everything I've read about and more. Being a priority club member we've stayed at several Holiday Inn hotels for our family vacations and I have to say this was by far THE BEST. It was modern, clean and the service we received from the staff was superb. They made you feel comfortable and were extremely accomodating from the moment we walked in until the time we checked out! Always with a smile on their face making you feel at home. Our room was spotless, the beds comfortable and we had a spectacular view of the ocean not to mention every accomodation we could need (kitchen, stove, refrigerator, dishes, etc) and free wi-fi. The pool was crystal clear every day and even the lounge chairs by the pool were new, clean and comfortable. There were activities daily for the little ones as well as the gated splash pool. If I could of I would have stayed longer. We will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to Daytona Beach.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here the 2nd week of April. We had fabulous weather and really lucked out with this hotel. Not only was our room beautiful and looked to be newly renovated but the ocean view - breathtaking! Waking in the morning watching the sunrise over the ocean from your balcony was simply magical. The restaurant and bar opens up to a relaxing outdoor patio area that over looks the pool/with mini waterfall. There was a hot tub. They also have these cool fire pits...at night we got a drink and sat by the fire. The hotel staff is really stellar - they're friendly & helpful. We had a few glitches but they made things right. We had stopped here because we were so tired and had been driving for two days to get to Florida. Our plan was to stay one night and then head over to the Gulf Coast but we loved this place so much we stayed the week. Something else I notice...the sweet scent in the air...I don't know what it was but it smelled good! Maybe orange blossoms?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband &I visit the Daytona area often so when I found a super price online for a 3-day vacation, I booked it. For this price we expected to get a really lousy room. Were we surprised. Dawn greeted us w/a a big smile & made check-in a breeze. Our room was oceanfront; lovely tile & granite bathroom w/ hairdryer; nice kitchenette w/ granite & full-size stainless fridge & microwave. The bed was fabulous w/a a soft pillow & a firm pillow(they were labeled!). Details n this place made such a difference-from the soap dishes to the hidden kitchen garbage can to the pillows, it is a comfortable & pleasant room. Dawn even called to ask if our room was ok & make sure all was ok. Pool area very nice, kiddie pool great --large area. Saw the hot tub but didn't use. Oceanfront cafe very nice, service very good. Drinks strong & sandwiches were fresh & hot. Hotel is about two miles from the boardwalk but convenient to everything. We had a wonderful time & will definitely return!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My friends and I checked into this hotel after having some problems with the Best Western Aku Tiki Inn down the street. Overall we were very pleased with out stay here! We were offered a great price per night during our 7 night stay in Daytona. The rooms were extremely clean and our room had a kitchenette, fridge and freezer with pots and pans and other utensils. We had an amazing view of the ocean and pool and beach in front of the hotel was very clean and enjoyable. If I would change one thing it would be the service. The men were very kind and helpful but the women I found to be very rude and incompetent. We were also woken up during the night for a wake up call that we didn`t ask for because they had gotten the room number wrong. Also we had rented a car and on our last day in daytona we noticed it had a dent near the driver`s door. The parking lot is very tight and there aren`t enough parking spaces. With exception of these few quirks, we had a great time and would definitely return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is the last top of our 9 days trip. The front desk was welcoming. The unit and lobby are new and nice. The hallway doesn't look nice. The pool is nice and light well at night. It is not far from Jet ski rental place, which open at 9:30am. The location of Holida Inn is kind of far from most exciting area (near the Pier). But the stay is pleasent and unit is conformable and clean. I took a lot of picture of sun raise from my room/balcony. Beach sand is much nicer than cocoa beach. But we drive to attractions a lot more. It has nice kitchen with regular fridge, microwave, 2 burners, sink, and coffee machine. If we stay longer, I am sure I would feel more delighted. unfortunately we stayed two nights only. You could try hotel's own restaraunt. I like one of the sauce that made of pineapple, mango and other stuff. I never have that in other restaraunt. I love it. There were two fire pits next to the pool. It's great for night swim. It's warm in the water. Come out became quite chilly because of the wind.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Spring Break Location!!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was pleasantly surprised by this Holiday Inn Resort. I reserved an oceanfront room with a kitchen and was very pleased. Very nice pool area and they have activities such as pool side bingo and adults can win a free beverage at the bar (kids when other small items). The only reason that I did not give this resort the "Excellent" rating would be due to parking and internet issue I had. The spaces are extremely tight. Thankfully I had a smaller car, but if you have a full size SUV you may have issues parking, but I am not sure really what the hotel can do to fix this unless maybe they build another layer on the parking garage so that spaces could be wider. The other issue I has was with the Internet service. The wifi was somewhat unreliable during my stay. You get a password for the wifi upon check in but wifi was down the entire first night. They did eventually fix it but was still intermittent. I loved the hotel and would highly recommend this hotel. I will be back!! Thanks for a wonderful spring break!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a Priority Club member ( platinum ) I stay at several Holiday Inns throughout the year, and generally choose to stay in Florida for vacations. This location sets the standards and exceeds them. The customer service form the front desk to housekeeping , the resturant staff and even the guys cleaning the pool deck in the morning. Every employee we past by all said " good morning " or " I hope your enjoying your stay." the hotel was extremely clean and well maintained. Easy and quick access to the ocean. Daily activities for the children when they need a break from the sun. Overall great place and will return next time in Daytona. A special thank you to Jessica @ the front desk. As I checked in I inquired about local restaurants and she informed me that she just recently moved to the area. Instead of the " I new in town and ain't got a clue " she took the time to tell me what she's heard from other guest and confirmed info. with her coworker. So on a personal level ... Thank you Jessica and continue the great service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Upon checking in we were greeted by a very friendly employee named Steve. Being new Priorty Members we were informed that we had been upgraded to an Oceanfront with a full kitchen and we were offered a later checkout time of 2:00 instead of the regular 11:00. The later checkout time was wonderful. We enjoyed being able to spend extra time on our last day. Also, we avoided the busy lobby area of everyone trying to checkout at 11:00. The room was nice, very clean and the view was awesome. Friday evening we enjoyed the pool and bar area with a nice drink and music. Not a loud band but a man playing mostly Jimmy Buffet etc. We had breakfast in the H2O Resturaunt. Very good and reasonably priced. Overall we had a wonderful time. The only complaint was the airconditioner didn't keep the room real cool when you had the curtain open to the balcony. The elevator was a little slow also. Those were really only minor things compared to all the really nice qualities. We definately will stay again. Already hoping to go back Labor Day weekend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Original plan visit Siesta Keys Beach for 8 days, with our family of 4 children. The home we rented & paid for turned out to be disgusting, as well as the beach~ definetly NOT as Described! We left that area as soon as we could. We were at the mercy of availability and rates. Long story, short- Eventually, we came to this Holiday Inn on the Daytona Beach. Although, we never intended to end up in Daytona & not all 6 of us in a hotel room! We were greeted by Nicole, who showed us the beautiful hotel & all it had to offer. We stayed 4 days, cramped into one suite, only because it was a newly remodeled hotel, wonderful pool, hot tub & camp fire, along with the views of the beach~what more could you ask for? I spoke in great length to Becky one evening. Staff made us feel very safe & comfortable, (well as comfortable as we could be). Point is...Although this vacation didn't go as planned, we made the best of the situation & felt welcomed by the staff. Thank you, I truly appreciated that.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got back home from staying at this Holiday Inn Resort and we had a wonderful experience! We were upgraded to a room with a kitchen and oceanfront view, which was lovely. The bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom were clean and the interior design was very nice! I thought it was neat how the bathroom shampoo, conditioner, and lotion were all Coconut Lime Verbena from Bath and Body Works. I loved the outdoor pool and hot tub and sitting outside by the fire pit at night was fun and relaxing. The place as a whole is very aesthetically pleasing! The hotel has a restaurant with great food and occasional live music. I especially enjoyed ordering breakfast from room service (which is not free, by the way.) Anytime we needed anything the service was surprisingly prompt! The employees are very professional and seem to take great pride in their establishment. I was expecting the bathroom adjoining the pool and beach to probably be somewhat dirty, but it was super clean and smelled amazing! I felt pampered at the Holiday Inn Resort and would definitely stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at the Holiday Inn Daytona resort after having some trouble with the Best Western Aku Tiki Inn down the street. The hotel and rooms were very clean, no problems in that aspect. We were also given a room with a very nice ocean and pool view, which was very nice as well. Also, the restaurant in the hotel is very good for a really good price. I was, however, dissatisfied by a few aspects of this hotel. First, I found the staff of the front desk quite rude, especially when we checked in. Also, we were woken up at 5am for a wake up call that was not for our room. On top of that, the gentlemen did not even bother to appologize over the phone, even though he had woken us up while we were on vacation! Also, the laundry facilities were out of order for both times we tried to use them. In addition, the parking lot is very poorly designed, making it difficult to park for any medium sized cars. Finally, I am not sure whether or not the hotel allows solicitations, but we must have accumulated well over 50 advertisement panflets through our door in the span of a week. Bottom line: Very clean facilities, but poor service</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked an ocean view room on priceline for $65 per night, and it was the best 80 bucks (with tax) I've spent in a while! The rooms are very nice and clean, with granite countertops and flat screen tvs. The patio was quiet with a fair view of the Atlantic. We slept really well! The customer service was wonderful! Jose, our server and bartender at the beachfront restaurant downstairs was an absolute delight! He treated my 2 year old daughter like a princess, and went out of his way to provide us with more than anything we requested. Becky was very helpful as well. Also, the front desk was extremely helpful, specifically Ekta, who signed us up for the Holiday Inn Rewards, and we got a free 2 pm late checkout! Also, the pool area is awesome if you have children! There is a large kiddie splash area where I was able to lay out and relax while my daughter played safely and blissfully in the shallow pool with huge waterfalls! The beach is really quite beautiful, and there is a chair and umbrella rental about 10 feel from the hotel! All in all, this hotel is impeccably run, and I will stay there every time we visit. Book this, you will LOVE it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this Holiday Inn resort this past weekend during a monsoon of a storm that lasted all weekend :( There were several things that made our stay pleasurable, not just bearable: 1. The Hot tub: The hot tub was outside by the pool with a great view of the ocean. It was nice and hot, so we didn't mind the rain coming down or wind blowing. 2. The room was large and comfortable with a beautiful view of the ocean. It was amazing watching the wind blow the trees and the HUGE waves breaking! The bed and pillows were great, and the bathroom is large and well-appointed. Big screen TV for the baseball playoffs. And the maid service was above average. 3. The hotel bar, H2O, was pleasant and comfortable. Food was served here but we didn't try any. The margarita was delicious and priced reasonably. 4. Monday morning the storm had cleared and there was a veritable army of workers righting the exterior of the hotel. There was an incredible amount of work to do, but each person we ran into was friendly, cheerful, and courteous. It could have been a miserable weekend getaway, but we had a great time despite the weather because of this classy, well-run resort.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this room for a long Memorial Day Weekend (4 nights) because there is not a Marriott on the water within the area(Marriott is my first choice and Holiday Inn is second). The hotel is an older property that has been refreshed. The pool area was nice and my wife and I really liked the "basket weave" style reclining lounge chairs...very comfortable--managed to read a very long novel in 3 1/2 days. Our 5th floor room was 2 doors down from the elevator on the 5th floor but we were never disturbed. The room was very clean, had 2 very comfortable beds, and the small kitchen served our purposes. The A/C kinda' shuttered at times and on the first night, woke me up...after that I got used to the noise. The staff was very friendly and appeared to take care of everyone very efficiently. Only real complaint was the elevator. It seemed to have a mind of its own and would skip floors, indicate you were going down and then go up....it was a roll of the dice and was noticed and commented on by several folks we saw. If I am in the area, I would stay at this resort, again. Parking could be a little bit of a challenge and getting away from the smokers at the pool was impossible.</p></li>

I spent A LOT of time checking several hotels/resorts and was really surprised by some of the bad reviews I read about well known "name" hotels. (Bad housekeeping, rude staff, stained things in rooms, bad parking, long waits to check-in etc.). The Holiday Inn (1615 S Atlantic one), consistently had great reviews. We were not looking for anything crazy, just cleanliness and safety. I finally decided to book online thru the hotels website and inadvertantly put the wrong expiration date for my credit card. I kept checking my bank account and after five days, I realized the charge hadn't gone thru and called the front desk. The man I spoke to was super nice and checked everything out and told me what the problem was. He then took the correct information and thanked me for calling. I would have been so bummed if we lost the reservation. After talking to this man for a few minutes I was glad I booked there. He seemed like a great guy and his niceness and attitude basically confirmed I had made the right choice!!! Cannot wait to get there!!!!!!!!!! See you on the 11th of March!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After greatly anticipating a much needed vacation with my family, I was disappointed upon arrival. Several weeks ago, we had requested a Double Oceanfront Suite on an upper level floor. Upon arrival we were told we would be on the 1st floor. I asked if an upper level room would be available the next night and they said "no", that our type of room was not available on any of the upper floor for the next few nights (was told that there was only one of the Double Oceanfront Suite on each floor). The girl at the desk didn't really seem concerned with my disappointment, she simply said "oh, I see where you did request an upper level floor". Later in the day, I checked the Holiday Inn website for the hotel and found that our room type was showing as available for the next two nights. Since we had the only one of its type on the 1st floor, it appeared that there were upper floor rooms available for the length of our stay. So, we had no choice but to stick it out on the bottom floor, right next to the pool deck, near a noisy restaurant, and with an obstructed view of the ocean., Though the room was fairly spacious and did show evidence of a fairly recent renovation, the whole experience left me disappointed and reminded me why I don't typically stay at Holiday Inns.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I were traveling for our anniversary, deciding to go back to where we spent our honeymoon. We wanted to stay by the pier, but could not find anything in a good price range, so we stayed further down the beach. On first arrival, we were greeted very enthusiastically at the front desk. Check in was a breeze, even though we were there 2 hours early. Our room was ready, and we went right up. We were surprised that there were no interior hallways, but this seems normal for Daytona. Upon entering the room, we found a clean, large, and inviting room. The only issue was that the AC was not on. It's an eco friendly room, so when the balcony door is open, the AC shuts off, and comes back on when closed. This did not happen, so the front desk promptly sent someone up to reset the AC, and it worked fine, though it never shut off with the door open. There are two things to consider when staying here. This section of the beach does have traffic, so you have to have to look before crossing. Also, the parking is a little tight, with beams on the lower section of the garage. This can easily be remedied by parking on the upper level, if you don't mind a hot car. Overall, we both enjoyed our stay here, and will definitely consider this for our next trip to Daytona. With many questionable choices on the beach, this one should be considered by all.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We visited during the MS150 bike race a couple weeks ago. We had one room at the Hilton (the host hotel) for after our 86 mile ride... but they were booked before our second room was reserved. So, we booked another room at this hotel for our support team (aka friends who would drink with us after the ride). I generally like to stay at a modern style, newer hotel, mostly because I feel like they'll be cleaner. After searching through tens of hotels on TripAdvisor, most of which looked a bit old and a lot cheesy... we finally settled on this one. We were very happy we did. In fact, we were very tempted to have our friends stay at the host hotel so we could enjoy the huge modern style bathroom with a shower with room for six people... and a very nice balcony with a view of the water. All in all, this has to be one of the nicest - cleanest - newest - most modernly convenient - of any in Daytona. We stayed in a suite with a pullout in the living room. Don't know if all the rooms are suites, but if you are planning a longer visit, the kitchen was nice and the suite would comfortably sleep 4 if you don't mind a pull out. The staff was also friendly and welcoming. They gave us a couple free drink tickets and gave us an upgrade. Family friendly too... at least for our visit. If and when I return to Daytona, perhaps for the MS150 next year, we will stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We came to Daytona Beach with no reservations for any certain hotel. A friend had recently stayed at this Holiday Inn and suggested that we do the same. We sure are glad we did! We were promptly greeted by Steve (super nice guy) at the front desk who showed us a room at my request. It was a very pleasant double oceanfront room with kitchen. At the time we were only hoping to get a standard oceanfront - no kitchen (because of price difference). I questioned him about the rate of the room and he said not to worry - with our Priority Club card we were eligible for an upgrade at no charge. How nice! We checked in immediately. Our room was on the 6th floor with a great ocean and pool view. Beds were comfy and room was clean and fresh - as if it was a brand new hotel. We loved the pool! It starts shallow and goes all the way past 10 ft deep with a cute waterfall on the deep side. There is a kids area (splash pad) with a gate and lots of chairs for sunbathing. We also enjoyed the fire pits that were lit after dark. It was nice to sit back and roast some marshmallows after a day on the beach. The on site restaurant makes some great cocktails! When we checked in we were given a coupon for 2 free cocktails - a nice bonus :) and used them the first night of the stay. Overall this was a great stay! No complaints at all here. Cant wait to return to Daytona Beach - we will for sure be staying at the Holiday Inn Oceanfront again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I stayed here the 20th-22nd of April for the Cheer Competition. Let me first say we arrived 4 hours before time to check in and to our suprise the room was ready. This made us all happy people because we were so ready to hit the beach and pool area. When we walked into our room which was on the 5th floor we were very suprised and how nice and clean the room was. The carpet looked to be brand new free of stains and any sticky feeling like at some other places. The bathroom was very clean with plenty of towels and samples. The room itself smelled great and the furniture on the balcony was very nice to have for relaxing outside. The beds were very comfortable and clean. Also we liked the flat screen T.V. and having the desk for our laptop which we did not have trouble connecting. We drove our midsize SUV and had to park in the back which is fine plenty of room. The only negative thing I can even think of is the elevators being a little slow but that is to be expected. Pool area was great and included plenty of loungers, a fire pit, hot tube and small water park area for the kids. Beach access was close and easy to get to. I would highly recommend the restaurant there the waitstaff was excellent and tends to your every needs. Breakfast and Lunch was great, I even told my husband I did not expect the hotel food to be good but it was great and reasonably priced. I just can't say how much we enjoyed our stay and we had an excellent time.</p></li>

There are definitely lower priced options in Daytona Beach, but this was our last night in Florida after leaving Disney and we wanted to make sure we had an nice, comfortable stay right on the beach - we got it! The room was exceptional with new paint, bedding and kitchen and bathroom fixtures. We arrived in the afternoon and spent time at the beach using the access through the pool area. The kids loved the pool, which has a small waterfall and I found the lounge chairs very comfortable and readily available. The pool restaurant/ bar also looks nice although we had just one drink and did not eat there since we had kitchen facilities and made our own dinner. There was live entertainment by the pool in the late afternoon. Once it got dark, the pool lights up in multi colours and there are two fire pits in the pool area. There is also a hot tub. Kiddie splash area is nice, clean, gated. Overall pleasant stay with beautiful ocean view from the lovely balcony. As always, I will be honest and present my minor negative observations as well. As other reviewers observed, I did find some mystery smudges on the walls (bug splats?) and noticed one large roach on the balcony at night. Only other issue is that we booked same day by phone while we were on the road and forgot to ask for the CAA/ AAA discount. The clerk was unable to adjust the rate to provide us with the extra 5% discount when we arrived. Otherwise - brilliant choice - overall good pick!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here Nov 17- 21. The room was pretty good, clean, and no bugs anywhere, which was really good, as I was on the ground floor. Refrigerator and microwave is convenient. The TV was good, but could certainly use a few more channels; I expected more than what they had, which was about 14 thru 39 or so? But it was sufficient. Pool was clean. Ocean was very nice. Try to get a room facing the ocean; I had one facing a vacant lot on the south side of the hotel, but still not the end of the world. The restaurant-bar was ok. I had an omelette breakfast, it was ok but the potatoes seemed like they had been sitting awhile and the cook just quickly reheated them. I had a burger in the evening with fries, and that was fine. The ladies working the bar always seemed pleasant. The front desk folks were good, too. One lady helped me find a Notary on a Saturday afternoon, which was a big help. The 2 guys who work the afternoon shift were always friendly and seemed to have a good sense of humor. Not much within walking distance. A 7/11 (small convenience store)across the street for any essentials or a newspaper, and a restaurant called Marco's which I ate in once and it was ok, but it was just a woman cooking and her husband doing the waiter stuff, but they pulled it off. Great beach right outside. But be aware that cars are driving on the beach and at high tide there is not much room to lay out there with the car lane there. You have to keep an eye out for the cars, especially if you have little kids. But the pool is there and that is good. Good childrens pool area, too. And the fire pits really look nice when they are going at night. I would stay here again, no real complaints at all.</p></li>
