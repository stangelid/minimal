Take advantage of the free water taxi out to Murano - don't buy in factory as cheaper outside - then get water bus back 7 euros.</p></li>

The bathroom was difficult to manuveur because there's not shower door/curtain so the entire area got wet. The breakfasts were absolutely ridiculous in price so we never ate there. We liked that the room was on the canal and we could watched the gondolas and other boats. The staff was OK. The internet was 5 Euros and there was often a line there. The location is good.</p></li>

Staff were friendly and efficient and beakfast in the small dining room was pleasant. We took a water taxi from the airport directly to the hotel, definately the way to arrive and depart.

The room also had some lovely pieces of Venetian glass, as it should. The bartender was a friendly young guy who couldn't ask enough questions about the US. A nice hotel experience.</p></li>

Great location a few moments from St Marco's Square and the Grand Canal. Tiny rooms, with highly variable views and when we stayed in the Venetian spring the heating was uncomfortably high. Breakfast was better than in many Italian hotels but nothing to write home about. Price was good for the location. Overall, better than expected. But no-one ever told us about the roof terrace!</p></li>

These men helped us learn several words in Italian and showed us the language is more of an attitude than a spoken word! They werer great. The other staff were excellent. The breakfast that was served every morning was the best. The coffee was outrstanding. Located in walking distance to everything. Take your electirical converters. We were very pleased with theroom and the whole experience. Wouls go back to Venics and stay at the Kette again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spend 5 nights there and it was very nice. Nothing big and over luxurious but everything was nice and clean. Our room was very nicely decorated with a spotless bathroom at the the end of a wide corridor. The corridor itself had a spacious closet and a desk. Breakfast room was really small, but we always managed to get a table. Breakfast variety was ok, nothing special. The best thing about "Kette" is its location!! Just 5 min walk from San Marco Piazza, but still very quiet. I reccommend it to anyone who wants a quiet, beautiful place in Venice canals.</p></li>

It was too far to anything nice, it had no air conditioning, etc. The Kette was everything and more. Our travel agent recommended it, and it was awesome. We had a great view overlooking the canal, it was super close to St. Mark's Square, and the staff were so ever friendly and helpful. Our room was just the right size, with a nice big bathroom, and air conditioning for those oh so hot summer nights. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone who really wants to live the Venetian Experience.</p></li>

After being told a non-believable story about being overbooked, blah-blah-blah, they hustled us down the street to the Saturnia Hotel. If this sounds familiar, there are other (almost) carbon copy stories about this property in your other reviews. Even more amazing was that we stopped at the Kette, a day early, to confirm our reservation. "Absolutely, we are expecting you tomorrow"; then, when we arrive the following day, they shuffle us off.

Marco and many other main services and facilities such as water bus stops, Gondolas and restaurants. The breakfast is good but in small hall. Two lifts available. Nice minor canal view and we had many pics and videos for the Gondolas with serenade passing through this canal. There is a tasty seafood restaurant behind the Hotel (Vino). We came through Water Taxi which took us directly to the Hotel's secondary door. The Receptionist in that time was great gentleman. Many thanks to Mr. M. Wajeh too, he suggested two great restaurants to us.</p></li>

Our room was comfortable (if a little small) ; breakfast was good ; the location is superb. The staff were very friendly and helpful. When we were leaving, we had a water taxi pickup before breakfast started. The receptionist, at the end of his night shift, went into the kitchen and came back with a bag full of breakfast goodies to keep us going. Highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is located within easy walking distance to St. Mark's and the Grand Canal. It is your typical European hotel with small rooms, but very clean. Our room was one of the few with two windows, one opening to a small balcony. You could see and hear the gondolers on the canal. The provided breakfast, was again, very European. Everything was fresh. The wait staff could have been a little more friendly, however. The front desk staff went out of their way to answer any questions, set up tours, and give directions. We would stay there again and have recommended this to our travel agent and friends.</p></li>

Mentioned it to guy at the front desk within an hour of checking in and his response "all the rooms are like this. There's nothing we can do". Then, asked the front desk as to the best & cheapest way to get the airport and his response was to get 120 euro private taxi from the hotel instead of mentioning the ALILAGUNA watertaxi service that runs from the St Mark's Piazza which is about 5 mins walk from the hotel. Location is great and the hotel is accessible. Aside from that, I wouldn't spend an hour at this place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our travel agent suggested the Kette for its' proximity to San Marco Square. Spent 2 nights Oct. 6 & 7 before our cruise. Hotel was adequate for our needs but a little too expensive. The room was small and did NOT have a view of the canal as we would have liked. Bathroom is nice and modern. Breakfast was good but I agree with other reviews that the breakfast room is too small. Very good coffee. Got a map from the front desk which was very helpful getting around. Took a water taxi from the back door of the Kette to the ship which cost 90E, pricey but at least we didn't have to walk the streets with all our luggage.</p></li>

A 5 minute walk to Basilica San Marco in St. Mark's Square, which is not to be miss in your trip!! Just around the corner on the Grand Canal you will find vendor shopping, canal side eateries and many tours taking you to Murano, Burano and Torcello. Not to mention the gondola rides that take you through the meandering canals that make up beautiful, romantic VENICE!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Staff were friendly and helpful no matter what time of day or night. the breakfast had enough choice .The location is good and near to good restaurants,shopping and main attractions. You can get the water bus from airport to san marco and the walk to hotel is approx 10mins but you will need a map. you can get a water taxi to the hotel cost approx 100 euros. The rooms are clean although only 1 plug for those essential hair straightners so no TV whilst straightning hair!! I would use this hotel again ..I had my Mum with me and trust me if she was impressed by the staff they were definatley doing it right !! Well Done all at Hotel Kette xx</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our room was very clean and nicely decorated although quite small, but this is Venice and you don't go there to sit in your hotel room! The size of the room was more than offset by the enormous balcony (about 30 feet X 25 feet) that went with it - so ask for room 501. We sat out there most nights before going to bed and didn't get eaten by any bugs and these were hot July nights. The hotel itself is a typical old Venetian hotel with lovely decor. We found the staff to be pleasant and helpful, especially the guy on night duty in reception. The hotel is very quiet and is nicely situated for doing all the touristy bits in and around Venice. Would certainly recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from a four night stay at Hotel Kette and thought the hotel was fabulous. We had a lovely room overlooking the canal, which runs down one side of the hotel building. Both the room and the bathroom were a good size (though I understand that the room sizes do vary a little). The staff were very friendly and helpful, particularly in relation to helping us make dinner reservations in Venice. I would definitely stay there again. One point: some people have suggested that the electrical sockets in the rooms can't be used. I don't know what they're talking about: our room had european sockets, as you'd expect to find in Italy, and we could use them very easily with a travel adaptor.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my first trip to Venice and did not know what to expect. Had been recommended the Kette by travel agent and did not let us down. The room was immaculate - wish I had had a bath as well as a shower though - and nothing was too much trouble for the staff. Also, it was just about possible to fill up with enough breakfast to last you most of the day if you wanted, a good selection of cereals, meats, cheeses, rolls, croissants, fruit, juices, coffees, yoghurts and cakes. And as for the location - it could not have been better. Just five mins from San Marco square and all the shops - but lovely and quiet all the time. And the aircon was good too! Thanks too all at the Kette for making the stay so enjoyable.</p></li>

The hotel was at first hard to find but with a little luck it only taken 15mins from the time we had landed. On arrival we were greated with a smile and gladly welcomed into the hotel at close to mid-night so that was greatly appricated. The room was nicely laid out but was disappointed to find that the bed was two singles pushed together, this was not what i call romantic and only serves to make it easier for the hotel to change from a (double) to two signles. When tryin to go around the town it is a good location as it only takes 10-15 mins to reach St Marks Square. I would definatly recommend the hotel to any of my friends.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was very centrally located. Very quaint. We had a corner room, with a view of the canal. It was amazing. Our stay was perfect. The front desk was very obliging. I would totally stay there again and strongly recommend it to friends. The view and location is what we loved best. We felt totally comfortable with taking our afternoon nap here before setting off for the evening dinner and stroll. It was very nice to stay off the main canal - since it was located on a smaller canal it was much quieter, so when we did want to nap or sleep it was perfect. The breakfasts that are included with the rooms are never that great anywhere you go, so that was pretty standard (we don't ever typically do breakfast at our hotel anyway/where).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a two night trip to see a concert in the main square. The Kette was superbly located for this, in a quiet setting 2 minutes walk away. I personally wouldn't return there due to the uncomfortably hard beds and lumpy pillows (my son agrees with me on this). The room we had, #222, was tiny. It was clean and nicely decorated though. Breakfast was ok, usual assortment of breads, pastries ham and cheese, and that strange "coffee" that only seems to surface at breakfast time wherever you go. Breakfast area was over-filled with tables, leading to an irritating lack of space. Decent bathroom, helpful staff. Location is the biggest plus for this hotel, although I am sure there are more comfortable establishments in the same area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good standard of accommodation but there were two large rooms given over to use as lounges while the two small rooms used for the buffet breakfast were hopelessly inadequate for the number of guests, both in size, table numbers and space between tables. Arriving for breakfast we were invariably unable to find two clean tables to seat our party of four. There were in total only two tables at which four guests could sit together and the poor group of seven who came down to breakfast had to virtually sit on each other's knees. The variety of food on the buffet was very limited and platters were frequently almost empty. Waiting staff frequently had to be asked to clear tables, replace empty platters etc, and could not be said to do it with good grace.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from staying at the Hotel Kette in Venice for 3 nights (25th - 28th March). I would recommend staying in the hotel to anyone, the staff were very friendly and welcoming. Our bedroom was a good size and had a lovely powerful shower. I would recommend NOT to pay more for a superior room as there in work going on near the canal and there is not point paying more. We paid for a standard room adn could see the Canal and Gondolas go past! Breakfast was good, croissants, rolls, cereal, orange juice etc etc. Only problem is that is gets quite full at about 9am, so go there before or after and you'll be fine!! The hotel is in the most fantastic location - just off the smartest street in Venice, with Gucci, Valentino and D&G on your doorstep!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and my girlfriend spent 2 nights at the Hotel Kette in January 2007. Even though the Hotel is only about 2 minutes from the st Marks square it isn't the easiest to find. However that would be the only disadvantage i would say about this great hotel. Once you've remembered where the hotel is, you realise just how perfect its location is, 2 minutes from marks square, and seconds from shops and restaurants. The staff were really friendly and always were willing to help. The breakfast was better than what we expected, lots of fruit, bread and cold meats. The room we had was excellent, the beds were comfortable, the ensuite shower room was very nice, and our room overlooked one of the canals. I will recommend this hotel anyone visiting Venice it truely is a great hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from a short break in Venice where we stayed at the Kette Hotel, which is in the San Marco area. It was just faboulous, the staff were very helpful, the room had a double aspect view of the little canal. We could watch the Gondolas float past with the ocasional serenade, which was really romantic. The Hotel is friendly, quirky and in a lovely quiet position, and we thoroughly enjoyed it! We found that eating in the San Marco area was very expensive and usually not very good at all. There are some lovely restaurants along the Grand Canal, which are very reasonable and very good because I guess there is more competition. The best meal we had was at the Metropole Hotel( you may have to book) It was also one of the cheapest! It was pure luxury and the food was outstanding!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 3 nights and found the hotel to be clean, centrally placed and ideal for walking round Venice. Approximately 5 minutes from the San Marco drop off for the airport public water taxi, the hotel was easy to find and located in a nice area. Also around 5 minutes from San Marco so just far enough away to avoid the hustle and bustle of the crowds. Don't be disappointed with the lack of views around the hotel - not many of the hotels in Venice have views. Our room (416) was quiet and of a reasonable size. The hotel has two lifts so no problems getting up and down. Stay clear of San Marco when looking for places to eat - head to Dorsoduro and find one of the many street cafes and don't be frightened to head down small narrow alleys - great fun to explore and amazing what you see.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">No free internet, but we paid 5 Euro for 24 hours access, which is not too bad. There is a free breakfast buffet that is decent. Rooms were fairly large by European standards. The hotel also includes a tour to Murano to see the glass blowing factory. You get to see a demonstration, and then they try to sell you the glass work. There's no pressure to buy the pieces, and it's a good chance to experience the water taxi ride (which is usually very expensive) for free (1-way). Just catch the water bus on the way back. You can walk to everything from the hotel's central location. We arrived via train to Venice, then took the water bus through the grand canal from the train station to the hotel. Getting from the hotel to the airport took over an hour on the water bus, so budget plenty of time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed 3 nights at the Hotel Kette and overall I was left fairly disappointed as they could easily have done so much better. Unlike some of the other reviews on here, I found the staff to be very helpful and friendly. That and the fantastic location is where the good times end. The rooms were noisey, both from a poor air-con system and from a building site, not ten feet from our window. The bed linen looked well past its sell by date and the bed cover looked like it needed a good wash. The breakfast for a '4 star' hotel was possibly the worst I have ever had, no hot food, pathetic service and a 'fresh' fruit cocktail straight out the tin. To top it all, the fresh juices were like paint stripper. For the price you are expected to pay, I cannot believe you wouldn't find better elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is just 2 minutes from St Marks and within easy walking distance of the main attractions of Venice. Arriving by vaparetto, it is just a few hundred yards, including one set of steps over a canal, from the Valermossa vaparetto stop. Comfortable and quiet, apart from bells at 7am on Sunday morning (which are part of the charm of Venice), the hotel is a good base for sight-seeing. Without its own restaurant there are no cooked breakfasts but it has a range of cereals, meats, cheese, rolls, croisants, toast, yogurts and fruits. The only critisism is that the breakfast room tables are close together, good for sociability, and the room cannot accomodate all guests at one sitting when the hotel is full, so you may have to wait for a table. Staff are helpfull and welcoming and the hotel is well run.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in Kette Hotel for 6 nights in November. The staff were reasonably friendly but quite stand-offish at times. A downside was the alleged cocktail bar, which actually only served beer- the usual barman was off sick so service was very limited. The room was a decent size, but unfortunately overlooked a large scaffolded area (this was an upgraded room)- we asked to change rooms but were told the hotel was full, despite us never never actually seeing another guest. The room had very little in the way of natural light and tended to be pitch dark even during the day. However, location was very convenient, a sohrt walk to all the major sites. Having said that, if I went back to Venice I would definitely pick a different hotel, there is so much competition and I just don't feel the Hotel Kette can compete.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very disappointed in this hotel. The beds in the rooms are extremely old and following our second night had to ask for extra boards (as they didn't have a spare mattress) to put underneath the mattress to stop the bed from sinking. Very squeaky springs! Also the rooms were very warm as the air conditioning doesn't work and if you open the windows you end up with a room full of mozzies. Had to pay for wi fi which we found quite surprising as we have not had to pay anywhere else on our European holiday. Also had to pay if we wanted to use the safe in our room. There is no power point in the rooms if you wish to charge phones, laptops or use hairdryers using a converter. Breakfast was very average, no fresh fruit available and disappointing in every aspect. We are surprised that this hotel has been given a four star rating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The kette was a lovely Venice hotel. Very pricey!!! But isn't everything in Venice?? I found the fact that you pay over $300 a night but aren't offered decent maps or complementary water taxi to the train station SHOCKING. They expect you to pay over $100 for one way to the station. Seriously. (note you can hop on a water bus for about $6 a person at a close by square- but they won't tell you that) I did find it to be a very nice hotel overall. Don't rely on staff to help you find your way around or openly chit chat or anything. The map provided is worse than having no map at all. (but Venice is a maze itself so you will get lost no matter what) Don't get me wrong- I liked it. But the only way to really describe it is "uppity" or "snotty". Lovely bathrooms - large and almost American (which is very hard to come by in Europe).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from 4 nights stay at the Kette Hotel in Venice. Great Location, 5min walk to San Marco Piazza, but far enough away to be very quiet at night. We had a superior room on the 4th floor overlooking the canal, definitely book one of these as they are really nice and spacious rooms and have a great view of the boats going by. Hotel is very clean and tidy, good polite and helpful staff. Breakfast was included in the price and was your typical continental style, ie. ham, cheese, bread and croissants, but was more than adequate. There's a great restaurant called Vino Vino, 2mins walk from the hotel (turn right out of hotel and cross over bridge, restaurant is on the corner). You can't book, so you may have to wait, but worth it. Food and service is excellent. Would highly recommend this hotel and would be more than happy to stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked the hotel direct, you get a discount on early reservations and you still dont have to pay up front. We went for a superior room and it was good- size was ok, beds were comfortable but the elusive hotel soft pillow still alluded us, the bathroom worked with plenty of hot water. Overall the standard is fresh, clean, nice marble and units in the bathroom good standard. Style is antiquey, stirpey wallpaper, dark wood, subtle bed curtains see photos, not to my taste, and strangely the bed seemed quite low to the floor, but hey this is picky, It was fine, no complaints. Breakfeast was good, all that you expect, rolls hams, juices etc, - very good. Location excellent for either a first time in Venice or you need to be near a central location. Staff on desks were efficient and organised- in line with the Austrian background to the hotel i guess.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Clean rooms with air con/heating that you control. Really good breakfast - self service apart from tea/coffee. Limited drinks menu but reasonable prices for Venice. Reception desk helpful, but could appear aloof. Internet facilities allow you to pre-book your return seats, saving a lot of queing. Good mix of guests from many countries. Not all British. Near St Marks and the vaporetti. Sit on the right hand side when approaching Marco Polo for a wonderful aerial view of Venice. From airport use service bus to Piazza Roma and then vaperetto for the cheapest transport. Don't be tempted with water taxi (unless included in your package). Venice is WONDERFUL - trek around and find all the guide book favourites. Eating out is VERY EXPENSIVE try and find Roberto's or Vino Vino for reasonable priced meals. McDonalds makes for the cheapest lunch by miles!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed in Kette for 3 nights first week of August. At the beginning we were given room overlooking construction, but once requested a change, were given room overlooking the canal. What a joy to keep windows open and get up with the gondoliers' songs: "chao, chao bambino". People that criticize breakfast, probably not aware that European breakfast is traditionally just coffee and croissant. This one had offered an exceptionally great choice of food and fantastic coffee. Staff is friendly (again by European standards). We, in Canada are killing ourselves to please customers, and we are surprised people in Europe don't. We have to remember that tourists will come there forever and ever, and who would come to London, Ontario? At last, I would recommend to spend some extra and get superior room. This might be a deal breaker how one perceive this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in an excellent quiet location, about a 5 minute walk to Piazza San Marco and 10 minutes to the Rialto Bridge. The hotel's staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast was excellent by Italian standards and is included in our room rate. Our corner room had views of the small canal through smallish windows that open but the truth is that you don't spend very much time in your room so you'll have to make a decision as to whether or not the difference in price is worth it. Remember you are surrounded by canals wherever you walk. The room was a little dated and could use some upgrading like better mattress and pillows. But having said that, we slept like babies. In this price category, we felt that it was 'worth' the money according to Venice prices. We ate most of our dinners at restaurants along the Grand Canal beside the Rialto Bridge.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a 5 day trip to Venice during the Carnaval. We stayed at the Kette for four nights and were very pleased with the hotel. Our room overlooked a small canal, the furniture is classical Venetian style and very romantic. Though the room was small, it was cosy and spotlessly clean. The bathroom is well-appointed , with green marble floor and towel-warmer. The staff was efficient and very polite. We ended our stay asking them to order for us a water-taxi which arrived in minutes and fetched us from the back door of the hotel directly to the airport. The location of Kette is ideal : central, easy to find yet quiet. Nothing could be better for Venice. During the long days of the Carnaval we could come back for a short rest at the hotel and then return to Piazza San Marco in a few minutes. I highly recommend this hotel! Very good reward for your money!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a 4 day 10th Wedding Anniversary trip to Venice. We stayed at the Kette Hotel for four nights and were very pleased with this hotel. Our attic room (501) was medium sized and clean, we did however have the only room with direct sole access to the hotels large roof terrace - excellent roof top views inc St Marks Tower, especially at sunset and sunrise. Both the room and bathroom were well-appointed and the hotel staff were efficient and very polite. The continental breakfast was typical, but above average - only downside was that the breakfast room was relatively small and was awkward when busy. My wife (but not me nor my bank manager) was also pleased with the extensive designer shopping on offer nearby! The location of the Kette is ideal: central, and easy to find (well some days it was! - if you didn`t get lost in the maze of streets). I would highly recommend this hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel for a hen weekend with 11 women and we all had a great time. Out of all 6 rooms none of us had a problem and all seemed very happy. The rooms were very clean, and nice modern bathrooms. I think a couple may have had trouble with the hot water from the shower being intermittent but our room was fine. Breakfast was really lovely with fresh, still warm from the oven, croissants and fresh fruit, cheese & ham, preserves, cereal, tea and coffee. It's a small room though so get down early to avoid having to queue to get in. We were up and out early though because there was so much we wanted to do. The location is absolutely great. Less than 5 mins to St. Marks Square and within easy reach of everything. We got a water taxi from the airport direct to the hotel door which was perfect. One tip....don't have coffee in St. Marks Square. It was a total rip off at about Â£14 each for just a coffee!</p></li>

Don't you ever go to the restaurant beside the hotel called Vino Vino and neither to the sort of 5 stars restaurant adjacent to the Vino Vino. We accidentaly went to the Vino Vino on the 24rh where we were very badly served and treated by a crazy waiter, shouting and screaming at his colleagues and very agressive with us. He did not speak English Correctly and did not speak French, unfortunately we did not speak Italian well ! We paid 80â‚¬ for a meal eaten under stress where the Lasagna were cold, served without parmesiano neither a knive & fork, plus the veal was so thiny that we left this hotel hungry !!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location and easy to find with the directions that they provided. The interior of the hotel was exactly what I expected, detailed wood paneling and tons of marble. The staircase up to the rooms goes pretty high, we were on the third floor, but there is an elevator if you want to avoid the stairs. Our room was perfect, it overlooked a small canal. The breakfast was good, a nice variety of items, and they have extremely strong coffee, which was perfect for helping me with my jet lag. The staff at the hotel was very attentive and friendly. The location is perfect, it takes a couple minutes to walk to Piazza San Marco, and maybe five to the Rialto Bridge, depending on the amount of people walking around. The San Marco water ferry stop is only a couple of minutes away as well. Around the hotel are quite a few high end designer stores, with great window displays. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and if I ever go back to Venice, I will stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at this hotel in our 2 nights @ Venice recently. First of all it was a bit of a challenge for us to drag our medium sized suitcases (14 days in Italy hence..) over the luggage unfriendly bridges near San Marco, when we managed to get to the street there was no sign for San Moise street since there is a construction going on in the building on front of the hotel. Remember take the lane opposite GUCCI showroom near San Marco Square. Or look for signs for Hotel San Moise rather than Kette. Entry : well decorated like many of the hotels in Venice. Rooms : Bit tight, walls are decorated in Antique fashion. Good bathroom. Funnily had to take the elevator to 4th floor to get to our room on 3rd (a kind of Harry potter like 3.5th floor) perhaps the portion of building with our rooms has sunk a bit. Hotel Staff: Was very courteous. Overall a good experience, but would have expected a bit more for the high price you pay for overrated location near San Marco Square.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family of 5 stayed at the hotel for 3 nights at the beginning of June. The rooms were small, but clean and the bathroom was a pleasant surprise - roomy, clean, with good lighting, mirrors, and a hairdryer. Our room was a double on the 3rd floor that had a view of a canal below. It was nice to watch the gondolas go by and to pass our windows when we went for our gondola ride. However, our triple room only had a view of the small street below, which was okay, but the canal was better. The location was the best. It was such fun to walk all over Venice and to just be able to pop over to St. Mark's Square was great. The breakfast was fine and the staff, although not very friendly, was helpful when asked. I would certainly stay here again and recommend the Kette Hotel to others. Also, we - 2 adults and 3 teenagers - had several wonderful meals in Venice, but one restaurant I would recommend is Antico Pignolo. The atmosphere was great, the staff was wonderful and the food was delicious!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Kette Hotel is well-located and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The ground-floor public rooms are pleasant enough to lounge around in. The bedrooms are small and somewhat claustrophobic, and laughably short of storage space. The bathrooms are tiny but well-appointed, despite the lack of shower curtains. The air-conditioning in our room was very effective - a must in Venice. If you choose to take the hotel's complimentary (one-way) water-taxi to the glassworks in Murano, then be warned! You will be met off the water-taxi by a pushy salesman who will let you watch the glass-blowing demonstration then take you into a display area and will suddenly turn unpleasant if you choose not to buy anything. Worth a miss. Back in the hotel, breakfast is adequate but unexciting and served in a room that is about half the size it should be to accommodate everybody. I suggest you get in early! All in all, a reasonable hotel - probably not the best in Venice but certainly not the worst.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel after it was recommended to us by friends and it didnâ€™t disappoint. We had a â€˜Superior Roomâ€™ which was lovely. We had asked for a room that overlooked the canals and thatâ€™s what we got â€“ right on the corner so we could see all the way down the canal and could hear and watch the guys singing on the gondolas! The room was lovely, with a comfortable bed (pillows not so great) and a huge bathroom. Unfortunately the only power points were being used by the TV and the fridge so we had to unplug the TV when we had to charge things. The hotel staff were happy to help and provided us with some great dining options. Breakfast was OK but nothing too flash for those of us used to â€˜big breakfastsâ€™. From memory we had to pay 10 euro a day for WiFi which is annoying. The hotel is in a perfect location (though can be hard to find â€“ like everything else in Venice!), easy walk to the big attractions. Would definitely recommend, just make sure you ask to be on the canal side.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I have just returned from a 5 night stay in Venice at the Kette Hotel and thoroughly enjoyed it. We got an Alilaguna boat from the airport to the San Marco stop, which was 12 euros per person and took appoximately 1 hour and 10 minutes. The hotel was a 5 minute walk away from the stop. When we arrived the receptionist and the porter were both extremely helpful and friendly. We were on the 3rd floor and the room was a good size with a nice bathroom. There was a good selection for breakfast although the room was slightly cramped. I particularly liked the coffee!! Top 3 restaurants for dinner: 1) La Caravella - just a short walk away, great service and good seafood. 2) Bacaro Jazz - Near Rialto, a lively place with a good selection of food. 3) Masaniello - located in San Stefano square, great food and excellent service I thoroughly recommend staying at the Kette. I also recommend a day trip to Burano and Torcello. We also saw the 4 seasons by Vivaldi just off San Marco and it was great.</p></li>

I highly recommend this hotel, it is in the best location to see all of what Venice has to offer. I found this hotel to be better than I anticipated. The second floor room (226 with a bath as well as a shower) had the perfect view from two windows, was clean and comfortable and the staff were very helpful. My first trip to Venice and a good hotel helps to make a good holiday. The only problem I had was finding the hotel on the first day, I soon realised that I was not alone with this problem, every day I saw people with suitcases and map in hand looking for their hotel and not just the Kette. It was perfectly situated, because of my illness I have to rest often so with the hotel being in the centre of everything I could go back during the day for a rest and then set out again in the afternoon. I saw more of Venice than I thought I would be able to and I believe the comfort and position of this hotel was the main factor.</p></li>

Our room overlooked a canal where the gondalas came past with their cargo of tourists and the sound of bells from the campanile in St Mark's Square completed the atmosphere that is uniquely Venice. The only changes I noticed were the designer name shops of Gucci , Chanel , Louis Vuitton , Fendi , and many more ( hide your credit cards if you wish ) which were all within a few moments walk of the hotel , as indeed is St Marks' . We could go out for the day exploring streets and squares full of wonderful architecture , returning to the hotel to shower and change. Then dine at one of many restaurants nearby and end the night having coffee and listening to an orchestra in the square before strolling back . There is so much more to see in the surrounding areas , one needs more than the few days we enjoyed so much.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Found a good last minute deal on Octopus but wanted to make it special so I emailed them and they upgraded me to a Deluxe Room (Number 501) for a small extra fee. This room is very nice with a nice big bed, TV, fridge and chairs. The bathroom is lovely with a nice deep bath and all the trimmings. Whats made the room so special though was the lovely private terrace attached to this room - not sure if any other rooms have anything similar. The terrace was twice as big as the room itself and had views over the city, you can see St Marks bell tower and the top of the Basillica which is only 300 metres away. Its a perfect spot for having breakfast (which we went out and bought ourselves at 20% of the price you would pay in the hotel) and enjoyed it sitting in our bathrobes! Its also a great spot for a bottle of wine or chamapgne in the afternoon... Location is great, in San Marco, not far from the ferry stop. Cost was reasonable considering it was Venice! Staff were ok. They were very helpful when emailing them to get the upgrade.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 3 nights at the Kette and were delighted with it. Our choice had a lot to do with the hotel being in a quiet area. When we arrived earlier than the regular check-in time our room was ready. The hotel knew we wanted a quiet room and mentioned it was not on the canal for that reason which was fine with us. Yes, the room was small but in terms of large cities it was fine with a bathroom that had bathtub with a shower and a glass door versus the usual shower curtain. The bed was comfortable but I did bring my own pillow after reading about pillows being hard in Italy and I was glad I did. The breakfast room was small as noted in reviews but we always found a seat and there was plenty of choice in food. We had no trouble finding the hotel from the map on the web site and the location is excellent. We would stay here again. In tems of Venice the price of food is shockingly high and everywhere else in Italy seems a bargin. The most important thing is to get to the remote areas where the locals live to really enjoy the feel of Venice away from the crowds.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Kette Hotel is a four star hotel, but is very clean and neat. we felt very vey confortable at this hotel. Our room was big and just precious, romantic and inspiring. The bathroom was big and beautiful, well loaded with everything needed to make us feel great. This trip was to us as a second honeymoon and it accomplished the porpuse very nicely, we are glad we stay at his hotel, centrally located and at the same time away from the canal noises. One thing very important about The Kette HOtel is very well located, centrally located, literally just 5 minutes away from every important site all tourist must visit in Venezia: San Marks Piazza, Rialto Bridge. The Bridge of Sights, The Beautiful Cathedral of San Marks, and many other atractions in Venezia. And also, is just steps away from the shopping district and many good restaurants. The Kette Hotel is a great deal especially they breakfast is just delicious. There is nothing bad about this hotel. We may not be able to list everything we should but we do recommend The Kette Hotel and certainly we will go back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was surprised to read some of the recently posted bad reviews of this hotel, because my husband and I have nothing but good things to say! We recently returned from our honeymoon in Italy, and concluded our trip in Venice at the Kette. Our room looked like a hotel room in a palace, very large for a European hotel room, ornately decorated with 2 chandeliers and Roman columns! We even had a complimentary bottle of champagne waiting for us there (thanks to our travel agent for telling them it was our honeymoon). The location was unbeatableâ€”a 2-minute walk from St. Marcâ€™s Square, right on one of the smaller canals. The staff was pretty helpful (although not the most friendly), and there was internet access in the lobby (for a fee). The breakfast here was a buffet (not American) breakfast, with various cookies and cakes, croissants, yogurt, fresh fruit and cereal. They also served you espresso with steamed milk so you could make your own cappuccinos!I would strongly recommend this hotel for anybody who is interested in visiting Venice because it really had it allâ€”quality and location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 3 nights at the Hotel Kette. With lack of directions on hotel confirmation papers, we took almost 1 hour to find the place. When reading addresses in Venice, the name following the number, is the area or island that the business in on. The second name is the street name. Long story short, if you're in San Marco with your back facing the canal, head left, straight out of San Marco. There is a Louis Vuitton shop on the right; keep heading straight past all the designer shops and over 1 bridge. The second and third alley will take you to the Hotel Kette, located on S. Moise. We had a larger room (201), with 10 foot ceilings and a canal view. It was so nice to watch gondola riders strolling by and once in a while treated to an accordian and singer. The room was clean, as was the bathroom. Take advantage of the complimentary water taxi to Murano. After that, you're on your own if you want to go to Burano and back to Venice. If you're flying out of Venice, you have to pay 100 euros for the private water taxi to shuttle you to the airport drop off point. Men with hand trucks greet you and offer you a 20 euro ride to the airport. Don't take it! Just walk it (took under 10 minutes on flat, smooth, semi-covered walkways).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is tucked away into a little side street, a very short walk from all the designer stores--and just yards away from hotels that charge far more for a room. We usually stay in four-star hotels and we were quite satisfied with this one. One warning--no map is going to be able to direct you to this place when you first arrive. If this is your first trip to Venice, you will realize--as we did--that part of the charm of the city is the winding, twisting roads that hold all kinds of interesting discoveries. It took a lot of walking with our luggage--and asking the natives--before we finally discovered the hotel. All the people at the front desk were friendly and spoke English very well. They will ask you to turn in your key each time you leave. One night we took a day trip to Tuscany, and we actually got scolded when we returned to the hotel the next day--the front desk guy said he was very worried since we didn't tell him we were staying overnight somewhere else. Our room was pretty small, like we expect in Europe, but we had a nice view out our window of the canal below. The breakfast was pretty basic, but since it was included in the price, we weren't complaining. We would stay here again. Mary and MIke St. Paul, MN</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at hotel Kette around 01:00 (a lazy 7 hours late thanks to our train from Paris breaking down at Modane) which was a bit stressful for a couple of "first time in Italy" Australians who suddenly found themselves not knowing where we needed to go and not having a taxi driver to assist however the night manager gave us good information on the phone and then smoothly checked us in and made us feel at home when we arrived. The rooms were clean and (once I worked out the external shutters) light and airy. Our room had only a limited view of the canals but that didn't detract from our experience. All the staff were helpful during our stay and the location in San Marco is first rate. San Marco does seem to be the pick of the districts to stay in (based on walking pretty much over all the island on both sides of the grand canal) and hotel Kette is ideally placed. I had read a few negative reviews before we arrived and was a little apprehensive but nothing in our experience matched the negative reviews. In common with most hotels in France and Italy at we stayed at, the lifts are very small and the rooms lack a separate shower but these are minor complaints. We would certainly stay there again on any future return to Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Kette because our travel agent got us a deal. It was o-kay. Few things. 1. The front desk took our passports upon check in and hung onto them for an entire day - until the next day. We didn't encounter this anywhere else is Europe. Is that normal? 2. The bathroom only has one outlet - and it's specifically for electric shavers. No other appliances are allowed/work in the bathroom. I had to blow dry my hair in a corner on the floor of the room. If I had known that fact alone, I would not have stayed here. 3. We could not figure out how to shower and not get water all over the floor. We used all our towels every morning, mopping up the mess. 4. They make you return your hotel key before you leave the hotel. Again, is this normal? Maybe it is, and we don't know. But thought it was strange. 5. The only have one iron for the entire hotel. If no one is using it, you're in luck. If not, then you're out of luck. 6. Supposedly this hotel is 4 stars. I guess by European standards? I would rate it a 2.5 in the states or at least in LA. Maaayyybe a 3. Definetly not 4. It was great having a water dock and not having to drag our luggage through out Venice, but if we go back - we're not staying here again. It was just o-kay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a lovely 4 night stay at this hotel and the only fault we could find was the rather hard bed in our room but don't know if this was standard or just that we were unlucky.Another minor observation was that the breakfast room was rather small for the number of rooms in the hotel so this could be a problem in the busy summer months.For those of you who don't need a cooked breakfast in the morning then the choice on offer was ideal.The Hotel is ideally situated for shops and restaurants but there again most of the hotels in Venice are because you will not be very far from the many Waterbus stops in the city.I would recommend purchasing a Venice Card at the airport which gives you unlimited access to all the waterbuses and for a small extra charge you get access to all the museums,theatres etc.The only thing that surprised me was that I was only asked for my ticket once out of the many trips I took on the waterbus(maybe I just have an honest face).The hotel is not the easiest to find especially in the dark and even the shops not far from the hotel give you a blank look when asked so if that is a concern then you would be best getting a water taxi which takes you right there.I would ceratinly return to this hotel if I returned to Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My two and I were traveling Europe and our agent booked us a room here because of price and location. We met another friend in Venice for the day to tour the city together as she was also traveling through Italy. That particular day the Italian transit went on strike around noon so my friend who met us for the day had no way of leaving the island until the next day at noon when the strike was off. We assumed she would have no problem staying with us in our hotel that night. We came back to Hotel Kette around 11pm and the manager at the front desk had the front door locked. He asked to see all of our ID's which we had but because my one friend did not have a reservation he would not let her in. We tried to explain the situation to him (WAHGHI EL DIN) but he was incredibly ignorant and threatened to not let any of us back in the hotel. We pleaded with him and he ended up charging my friend 200 euros to purchase her own room instead of letting her stay with us. The next morning we were walking down to breakfast and overheard this man (WAGHI EL DIN) mocking us in Italian to his co workers. We were extremely upset and the entire ordeal ruined our trip in Venice. YOUNG TRAVELERS do not stay here. Ignorant, rude, and unaccommodating!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I as well as the group of friends we were travelling with stayed at the Kette hotel for two nights. Tucked behind the La Fenice Opera House it was in a good location very near to St. Marks and many other points of interest in Venice. If you book through Easy Jet be sure to bring a printout of your reservation (aka your voucher). We were treated rather harshly for not having the voucher, told that they could not prove we were who we said we were without it (despite providing out passports and a confirmation number) so just be forewarned. There are probably instructions somewhere to this effect, but nobody in our group managed to glean this information beforehand and the man at the front desk was less than pleased. We were on the fifth floor and our room was nice, but nothing extraordinary. The dÃ©cor was a bit dated but everything was clean and comfortable. We booked the room and breakfast each morning which was well worth it. Lots of choices and everything was delicious. The downstairs has a few â€˜living areasâ€™ that are nice and comfortable and a good meeting place for our party every morning. All in all the hotel was fine for a few days in Venice, nothing to write home about but I wish the staff would have been a little friendlier about the voucher situation (albeit a possible oversight on our part).</p></li>

'disabled-access' friendly.Breakfast is OK; good coffee and lots of it. Terrible tinned fruit..I haven't seen that kind of 'fruit cocktail' since the early 70s ..It's worth reading a bit about what '4 stars' actually means in Italy. BUT , at this time of year...and in spring, I suppose...the hotel is one of the many properties in the San Marco area that is impossible to get into or out of , twice a day and for several hours, without...wellies! I don't mean that there's a bit of water and your shoes will get damp.I mean that the smaller, access, roads to the hotel will be under water and you will have to paddle. You will be able to buy ' disposable' boots at Reception...8Euros a pair. We're glad we decided to take our own boots with us..for their relative 'comfort'. On the 'flooding' question...Since you're going to have to accommodate some level of it anyway, enjoy the ' acqua alta' :)Paddling through the Square and surrounding streets instead of using the temporary walkways is fun and hearing the WW2 sirens indicate the expected level of flooding is quite an experience!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed for 5 days in the Hotel Kette in November 2006. We had a wonderful stay. The hotel is located just a few "blocks" from Piazza San Marco and the vaporetto stop and is even closer to La Fenice opera house. This location makes it ideal for touring the main sites of Venice and it gives ready access to a large number of restaurants. While it is close to the main tourist sights, it is set one block off a main road, so the location is quiet. Our room was relatively large and elegantly furnished, while the bathroom was large and modern. The staff, dressed in tuxedos, was attentive to our needs, including booking reservations for restaurants and for the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua. An advantage of the hotel over some others is that it has two elevators. No need to climb several flights of stairs after rambling around Venice all day. The list price for this hotel is higher than what we usually pay for hotels, but we booked the hotel and flights to Venice as a package using Expedia. This is the first time I have booked a package (Expedia is very flexible in the way that it lets you choose flights and hotels) and I discovered that it is possible to save a substantial amount of money this way. Our only complaint is that we found the mattresses and pillows to be quite firm. Despite this, we thoroughly recommend this wonderful hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">By carefully searching the internet we got a fantastic deal at The Kette Hotel, including a great breakfast â€“ and when we arrived we found that we had been given a suite comprising of lounge, (glass chandelier, table, settee, chairs, mini bar/fridge) bedroom (very large bed, TV, wardrobe, glass chandelier) overlooking a canal with occasional gondoliers singing as they passed by, and en-suite bathroom (toilet, bidet, bath with two showers, hair dryer). The hotel was spotlessly clean and well presented with attentive and helpful staff. Breakfast was buffet style with stacks of foods on offer â€“ including fruit juices, yoghurts, fruit, meats, cheeses, eggs, super cakes, and numerous other items. Fill up at breakfast and you donâ€™t need another meal until the evening! On the down side, the bed was rather firm and the pillow hard. The room lacked drink making facilities (we always take our own kettle), and surprisingly there was no visitor information or tourist map available in the room. Hotel Kette was well positioned a short walk from St Markâ€™s Square. The location was quiet and all the delights of Venice were within easy reach. I do recommend getting a water taxi from the airport to the hotel. It is a great way to arrive Venice and guarantees that you find your hotel. I would happily stay at The Kette again, and would have no trouble in recommending it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 2 nights in room 141. I got a bargain rate on otel.com (A$197 per night) but I think I got what I paid for. Positives: - conveniently located near the vaporetto, you can take either 1 or 82 there and get off at Piazza San Marco - the team was very helpful and pleasant, checking us in and booking a tour - close to Piazza San Marco, only a few minutes walk - close to shops, it's just up the lane from Gucci, what amused me was the street vendors selling fakes brazenly out the front of the authentic high-end shops - clean - tidy room Not so great: - the room was dark and looked onto a wall (as I said, I may have got what I paid for) - the bed was HORRIBLE and dipped in the middle. I would have had to change hotels if we were there for more than 2 nights - there was this 'noise', at first I thought it was drilling but then I think I figured out it was the noise from the elevator going up and down AND we weren't even located near the elevator so the noise carried - the only thing I could see that would equal an 'American breakfast' was a boiled egg. There was also no fresh juices. There were nice pastries, fresh meats, cheeses etc. - there is NO WAY this is a 4 star hotel This was probably the worst hotel room of our one month stay. Thank goodness we had ear plugs. For once in my life I didn't provide feedback to the hotel team directly (to my husband's relief) as I didn't think there was much they can do.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay at the Kette was arranged by a travel agent whose winning streak with accomodations ended here. When we arrived via water taxi, we strolled a short 5 minute walk to the hotel. One of our first impressions of the property was the monstrosity under construction across from the hotel. It's unappealing, blocks light and the work being done to the place generates a great deal of noise throughout the day. Still, once in the Kette, all seemed well in the lobby. It was clearly older but attractive to the eye and the hotel staff was very nice. However, once each couple entered their rooms, you could hear collective shrieks of disgust. One room, a non-superior, was dingy. The carpeting, furniture, linens, etc. all looked tired. The room had a lovely view of a concrete wall. The shower was the size of a coffin. The second room smelled like cigarettes and the carpet looked as if it was stained with the outline of a body. The wi-fi wasnt working though if it were, we would have had to pay to use it. The rooms were so unappealing that we were more than motivated to spend time outside of the hotel. We also hated the location which was too close to the overwhelming crush of tourists who spill into San Marco. We would've preferred one of Venice's more low key, civilized neighborhoods. Though we hated the accomodations, we loved the staff. The gentleman attending to guests in the lounge was particulalry nice. Everyone was helpful.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The best thing about the hotel is the location. It was easily found and was just a stone's throw from St Mark's Square. It is hidden down a back alley so is away from all the noise. It is a nice looking hotel on the inside. My main beef however is regarding the rooms, which are decidedly average. Me and my wife were staying there as part of our honeymoon and we were advised that we'd "probably" be upgraded as a result. We weren't however and when I asked to see one of the 'delux' rooms with a canal view, the room that was presented was not much bigger, with no better facilities, and the 'view' was of a brick wall opposite with a narrow and rather grubby-looking canal visible if you stuck your head out and looked straight down. This room was offered for 50 euros extra per night, then 40, but I declined. Contrary to what a lot of people have said, I thought the breakfast was very good - indeed one of the best and most varied continental breakfasts I have seen. The selection of wine is not so good. I ordered a bottle of red for the room and they had only 1 type of red wine in the hotel which was also decidedly average. If you want some drink in your room I would recommend buying it elsewhere. The staff were efficient and helpful but a bit brusque in their manner although I think this is generally the case in the city. I would summarise that this is mostly an average to fairly good place to stay in Venice, I imagine you could do a lot worse.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 2 nights at the Hotel Kette. We found the hotel easily from the San Marco Waterbus stop. Our room was ready when we arrived so we checked in straightaway which was great. Our room was quite small and looked inwards to nothing much, but it was bright and spotlessly clean, good clean carpets and very comfortable beds. Air-con was very effective at heating the room as it was rather cold in Venice (Feb 1-3). The beds had a lovely wall canopy over them and there was a lovely Murano glass chandelier to light the room â€“ all very regal! The room was very quiet although the marble corridors did mean you hear the very occasional tap of feet as people go to their rooms but this was not a problem. The bathroom was the tiniest Iâ€™ve ever seen but fully functional and spotlessly clean and heavenly WARM thanks to the heated towel rail! Apart from shavers, for which there was a specific plug, the plugs in the room would not accommodate our 2 pin plugs â€“ someone else said in an earlier review that they were not â€œallowedâ€� to charge things up so maybe thatâ€™s why these hybrid 2/3 pin sockets have been fitted? But please donâ€™t let this put you off staying at this lovely hotel. Staff were friendly and very polite and there was a good cold breakfast buffet and nice public rooms. The Hotel was very convenient - just 2 minutes walk from Piazza San Marco, and 2 seconds from La Fenice Theatre. We got an excellent price considering it was Carnival and we would definitely return to this hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose the Kette on our travel agent's recommendation, backed up by the reviews on Trip Advisor. We thought about private water taxi v public vaporreto and as we had 4 pieces of luggage, chose the private taxi (thank goodness). We were quoted 90 euros but we found a Canadian couple to share and got it down to 65 euros - well worth it. The ride into Venice was brilliant and the water taxi dropped us at the back entrance of the hotel. The Kette is a small hotel but very well presented and beautifully furnished. The staff - in particular, the front desk, were excellent - extremely couteous, efficient and very helpful - I would give them a 5 blob rating. The breakfast is as described by other reviewers - perfectly adequate in a smallish dining room but everyone seemed to get a seat and there was plenty to set you up for the day. The location is superb - just a couple of minutes from St Mark's Square. The only problem (for me) is that to get there, my wife and I had to walk past all the major designer shops - Gucci, Prada, Fendi, Valentino, Ferragamo etc; I was able to resist - she wasn't. Why not 5 blobs overall? Only because the room, while very well decorated and finished, was really small and the view from the windows was of a brick wall (Room 141). Did it ruin our enjoyment? Not in the slightest but that's what stopped us rating the Kette with a 5. Venice was absolutely magical and in 4 days, we barely scratched the surface. We will definitely come to Venice again and would certainly choose the Kette again.</p></li>

<li>The only problem (for me) is that to get there, my wife and I had to walk past all the major designer shops - Gucci, Prada, Fendi, Valentino, Ferragamo etc; I was able to resist - she wasn't.</br></br></li>
<li>Why not 5 blobs overall?</br></br></li>
<li>Only because the room, while very well decorated and finished, was <span style="background-color:#808000">really small</span> and the view from the windows was of a brick wall (<span style="background-color:#808000">Room</span> 141).</br></br></li>
<li>Did it ruin our enjoyment?</br></br></li>
<li>Not in the slightest but that's what stopped us rating the Kette with a 5.</br></br></li>
<li>Venice was absolutely magical and in 4 days, we barely scratched the surface.</br></br></li>
<li>We will definitely come to Venice again and would certainly choose the Kette again.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Unlike the previous contributor, I have not had the pleasure of travelling the world, but would like to say that in our experience, travelling to Venice with extended family, that we were very happy with the value we got for the three night stay in this hotel. We found the rooms adequate for a family of any height or size. The decor of the rooms would n't appeal to all tastes as they are not 'corporate image' looking bedrooms and I expect some would find them to be dated.. The location is really great. You are in the thick of it all/Venice and so near everything. During our stay there was fresh fruit available each day at the buffet. It's not as extensive a choice as you'd get in a hotel chain buty there was plenty of cereals, bread, cheese and meats and these were replaced. We came down to breakfast early each day so that may have contributed to our experience here. The hotel has a charm that we enjoyed. If you pay 'big' money for a hotel in Venice or indeed anywhere - you'll get a big room, big breakfast and big smile/greeting. Opinions differ around hotels - but I like to read contributions where the contributors resist from being rude in expressing their opinions - while 'drawf' is a technical or medical term, there may have been a kinder way to explain the matter over room size. One small matter though.....the hotel bar is lacklustre but there is such a choice outside that you do n't need a swanky joint. This is a small, comfortable hotel that is perfect for visitors to Venice that like to be outside exploring.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a decent hotel and is a great base for exploring Venice, as it's located just a few minutes' walk from St Mark's Square. We found the place from the San Marco water bus stop with no problems, thanks to the excellent hand-drawn map on the hotel's website. Other good points: bedroom was roomy, king size bed was firm but extremely comfy, the continental breakfast was above average and the checkout time of 12pm was appreciated. A few factors stopped me from giving this hotel a higher rating, though. Venice is freezing cold in winter, but the heating had not been turned on inside our room before we arrived at 11pm. We had to fall asleep in our chilly room with the heating on, meaning that we woke up in the early hours in a suffocatingly hot room! The next night was much better, as we heated the room for a couple of hours before bed. We also couldn't get the bathroom heating going on the first night, so this room was very cold until the heater was fixed the following morning. The hand held shower was set up only 10cm above the bathtub on the side, with no shower curtain etc, meaning you either had to sit uncomfortably in the bathtub or spray water all over the room to wash. The bathroom was also in the eaves, which meant that my 5'10" hubby couldn't stand upright in most of the bathroom. And watch out for the bar snacks - we ate half a wrapped cake before we saw a bit had a bit of mould on it, although the hotel can't be blamed for this. Overall the hotel was good, but a few more thoughtful touches would have taken it from good to great.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great location, lovely rooms, helpful staff!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent a long weekend here with my mum and my husband in March 2012 and we loved the hotel! All the staff were helpful, professional and attentive, they spoke good English (sadly our Italian wasn't up to much!). The foyer looked very grand and the rooms were lovely, clean and decorated in a lovely venetian style with grand light fittings and lovely mirrors and pictures. We requested a canal view and it was lovely to open the windows every morning to see boats going past (and hear the gondeliers singing!) The location was fab. 3 mins away from the Vaporetti stop, next to St Mark's Square and in the heart of San Marco. Don't expect a big fancy breakfast though! I'm not a big breakfast eater so I was happy with a bowl of cereal and a piece of fruit however my Mum and Husband were slightly disappointed with the choice and quality of the continental breakfast. There was lots there, eggs, meat, cheese, pastries, fruit, jams, yogurts, cereal etc but a few things including the coffee didn't taste very nice! As it was included in the cost of the hotel though you can't really complain and they definitely didn't go hungry! The breakfast room is also tiny considering the size of the hotel so it's generally best to get down to breakfast by 8am. We turned up at 9.15 on the last day and had to wait in a 5-10 minute queue. The staff were working flat out to get everyone in and out quickly though and the service was excellent. You can purchase wifi at the hotel which worked well and there is a PC with printer that you can use for printing boarding passes if you pay 2 euros to use it for 30 mins. Overall we were extremely happy with our choice of hotel and would recommend Kette to anyone looking for an elegant hotel with good location and helpful staff at a reasonable price!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have no significant complaints about the Kette Hotel. It is superbly located in a quiet backwater within less than ten minutes stroll from St Marks Square and about fifteen minutes from the Rialto Bridge. Its' canalside location enables visitors to arrive directly to the hotel by private transfer from the airport. We were welcomed and shown our room within minutes of stepping off the boat. The hotel appears to be newly decorated and with new carpeting throughout, so it is immaculate. There are two efficient lifts serving the five floors and though the hotel appeared busy, we rarely needed to wait for the lift. Our canal side room was rather small and had only limited storage. There was no chest of drawers, so it was necessary to live out of the suitcase. It was also rather warm for our taste, even though we kept the heating off during our stay. Contrary to some reports, we found the reception desk staff to be very polite, friendly and helpful. The Continental breakfasts were very good and the buffet was continually refreshed. The hotel does not have a restaurant but there is a wide selection in close proximity. We paid an average of 60Euros for dinner for two with a bottle of wine. The Al Falaciani Burreira, (San Marco 353) just off the corner of St Marks Square is friendly and unpretentious, The Tavernetta San Maurizio (San Marco 2619) is small and good but ask for a table with proper chairs. The benches are excrutiatingly uncomfortable! The Trattoria Di Fiore off the corner of Campo Stefano (San Marco 3461) provided the best food we found in Venice. Booking is advisable for all three restaurants in season and the hotel desk will make the arrangements. We thoroughly enjoyed Venice and our stay in the Kette Hotel. We will reccommend the hotel to friends and will use it again on our next visit.</p></li>
