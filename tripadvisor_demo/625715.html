The 2 rooms we stayed in, the lobby / lounge area and above all the service from the staff was great. In addition we liked the fact that we were located close to Champs Elysee but were away from the hustle - bustle. My wife and I had a wonderful time at Jays. We enjoyed our short break. If in Paris, we would choose to stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything you could possibly want for a short stay in Paris. It was great weather so we walked the City and didnt make use of the fantastic facilities. Be great in inclement weather too as you could enjoy the wonderful room and kitchen/lounge facilitys. For the space, comfort and opulence this may look expensive but its 50% less than many leading hotels and we put it at the top of the boutique range.</p></li>

Stephen and Kersey were great and did everything possible to make our 5 night stay a memorable one. My fiancee and I stayed in the Provence suite which is beautiful and huge! While it is not a cheap hotel, it is an excellent value, considering what you get. I would encourage anyone traveling to Paris to choose Jays. All these great reviews are right on point!</p></li>

The staff is very attentive and every evening they surprised us with a collection of fresh fruit and also champagne. The hotel is perfectly located. Rooms are large, comfortable and quiet. The only downside was one restaurant which they recommended, Le Stresa, which was one of the worst restaurants I have been to in my entire life.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and i unfortunately only had one night in Paris on route home but were fortunate to stay at Jays. We were taken care of by the staff with 5 star service. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The hotel is a 3 minute walk to a metro station and has a few nice restuarants close by. One in particular that was recomended by the manager on duty was called ETC just a block away. Although expensive the food and service were outstanding. The staff and management bent over backwards to make our stay a memorable one. We will definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I read all the reviews. I was staying at a hotel which I love but, I thought I'd try this one out because it is number one and it was cheaper then where I was staying (which is rated like 100+). I had the hotel call (the concierge put it on speakerphone for me) and it was really odd. First they quoted 300 euros, then they quoted 420 euros then they said they might have a room (is it possible to 'possibly have a room?). They said there was a suite at 420 which was available but, probably not. C'mon guys either you have a room, or you don't ... who runs this place?</p></li>

Every need I could have had was perfectly anticipated by the excellent staff, even down to the correct socket transformer in the room for my laptop and the weather forecast gently pushed under the door each morning - both unrequested but absolutely essential. I have never experienced quite such attention to detail in such a elegant way.

This should entice you to email the hotel for any special pricing when you're planning on visiting Paris. We have stayed 3 years in a row, and each time we're continued to be amazed by the service of the staff, the impeccable cleanliness and size of the suites, and the overall elegance of the small neighborhood. The location is ideal, surrounded by the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, and Champs Elysee. We will continue to visit Jays Hotel on our visits to Paris!</p></li>

The rooms are really light and airy with plenty of room. We had a conecting room for our kids and appreciated the fact that they decorated the room full of teddy bears etc. The afternoon snacks of fruit went down a treat.

Could any hotel be that good! YES!!! From the moment we checked in to the moment we leaved, the staff and owner of the hotel were at our service. They truly enjoy what they do and they made every effort to make us feel comfortable and at home. Every time we entered the hotel, we were greeted as if we were guests arriving in a private home.

Their attention to detail in both service and decor was a delight! They arranged all of our dinner reservations prior to our arrival. Nothing we asked was too difficult for them. The room was very large and comfortable and spotless! JAYS is the perfect place to stay for a romantic get-a-way or even for business. Just a note, there are three floors with no elevator. This could be a problem for some... We stayed on the third floor and actually enjoyed the walk to our room on the very elegant curved staircase. The FREE WIFI was a real bonus!</p></li>

Housekeeping was outstanding throughout our stay. All the extras spacious suite, big bathroom with tub and shower, heated towel racks, chocolates and fruit plates every evening.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here in July 2009 with three children aged 9, 7 and 5. We had two beautiful adjoining rooms on the first floor (2nd floor in the US) which were wonderfully decorated. We arrived and they were still exchanging the 'grown up' furnishings for the childrens' furnishings to make them feel at home. Teddybears and all. Amazing. Most importantly, the staff were wonderful - really wonderful. Very personal and incredibly proactive in all their attention - plates of fruit, drinks for the kids at all times of the day of night. No need for a babysitter; they will watch the kids and call you if your kids need you. Perfect. It is like visiting with good friends. Highly recommended indeed.</p></li>

I hope I'm a well seasoned traveller and certainly know what to expect in luxury hotels. Jays did not disappoint, suffice to say all you read is correct, Judy and the team are exceptional â€“ I have never stayed anywhere else where the cleaner stopped what he was doing to help me with my bags â€“ this is just one of dozens of cases of our needs being both anticipated and meet almost without asking. The upshot? On checking out from our two night stay I booked a four night one later this year and will probably go back again even before that. I can offer no higher praise.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Maybe I was so excited about the unbelievable reviews of this hotel my expectations were warped. We had no nice greeting champagne or anything offered.....not even a welcome gift in the room. There was no afternoon reception parties that I read about etc. Unless you get the Deluxe rooms, the superior one (Empire) room is tiny! Yes the bed was comfortable but for the amount of money we paid I expected a pure suite. This particular room is also facing the street and was pretty noisy with the traffic. We stayed in a 5 star in Nice that was alot less expensive and the room was gorgeous!!!!! The hotel staff is certainly very very sweet but again I expect to be wowed when I am paying over $500.00 a night for a hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our experience with this hotel started before we even got on a flight, Judy was excellent at communicating via email allowing us the ability to tailor our time in Paris perfectly. Everything from the welcome to the friendly hellos by all the members of staff. Our holiday in Paris was made more memorable by the great restaurants that were picked by Judy and her team and the proximity to all the shops and metro station. specific highlights were the fruit platters each day, the beautiful furniture in the room (Louis XVI), selection of reading material and the cosiness of the whole place. you are greeted everytime you walk in and nothing is too hard for the hotel staff to do. Excellent place, great location, great value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband, our 19-year old daughter and I stayed here for 4 nights and loved every moment. The hotel is immaculate and beautifully appointed. Our room was lovely and comfortable and the staff treated us so warmly. We had planned to stay at a larger chain hotel until I discovered Jays on Tripadvisor and I am so happy that we changed our plans. As others have stated, there were chocolates and fresh fruit in our room each night when we returned from our adventures which was such a treat. More than anything, the staff was extremely helpful and made us feel at home. They provided us with wonderful restaurant recommendations and printed directions when we needed them. I can't say enough good things about our experience at Jays!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Expectations are hard to manage when you're the #1 Trip Advisor rated hotel in Paris! Judy and her staff certainly go out of their way to insure their guests are comfortable and needs are met. Every evening I returned to my room to find a nice fruit plate. My room was a little small, but I was traveling alone and it was fine for me. The room overlooked the street below and there was a small balcony. I pulled out a chair, enjoyed the fruit plate, glass of wine and a good book. At night it was a little noisy but I use ear plugs and eye shades...wasn't a problem. Enjoyed dinner at Victor. Good value and service. Check directly with the hotel for better rate. I called the week before, they had a cancellation and was I given a discount on my room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As world travelers, I use TripAdvisor to plan vacation/business trips for my husband and myself. Comments and reviews on TripAdvisor have been very helpful in this world of lavish websites only to arrive at less than attractive surroundings. You cannot rate service on a hotel website. I've had the opportunity to stay at Jays Hotel in Paris on 2 separate occasions during the past 2 years. Both stays were delightful experiences! The hotel is indeed a five-star, with an extremely attentive staff, in a lovely neighborhood. I cannot understand why anyone would give a poor review of this establishment, especially when Jays Hotel has been the #1 hotel in Paris for so long. If you have never been to Paris or if you love going to Paris, I highly recommend staying at Jays.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel using all the reviews on TripAdvisor and I wasn't disappointed. From the moment you arrive you are greeted with nothing but smiles! Prior to my arrival I coordinated with Jays for tickets to The Louvre and Moulin Rouge and everything was set up when I arrived. The staff was also very helpful with directions to the Metro and bus lines. Everything that Jays did had a personalized touch, from the daily delivery of the days weather report to the coordination of day trips. And the rooms are just gorgeous! It's a shame though because the beds are so comfortable to the point that you don't want to get out of it. There were a few days I had to remind myself that I was in Paris and get out of bed because it was just so cozy. I definitely give it an A+ and look forward to going back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We only stayed for one night and while not inexpensive it was worth every euro. It is not a luxury hotel in appearance perhaps a bit too modern for some but quite comfortable and what's not to love with a Picasso drawing on the wall and coffee or champagne in the afternoon. What stands out about Jays Paris is not only the size of the rooms but the level of care and attention expended on your stay. They know who you are when you walk in and they never stop trying to make your visit a positive one. We were there during the strike and the wonderful concierage on duty had 2 phones up to his ears, his cellphone and he was running out to the street to find us a taxi. We were never just another guest. All the touches are there to make you feel special and the wonderful staff are the icing on the cake.</p></li>

We stayed in room 203 and arguably it was the biggest room i have encountered in over 30 years of travel to Europe. Extremely comfortable ,quiet ( I am not the worlds best sleeper) and with a staff that were very pleasant and eager to please..This was the first time we have stayed in that part of Paris between Champs and the Eifel Tower. I found the area stylish and felt safe in my wanderings at night around the various local restaurants. Yes, i enjoyed my stay there and would certainly return.It is small( 5 rooms )but gives one the feeling of an exclusive apartment block.</p></li>

We had the 2 inter connecting rooms on the top floor. They were large, luxurious and so very comfortable. There was the added bonus of a lounge next door with a fridge and cooking facilities if you wished to use them. The staff went out of their way to make our stay as joyful as possible. They recommended different local restaurants( all of which were fantastic), local markets and interesting streets to visit. The experience was more like staying at some one's fantastic home in the centre of Paris than a large impersonal hotel. If you don't mind not having the trappings of a 5* hotel like 24 hours room service but just want a really fantastic place run by fantastic people this is the place for you!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had a wonderful stay at Jays Hotel. My wife & I booked partly on the basis of it's No. 1 billing with Trip Advisor, and we weren't disappointed. Excellent location close to Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe. We found a huge variety of excellent restaurants close by and used some of the places recommended by the hotel. We were upgraded on arrival (though we didn't realise this at first) to the Asie suite, which was beautiful with a combination of antique furniture and mod cons. The bed was the most comfortable we had ever slept in, with pillows which were beautifully soft and moulded to your head. Although we tended to do our own thing, the staff were extremely helpful - we probably should have used their services more. All in all - an excellent stay - hard to imagine staying anywhere else if we go back to Paris.</p></li>

But above all, it was the staff who were quite exceptional in their warmth and helpfulness in meeting all of our needs. There is so much more we could say but it would be redundant in the light of previous comments. Clearly, this is a hotel that recognises the importance of finding and retaining and excellent dedicated staff, and of providing the highest in quality and service.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and my wife stayed one night at Jays and the hotel is great and highly recommendable. The best is the staff. The are 6 stars out of a five star system. The location is 5 stars and the rooms are also 5 stars. There is no pool or gym, but who needs that when you go to the town of love. Love in wine, love in food and love in your spouse. In Paris you usually have to pay for 5 stars and you have to pay a lot. Sometimes you also pay for a reputation that was valid maybe during de Gaulle or Pompidou, but not anymore. At Jays, you do not need to pay for the 5 stars. You pay for 3 to 4 stars depending on the current offers. The hotel is small, only five suites, so its very peaceful. We will be back! Many thanks Judy, the New Zealand expat who runs the hotel and provides excellent incoming service and also many thanks to the rest of the team! Great job!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As seasoned business and leisure travellers we were cautious about staying at Jays despite the glowing reviews as it was a special occassion. All I can say is that this has to be one of the best city hotels we have ever satyed in and our concerns melted away as soon as we were greeted by the fabulous staff. The suite was just wonderful, outstriped our expectations and the piece and quiet in such a central location was perfect. The staff are spot on - they and attentive, knowledgable and helpful if you need them, but equally unobtrusive if you don't. The location couldn't be better, a few minutes walk from the main attractions. There are plenty of good restaurants and bars near by which are well worth a visit - Jays gives a very comprehensive guide to some of the best. Would we recommend this wonderful oasis and stay again ? Too right we would - go on treat yourself ! !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I won't repeat the details that have been covered so well below: the exceptional staff, the warm, welcoming, familial atmosphere, the great comfort of the rooms. We looked forward to a glass of champagne or a cup of coffee with other guests and staff members at the end of a day--something unthinkable in most hotels. We enjoyed every aspect and every minute of our stay, and we're enormously grateful to Judy and her whole team. The 16th isn't the liveliest district in town: it is wealthy, private, sedate. But the hotel is an easy walk to two different metro lines. We ate most of our meals in the series of great bistros that offer meals for around 30 Euros-La RÃ©galade, L'ami Jean, Christophe, and those are all on the left bank. But it is an easy walk to the Pont d'Alma, and there is a great clump of bistros in the 7th between the Eifel Tower and the Invalides. Highest recommendation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and i stayed at Jays Sept.2 thru 5. Celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary before embarking on a 14 day River cruise of France. What a way to start our trip. We had the smallest room but it was very comfortable and romantic with the 2 big windows that overlook the potted geraniums and a typical Paris street scene. Judy and Staff were most accomodating giving advice, directions and just about anything to help. They arranged a driver to pick us up at the airport which made the transition to Paris seemless. They also arranged taxi service to the Quai where the river boat was docked. The only complaint was something uncontrollable when their neighbors decided to do some construction at 9 am when we wanted to sleep. The breakfast (extra charge) was typical french (croissants, juice coffee tea) but quite enough. We really enjoyed our time at Jays. It was a great way to start our adventure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed in many good hotels around the world both large and small and we would say that Jays was one of the best! They offer the personal touch which is very rare, their attention to detail is fantastic. Before our trip I arranged many things for my partners birthday and Judy was very helpful from balloons in the room to dinner reservations, nothing was too much trouble. All the staff were amazing a lovely warm welcome on arrival and free drinks in the lounge when ever you came back from sight seeing they really do know how to look after their guests. The room was fantastic and the location wonderful just a short walk from all the major places you will want to go and see. I cannot fault this hotel and if you are thinking of staying with them you will not regret it as they will make your stay one to remember. Thank you to all the staff at Jays we hope to visit again soon! Sue & Jackie London</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for our 10th wedding anniversary. The hotel is fairly expensive but worth every penny. We got a great deal for mid-week in a quieter time by contacting the hotel directly. It is quintessential Paris and you could not get a better location. The room was fantastic and the staff were super friendly and helpful. The rooms are huge by European standards. Even arranging to meet us from the airport. I have to laugh at the one review about the large creaking wardrobe. When a building is 160 years old you expect a little creaking which only adds to the character. It is not some cookie-cutter chain, which is precisely what makes it so special. I have to say that this place was truly one of the finest hotels that I have ever stayed in. I have to thank Judy (the owner) for her exceptional attention to detail and making our stay so amazing... right down to the cold champagne waiting in our room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent service, above and beyond what we expected. After reading all the recommendations for the Jays on Tripadvisor we decided to make a booking. Wow! What a beautiful hotel. The rooms are large by any standards and so beautifully decorated. They are themed in a very elegant Parisian way. We stayed in the Louis XVI room and our children in the adjoining Empire room (I should mention the teddy bears all over the beds that greeted the kids making their welcome extra wonderful). The Arc de Triomphe is 5 mins away while the Tour Eiffel is a 15 min walk. Both rooms have kitchenettes (elegantly hidden away behind cupboard doors), always a bonus when traveling with kids. Both bathrooms are large, ours with a deep bath for relaxation. The best thing about the Jays is the staff. They are so attentive and give the most exceptional service we have experienced. We would come back and stay at the Jays in a heartbeat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 5 nights at Jays in August 2011. Our room was spectacular, and we loved Ivan (concierge) although other concierges were quite average. The location in the 16th Arr. was perfect. I was really unhappy that Jay's website had recommended, and offered to arrange, appointments at a nearby hair salon (Lucie St Claire). My 10 year old daughter wanted a haircut as her special treat. The appointment was scheduled by the concierge, the stylist was great, and then they overcharged me by 18 Euros. As all conversations were in French I didn't feel comfortable arguing with them, but I later checked their rates & let the concierge know about the overcharge. Judy (who has her hair styled there) also spoke with the salon manager. I was disappointed that neither the salon nor the hotel would correct the overcharge - even though our total bill at the hotel was around 3,000 Euros. It may seem like a silly little thing but this wasn't right.</p></li>

Their warmth, hospitality, and knowledge of everything Paris was absolutely first rate. From a winding marble staircase up to our rooms, beautiful floral arrangements, antique French decor with all the modern conveniences available for our comfort, Hermes and Clarins toiletries and the gorgeous views of the streets of Paris from our windows, this hotel was a perfect 10! The staff had champagne for us each evening and wonderful coffee and croissants each morning. A beautiful fruit plate was also left in our rooms each day. Gourmet chocolates were placed on our beds each night. To top it off, they gave us beautiful Christmas gifts for the holiday! Judy and her entire staff were "at our ready" while respecting our privacy. I cannot think of a better place to celebrate a special occasion. I can't imagine staying anywhere else when I return to Paris!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 3 nights & had a lovely time. We were well looked after by all the staff we met, they were friendly & helpful at all times. We stayed 1 night in the Empire Suite & were 'upgraded' to the Asie for the 2/3rd nights (very nice). To be honest the room was larger & at the back of the hotel, but both were wonderfully comfortable & charming. We enjoyed the freedom of making our own breakfast when we wanted, having a fridge for water & drinks & also having the luxury of such good service & help from the staff when needed. I celebrated my 50th birthday while we were there & I was very kindly, treated to champagne & fois gras with compliments from Jays. We ate out at restaurants recommended by Jays on two nights & we weren't disappointed, the food was excellent & the service charming & unobtrusive. We thought the location was great, near enough to access all the sights, yet out of the bustle to be quiet. All in all first class.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from Jays and we had an absolutely fantastic time! From the second we arrived (with a chaffeur to collect us from the Eurostar arranged by the hotel) we were made to feel extremely welcome. The hotel was beautiful and in a fantastic location - only minutes from the centre. Our room was lovely and incredibly spacious, in fact the weather was beautiful but we still spent time in our room as it was so lovely. One of the best things about this hotel though is the staff. Nothing was too much trouble and everyone was so friendly, in particular Quency. We wanted to go out for dinner but unfortunately several of the restaurants we liked were either closed or fully booked, however Quency went out of his way to find a lovely restaurant for us and then brought champagne to our room before we left which was much appreciated! We enjoyed our stay here so much and I would thoroughly recommend this hotel - we didn't want to leave!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a single traveler, I felt so welcomed and personally cared for by each and every member of the staff at JAYS. From being driven to and from the airport by a private driver, to flowers, fresh fruit, and a wonderful little gift for my birthday. Coming home to a friendly face and wonderful conversation over a glass of champagne, fresh fruit, and luscious chocolates after a day of walking the Paris streets was a wonderful treat; and sleeping in the sumptuous bed ensconced in luxurious linens was a soothing invitation to blissful sleep. What integrity JAYS international staff exhibits! Honestly among the many wonderful memories I have of my week in Paris, the friends I made at JAYS top the list. After all, itâ€™s about the people. Thanks to everyone who took care of me. I appreciate everything and miss all of you. Thanks again for making my holiday special! P.S. I still miss your espresso machine! Wish I had one! Hope to see all of you again soon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Jays is more than just a room in a hotel - from the moment we arrived we were made to feel extremely welcome and for our whole stay received very attentive service. Jays really does provide an exceptional experience. The service is personal, discreet and tailored to your individual needs and this theme is continued into your hotel room. We stayed in the Asie suite which was sumptuous - the room was a fantastic size and the added features of kitchenette, DVD player, plasma TV made together with the individual styling of the room made us feel extremely comfotable and that we were enjoying a real treat. Over and above the standard checklist of location, room quality, etc (which all ticked the right boxes), Jays staff really made our experience exceptional and we would like to thank them all. We have stayed in many hotels in many different cities and always rate our favourite hotel - Jays is now top of the list and we hope to return soon! A real spoil</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Jays is not a hotel, but a home away from home. It only offers five unique suites in a beaux arts townhouse in the 16th a stoneâ€™s throw from the Arc de Triumphâ€”but they are each gems. On a return visit, we found the amenities and elegance even more alluring. Judy and the rest of the attentive staff are there to help make your visit to Paris seamless and enjoyableâ€”they print weather reports in the morning to help you start your day, and maps after they have made your requested dinner reservations, to aid direction. They serve coffee and tea in the intimate lobby decorated in red, and every afternoon a lovely fruit plate is waiting in the room. Fauchon and Hediard delicacies are offered. And rooms have little kitchens! You can get all of the facts â€“ location, pictures of rooms, amenities â€“ from a hotel brochure; but what you can get only from travelersâ€™ reviews is how special it is to stay at Jays. We would not even think about staying any place else!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I planned a trip to Paris and London for my granddaughters graduation from High School,accompanied by her mother. Since it was to be a surprise, there were many emails going back and forth between me and the fantastic owner and staff, to make this a dream experience. Jays came through on every level with high marks. Beautiful room, luxury bath details, bowls of fruit and other goodies always in the room. Central location near the Champs de Elysse with a view of the Eiffel at one end and the Arch de Triomph at the other, with great shopping inbetween. Jays provided a marvelous list of restaurants nearby that they had tested personally. Helpful directions were always given. They provide transportation to and from airports and rail. Tea and champagne always offered in their lovely gathering room....I could go on and on, but in summation, my girls arrived home glowing with happiness and raving about Jays, who thoughtfully sent me pictures they had taken of them. Our family will return to Jays.</p></li>

We were so happy with the room (huge, bright,beautiful and so quiet) and the care and attention we received. I am a terrible sleeper but Jays covered all the bases: quiet but cool A/C, super bed, huge windows that can be totally dark at night. All of our activities/guides were booked before we arrived. We walked everywhere. Judy's restaurant choices were great. The second visit was this last Dec. with my adult daughter. I had no qualms traveling without hubby because I knew we would be met at the train and everything would be taken care of. My daughter wanted to shop and see art, and the lights of the city at night. Judy arranged a shopping excursion with an English speaking guide from the Christmas market, to the flea markets for antiques, and to Montmartre. It was a trip my daugher and I will always remember! It was like staying in a grand home with your closest friends. Until next time...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have to admit, I booked this hotel for 2 reasons,; first, the reviews from Trip Advisor and second, when I contacted the hotel to check on the best available rates, I was offered a really fantastic offer that included an upgrade to the Provencal Room. I had no idea what that room was like but the offer was good enough to book the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel, the outside was completely uneventful and discreet. Once inside, it was like arriving at a rich relatives town home. It was relaxed and elegant with a touch of modern with classic. Very different from any other place I have stayed at before. The staff was extremely professional and helpful. They offered suggestions for lunch and dinner and made all our arrangements. Only negative: no elevator. We went up a circular stairway to our room. The room was large and comfortable. The decor was French country. The best part of the experience was the toiletries. Best products from Clarins. We could have stayed here at least 3 or 4 nights. We will come back for sure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent our 20th wedding anniversary in the Asia room at Jays and loved it. It was just what we were looking for. Unlike a typical Parisian hotel the room and bathroom were spacious, simply yet perfectly decorated with a four posted bed overlooking a small internal atrium garden. It also had with a small kitchenette although there was a communal room where cooking was possible and along with internet access. The service was excellent, Jays looked after us well with restaurant recommendations, shopping suggestions etc they even had, bread, cheese, ham and champagne waiting for us after our long trip from Singapore. it is in a great location being a few minutes walk to the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs d'elise , the Trocedero, a metro station, local cafes and restuarants and Patisserie, and not very far to walk to the Seine and the Eiffel Tower. Definitely recommend this hotel for those who want a good location, good service and a great room but donâ€™t need all the trimmings that come the larger hotels such as spa, gym, bars etc etc</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed at Jays, Paris with my father and 5 year old daughter for 3 nights at the end of a month long tour of Europe. I liked the idea of staying somewhere intimate that could make our short stay in Paris as rewarding as possible. Both the hotel and the Jays team did not dissapoint. In short we had a wonderful stay at Jays. It was the perfect way to finish our trip. Whilst the room and adjacent salon were delightful, peaceful havens to return to after a long day wandering around Paris, it was the personal attention and service from the Jays team that stood out the most. No request was too much and each one was dealt with efficiency and a smile. It was as if we were being welcomed into their home and certainly it was how we felt upon leaving. Our stay unfortunately was far too brief, luckily though I have spoken so much about it to my husband he is very keen to travel to Paris soon so he can see for himself. Judy and the Jays team are a special group of people in an industry that often lacks all the things Jays excels at â€“the human touch!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at Jays for three nights in January as part of a birthday trip. We booked on the basis of its Trip Advisor reviews. As a result our expectations were high, but it's fair to say they were exceeded in every respect. The building is charming, the rooms are very spacious and beautifully decorated, the location is superb. The staff, in particular, were fantastic - incredibly helpful and interested without being obtrusive, and in a sincere way that is often lacking at top end hotels. My wife loved being greeted with the offer of a glass of champagne on our return to the hotel. My wife is a vegetarian which has meant we have struggled to find suitable restaurants in France on previous vists, but the Jays staff were able to recommend some lovely restaurants for us to eat in. I have stayed at a variety of five star hotels, but Jays is something much more. I saw another recent review which said it was like staying in the guest room suite of your friend's beuatiful home, and I think that summarises the experience perfectly. I highly recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Paris was to be part of a very special holiday for us. Being collected (and later dropped off) at the station removed all the stress of trying to find our way to the hotel with heavy bags. Entering the building we were greeted by the first of Judyâ€™s exemplary staff, the charming Gerrit, who was on duty at night during our stay and made it special by not only his efficiency and helpfulness, but by taking the time to chat to us. Thanks also to Quercy , always available to offer help and information and to Renato the cleaner who left our room looking like a work of art. As for the hotel itself, it was a truly beautiful, elegant space, a haven to return to after a busy day in Paris. We enjoyed the comfort of our huge bedroom and the enormously deep bath in the bathroom. The sitting room on the second floor became an extension of our room where we made hot drinks, used the internet and read or just sipped a glass of wine bought from the nearby wine merchant. Visit Jays, stay as long as you can and let it work itâ€™s magic on you â€“ you wonâ€™t want to leave!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose Jays because we have stayed in many of the larger-type, famous hotels in the world and wanted one that would give a little more of a personal touch for a 4-day trip. Trip Advisor was raving about it so that's how we came to book. The concierge Ivan was exceptional, as was Romain, and the little touches like fruit in rooms in the afternoon, complimentary champagne, wines and coffee in the lounge and the general welcome was excellent. We were a little disappointed with the rather sparse breakfast; a recommendation to Judy and her staff would be to consider some cheese and ham and perhaps fruit and granola to add variety. We appreciate that at 10 euros it represents good value in the centre of Paris, but I would have preferred to have been able to pay a little more and have a wider choice! Also, a few cans of lager in the foyer fridge would be less expensive for the hotel to provide than champagne and probably a popular option. We don't want to sound negative and have still given an 'excellent' rating because we would return and recommend it to friends</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">JAYS is everything it says on their website and more. The hotel is elegant and private, and the location is absolutely perfect. Staff members are not only efficient and helpful, they take pride in their work and actually enjoy it! Check-in was made easy and pleasant, as we sat in the comfortable reception lounge with a welcome cup of tea. There is a beautiful period staircase leading to the 2 floors for accommodation and the guest salon. Our suite was light and spacious, almost like a studio appartment with its built-in kitchenette. The bathroom was bright and shiny clean. The bed was really comfortable, and combined with the peaceful atmosphere provided a good night's sleep right in the heart of Paris. There are numerous cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance. We chatted with the reception staff over a complimentary glass of excellent champagne (yes!), and they helped us plan our visits and also booked our restaurants. JAYS is definitely family friendly, would be great for a long stay, and is warmly recommended for those who believe that small is beautiful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is a rare gem that believes in pampering the guest and making sure the guest feels like the most important person in the world. The hotel is small and beautifully appointed. The rooms are all decorated in the best taste - they are graceful, elegant and very comfortable. We love turning into the foyer and knowing "we are coming home at the end of a great day in Paris." Before arriving, we received an email that gave us dining suggestions, help with transportation, and a list of the additional services provided by the staff at the hotel. By the time we arrived in Paris, we had transportation, dining reservations, and tickets for the museum we wanted to visit. It is wonderful to have all those details handled efficiently because it made our trip much more enjoyable. Not only that, but the staff was always ready to provide additional help at all times. We really cannot say enough nice things about the stay - and the hotel deserves all praise. Our only concern is that others will "discover" this fabulous hotel and it will become everyone's favorite place in Paris.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had such a wonderful stay at this boutique hotel. Each room is unique and we chose the Asiatique (we think!). We loved waking up in the grand four poster bed and the furniture was lovely with a feature antique wardrobe. The room was the most generous in size of any we had in Europe. The location is absolutely the centre of Paris. The service was without fault, personal, attentive and discrete. I suppose this is not a place for those who like the big 5 star paris hotels (perhaps the review below) and not for those at the budget end. We chose this place based on the opinion of most of the reviewers that given the choice of small rooms that look the same as any hotel in the world, lots of overtrained staff who offer service we never want with careful impersonal smiles, this place is different. The owner seems to have travelled the luxury hotel world and put together everything she loved in a boutique hotel. We share her taste. If you can get a room (they seemed to be booked out most of the month we tried)..the experience is something special... we hope you enjoy it like we did.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a week at Jays. We found this boutique hotel to be of an exceptional value for its location, accomodation and service. Jays is just a few minutes walk from Champs Elysees and L'Arc de Triomphe. The suite we stayed in was spacious and nicely decorated, equipped with everything needed (from in-room safe to microvave oven). But the highest point of Jays is their service. Just a few examples - Jays concierge contacted us before arrival, offering to provide tickets/reservations for Paris attractions (e.g. Le Louvre), so that we wouldn't have to queue. We arrived quite late and the person who greeted us at the reception (unfortunately I don't remember his name!) had already prepared directions for a few restaurants nearby - just in case we were hungry... Whatever we asked for was immediately arranged. And all that with a personal smile, frendliness and readiness to help - big thanks especially to Quercy and Edwin. A couple of days after our return we were e-mailed again, just to thank us for our stay... No doubts - next time in Paris we will surely stay at Jays!</p></li>

<li>Just a few examples - Jays concierge contacted us before arrival, offering to provide tickets/reservations for Paris attractions (e.g.</br></br></li>
<li>Le Louvre), so that we wouldn't have to queue.</br></br></li>
<li>We arrived quite late and the person who greeted us at the reception (unfortunately I don't remember his name!)</br></br></li>
<li>had already prepared directions for a <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">few</span> <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">restaurants</span> nearby - just in case we were hungry... Whatever we asked for was immediately arranged.</br></br></li>
<li>And all that with a personal smile, frendliness and readiness to help - big thanks especially to Quercy and Edwin.</br></br></li>
<li>A couple of days after our return we were e-mailed again, just to thank us for our stay... No doubts - next time in Paris we will surely stay at Jays!</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">While my Fiance was on tour last year (which lends to us staying in budget hotels) we had 2 nights set aside for thanksgiving in Paris. We were booked at Jays Paris and from the second we stepped in, to the moment we reluctantly left for London we loved this hotel. The staff is the key, they are somehow always out of sight until you need them and then they become the perfect fix-it, concierge, or tour guide. The hotel will provide anything they possibly can to make your stay more comfortable... we were not able to think of anything even though we tried. Espresso every time we came in or out, a large room (very very rare in europe) and a bed I could have slept for days in had I not wanted to go take in all i could of paris and its culture. Bottom line this hotel is pricey... so it is not for everyone, the last thing you would want on a trip to Paris is to stretch yourself so thin on money for a room that you are eating McDonalds in a land of such fine wine and cuisine... however, if your budget allows not one penny, euro, pound, quid, yen, cordoba, peso...etc would be wasted on a stay at Jays.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just came back from a wonderful three nights in the sublime Jays - from the moment we booked, to the moment their driver took us back to the Gare du Nord, everything was handled with consummate professionalism, nothing was too much trouble. The staff (really don't like to call them that as they were more like hosts) were absolutely faultless, so charming and helpful - it was like staying with friends in a private home. Our room, Le Provence, was light and airy which was very welcome, given that it was 36 degrees on Friday - so hot we could barely move! Fresh fruit and champagne in the room, tins of Fauchon chocolates every evening (not the usual square of indifferent choc left on the pillow), lovely Clarins products in the bathroom, beautiful flowers everywhere, fantastic modern artwork combined with antique furniture, oh and proper coffee - it was blissfully refreshing after staying in some big name hotels around the globe... The stairs can be a bit daunting (there's no lift) but it's only two flights and it's good for the thighs!! Can't wait to go back to Jays, it really is a special place...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at Jays late on a Friday night to a delightful champagne welcome from the staff. During our two night stay the service from the small team of staff was impeccable. They couldn't do enough to help; coming to meet us at the door, asking where we had been that day. They were so friendly, always courteous and genuinely delighted to help. The hotel itself is a great conversion of a former parisian town house. Inside it is clean, light and spacious, with plenty left of the original buildings character. With only five rooms over two floors we found the hotel to be quiet and very private indeed. The daily fruit dish is a nice touch as was the weather report delivered to our room each morning. The breakfast buffet was also a pleasant surprise, having read some other reviews I thought this might be a weak spot, but it was good, with more than enough for us to eat and drink. Staying with Jays really elevated our Paris weekend break to a higher level. Ivan, Michel & Juan, thank you for making our stay so memorable. Judy, thank you for running such an amazing hotel! We will be back. Matt & Rachel, London.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and went to Paris for 7 days in January, a combination vacation and business trip. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was huge, for Paris, and quiet. The bed was comfortable and large. Fauchon's chocolates every night on the pillow. The bathroom was large and the towels kept warm. The robes were actually large enough to use. The temperature control was easy to operate. Very helpful for my work was the free high speed wifi internet connection. They had umbrellas in the lobby available.The location couldn't have been better, and we had many a nice evening walk to restaurants and the metro. Not a bad stroll to either Trocadero or the Arc de Triomphe. Fresh fruit each night in the room after our evening out. The staff was a great help in recommending restaurants, stores, museums, often offering a glass of wine while we planned out the evening. We have been to Paris at least 20 times and this was the best hotel experience we have ever had. This was also the most expensive Paris hotel we have ever stayed in, and it was worth it. If you are ready to pamper yourself, this is the place to do it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We agree with the many other excellent reviews JAYS has received. We stayed at JAYS for three nights in June, to celebrate my 40th birthday. We wanted to stay in a luxurious stylish hotel, and yet take our two young daughters with us (aged 7 & 8). We wanted to avoid the 'sofabed in the room' scenario, too often offered to families. JAYS did not disappoint, and we were offered two suites, with an adjoining door, which suited us perfectly. Both rooms were spacious and clean with beautiful decor. We were very impressed with the service received from JAYS staff. They were prompt in answering our e-mail queries before our stay, and were very helpful in booking a table at a very nice restaurant for us. We were made to feel that nothing would be too much trouble to help us with. In particular, we were not made to feel at any way unwelcome by bringing children to the hotel. Although we know that our children can behave when requested, not all hotels seem to welcome them as paying guests. JAYS were very welcoming to us all. We would not hesitate in staying at JAYS again when we next visit Paris. The location is great too.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having been unimpressed by Parisian hotels in the past (small rooms, noisy neighbourhoods, surly/arrogant staff etc), we decided to pay a little bit extra and try out Jays based on the numerous glowing reviews on TripAdvisor. We were not disappointed. All the staff without exception were incredibly welcoming (without being obsequious), charming and helpful. The location was ideal, tucked away on a quiet back street, 10 mins walk from the Eiffel Tower and the banks of the Seine to the South, and Arc de Triomphe 7 mins stroll to the North. The hotel, and the rooms in particular, were tastefully decorated to a high standard, and although the hotel is somewhat on the small side (which incidentally we thought added to the charm), the rooms are very spacious, which is unusual for Paris. Ok, so there is no dining room/restaurant or bar, but there are so many excellent restaurants/cafes nearby for it not to be an issue. There is also the flexibility of a kitchenette, so bringing food and drink into your room is not a problem, unlike most other hotels I could mention. We would thoroughly recommend this quaint little hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned home after having spent 5 amazing days at JAYS. Actually, it is absolutely pointless to compare this lavish residence with other brand high-class hotels since it has been such a unique experience and the approach to clients is totally different. Luxury at Jays hotel is not a cliche. It is exclusive. You have an immediate feeling that everything is being made to meet your own requirements and not just the well-known standards. Its luxurious interiors and charming miniature size add up to the warm feeling that you are staying not at a hotel, but at home. The spacious suites with high ceilings are fully equipped for a comfortable stay, so that the tasteful furniture is not only beautiful, but suprisingly functional. Jays' location is almost perfect. The main Paris sites are within a walking or a short-driving distance, yet it is hidden from the hordes of tourists and horn-honking traffic in a sophisticated, calm part of the 16th arrondissement. Yet, Jays would be a brilliant eye-candy without its charismatic team. We would like to thank Judy, the owner, Philippe and all other team members, who made our stay unforgettable. We can't wait to come back to Jays and will definitely recommend it to our friends. Best wishes, The Arutyunovs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay was 5 nights in Paris and we could not have asked for a more perfect, friendly, pristine, and accommodating hotel. The staff was so extraordinary that we have never found any place quite like it where each person we met was nicer than the one before. From Jane (our tour guide), concierges Philippe,Ivan and Roman, to Edwin (housekeeping) there was a thread of consistency in all these individuals that is carefully chosen by Judy (the owner). The staff really enjoys their work and have you as a guest as their first priority. There was nothing that we ever lacked or were disappointed in. When reading reviews I know it is sometimes difficult to decipher who has similar likes and dislikes to you, but at Jays it doesn't matter. They tailor their service to the individual. I have read the other reviews of this hotel and want to make note that some of what others have not liked were really not Jays fault at all. Please be discerning when evaluating your decision to stay/not stay here on some of the negatives you read. We have stayed here and would not stay ANYWHERE ELSE in Paris. Every night as we entered that beautiful French blue door we could feel ourselves relax into the comfort of home. We are so happy we discovered Jays and so happy to impart this to you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location - walking distance to shops, friendly restaurants plus grocery and laundry, easy to travel by bus, subway to major tourist attractions. Great room (we had Le Decor I think) - good size plus amenities (we always like to have an electric kettle to get our own hot water and wifii), and a resting section (that has a kitchen & even a mac) on 2/F (and lobby of course) that becomes almost like your living room. Great job by Edwin on housekeeping. Good service - nice touch - fruits were delivered every evening. Great help from Judy and her team (Philippe, Ivan, DJ, Stefan (apologies if I got the names wrong) including choice of restaurants, address of specific shops and even booking of plane and train tickets. Overall, we have yet to find anything close to Jays balancing top service, cleanliness, location with warmth (my wife is full of praise of Jays' touch of red in its decor as red is easily too intrusive when overused). One can easily find hotels with fabulous decor & top service but at the end of the day, you know that is still a hotel, but at Jays you feel at home. And Paris, glad to say we like to be back, and just like a few other great cities, we now have a few restaurants we like to revisit whenever we are back. Victor & Woody, Hong Kong June 2010</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When you read reviews you are never sure how correct they are, we always check reviews before booking hotels, sometimes they are spot on and other times they are way off the truth. The reviews for Jays are all true. This is a fantastic small and intimate hotel run by staff who really understand what customer care means. From the moment my husband sent the first e mail to enquire about a booking to when we stepped over the door to leave we were looked after. The hotel is well situated; there is only a small gold plaque on the wall to say itâ€™s a hotel and check in was more like having coffee with friends. With regards to the rooms style and cleanliness other reviewers have said it all, past reviews also talk extensively about the level of service and while it would be easy for me to agree with them I feel very strongly that however wonderful a hotel looks if you are treated well thatâ€™s what will make you return time and time again. Jays staff canâ€™t do enough for you, they are never pushy, advise rather than dictate and make you feel totally comfortable We were really looked after and if you visit you can be assured that whatever you require from restaurants bookings to museum and train information Jayâ€™s wonderful staff will assist you. If we return to Paris we will only do so if we can stay at Jays.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As we all know, traveling to a foreign country can be both exciting and intimidating, especially when you're unfamiliar with the area, the language, AND more so when intertwined with business intricacy... I was introduced to JAYS Paris from a family friend. Although I was a bit nervous about traveling to Paris for the first time, my hesitations and nervousness quickly evaporated when my chauffeur picked me up with a smile and helped with my luggage at the train station. JAYS Paris is conveniently located within walking distance to a variety of amazing restaurants, tourist attractions, and shopping. The staff is warm, welcoming, organized, and professional. They helped me plan my trip from the beginning to the end. They booked my transportation needs, dining reservations, as well as my sightseeing trip on Saturday. They also printed all my reservation confirmations in English so that I would have all the information with me. I was able to take advantage of the hotelâ€™s wireless connection and computer stations to prepare for my meeting and business activities. All of the rooms are spacious, relaxing, and beautifully decorated. The lobby/lounge also makes the perfect setting to host meetings, and entertain clients, with the lovely service of coffee, refreshments, and champagne. I truly enjoyed my time at JAYS and have recommended this unique gem to my friends and business associates.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent four days during the holidays at Jays all due to reviews here at TA. Checked in late after long flight from Seattle. Met with espresso and friendly faces. Luggage (BIG) was taken upstairs and the room prepared. Champagne was delivered at our door shortly thereafter. Room was large compared to other Paris hotel rooms. Comfy bed, nice bathroom. My only observation that may be critical is the bathroom should be updated. Could use some improvements. Large bath but not optimal for 6â€™4 big guy to try and shower. But really, minor. Great amenities in bath or so says my sig other. Small boutique hotel, like staying at someoneâ€™s very nice home. Close to everything, on a very quiet street in a residential neighborhood. AWESOME people working there, like having your own personal concierge. Maps, taxies, and advice on demand and as needed. Or if you want to be left alone and disappear, discretion is there also. Only warning is that if you stay here, be prepared to be disappointed with other hotels, we came back after two weeks traveling through Italy and Jays was not available. We stayed at another hotel, and no comparison. You get what you pay for and we got what we would expect and then some. No big fancy lobby, no restaurant or bar, however there are multiple locations for both within an easy walking distance. If you want to feel less like a tourist and more like a welcome guest this is the place. Thank you Jays staff for a memorable Paris trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Do not listen to the latest (French language) review (5th Jan by Hsien698) - they have clearly missed the point, this special place makes no pretence of being a five star hotel, it is something completely different, catering to a clientele who don't want the large palace hotel experience. Â There would have been only one member of staff on as in the evening that is all that is required given there are only 5 rooms. Â I have just spent 2 nights here with my wife. Â The staff are very attentive from the moment they receive the booking; they recommended and booked restaurants for us in advance and always replied immediately to our e-mails. Â The welcome and service once you arrive strikes the right balance between professional and personal and nothing is too much trouble. For example my wife forgot her mobile phone charger, and one of the staff brought her one in for her to borrow from his home. The rooms are astonishingly big for such a location, with bathrooms to match. Â They are all individually decorated with a very comfortable bed and bedding. Â The kitchenette is very useful with a microwave, kettle, mini- hob and basin, as well as cutlery, crockery and saucepans. Â The bathroom is well stocked with Clarins and Hermes products, which you are encouraged to take away (including a full bottle of Hermes perfume!) Breakfast is served until a very civilised 12:00 (and in your room at no extra charge). Â All in all, we would thoroughly recommend this little place. Â We don't all want to stay in large hotels; one might almost think some reviewers have an agenda!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were nervous about booking a family trip to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary solely on the basis of trip advisor recommendations. However we had a lovely time at Jays and in Paris. Although we were suprised to find that our room choices had been changed when we arrived at the hotel it turned out that Jays had decided to give us one of the salons as an extra bedroom for our family of 5. This meant that we had 3 double inter-connecting bedrooms and two bathrooms along with a kitchennette and computer. As the rooms are spacious it felt like a large apartment and everyone was happy. Although the total price was expensive it was for a special occasion and what you are paying for is the special level of personal service. We were very well looked after with restaurant and hotel bookings, driver from train station and lots of lovely treats each day including Clarins toiletries and Fauchon products. I would agree with other reviewers that breakfast should be included and that some additional items could be offered for breakfast including yogurt and fruit. However in Paris you end up eating a lot of food so maybe it is not such a bad thing to start the day with a light breakfast. The location is not central so you need to use taxis or the metro to get to many of the sights. (if you call a taxi to the hotel they charge from the time they start to come to the hotel!) However the rooms are very quiet and the beds are excellent so you get a good nights sleep which is not always the case in a city hotel. Overall we had a great stay and would recommend the hotel to larger families celebrating a special occasion.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I recently stayed at Jays on our first trip to Paris, and were immediately impressed by the personal attention and friendliness of the staff. After a long trip from Chicago (complicated by missed connections and lost luggage), we were pleased to have a car (arranged by Jays) pick us up at the airport and bring us to the hotel, where we received a warm welcome. With only five suites, Jays is a small, boutique hotel located within the 16th arrondissement, which places it within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower, the Champs Elysees and other attractions. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and quiet. Although Jays does not have a restaurant on site there are several bistros and a market close by. Prior to our arrival, Philippe from concierge services arranged tickets to the Louvre, as well as lunch reservations at the Jules Verne restaurant (which I understand are difficult to obtain on short notice). Whether it was an umbrella, maps, museum recommendations or following up on our lost luggage, no request seemed to be a problem. Each evening when we returned to the hotel, we spent a few minutes telling the staff about our adventures and having a glass of wine in the reception area. Try doing that at one of the big chain hotels! Jays is fairly expensive, but as with most things, you get what you pay for. I contacted the hotel directly by e-mail, and was offered a special rate, which I thought was very reasonable and in line with other luxury hotels where we have stayed. Jays certainly made our first trip to Paris unforgettable. We only wish we could have stayed longer. If you are seeking a truly special place to stay in Paris ... Jays is the place!</p></li>

<li>My wife and I recently stayed at Jays on our first trip to Paris, and were <span style="background-color:#911eb4">immediately impressed</span> by the personal attention and friendliness of the <span style="background-color:#911eb4">staff</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>After a long trip from Chicago (complicated by missed connections and lost luggage), we were pleased to have a car (arranged by Jays) pick us up at the airport and bring us to the hotel, where we received a <span style="background-color:#911eb4">warm</span> <span style="background-color:#911eb4">welcome</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>With only five suites, Jays is a small, <span style="background-color:#ffe119">boutique</span> <span style="background-color:#ffe119">hotel</span> located within the 16th arrondissement, which places it within walking distance of the Eiffel Tower, the Champs Elysees and other attractions.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">rooms</span> are <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">spacious</span>, comfortable and quiet.</br></br></li>
<li>Although Jays does not have a restaurant on site there are <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">several</span> <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">bistros</span> and a market close by.</br></br></li>
<li>Prior to our arrival, Philippe from concierge services arranged tickets to the Louvre, as well as lunch reservations at the Jules Verne restaurant (which I understand are difficult to obtain on short notice).</br></br></li>
<li>Whether it was an umbrella, maps, museum recommendations or following up on our lost luggage, no request seemed to be a problem.</br></br></li>
<li>Each evening when we returned to the hotel, we spent a few minutes telling the staff about our adventures and having a glass of wine in the reception area.</br></br></li>
<li>Try doing that at one of the big chain hotels!</br></br></li>
<li>Jays is fairly expensive, but as with most things, you get what you pay for.</br></br></li>
<li>I contacted the <span style="background-color:#f032e6">hotel</span> directly by e-mail, and was offered a special rate, which I thought was <span style="background-color:#f032e6">very reasonable</span> and in line with other luxury hotels where we have stayed.</br></br></li>
<li>Jays certainly made our first trip to Paris unforgettable.</br></br></li>
<li>We only wish we could have stayed longer.</br></br></li>
<li>If you are seeking a truly special place to stay in Paris ... Jays is the place!</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I had been to Paris twice in the past but this was our first trip with our children (ages 8 & 9). My sister booked the four of us, as well as herself, in three of the five rooms at Jays (we took up the second floor) after reading all of the great reviews on TripAdvisor. We actually spent six days in Paris in the middle of a two-week vacation in London so our exposure to Jays started with the transportation they arranged from the train station (quick and easy). The first thing you notice after passing through the bright blue door, is the great aroma and the beautiful orchids. Check-in was painless and the rooms exquisite. We had a connecting room with our girls and their bed was covered with stuffed bears. There were so many personal touches in the rooms (by Judy) including framed "letters" from the room/furniture/bears giving you their history. The bathroom amenities were all by Clarins and Hermes; after one shower, I smelled as good as the hotel. The bedding was luxurious and we slept like rocks all week. There was a well-appointed kitchenette in each room although we took advantage of their exceptional breakfast every morning before setting out. Judy does just a fantastic job of running this hotel and she told me, on our last day, that she doesn't hire any staff that she personally doesn't enjoy. It was obvious. Every single member of the staff was pleasant, helpful (running off to make "inquiries" and print maps at the drop of a hat) and spoke fluent English (a real plus since the years have been unkind to my memory of high school French). I can't make enough positive comments about our stay at Jays and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone! Thank you to Judy and all.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I recently spent three nights at Jays. What a true gem in the heart of Paris. I think it is very safe to say that you can not, should not stay in Paris without staying at Jays. The property consists of only 5 rooms, so to say you get individual attention is an extreme understatement. Prior to our arrival, I worked with Judy and Philippe to get Louvre and Orsay tickets. They provided a detailed listing of their favorite restaurants, all of which we tried, we loved. They also arranged a horse carriage ride for us. From the moment we arrived, their attention to detail was top notch. The driver was ready and waiting when we arrived at the train station. When we arrived at Jays, Philippe was there to greet us and offered us coffee, wine, anything we wanted. A couple of the evenings, we requested a bottle of wine. They were always super quick and provided nuts, olives, or some other goody to go along with the wine. The best way to sum up the way we felt about Jays, it is easy to say family. We felt very comforted, protected, and well taken care of. They were always more than willing to call a cab, give directions, set up reservations, etc. Because it is such a small property you really feel like you get to know the staff. Before you leave for your afternoon of adventures, whoever is working the reception, comes out to wish you a good day, provide a snack, or to lend a hand. Upon return, they were always interested in how our day was and what we got accomplished. The morning we left, Gerrit called us a taxi, Him and Judy stood at the door waving good bye as our taxi headed off to the airport. I actually felt sad to leave them. Paris was not our favorite place we have ever been. However, I would love to go back just to enjoy in the pleasures of Jays!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at Jays for a long weekend recenty for his birthday. Neither of us had been to Paris for many years so when looking for inspiration for places to stay I read the reviews on Tripadvisor and Jays came out tops. I was lucky enough to get a good deal for the time we went, and from the moment I booked I received a great welcome email from Judy with an explanation of Jays and a great list of reccomended restaurants. Judy then helped me to book a couple of special places to eat ,my favorite being Le Hide. We arrived in Paris by Eurostar; wow how great is that to be in Paris from London in just over 2 hours, superb! I arranged the chauffeur pick up from Jays, charged at 50 Euros which is pretty much what a cab would cost and was very convenient. We stayed in the Empire suite which is their smallest suite but very spacious I think for Paris standards. The room was lovely, high ceilings and nice furnishings, the bathroom was well stocked with fabulous Clarins products, bathrobes and slippers. Jays is the creation of Judy, a Parisian Residence converted into a very stylish, tranquil boutique hotel. All the staff are very charming, professional and very well conversed, they all took time to chat and gave us great advice of where to visit and eat. Jays is very well positioned for walking to the Arc De Triomphe, Champs Elysee and the Eiffel Tower, it is also easy to get on a metro from nearby. I have only one small suggestion for Judy and that would be to add a little background music to the lounge area, we actually liked sitting there when we came in from walking all day to have a refreshment but felt it was a little too quiet. It has been a long time since we both visited Paris but this time we will definately be back sooner and will definately stay at Jays again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We travelled to Paris for our wedding anniversary and wanted somewhere special to stay. Having read all the great reviews on Tripadvisor Jays seem to fit the bill. The fantastic service you receive from Judy and her staff begins the moment you make contact with Jays. Email enquiries are dealt with promptly and contain all the information you could require. Having booked the only disappointment is that your visit cannot begin immediately. We decided to avail of Jay's chauffer service from CDG-a very elegant way to leave the airport and arrive in style. It also takes the hassle out of getting transport to the heart of Paris. On arrival into Jays our breath was taken away-Judy has managed to create an oasis of charm, character and calm just minutes from the centre of Paris-you immediately feel relaxed and know that here is something very special. After a refreshing drink, Judy showed us to our room. We stayed in a Deluxe Suite and it is luxury. Clarins products in the bathroom, a wonderfully comfortable bed and personal touches like chocolates and fresh fruit every night. Breakfast is simple but wonderful and was more than enough to start our day. The staff at Jay's are wonderful-Ivan and Stephan who we had most contact with, made us feel like nothing was too much bother and all queries were dealt with efficiently and promptly. Jays biggest bonus is its location. A 5 minute walk in one direction and you are at the Arc De Triomphe-10 minutes the other way and you at the Eiffel Tower. You may think this would put Jays in the middle of a noisy chaos but it is peaceful and quiet and perfect. We had a wonderful 3 nights at Jays and will certainly return here when we are next in Paris. If you are looking for somewhere special to stay, where the staff treat you like friends first and then guests, Jays can be your only destination.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I had decided that the last night of a 5 week trip to France needed to be a truly special event and Jays was the obvious choice. From our very first contact with Judy we knew this was indeed to be a memorable night and even our expectations were exceded. Our plane back into Paris was very late but nonetheless we were met by a delightful, cheerful chauffeur whom Judy had organized to collect us and he very quickly had us arriving at Jays. We were ushered up the sweeping, rather regal entrance, greeted warmly by Judy and a gentleman whose name I sadly do not recall, and offered refreshments before being shown to room 203 which is on the first floor. What an absolutely beautiful room this is with the soft, subtle tones of lavender, pink and grey. To say its spacious is an understatement (particularly for Paris). There is absolutely everything one could possibly wish for from the deep bath to the fluffy bath robes, the ultra sleek TV, the discreet little kitchenette, remote controlled lighting and of course whisper quiet air conditioning. Best of all was the huge, comfortable bed with linen to die for. Its definitely luxurious but not in any way is it "stuffy" or over formalized....a real haven in the bustle of Paris. Judy had booked us into La Griottine for dinner which was about a 10 minute walk from Jays where we both thoroughly enjoyed a delectable, very reasonably priced meal which was brought to us by a very cheerful and helpful English speaking gentleman.. After a leisurely stroll to the Arc de Triomphe and soaking up the atmosphere which is unique to Paris we returned to Jays for a soak in the bath and an early night. Sadly we had to leave early the next morning and again Judy had arranged a chauffer to take us back to the airport. Our experience at Jays was everything we hoped for and more and if ever we are fortunate to be back in Paris we would not dream of staying anywhere else. Thank you to all the wonderful staff and to Judy for her personal care and interest. .</p></li>
