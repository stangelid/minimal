A staff that you can have a conversation with and not feel like "just a customer." With the money saved here you can afford to take the kids to SeaWorld!</p></li>

However, our room above the office was tiny, and straight out of 1940. Not a thing had been updated except for the TV. We left after one night, in search of a roomier and more up-to-date room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay at the Dolphin Motel was wonderful. I have never met a more friendly or helpful staff - very much a "can-do" attitude! Sure, there are plenty of places that are fancier - bigger rooms, elaborate furnishings and elaborate breakfasts, but the Dolphin is more than adequate, and even better than some of the ultra high end hotels I've "splurged for" in the past. I will be happy to stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had 3 rooms on May 28, and overall we were happy with the Dolphin motel. Our rooms were small but very clean and the beds were comfortable. The staff were friendly and helpful, and they monitored the vehicles in the motel's parking lot overnight. Breakfast was OK, we had Costco muffin, yoplait yogurt, and hot coffee. The owners actually looked much younger than in the picture. We would stay there again.</p></li>

One of our company computers was unable to connect to the Dolphin's high-speed wireless internet (computer problem), so they moved us to a room closer to the router. Very accommodating staff, great breakfast items (lots of coffee!) in the mornings. HD televisions, close to airport and America's Cup Harbor. This is a great hotel in San Diego, and the price is amazing. Highly recommended.</p></li>

The management is there hands-on (some for 24hrs.) daily. The customer's comfort is their TOP priority. It is very convenient to the Bay, the airport, downtown and is within walking distance to excellent restaurants. If there was a rating higher than five stars, the Dolphin Motel would get it from me.</p></li>

Breakfast with delicious muffins, bananas, orange juice, yogurt and fresh coffee. Very nice view from our room on the second floor. The friendly owners are always there for help and advice.

As some of the other reviewers mentioned, the rooms are a little small, but we were on the go constantly, so it worked out fine for us. The owners and staff are always around seeing to your every need. All of our basic needs were met including a very comfortable bed. We wouldn't think of staying anywhere else when visiting San Diego.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The rooms aren't that spacious but I'm totally fine with that considering that the price of the room beats everything. It's is definitely very clean! And the staffs are warm and friendly! I met this guy who works there (I think he's the owner but I'm not so sure) over breakfast and he was really helpful to offer me insights as to where my family and I should visit over our stay in San Diego. He even provided maps to various attractions in SD! Thank you!</p></li>

Guess what? This was perfect! Why would you pay for things you aren't going to use? We got the best room in the house. It was clean, comfy, quiet, and I didn't pay a lot for it. I have no idea why this place isn't packed every night. I was so glad to get a reservation for the next night. WIll absolutely stay here next time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just stayed at The Dolphin Motel for 2 nights and just loved it ! Cute room, super clean and had a nice balcony in front of room for sitting and watching boats go by in the harbor. It is located on the corner of Harbor drive which was great as we took a beautiful and easy drive all the way around past parks and marinas and the naval ships. We did a lot of sightseeing around Coronado, La Jolla and San diego and this was a perfect "home base". Will definitely go back.</p></li>

The owners have made the most of the small rooms by adding shelves to keep things handy which makes a huge difference. The bed was super comfortable, the shower was terrific, and theTV and large number of channels were great (especially since the weather did not cooperate while we were there). The WiFi was also terrific. I would highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Dolphin Motel is a nice place to stay in San Diego. It's cheap, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, and the room could not have been cleaner. Although we didn't get the best room (which was our own fault because we had a last minute change of plans) and although the walls are thin, we slept pretty well -- only on Saturday night, we could hear the nearby streets a bit too much. The only thing that kept this motel from being excellent though was the size of the room; it felt way too small for two people.</p></li>

The room was small, which didn't bother us as we were out and about all day, and spotlessly clean. There are plenty of places to eat and drink nearby, and downtown San Diego is a five to ten minute drive away. We took a taxi one night and it didn't cost much. Breakfast is good. We enjoyed our stay here and thought it was great value for money. Can't praise the staff enough- excellet customer service.</p></li>

In the Point Loma district and across the street from San Diego Bay and yacht moorages, the location has always provided an invitation for a scenic early morning walk providing a calorie burnoff from one's complimentary breakfast.

The staff is wonderful and very knowledgeable about their area, need directions or ideas? Just ask. Lots of things to do in walking distance. Good breakfast for the busy couple, relax with a bagel and some O.J. The rooms were small, but great for a couple. The only negative thing I could think of, since I'm a girl, is to add shelving in the shower for Shampoo/Soaps. Besides that great room, great value and great stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a modest motel in a GREAT area. Very affordable and the staff made the stay wonderful. The rooms very clean and the beds are more comfortable than most hotel beds. There is no phone or alarm clock in the room I stayed in, but if you have a cell phone you don't really need one. The room I stayed in did have a refrigerator which was nice and the muffins for breakfast were very good. I would definately stay here again because of the value. When you save this much on a place to sleep, you can definately spend more on gifts, amusment parks, and dinners.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This little gem located across from a scenic marine harbor is a very welcome place for the simple, budget-minded traveler. Have stayed here 4 times now, (about 2-3 nights each time). Family-owned and operated, the whole staff is super friendly, attentive and helpful. The rooms are small but they have fresh white paint and thick bathroom towels. Comfortable beds and flat screen TV's. Convenient walking to several good restaurants and a very easy route to the airport are other benefits. Thank you, Hawley, and everyone, for always providing us with a pleasurable experience and stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location, staff and room were all great. The staff suggested several local restaurants (most within walking distance) and we were glad for their recommendations. They also suggested places to go sight seeing, and since this was our first time to San Diego we appreciated their input. They also gave us maps and directions, and an umbrella on the one day it rained. The free breakfast is not fancy, but had several options including bananas, yogurt, muffins, coffee, tea. The rooms are small, but include flat screen TV, refrigerators, a nice clean shower, and nice, comfortable bed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here on our anniversary and plan to do that each year. The motel is always clean and well maintained. It is small but really if you are in San Diego how much time is spent in the room anyway? The beds are always clean and well kept... and after speaking to the owner and his son during our stay we think this is by far the best place in San Diego hands down. There is a small breakfast offering (muffins and coffee) which we love to partake of as we stroll across the street to the harbor and watch the fishing boats loading up for their day at sea. Truly this place is AWESOME!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location is excellent (safe, great walking, close to airport, easy to find). The facility is old and the rooms are very small; but they are clean & very functional. Noise could be an issue if you are sensitive to noise. Staff is friendly.... very friendly.... very accommodating. Price is cheap compared to most everything else in San Diego. Read the other reviews. I found them to be accurate. Those that liked/loved the Dolphin did so for just reasons. Those that did not like the Dolphin seemed to have "magical thinking" (ie expecting something that was not there.) I'd stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ditto on all the good things others have written. Four- and five-star hotels can take a cue from the staff at the Dolphin. They walk the walk when it comes to customer service. Tom gave us a tip on where to park for free near Sea World. Jeb told us about a great restaurant down the street (Miguel's--second floor balcony, fantastic view of the harbor at night). If you're there on a Tuesday, check out the fantastic Taco Tuesday at Mitch's Seafood across the street--amazing fish and shrimp tacos! If we return to San Diego, we'll definitely stay at the Dolphin again. Great location and staff.</p></li>

It was so beautiful up there. Thanks to the kindness of the people that work there we got to see that. Also anything we asked for they went out of their way to accommodate us if at all possible, and every thing was very clean. There was not one single person there that was not polite and very kind. Thank you for making our trip a great one. If we should come back there in the future we will definitely check to see if you have a room available. Thank you again. Louise Tesoro</p></li>

We have stayed in San Diego many times at other high-end resorts but needed a budget motel this time. We found the Dolphin on Trip Advisor and were very happy with our choice! The owners are so hospitable - they make you feel very at home in their motel. The rooms were small and simple but very clean & comfortable and met all our needs. The location is fantastic - within walking distance of many tasty restaurants and right by the fishing marina. Since it is a small motel, the parking was great. We will definitely be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For its location by the marina, this motel is well priced and well maintained. The rooms are smaller than most we have encountered in our three-month trip across the states and the walls were thin, but the furnishings and decor gave this motel a quality feel. The motel staff were helpful and friendly, the owners less so. The electrics blew in our room and the matter was not handled well. We were blamed for the damage and ungraciously hurried out. This episode left a sour taste in our mouth and we would not stay there again but I'm sure it is possible to have a very pleasant stay at this motel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved the Dolphin. You cannot beat this price with the location. Minutes from everything - beaches, downtown, eating airport, etc. The staff is first rate and were so accommodating. They even fed you breakfast. My favorite was enjoying the great weather and relaxed atmosphere in the morning whilst drinking coffee, eating muffins and browsing the internet (free wi-fi) and planning my day. That's what vacations are about. No hassles and this place was trouble-free. It's not fancy but for as much as you hang out at your hotel/motel while on vacation, it had all your needs met as well as a comfortable stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights. We arrived after a long flight to be greeted by a really helpful cheery reception staff. Room was clean and bed was super comfy. Clean white bedding, we were cold on the first night but had no problem following nights, fridge provided, luggage stands and tv with more the enough channels. Bit out of downtown area but we were given a map by staff and directions to bus and trolley which only costs $9 for a two day pass. Within walking distances of good seafood and restaurants. Had a brilliant stay and the muffins at breakfast were amazing!!! would definately stay again!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Dolphin has very clean, well appointed rooms, and a nice sized bathroom. Great location near to the marina with a choice of restaurants, and the bus into the centre stops about 10 yards away. Staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, which always makes a great difference to any stay. Good continental breakfast. Free use of a laptop with WiFi connection was also an added unexpected bonus. Doubt you'll find better value for money in the area. One word of warning - if you're not coming by car, its better to get public transport to the motel, which is regular and good if you're arriving from the centre - we got thoroughly ripped off by a taxi.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Found this little gem of accommodation through Trip Advisor, we were visiting San Diego for 2 days and was looking for something inexpensive with parking. The Dolphin Motel was a great option, while out of the CBD and on the other side of the airport, it's only a 10-15 minute drive to Gaslamp Quarter so that suited us fine. The accommodation is basic and very clean, all of the staff are very friendly and extremely helpful and breakfast in the courtyard is an added bonus! If you are looking for 5-star accommodation this may not be the place for you but if you are wanting somewhere that is value for money, clean and with great service than stay here!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Dolphin 23-26 Dec. From the minute we arrived we were greeted by Jeb who was very friendly and efficient in checking us in. Room was very clean and adequate, nothing fancy but a lot more than what you would expect from this type of motel. If you need anything you only have to ask at reception, we were kindly lent a hairdryer - thanks Steve, GPS - thanks Alan - and loan of a phone for a local call. Could not fault anyone on their attention to customers. The fishing harbour is right across the street, lovely area for a walk and a coffee if you're not fishing. The city is a short drive away but you can use local transport if you have no car.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the (family-run) dolphin motel for one night before taking off back home. The hotel staff, especially senior and junior owner, was extremely nice and tried to help wherever possible. The rooms were indeed clean, everything decorated in white and maintained very well. The only negative thing to notice were the quite "thin" walls - we had trouble falling asleep that Friday night, as outside on the streets the party crowd was very noisy and we could hear every single thing in our ground floor room. The hotel is not centrally located, however rather close to the airport and sport fishing docks and marinas. The car ride downtown San Diego takes approx. 10minutes.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room was clean, white and looks exactly like picture. The room was small, as expected. My only complaint was how thin the walls are. My husband and I went to dinner and a movie. We got back to the room a little after 11 on Saturday. We turned on the tv and within 5 minutes the neighbor knocked on the door and told us that we would need be quiet. It was a little shocking as we were not making noise beyond the tv and a few comments between us about what time we'd be leaving in the morning. I would not recommend staying in the motel if you are planning to do anything at night. Overall a good stay. Close to everything to do in San Diego.

The room was spotless and was cleaned every day. A breakfast of muffins, fruit, coffee, juice & yogurt was included. Staff were really friendly & helpful, in fact one day we were at the bus stop and the owner came out and insisted driving us to the beach and he stopped to show us a few places of interest on the way! A good location with bars & restaurants within 5 minutes walk, and if you don't have a car, like us the bus stop is 2 minutes away and links with the trolley to downtown etc. Cant imagine you will find a better place to stay for the money in San Diego</p></li>

My wife and teenage son had a great time in San Diego And it was because of meeting people like the owners of this motel (Father & Son) and Stephen- the Reception Manager and the lovely Fillipina Lady who has worked there a couple of decades. Man- does that say something when the Staff stay there so long, the loyality the staff have to the owners is something!! I feel the same loyality to this place after just one vacation stay at the Dolphin Motel. I will tell all my friends that you can not go wrong here!! And the rooms were great and at a terrific price.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed in "The Dolphin" for 4 nights and wished it could have been longer. It's position facing the marina is perfect and nearby Shelter Island is just a short stroll away. The owners (Horace & Allan) are the nicest of people and they and their staff went out of there way to make our stay a memorable one. Many restaurants are nearby as is public transport to take you to the many attractions of this beautiful city. Although the motel does not have a swimming pool this pales into insignificence because of it's position and the fantastic welcome and care on offer. We certainly highly recommend this motel for the budget traveler and will certainly stay again on our next trip to San Diego. Andrea and Brian</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everyone from the owners, housekeepers and front desk people were always helpful and proud of their motel. Nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was always a friendly way to start the day. Staff would enquire what our plans were for that day, answering any question and giving suggestions if required. Loved the balcony at the end of the day to relax and have a drink. Meet several people, from the US, who regularly stayed. One told us that several years ago he was staying at a nearby hotel that over looked the Dolphin Motel. He noticed the people laughing and enjoying themselves. He made enquires and from then on always stays at the Dolphin. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Everything worked! Would DEFINATELY stay, if in the area again.</p></li>

It's AWESOME!!!!) I personally, don't see why people complain about "HOW SMALL" the rooms are...I thought it was perfect in size (Plus I was able to rub elbows with my honey) It's in a great location, it's California! Great ocean air (Which I am sure the locals sometimes take for granted)....I personally feel inspired travelling to San Diego.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very nice personal service and the owner went out of his way to provide excellent area directions to both attractions and good spots to eat. The room was tiny, but very clean. Had a bit of a connection problem with the WIFI, but maybe it was just me. Coffee and pastries were provided but we chose the Denny's up the street instead. Small, safe parking lot in between the two buildings. Very nice to be so close to the harbor, with many great restaurants in the area within walking distance. The staff were very accomodating and we really appreciated the kind service after experiencing so many cold faceless chain motels over the years. Felt very safe at the Dolphin. Don't expect much in the way of frills or large rooms but the price and smiles are just right.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this Hotel because I wanted a reasonable place to stay during Comic-Con. I was definitely not disappointed and I would stay here again. If you had a car the location was excellent for Comic Con as well, just straight down Harbor Drive. (Mind you, for that to be an actual benefit, you need to buy your Comic Con parking vouchers months in advance) The room was a little dated but that's not really what I look for in a hotel. It was very clean and the staff were all very friendly and very helpful. They always asked if I was satisfied or if there was anything else they could do to help. The breakfast was pretty good, too. On a side note, there were thankfully no parking oddities at this hotel. This seemed to be a recurring problem throughout my road trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed here. It is in a great location, close to everything. But we git what we paid for.......hard beds and uncomfortable pillows. I asked the front desk for more pillows and they were delivered by a housekeeper. Upon her arrival I told her we didn't need stay over service and she said ok. We left for the afternoon to find that they in fact come into our room and gave us new towels. My husband said that at the front desk there is a sign that states they come in every room every day. And that just makes me slightly upset. I work in the hotel business and when a guest states no room service, we do not enter their room under any circumstances and I expect that to be upheld at any other hotel. With that said it wasn't that bad but I def wouldn't stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This motel is great if all that you really need is somewhere to stay at night before heading out to the sights in San Diego. Rooms are tad on the small side but very very clean. Muffins, tea, coffee and OJ are outside for a quick breakfast in the morning. Free wireless internet is a plus There's a view of Fisherman's Landing, and we were able to see the July 4th fireworks from our balcony too! Staff at the motel are really helpful, and we were able to use one of their lockers for our things on the day we checked out as we were going to Seaworld and didnt want to bring everything in the car. Rates were great too- about $100/night and it had everything that we needed (clean room and comfy bed) and was also very close to the Zoo and Seaworld. Would definitely stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Driving into the car park of this place I had that oh no feeling but I was pleasantly surprised. The rooms as pointed out are a bit small but if you want extra space book a room with a single bed and a queen which makes a big difference for not much more cost. The room was clean and made up every day. The location in point loma is great and is ideal if you don't want to be in downtown but still close enough to everything. Staff were very helpful 24hrs a day. The rooms closest to the road can be a bit noisy from the traffic so choose wisely. The walls are also a bit thin but if you have noisy neighbors call the reception who will gladly come and tell them to shut up like they did for us. You will struggle to find better value for money than here. It ain't luxury but it fits the bill.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The good: After much searching for a cheap hotel in San Diego that was in a decent location it brought me to the Dolphin Motel. The staff here are very friendly and print things for you and also help you out with any problems you have. The location is great and parking is free. You are around 5-10 minutes from downtown San Diego and all the attractions. The breakfast was okay- we had some muffins,coffee,yogurt, and orange juice but it was okay. Most importantly, the price was great and it is very clean. The bad: The rooms are not very soundproof. I stayed on the 1st floor and was able to hear a lot of the footsteps from the room above me so that was a bit annoying. Also, if someone was outside your room talking you could hear them without much of a problem. I think that if the hotel was quieter i would have given it a 5 star rating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I stayed at the Dolphin Motel for 3 nights. Since it was winter, it was very cold and the one blanket on the bed wasn't sufficient, and we also needed more pillows, so we notified the front desk and an extra blanket and pillows were brought up. Going into the bathroom, I noticed a long black hair on the sink. The man at front desk said this was from the housekeeper and apologized. They were very nice, and when we asked if they had a computer to use the internet, they gave us the hotel's laptop which we could take up to our room. Breakfast was muffins, yoghurt, bananas, coffee and juice. The best part about this motel was the shower.....it had the best water pressure of the whole trip! Just like home. We would recommend this hotel if you want somewhere cheap to stay, that also includes breakfast and is close to attractions.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Dolphin management was very friendly and the location was superb but we felt the room was somewhat dated. That being said, if you are looking for a great area to stay and are fine with a very basic room the Dolphin is a good choice (and likely cheaper than other chain options in the area). The hotel is located close to the airport (but away from the flight pattern) and very close to the bay and scenic Shelter Island. There are many restaurants and bars within walking distance. The room was slightly on the small size for two but had a large, fairly comfortable bed. The room was painted all in white tones; there is a small tv with cable and a fridge. The bathroom was tiny and had older fixtures and a basic shower. There was a simple continental breakfast in the morning and the management team greeted us cheerfully when we came and went.</p></li>

I was surprised with how small the room was but it was very clean and suited our needs well. Our room had 2 beds, Queen and Single with a nice fridge, air, small bathroom and tv. We didn't need the air being close to the water. We just kept our windows open and was very comfortable. Every morning in the courtyard, they had a nice breakfast set up that consist of muffins, yogurts, banana's, juice and coffee. Every now and then something special was thrown in there like apple pies. Pool area looked nice even though we didn't get a chance to use it. Front desk was very helpful with directions to places and handed out maps. Heck they even offered to let us use the laptop. Overall, I would def stay here again especially for it's charm, price and location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you want a nice location, where the service is "old school" this is the place to go. The owner and his son are second to no-one when it comes to good old fashioned service. From the moment we arrived we were treated like important guests and like they were happy to be hosting us. The owner and his son can be seen milling about the property for most of the day and were quite happy to provide area information, tips and just good old fashion conversation. They always had time to chat. The rooms, while not huge, were big enough and came with all the expected features, TV, fridge etc. They provided a better than average complimentary breakfast, lots of free parking, a nice quiet location and did I mention service!! All for a reasonable price and considerably lower than the "big chain" accomodations in the area. I would stay at the Dolphin Motel again and recommend to others in a heartbeat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in July 2011. Very clean and simple. Yes rooms are small but this shouldn't matter if you are out sightseeing. We weren't driving at this part of the holiday but bus stop is pretty much around the corner from the motel. You will have to make a few changes to get most places though! Quiet location therefore good sleeps! What definitely makes this motel is the staff. It's a system that seems to work perfectly. Reception, management, cleaning staff all seem to put effort into their jobs and it pays off. it's so nice to see! They couldn't do enough for you and they take pride in their business, some big hotels could learn lessons. We borrowed a hair-dryer from hotel when we were there - I note an earlier review says this was not possible. We travelled around a variety of hotels and motels during our stay, this was easily the cheapest and definitely one of the best in terms! Holly is a legend!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed our stay here in early March. I had reviewed the motel via Trip Advisor and was fully aware of what to expect. Yes, the rooms are small but they are super clean and sufficient if all you need is to rest your tired body. You cannot beat this location and what they offer! Since we were out and about every day, we didn't partake of the breakfast but from the looks of it, it was pretty substantial (fruits, muffins, coffee)! The folks here are genuinely nice and offered us the use of a GPS if we needed one and also offered recommendations for meals. The area is safe to walk around in the evening as well. I would've given this location a higher rating however I couldn't, due to the fact that our noisy neighbors abruptly awoke us at an ungodly early hour. Keep in mind, that the walls are very thin. Other than that, everything was fine and we probably will return again on our next visit to San Diego.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were very pleased with our stay at the Dolphin Motel. Rooms were small but very clean. Front desk staff was always friendly, helpful and accommodating. The location was safe and we had a nice view of the bay from our second floor room. The breakfast served in the morning on the patio was enjoyable in the beautiful San Diego weather! As a person that generally only makes hotel reservations online I was a bit nervous to trust my reservation made over the phone...if you feel this as well - don't fret - my reservation was safe and the prices we agreed upon on the phone when we made the reservation were exactly what we paid. **Sigh of relief Another side note: We were in town for a wedding. Most people in town were staying at the Ramada right across the street at the suggestion of the couple. Everyone we knew that were staying over there had major issues and were all jealous that we were having a nice time at the Dolphin!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I first stayed at the Dolphin Motel shortly after my "release" from an abusive marriage in 2008. I wanted to reclaim San Diego, a place I've loved and visited for years. I drove the eight hours from Tucson for a short three-day weekend and was warmly welcomed by the staff. Felt safe and secure in my little upstairs room with the all-white linens. That first night I walked across the street to a little harbor restaurant for some fish'n-chips, and later fell blissfully asleep between crisp white sheets. I can't tell you how special that weekend was in my old stomping ground in Point Loma. Took the usual drive out to Cabrillo Monument. Anyway...I am thrilled to be returning again in April 2012. The rooms are simple, clean and cozy. Love the little continental breakfast in the morning. This is a great motel for women traveling alone or for anyone who wants clean, inexpensive, and nostalgic retreat in authentic old San Diego.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this motel during a recent visit to San Diego because of the reviews on this site. While I wouldn't rate my stay as highly as most for this motel, I would recommend it as a clean, inexpensive, centrally located place to stay in San Diego. As others have said, the rooms are small, but tidy and everything was in working order. Also as stated, the owners were nice and very helpful with suggestions of activities (one even provided me a coupon for the San Diego zoo). A couple of pesky inconveniences---as our room was situated in the corner, there were no chairs placed outside of our rooms if we wanted to sit outside to enjoy the marina. We would have had to sit in front of other guests' rooms. This seemed to just be true of the corner rooms. Also, as the rooms were small, the air conditioner was directly at the head of the bed. Rooms could get stuffy at night (I happen to prefer air conditioning to the windows open at night). Overall, a nice stay.</p></li>

The breakfast (coffee, muffin, yoghurt) was a bonus. The owners were very friendly and helpfull, as were the guys at the check-inn desk. Hi, Tom Huynh!! One day i saw a sign which said "please be quiet before 9am and after 9pm". The next day however 4 people checked in to the room next to us at 11.45pm, and started showering till 1.30am. Unbelievable, who does that in a motel???? I mentioned it to the owner, and he talked with these people. On the other hand if you put up a sign with the above text, you should not alowe people to check in after 9pm, let alone at midnight! Overal we had a very nice stay in a family owned motel in a great location. We even wanted to stay another night, but the motel was fully booked. I gues that says it all!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 2 nights whilst visiting some friends in San Diego. We based the stay on the good reviews and were not disappointed, the staff were unbelievably friendly, whether it was 7am or 1am. Rooms were clean and adequate, not somewhere you want to spend all day but comfortable enough to spend the night. Amenities are great for this price, we didnt take advantage of anything other than the free breakfast (McDs apple pies, bananas and muffins) but they offered gps and cell phone loan, maps, internet and more. There was a flat screen TV in our room, this was more modern than the 5star hotel we stayed at in LA the night before!! We did a number of touristy things and ended up practically driving past the motel en route to the next activity on a number of occasions, it ended up being a great place based on our itinerary. Gaslamp district nightlife is around $20 in a cab. Again, the the staff were great. They really made the stay pleasant and we will stay next time we are in San Diego.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It wasn't easy figuring out hotels and mapping out college tour visits---from the Bay Area, for myself and my two teenagers on spring break. We stayed at 3 different hotels and I was most interested in this one, after reading this wonderful reviews. After our 2nd hotel on first st. in Azusa (Rodeway Inn) where I felt scared for our lives (somehow the handful of reviews were positive) it was SUCH A RELIEF to come to Dolphin Inn for 2 nights and have that "peace of mind for my soul" in feeling safe, taken care of, and the layout is like a little community. The rooms were cute and clean and quiet. Breakfast was just right for us and appreciated. We arrived from the UCSD tour in pouring down rain and one of the Housekeepers who was outside at that moment offered us HER umbrella. We didn't need it, but that gesture warmed my heart. Of course we appreciated the affordable price too, fit just right into our budget. I agree with all the other reviews, but feeling safe (and relaxed) was the best PLUS for me.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've only ever stayed in the downtown and hotel circle areas for my trips to San Diego so when I needed a place that was guaranteed to be less than $100 and nearby the Point Loma area, I was relieved that my friends mentioned this motel to me. At the time I booked my room, I had two options of rooms: they were either $50 or $75 a night. The room with one queen bed was $50 and the one that's got a queen bed and a twin bed was $75. These rooms are a bit small but if you're looking for a clean place to sleep that's walking distance from where you need to go to it's great. I shared the room with a queen bed and twin bed with two friends and it was comfortable enough. It had a small fridge and a surprisingly nice flat screen TV. Their complimentary breakfast consisted of free coffee and muffins. The staff was impeccably kind and eager to help and I really appreciate them calling a taxi for us in the very early morning. If I ever need to stay at the Point Loma area, I'd gladly come back here. It exceeded my expectations.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staff was nice, and the owner came by our room to give us a hand-drawn map of the area along with advise on how to get the best out of our time. What a great service! The rooms itself were small but neat. Shower was awesome, internet worked but signal was a bit hard to catch. There are free muffins and coffee for breakfast. Location: It is situated close to a yacht harbor, western area of the city towards wonderful Point Loma. If you want to go sportsfishing, you will not find a better location. Car is advisable though to get around to San Diegos nicest places. I can abolutely recommend the following: - San Diego Zoo (full day) - Whale Watching (half day) - Coronado Island (half a day) - Point Loma (half a day) - Restaurant: Point Loma Seefoods (just across the street, voted best restaurant in San Diego) - Drinks: Yardhouse (300 different draft beers to choose from) In the summer I'd imagine the beach area north of the city (Mission Beach, Pacific Beach, La Jolla) will be great too. Overall, this motel is very good value for money.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a great place for us! Married for just under 8 months and still in college = little money to spend! We loved it! Our total for two nights, a thursday and a friday, came out to be about $175 Plus $33 for the Fisherman's Special!! We had checked out and gone deep sea fishing with H & M Landing. We don't reccomend going on the The Premier, the crew was kinda rude and not very helpful. They also fling smelly fish water and who knows what else on everyone as they throw the bait into the water. Which explains the Fisherman's Special at the Dolphin Motel. After returning from the fishing trip we needed a place to clean up, for $33 bucks, you get a room for another two hours! Well worth it after getting fish guts thrown all over us! The staff was helpful, and friendly. The rooms are just like everyone else says. White, clean and small but cozy! This is a great place to stay if you want to go cheaper than the other hotels and just need a place to sleep! Why pay more for a good nights rest?? We highly recommend the Dolphin Motel for anyone who wants just that!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booking was complicated with the guys. I called them from my european cellphone which made the booking procedure expensive, they where very slow and it took them about 20 minutes... The motel is very well located next to the harbour and it is fun going down there in the morning watch the fishing crews go on the boats and in the evening see them coming back. The room we were in was tiny, had AC, fridge and TV. The bathroom was tiny too. Everything was clean and nice. The place doesn't have a pool. For what you get I think it is not so perfect as others say. I think you might get better places for the same money. We payed 82 $ for the first night and 116 $ for the second. If you stay there go to the harbour just across the street. You can see a bar with a shop for fishers on your right hand. Go there!!! Having a Caesar Salad with grilled shrimps and a Corona watching the sunset and the fishermen on the porch direct at the sea is amazing, the food is perfect! Try breakfast too, awesome pancakes!!!! Unfortunately I don't remember the name. The place next door has huge icecream cones! Try them too!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose to stay at the Dolphin Motel for four nights because of all the rave reviews we read on Tripadvisor. I must say we were not disappointed! The rooms are smaller but set up very functional. There is plenty surface areas to spead out your things. There is a big closet, great shower, nice bathroom with a big mirror, big flat screen TV, free WiFi which we did not use. The whole place is immaculate, including the outside courtyard where free coffee, muffins, yogurt, fruit is served every morning. What more can you ask for? This motel is run by a father and son team, Holly and Allan who are totally dedicated to the comfort and well being of their guests. At one point we could not find a specific place in the harbor so we returned to the motel, within minutes we were in Holly's car being driven to the place. The reception desk staff, Steve and Jeb, very so professional looking, always wearing a tie, were so friendly and helpful also. My husband and I did not rent a car, so they explained everything about the bus system and how to get to places. The bus stop is just around the corner from the motel. All this for only $55.00 a night!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my second stay and it was even better than the first! I am so grateful to Tripadvisor for finding this delightful place. If you have forgotten what good customer service feels like, stay here. These people are wonderful and have a special place in my heart. So much so that I wouldn't take the Hotel del Coronado over the Dolphin Motel. It is so quiet, safe and I sleep like a baby. In the morning we wake up to tasty pastries, juice, and coffee. The owners even brought my daughter little snacks to the door, and sent each member of my family on the road with a cold bottle of water. My husband took notice as we sat on our balcony one evening that no detail goes left unnoticed here...you won't find one lighbulb out or one peice of trash on the ground...it is immaculate. The rooms have everything you need for a comfortable stay and everything you don't. The location is terrific...walk across the street and watch the boats come in, or take a five minute drive to the bay to get some sun. We stay there to take in Sea World which is right down the road. I already can't wait for my next stay! Thank you Dolphin Motel for taking such good care of my family!!! See you next April!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A WONDERFUL CLEAN PLACE FOR VERY LITTLE MONEY AND A VERY FRIENDLY STAFF The Dolphin Motel is very conveniently located, you can get everywhere quickly by car, and the area is nice and quiet, especially at night. The motel is very well-kept and looks very nice. The rooms are kept in white, which looks fresh and clean and gives you a holiday feeling. And it not only looked clean, but WAS impeccably clean. The atmosphere is wonderful, friendly and familiar. Staff was helpful in every way, especially the owner, who took the time to make us hand-drawn maps to the most popular attractions of San Diego. When we left, they even helped us carry our luggage to the car. In the mornings, they have muffins, coffee and orange juice for free, which is totally okay considering the price we paid for the room. Right around the corner is a really good diner/café where we had the most wonderful French toast. At night, you can sit outside on the porch of the motel, which looks out to the marina, and enjoy the summer breeze. In spite of the unbeatably low prices, we felt like we stayed in a truly unique little place where people still care about the well-being of their guests. We highly recommend a stay in this wonderful place!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My daughter and I were booked to stay at the Dolphin Motel for three days during our "girls getaway." We had chosen the motel because of the tripadvisor reviews, looking for something centrally located, comfortable but reasonably priced. We arrived after a very long, frustrating day of travel in which we had our flight delayed due to weather and later diverted due to mechanical problems, resulting in the loss of most of our first day of vacation. Staff at the motel did everything they could to make us feel welcome and get us back into the "we are on holidays!" mindset. Although our original intention had been to find another hotel with pool and modern amenities for our final two nights, we ended up extending our stay at the Dolphin for the full five days. The room was very basic: beds, bathroom with shower, TV. But anything needed was available from the office, including access to laptop with wireless internet and use of the cellphone with unlimited calling throughout the US. The owner and staff were great resources for locating destinations of interest and although GPS was offered, the hand-drawn maps to various points of interest always got us to our destination. What the rooms late in ammenities is certainly made up for in staff attentiveness.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I had an excellent stay at the Dolphin late last year. The motel was located in a very convenient location. The price was amazing!!! We didn't spend a lot of time at the marina, but every place we visited was close by. We had rented a car and there was free parking, which was a bonus. There was also free WiFi which is always an added bonus! The room was immaculately clean, it was on the smaller size, but it had more than enough room for the two of us. The shower pressure was excellent. The daily breakfast of muffins, yogurt, juice and coffee was a nice start to the day. The staff at the motel are very friendly and helpful. Apparently, there are about two to three days of bad weather in San Diego a year...well we were there for all of them. The staff at the Dolphin Motel profusely apologized every time we saw them for the bad weather. It was adorable that they felt so bad about the weather during our visit. The older gentleman gave us an excellent recommendation of an incredibly beautiful drive back to Los Angeles through the mountains via the Sunrise Highway. This is highly recommended! We had already taken the PCH down to San Diego and wanted to see an alternate route. I will definitely come back to stay at the Dolphin Motel next time I am in San Diego.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ok, so its not the Ritz, but it is a motel which will stay in your imagination for a lot longer than a souless big chain. Firstly this is run by a team of highly motivated people, the owner even stopped us in the carpark just to make sure we were going to see all the right things during our brief stay. Needless to stay we were not going to any of these places and were grateful for his 'mud map'. They offer you a gps, mobile phone, suitcase scales and will even print out your boarding passes if you need. The motel is held together by paint and love, it has the big blue dolphin light on the outside along with blue fairy lights. Space is at a premium in the yard, but everthing is put away neatly and this place is so tidy it is scary. Yes the room was small and we did have to stack our suitcases, but it is more the experience than the luxurious motel that you get here. You cannot help but find yourself being caught up by the dedication of these guys. Breakfast was nice, they dont have a breakfast room but it was nice to sit up on the balcony and have our breakfast overlooking the marina. If you just stay one night for the experience it is worth it, they should have tshirts made. I just wish they had a big fat posh hotel to run, the 4 staff could do it with their hands tied behind their backs. We would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here with my husband from 7th - 11th September. We were originally booked in from 6th, but due to delays on our first flight into Atlanta, we didn't get to San Diego until 7th. The staff were fine about this and kept our harbour view room open for us. The motel is an older property and the rooms are small however the price, location, cleanliness and staff all make this a place we would not hesitate to return to if we came back to San DIego. The motel is within walking distance to some nice restaurants, less than five minutes drive from the airport and only 10 minutes drive from downtown and the Gaslamp area. The breakfast isn't fancy - muffins, yogurt, fruit, coffee, tea and juice - but the muffins were someof the nicest I've had and it did the job and saved us paying out each morning for food. The owner took time to recommend places we should see and provided a map to help us get there. We were in San DIego during the blackout and were glad we were at this motel. We didn't have any problem getting into our room as we had a key not an electronic key card, we didn't have a lift to get stuck in, the boats in the harbour opposite provided some light and the owners distributed torches (flashlights) for use in the rooms. They even gave food to people who had arrived late and not had a chance to buy any earlier in the evening. It was the personal touches like this that made this a great place to stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'm all for quirky budget hotels, and like to support standalone businesses. I stayed at the Dolphin on an unseasonably rainy Sunday a few weeks ago, and it was clean, the proprietor was pleasant, and the price was low. But there are a few things potential customers should know. The property consists of two buildings, a main building containing the small check-in office, with rooms whose doors face the harbor, next to the pool and outdoor area, and a second building, which I was shuttled off to. This is basically a sort of shack in the middle of the parking lot, an extremely awkward spot that feels uncomfortably exposed. My tiny room, with its windows facing the stairs and directly over the cars, felt like one of those art projects where a performer lives inside a glass cage on a street.

<li><b>Title:</b> “If You Stay At The Dolphin Motel You Will Have Two Reasons To Return To San Diego”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visit San Diego every year, at least once, and the Dolphin Motel has been my address in S.D. for years. I discovered it, back whenever, because I was staying at a chain motel next door. In walking around Point Loma, I noticed the Dolphin's marquee with its beckoning to "see a room" and "why pay more". So, I did. And thank God I did. I've been a regular ever since that day. With the Dolphin Motel you get a nice, little family-owned motel with really comfortable and clean rooms, breakfast served every morning, a welcoming and cordial staff, and all of this is at a price, which the surrounding motels can't touch. On my latest visit, I was warmly greeted by Tom, as I exited my Taxi from the airport, and he quickly checked me in. Steve has been at the reception desk for years and he greets guests as they pass the office on their way to whereever. And, of course, there is Alan and his father, who are around the premises all day long looking after the property and guests' needs. Another interesting thing about the Dolphin Motel, is that many guests come from all parts of the world, and most of them learned about the Dolphin from www.tripadvisor.com . This gives the atmosphere at breakfast, especially, a true international feeling with different accents and languages being spoken. As I said in the title to this posting, if you stay at the Dolphin Motel while in San Diego, you will have two reasons to return to S.D. First, you will want to again experience the hospitality of the Dolphin Motel, and second, well, they don't call San Diego "America's Finest City" for nothing!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">PROS:- Great Price for SD. I wanted on the beach and motels were 275 up a nite. -Good Location: another review panned the location. I think it's great. it is near the ocean. It is not far from Nimitz on Harbor so great access to SeaWorld and Mission Beach. Great access to the downtown harbor cruises and Midway. 5-10 minutes from the airport. Safe. They have a guard 24 hours with video cam surveillance of the entire property. -Great Service. Family owned and everyone gives you so much help planning your vacation, trips, post office, advice about what to see. Really nice people. -Good continental breakfast: excellent muffins, yogurt, coffee, OJ. That's it but tasty and filling. -Free Parking -Good AC with a refrigerator inside -Soft comfortable bed. If you need stiff bed you won't like it but I found it nice. -Free internet. CONS: -small rooms without furniture other than bed and luggage racks and metal chair. For 1 person with alot of luggage fine. 2 People with alot of luggage each may find them stacking one on top of the other. You will be living out of your luggage. -small bathroom with nonadjustable shower head in small shower. You can't point the shower head at your feet to remove the sand. They need removable european shower heads and it would be oK. Probably drive the price up but this is a useful feature. it is SD and you will be going to the beach and water sports so that would be a nice feature. Crowded bathroom with 1 person inside. But the PROS outweight the CONS. I enjoyed my stay. I would recommend it to friends and I will be back if I can a reservation now that it is so popular.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for four nights in the beginning of December. We had three rooms total, with extended family that met up with us for a visit. The proprietor and staff are just amazing, I haven't experienced customer service like this ever. From the front desk to the housekeeping staff everyone was friendly and helpful - went out of their way to be accomodating and think of things we might need even before we asked. Two examples; the housekeeper brought extra blankets to our rooms one evening because the temps were expected to be low that night, and one morning the guy from the front desk came running out of the office with 4 bottles of water for our group as we were loading in the car to head out for a day trip, just because he thought we might need it. The rooms are small, bathrooms are small and the furnishing is very basic. Pillows are not soft, so bring your own if thats important to you. The rooms are clean and functional, have free wireless internet and cable tv. No telephone, microwave or coffee pot in rooms. They will provide a hairdryer, telephone or gps on request and will print boarding passes and weigh luggage at the front desk. We stayed both upstairs and downstairs as we switched rooms to have a harbor view when one became available - there were alot of raves about the view but I didn't find it that great, nice but not necessary. They do provide a continental breakfast which was average fare. There are coffee shops, restaurants, bookshop, pharmacy, and little gift shops all within walking distance. All in all this is a fantastic place; clean, safe, central location, great service and price.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Disappointing Room and Location, Excellent Personnel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Selected this motel because of the rating of being #7 in San Diego and price was reasonable ($60-$70). I'm not a fancy room person, usually keep things cheap 2-3 star so my level of need is reasonable. The room was smallish and old, but very clean as everyone says. There was no shampoo and no phone in the room (though one was available in the office) and a hole in the screen that let some termites in onto the bathroom windowsill. Parking was crowded and on the opposite side of the building from the room entrances. There were other places that were similarly priced closer to the cruise port,downtown and the other sights. (we had a car, so not a big deal, but still added 5-10 minutes to our drive each time. If you were going sport fishing, it is perfectly located. Walking distance to many marina locations. As mentioned in other reviews, the staff was absolutely excellent. Very accommodating, friendly, cleaning staff and front desk. GPS available for free (if not already taken out), local phone calling on their cell, printer for online boading passes, wi-fi for free and nice TV with lots of channels. Breakfast was pretty good. Open air, so when it rained (as it did for us), the microwave is not available (covered and unplugged), but great on a normal San Diego morning. Fresh apple/berry pies from McDonalds on most mornings, OJ, yogurt, coffee, muffins. Good continental breakfast served till a leisurely 10:30 am which was great. I hate those places that start at 6am and shut down by 9am. So, the room was the disappointment but the staff was excellent. I think there are better places to stay in the same price point that would be closer and a bit roomier and updated. I will be looking for other places to stay, even for a few extra dollars, next time I visit San Diego.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As is often the case with properties that have been reviewed many many times, most of the virtues and vices have been listed and what really becomes important is what we each seek as travelers. We selected this property based on TA reviews and moved in for 9 days in late January. Yes, the rooms are small, with a main room about 12 feet by 12 feet, a small bathroom with shower and a smaller closet. The property is a wood (rather than tip-up concrete) frame builiding, built in 1957. Over the years there have been minor changes to various walls (new a/c, moved towel racks, et al) so the walls are not perfectly smooth. A power cable to the a/c and the cable to the 32 inch flat screen t.v. were both surface mounted on the walls. The windows are double pane but you can hear a loud motorcycle on occasion. And because the walls are wood/drywall you might hear the next door heat pump a/c turn on. What you WILL get is a comfortable quality mattress, fluffy white towels, all white bedding--the owner was justly proud of using a white bedspread to show how clean it was instead of the typical mottled dark colors in use elsewhere. The owners, who were there every day, and all the office staff were unfailingly polite, helpful, and full of suggestions for places to go and things to see. As a lark I walked over to the Vagabond motel which is a block away and also well reviewed. The price I was quoted was $26 dollars per day more than The Dolphin. For the $26 we would have had a little plastic bottle of shampoo every day, a slightly larger selection of breakfast rolls and 100 more square feet of space. You'll have to decide if that is important to you. At the time we were there most of the other guests were a mix of ages, but all uniformly quiet and pleasant.
