<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had great time in Paris made better by our stay at this hotel. On two metro lines which was convenient since the hotel is farther out then we realized. But neighborhood is nice with great restaurants around the area. Rooms are small but well done. Might stay in closer for the same price. But if you want a modern boutique hotel, give it a try.</p></li>

However, it was clean, comfortable, extremely close to 2 Metro lines, on a quiet side road with helpful friendly staff. What more would you want?

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived late on a Friday night. The receptionist was super friendly and checked us in quickly. Once we got to the room, we noticed 6 complimentary pasteries. The room was a good size, clean, and was very modern. The hotel is a great location with loads of restaurants and cafes just steps away. There are 2 metro stations just a few minutes walk from the hotel. All the staff were so friendly and helpful!</p></li>

This hotel is too far away and in a poor location. The prices are not justified. To their credit the management decided to throw in breakfast and reduce the rate slightly to keep us here -but it put a total damper on our Paris holiday knowing we paid too much and ended up so far out.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We can't decide which we liked best. The huge bed, the luxury bath or the fantastic breakfasts. The furnishings are sleek and the people who work there are happy so they can't help but be helpful. There are three metro stops within 2-5 minutes walk so the location isd grand. We walked to the Seine a few times, 15-20 min and it's less than 5 min to the gardens at Luxemborg. This one of the nicest hotels that we have ever stayed at. The spa is a must!</p></li>

The bed linen and towels were excellent quality - lovely thick fluffy towels!! Soft comfy pillows. Pleasant and helpful staff. Two minutes from metro. Quiet room was spotlessly clean.

The beds are firm and give a good nights sleep. If you stay here, check out one of the best little restaurants in Paris called "le carre de marguerite" a 5 minute walk.</p></li>

We received a free upgrade, which made our stay even more enjoyable. Most of all: the beds are the best!! Spacious and perfect-feeling mattresses. Furthermore rooms are, for Paris standards, quite big and provision of slippers and bathrobe adds to luxurious feeling. Staff is very friendly and helpful. 3 metro stations just around the corner, many places to eat and drink. Hotelbar is nice, but quite expensive.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at Hotel Le Six last weekend and really must say that we had the most wonderful stay we ever had in Paris. Staff was just overwhelming. They are all fluent in English and apparently speak many other languages as I heard at the front desk. Rooms are spacious and very well designed. Ironing board and coffe maker are definetely not the standard in Paris, at Le Six it is. Concierge recommanded some great restaurants around and their breakfast buffet was just perfect, a bit of everything. Will definetely go back there Hans Antwerpen</p></li>

I delivered my custom-designed painting to Le Six for the Hotel Reception area and was pleased to see that it has found a perfect "home" in the reception area! The service while once again staying the week at the hotel was excellent..the entire staff was helpful and most accommodating when I required assistance. I hope to make this hotel my stop each year when traveling to Paris. Its the type of hotel you would expect to see in such an elegant city....Paris.</p></li>

The staff were very friendly and helpful, the room and bathroom were excellent, so much so that I was just happy spending time in my room, and breakfast was awesome. The coffee was very good and I am particular about my coffee. The hotel is on a quiet side street with 3 metro stops nearby and airport buses are at Montparnasse station which is about a 10 minute walk. I would definitely stay here again if I return to Paris. Le Six is a small, classy hotel without being pretentious.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent the weekend at Hotel Le Six in Paris. The location was ideal. Close to the metro and ten minutes walk to RER which brings you directly to the airport. Service and staff excellent. Pleasant and accommodating. Rooms modern and all amenities. Molton Brown bathroom products and an excellent hair drier (always important for me). Slightly expensive but worth every penny. Buffet breakfast was excellent. Good selection and warm buffet also. Loads of restaurants and bars located just by the hotel. 5 minutes walk from the Luxembourg Gardens. An absolute gem!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel on Travelocity and we were not dissapointed. The hotel is a very cute boutique hotel and the rooms are modern. We were upgraded at check in to a deluxe room, the room had beautiful hard wood floors, a fabulous shower (rain shower) and the bed was super comfortable. We were not sure what to expect, because we booked the hotel last minute and wanted something that was nice, in a great location that didn't break the bank. I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff were also very nice. (Also, the free internet access from the room is a nice touch).</p></li>

I loked this place up in Traveladvisor and it was a winner! from the moment I made a booking online, they contacted me by email and confirmed my booking. Eveyone is friendly, and unlike what other people think of the French, they were most accommodating and they spoke better English than my French. The man at the front desk even offered to translate the menu from the restaurant across the road. I recommend checking out the restaurant across the lane. Quaint and nice.</p></li>

He made a fantastic choice! Location is great; very close to 2 metros and the beautiful Luxembourg gardens and there are plenty of cafes and restaurants nearby. The hotel is small and boutique, beautifully furnished with a cute bar, restaurant and spa. Hotel staff were unbelievably helpful, bedrooms were lovely and the power shower was fab! It's tucked away off a side street, so it's very quiet and I slept like a log both nights! I would thoroughly recommend to stay in this hotel whilst in Paris.</p></li>

Some architectural hints to the past are retained: tall window opens up to view a lovely courtyard, old style wire cage elevator (in addition to modern elevator). Breakfast was very good and will sustain you for your walk around the charming neighborhood. Staff is extremely helpful and pleasant. I took their recommendation and dined across the street at Michel's (the perfect French restaurant). Would definitely stay at Le Six again. Metro is close by. Invalides and Rodin museum are about 20 min walk.</p></li>

We did not have the breakfast, it is pricey and there are too many great cafe's within a few blocks for half the price. The staff were amazing, even at 5 am when my girlfriend and I stumbled in after a very long day/night of drinking...husbands made us climb the Effil tower the next day (we paid dearly)!

We really enjoyed the location the most, as we were on a quiet street yet within close walking distance to many restaurants near Montparnasse. It is also close to 2 metro stops which is very convenient. The only problem I encountered was that when I tried to extend our stay by 1 night, the hotel could not accomodate us. I had originally reserved our room for that night, but changed it when we checked in, so it was my fault, but still very inconvenient that within a day, our ability to stay that extra night was gone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This really is the perfect hotel for a romantic weekend in Paris. I took my girlfriend away for a surprise weekend and we both loved it there. The room was amazing, it was a great size with lots of character and a lovely bathroom. The staff were always very friendly and could not have been more helpful. The location is very good, its on a quiet street just around the corner from a main road with lots of restaurants and bars. There is also a side street full of creperies so you are spoilt for choice. For metro access its great with two stations just around the corner and another two only a five minute walk away so you can travel to anywhere in Paris with ease.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great little 'boutique' hotel on a quiet little street just off Blvd. Raspail in the 6th arrondisement. Two different metro stations just steps away, while the great cafés and shops of the Saint Germain neighborhood just minutes away by foot. Also, great restaurants along Montparnasse Avenue just around the corner. We had booked a 'superior' room but got upgraded to a wonderful 'junior suite' on the top floor...absolutely fantastic, balcony, lots of windows, huge bathroom, and great Paris rooftop views with the Sacre Coeur in the distance. Has a spa and gym, but didn't use it. Breakfast was expensive, but who cares when there is a bakery around the corner. I shall return!</p></li>

We were welcomed by a smile and a receptionist who could not have been more pleasant and helpful. She directed us to our room which was stylish, bright, very well equiped and very comfortable. The bath/shower room was very much high spec! After returning late from dinner we wanted to find a venue with live music. The night time receptionist could not have been more helpful, phoning a number of venues to find out what music there was and what time it would finish. He then directed us and we had a really fun night. Needless to say we will return</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel le Six is the best hotel we have ever experienced. The concierge services were outstanding. Each person working in this area were very helpful, friendly and accommodating. Anything we needed was provided to us, with many nice surprises along the way, including help translating directions to taxi drivers and helping us use the Metro, which is very close by. The hotel is on a quiet street, but only a short walk to a thriving shopping area. Local food was wonderful, and the staff suggestions were terrific. The room we stayed in was beautifully appointed and gleaming clean. We highly recommend this charming boutique hotel that was quintessentially French in beautiful Montparnasse.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything you read here is true. Hotel Le Six is the perfect place to spend a city break in a very busy place. We arrived and were greeted very pleasantly by smiling reception staff who continued to smile and help with any and every request we had. The room was small but had everything you need including a very powerful rain shower and spacious bath. Breakfast was continental and was very satisfactory with bread, pastries, cereals, cheeses, meats, juices and hot drinks. The barman was always smiling and brought us some wonderful macaroons our first night! I highly recommend this hotel, it's not cheap but you really do get what you pay for. I would definately choose this hotel again for a stay in Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I cannot say enough positive things about the service of the staff. To give you an example I accidentally created a small flood in our room. My husband and I came back to our room after being gone all day to a small layer of water all over our bathroom floor. The staff immediately responded, investigated and I determined it had been my fault. They were nice enough not to blame me and put us in a better room with a bottle of champagne and strawberries, even though, it was not their fault. They were all very, very professional. The rooms are not huge but very, very nice and modern. The breakfast was among the best I have ever had. It offered almost everything you could imagine. The location was very good.</p></li>

The location is convenient to many metro stops and there are a number of bistros and shops in walking distance. We were pleasantly surprised when we received a complimentary upgrade to a larger room when we arrived. Our room was spacious and quiet. The bathroom was large, there was plenty of hot water and the room was spotless. The bed was very comfortable and the free internet was a real bonus and easy to use. The staff was friendly and spoke English well. The gentleman at the the reception desk at night was particularly helpful and friendly. I highly recommend Hotel Le Six. We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in this hotel for three nights while on business in Paris. It is located pretty central in my favorite location in Paris, and close to a Metro. I was greeted by a more than friendly staff, and the room was spacious (very much so for being Paris), fresh and inviting. WiFi, TV and room for work was also very good. Breakfast: a nice and quiet area, with enough space between the tables. Attentive and friendly staff, newspapers, and an ample choice of high quality food. I have only to issues for improvement: Coffee, which I would like hotter, and the scrambled eggs which did not seem to come from fresh eggs (I may be wrong since I did not try it). In general: one of the very best of my hotel experiences in Paris. I look forward to visit this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were greeted afer a LONG 10hr+ flight, by front desk staff that told us our room was not ready- and WE had flown ALL night - so very desperate to shower, sleep etc. after, we stressed our dismay- They quickly, came up with a room and from here, we received excellent customer service, friendly, efficient, and courteous! The room is small (paris standard- normal) but, the room is clean, modern, bright, and the bathroom is wonderful with a large, modern, tile shower. Since, the hotel is a boutique we appreciated the cozy atmosphere. The location is close to the tulleries park which we enjoyed for AM runs, but a fair distance to all the tourist sights etc. IF you enjoy walking, great location, if you need to be close to all tourist sights- you must be prepared to walk, bus, or taxi.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We really had a wonderful four-night stay at Hotel Le Six in February during our first visit to Paris. Having booked several months in advance, I was able to secure a greatly reduced rate for a deluxe room, which was located on the fourth floor of the hotel, overlooking the quaint and quiet Rue Stanislas. We have nothing but good things to say about all aspects of Le Six -- the staff was gracious, professional, helpful and friendly; our room was clean, bed was comfortable and the bathroom had modern amenities; the private steam room in the spa downstairs was a nice retreat after a full day of walking around the city; and the location was ideal for getting around either on foot or by Metro. I would recommend Le Six to anyone visiting Paris, and I'd be sure to stay there again on our return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was the first hotel in TripAdvisors top 10 in Paris that we found an opening and could afford. It was a little more than we usually spend on a hotel, but it was for my first trip to Paris, a dream come true, so we decided to splurge a little. It was so worth it. It is the perfect location - close to Metro stops for every line & RER. It's in a nice neighborhood away from any street noise. Just around the corner we found a street Creperie the first night with the most unbelievable crepes! The room was indeed small, but so nicely laid out with 3 wardrobes, so plenty of closet space. The bathroom was very large with a huge walk-in shower, really lovely. We didn't try breakfast as it was pretty pricey. All in all, we loved everything about it! So glad we found this unique place on TripAdvisor.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed in paris several times and have become used to dissapointment in the hotels. This is a four star, and by Paris standards, I agree. But, not by standards outside of Paris. The service friendly and room clean and well appointed. Ok size too. But all just OK if you compare to Asia or US. The bed was a true double...not two singles pushed together. Shower was a highlight, but low pressure let it down a bit. Still, for the money, I would stay here again and recommend it. Location is great if you want left bank. Close to a metro and walking distance to central Paris. Warning: Check if breakfast is included. If not, there is no way it worth the 22 Euro they want for it. Very basic. Better off heading out onto the stree where there is plenty of choice (even a starbucks for the Americans).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was the second hotel I found through Splendia and Splendid it was! The hotel is clean and has lots of modern amenities. We were upgraded to a Deluxe room and it was a very large room, especially for European standards. The bathroom was modern and huge and had beautiful teak floors. The towel warmer, rainforest shower and speedy internet service were great benefits. The room was super quiet and the bed very comfortable. We only wish we had more time there! The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. They made several restaurant recommendations (the one we took was excellent) and very accommodating to all of our requests and needs. Our friends stayed at Le Meridien and the staff there were rude and impersonal. At Le Six we felt extremely welcomed and can't wait to go back. HIghly recommend!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just returned from a week-long vacation in Paris and we absolutely adored this hotel. Our room was immaculately clean, the service was always incredibly pleasant, and it was very quiet. I have lived in Paris and have been back many times and this was by far my favorite hotel. The rooms are quite modern in terms of decor and the bathrooms are surprisingly spacious, with great showers. We chose to upgrade to a suite, as the concierge offered it to us for a reasonable additional fee, which allowed us to check in right away (after an all-night flight) and included their delicious breakfast buffet each day. The hotel staff was very accommodating and we found the breakfast buffet to be a very nice treat every morning. I will definitely be going back to stay at le Six on our next trip to Paris!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We already had high expectations about this hotel from other reviews here at tripadvisor, but we were still amazed that everything is true or even better. The most effective and very pleasant staff, beautiful room, high-quality bed, quiet sleep and excellent breakfast, what more one can wish on the trip to Paris? The hotel location is great, plenty of restaurants in walking distance, subway practically in front of the hotel, but still the hotel is hidden in the side street and with good windows its rooms are very quiet. Breakfast was also superb, e.g. the wide choice of excellent juices is unusual. However, our best experience remains with the hotel staff - everyone was always nice and ready to help, and all our requests were promptly fulfilled. We can really recommend this hotel to anyone, you will not regret...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had such a wonderful time at this hotel and in Paris I don't know where to begin. On arrival to the hotel we were greeted warmly and shown directly to our room as an early check in. The room was clean and had a comfy king size bed. We had a room facing the street but had no problem with noise at night or in the morning. Bathroom was great(I'm a real clean freak). Location was very good for dining and for the Metro. Try dinner across the street, very good traditional French food at a good price. Breakfast was good and filling. Had some good breads and cheeses plus more. I can not say enough good things about the staff. We loved them all. Very helpful. Thank you again! We stayed for 10 days here and had no problems. Two nights we were there we had entertainment at the bar/lounge which was nice. Hope to stay again !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Tucked away in a quiet little side street we both really enjoyed Le Six, it of course helped being upgraded to a suite. For Paris the room size has to be considered enormous, big showers and excellent toileteries. The staff were always very pleasant and welcoming and we would definately return again. Eating in the area was a little disappointing and not cheap. Having previously stayed around the area of L'Opera which has excellent restaurants, those we visited in this very touristy area of Paris were disappointing both in menu choice and availability. Maybe we were just unlucky but you may find you have to do more investigation into the good restaurants than we did - usually in France you do not have to walk far to find good food. Excellent location for the metro and we able to get around the city with ease and comfort.</p></li>

You are treated like a celebrity and made to feel at home. Any problem? - solved to your satisfaction without hesitation. Chic, stylish, understated, attention to detail, all those elusive qualities every hotel wants Le Six has in abundance. A discreet and excellent location off Blvd Montparnasse puts guests steps from delicious food, little shops, transportation, and all things Paris. The bed was so comfortable with fine linens so sleeping my time away was a tempting option. However, the City of Light beckoned and we were resigned to cherishing our stay at Hotel Le Six as one of the highlights of an incredible holiday.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We visited Le Six for a few nights as part of our honeymoon. It's a great little hotel and ideally located - short stroll to about a dozen restaurants and bars and just around the corner from the Metro. The RER station (Port Royal) is around 10 minutes walk and it's a pleasant walk through the Luxembourg Palace gardens up to the river and beyond. The rooms are quite small but everything is modern, clean and very comfortable. The only down point is that there are no drawers to put your clothes in. Breakfast seems expensive at Eur22 each however, it's actually great value compared to paying Eur11 for a coffee, juice, stick of bread and a croissant outside. You get everything from fresh fruit, yogurts, cereal, pancakes, bread, croissants, pastries, cooked meats, cheeses as well as eggs, sausages, bacon, mushrooms. More than enough to set you up for the day. Would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed at Hotel Le Six over Thanksgiving break. The hotel is brand new, the rooms are very clean and pretty spacious by European standards. We stayed in a suite and really enjoyed the extra space. The breakfast each morning is fantastic, with quality food and good service. Definately take advantage of the complimentary steam bath in the spa! The reception staff are very friendly and very helpful - they were very pleasant when we needed restaurant recommendations and show reservations. The maintenance staff is also very thorough and very courteous. There are several metro stops within walking distance - making the rest of Paris extremely accessible. The 12 line metro is only 1 block away. Saint Michel's Latin Quarter is also in walking distance, along with all it's fantastic brasseries. All-in-all a fantastic experience at this hotel, and I would definately stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I were recently visiting Paris for our anniversary. When planning this trip, I was a bit concerned about Paris' reputation for being unfriendly to Americans. The staff at Hotel Le Six completely shattered this concern for us. Over four days, we met 5-6 different employees working at the front desk. EVERY ONE of them was super friendly and helpful to us. They helped us book dinner reservations, gave us directions, instructed us about transportation and made our experience wonderful. The rooms are very clean and up to date. Although the room was small for the price, the hotel made up for it with a comfortable lounge and bar near the lobby. Thank you to the staff for making our visit so enjoyable. Last tip: don't call a taxi to come to the hotel. They start the meter when the hotel calls them which runs the fee up. (I guess this is standard practice in France). Once we learned this, we found that we could walk 1 block and grab a taxi for half the cost.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This little gem of a hotel is convenient to metro, shops, restaurants. The amenities at the hotel are wonderful. Wi-Fi codes are given per device (I needed 2) and even though they expire in 2 days you can get new ones quickly from the Reception. My only criticism which was never really resolved was that the bed's comforter/duvet was too heavy and hot. I requested a sheet to be placed under the comforter but no one seemed to understand me.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is very well located on a quiet neighborhood, close to the magnificent Luxembourg gardens, less than a few minutes walking from 4 different metro stations and, if weather helps, you can enjoy a nice walk to the Latin Quarter, Notre Dame, etc. A taxi to Orly airport takes less than half an hour. The hotel quality is, in general, very satisfactory, although maybe we were expecting something a little more luxurious for a 4 stars hotel. For example, the room was clean, noiseless and comfortable, with a huge bed, but the room itself and the bathroom were small (we booked a double deluxe room), with just a small bottle of gel and shampoo for 2 people. Buffet breakfast was also excellent, but again the cafeteria was really small. The hotel service was very nice and always ready to help. We also enjoyed a massage and sauna session (on a very small cabin...). In overall, we are very pleased with our stay at Hôtel Le Six, but there is always room for improvement.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I visited Hotel Le Six for our 10th anniversary (leaving our 3 little ones behind!). We have both been to Paris separately, but this was the first time visiting together. The hotel was wonderful - modern, comfortable, and in a superb location. The staff members were all very polite and friendly, and tolerated (perhaps even appreciated?) my lame attempts at speaking French. Alex, the Bartender, was our favorite, providing us with wonderful restaurant recommendations, and keeping us entertained with discussions of French life and politics. The only disappointment was the "gym" - really more of a little nook with a couple of out-dated pieces of cardio equipment (this wasn't a huge problem, though, as we were able to run around the Jardin du Luxembourg every day before walking for hours). My husband was not a huge fan of Paris before this trip. His opinion is now much different, and I'm sure this is, in part, thanks to the hotel and its fabulous staff. We will definitely be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I were going to Paris for the first time to see all of the sights and celebrate my 30th Birthday. We stayed at Hotel Le Six after looking through tripadvisor, and seeing the good reviews. A friend of mine suggested that we stayed in the 5th or 6th district as it was upmarket, and not too touristy. The hotel is located in a fantastic part of Paris - there are 3 metro stations all within a 2-3 min walk on different lines so you can get out and about really easily. The area is nice and quiet, but a 30 second walk and you are onto a main road that has everything that you'd need - bars, restaurants, tabacs etc. The area also seems very safe, we got back at about midnight once and walked from the metro station to the hotel and felt very safe. The hotel decor is really nice, obviously been done recently. The rooms are great - quite small, but apparently most are in Paris. The bathrooms are also really nicely decorated, and have 1st class products for you to use. I would recommend this hotel as top class. We'd definately stay here if we went back to Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in the hotel on honeymoon trip. Pro: Nice morning staff. Nice hospitality, clean and quite room. Cons: Poor english speaking staff in evening and morning. On last day of my departure, I called the reception and asked to book a taxi to the airport. Taxi arrived 30 minutes early and I was informed by the hotel staff about its arrival. When I questioned its early arrival, I was told over the phone that the txi will not charge anything extra (no waiting charges). However, when I paid for the taxi, it charged me 22 euros as waiting charges. I immediately called hotel reception and informed him about the charges. The receptionist suggested that I have to pay for that and there are always waiting charges in Paris. I was so disappointed with the lack of communication and I have to unnecessarily pay 22 euros from my pocket. I felt that I have to pay for something which I never used.Though staff was nice, I would suggest them to hire better English speaking staff in the evening so that these incidents never happen again. Not very conveniently located from Paris attractions.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 5 nights at Le Six and found the accomodations and service to be very good. The location is ideal if you are planning on doing a lot of touring as there are several major metro stations nearby, you can get anywhere very quickly from this area. The neighborhood also has a lot of good walk out cafe/restaurants and decent shopping but doesn't feel overly touristy. The room was clean, comfortable and good size. We came early and mid-week so were lucky to be upgraded to a lightly larger room. Everything was very clean and had a comfortable modern updated feel. The breakfast was excellent and a good value with a nice selection to fuel up before heading out for the day. The reception staff was very accomodating prior to the trip (responsive to email) and while we were there to help with dinner recommendations and reservations. Everyone was very friendly and spoke English when our attempts at French weren't enough. Overall Le Six was a great value and very nice stay with good service, we would recommend it to anyone looking for an upscale boutique hotel in a great location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I were booked in to the sister hotel Le Relais St Jacques. On arrival we were told that we were being moved to Hotel Le Six due to "technical work". We felt very hesitant about this but were reassured that it would be just as nice. We had already treated ourselves to an upgrade to a superior room (about £190 per night). When we arrived at Le Six the receptionist told us we were to stay in their Junior Suite, one of their finest rooms (goes for 600 euros per night on the price list!). The room wasn't huge, there was no sitting area, but very nice. Lovely bed with huge pillows and good quality linen. Fantastic bath room with shower and bath tub, lovely bath products, and a separate WC. The room also had a view over Sacre Coeur if you craned your head out of the window! The location is the best with two metros on 2-3 minutes walk and Le Jardins de Luxembourg very close. We never had anything to eat or drink at the hotel as it was very expensive even for Paris. The staff were very friendly and helpful and everyone we spoke to were happy to switch to English. We had a lovely stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Hotel Le Six for 2 weeks. We researched extensively before we left and were very pleased we chose this hotel. It is clean, fresh and well maintained. Initially, I was a bit hesitant about booking because of the hotel's willingness to accommodate some pets (this didn't strike me as being particularly hygienic), but it was very clean. Every staff member is cheerful and friendly and went the extra mile at every turn. The rooms, though quite small are very nice. Perhaps a selection of in-house movies could have been offered. The breakfasts are buffet-style with plenty of choice. The location couldn't be better, very close to two metro stops and in the nicest area of Paris, and within walking distance of the centre of Paris. We had the internet special deal of 209 Euros per night for a Classique room (including breakfast). We'd recommend a room with a street view - from what we could tell the courtyard view wasn't as good. We loved the live music they had in the little bar area on occasion too! Hotel Le Six was a lovely mix of quaint and modern. They deserve there 'Hotels of Distinction' high rating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having read many reviews of a variety of Paris hotels, we chose Le Six based on the combination of location, quality, user ratings, value and comfort and it turned out to be a great choice. Rue Stanislas is a quiet street located between Jardines du Luxembourg and Boulevard du Montparnasse. Reception staff are friendly and knowledgeable and seem to enjoy their job. Bellman was charming. The breakfast which was included in our rate was very good indeed with a nice spread of cheeses, fruits, cereals and breads as well as very good coffee. Our room overlooked Rue Stanislas but was still very quiet. The bed is comfortable and large and the entire room is a good size for a Paris Hotel. Bathroom was warm with nice fixtures and large walk-in shower. Decor is modern and warm at the same time. Decent size closet with digital safe which was useful. If you get good weather and like to walk you can enjoy Paris by day and night from this location. We walked all the way to the Eiffel Tower from here no problem at all. At night you are spoiled for choice for restaurants, but I suggest getting recommendations from the staff, they will help you get what you are looking for.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Hotel Le Six for a week to celebrate our 10 yr anniversary. It was the perfect hotel for us. Having stayed in St Germain before we knew we liked the area, but this location even exceeded our expectations. Last time we had stayed a bit closer to the Seine, but I much prefer where this hotel is situated. The street is very quiet, but close to Montparnasse subway, one of the most connected subway stops in Paris. Loved being close to Luxembourg Gardens. Rue Vavin is also super cute for strolling. The hotel is beautiful. Small, stylish, modern and sophisticated. We had a good size room and very comfortable bed. Beautiful decor. The bathroom was gorgeous. Small little balcony facing the street. The staff and service were incredible. Everyone was extremely polite, friendly and helpful. They gave great restaurant recommendations and called to make the reservations for us. Also gave detailed instructions to find the sweetest kid's toy store I've ever seen. I had a massage in the spa and it was lovely. Enjoyed the breakfast as well and drinks at the little lobby bar. We will definitely stay at Hotel Le Six the next time we are in Paris. If only it were sooner!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in this hotel for one week and cannot say enough good things about its style, its cleanliness, its great staff, it excellent location and the comfort and size of the room and bathroom (for Paris). I put it on par with a W-Hotel in terms of style and comfort (fewer ammenities though) at half the price and "attitude" ;-). I was at the hotel on my birthday and they even sent up a bottle of nice champagne on the house. Very close to Luxembourg Gardens via rue Vavin--which is a quaint shopping street (nice chocolate vendors, clothing boutiques), at the crossroads of Montparnesse and Pres St. Germain which are wall to wall with restaurants and shops. Rue Stanislas is quiet for this location with no late night venues on the block. I walked EVERYWHERE from here, but transit was very close at hand on either Blvd Raspail or Blvd Montparnesse. A nice sized bar fridge made it possible to keep a few nibblies at hand too. Molten Brown toiletries were lovely (bring hair conditioner though), a good hair dryer also a safe and an ironing board and iron in the closet. I will recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Paris and hope the hotel enjoys much well-deserved success.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great modern boutique hotel in the 6th arrondissement (at the southern end, bordering Montparnasse -- perhaps not the most central location, but pretty close to it). Our "classic" room was small, but well kept and very clean. We didn't mind the size of the room since we were only there to sleep, but the only time we did feel that it was undersized was when we realized we didn't have any drawers to put clothing in. But the bed was comfortable and it was nice and quiet. Loved the Molton Brown bath products, but they don't provide conditioner, so bring your own! The staff was extremely accommodating and friendly, and helped us make restaurant reservations even before we arrived (I contacted them easily via email). We never tried the breakfast, but there are plenty of cute cafes and restaurants nearby. The hotel is situated very close to two metro stops so it was easy to get around. And, we were able to walk to most major sights (approx. 30 minutes to get to Saint Germain des Pres, 45 minutes to get to the Louvre, 45 minutes to get to the Eiffel Tower). Wireless internet is free, but it is very spotty -- luckily we only used it to check email occasionally. Overall, great hotel!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family of 4 booked 2 rooms at the Hotel Le Six. This modern boutique hotel is perfectly located in the St Germain area of Paris (arr 6) and it is easy to walk to the majority of major attractions. A metro station is a short walk on Bd du Montparnasse which is awash with activity (restuarants, cafes, shops, theatre etc). The rooms are beautiful and reasonably sized for Paris. The bathrooms are spacious and luxurious. The rooms had a king size bed, and desk with free wi-fi access. Attention to detail was suberb with complimentary bath robes and slippers. On the ground floor is a bar and breakfast room all decorated in funky modern style. There is also a library of reading materials in the bar area. Newpapers are available in several languages each day. But it was the staff that made this hotel stand out. Nothing was a problem and any request was immediately attended to with a smile.They recommended some excellent restaruarnts close to the hotel. It was my wifes Birthday during our stay and we were offerred a complimentary drink at the bar prior to leaving for our celebratory dinner. The staff also sang happy birthday. The hotel is not cheap but when you balance this against the quality and service you will not be disappointed. And finally, there is a massage clinic on the lower floor to help you unwind. Our family were unanimous in praise of the Hotel Le Six. Superbe!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We came to Paris for honeymoon and was shocked to find that our travel agent had booked us into a 3 star hotel that is ranked 1600 out of 1800 hotel in Paris on Trip Advisor! It was simply the most cramped and horrible hotel ever and I immediately started looking for an alternative. After reading so many good reviews, I rang up and spoke to the lovely front manager who was happy to accommodate us at late notice and very understanding. After dropping our bags off at the reception as the room was yet to be ready, we looked around Paris and came back to hotel after dark.

The suite is absolutely amazing with abundance of room and everything is so well laid out and thought through. It actually shames the Hilton Sydney's king suite that we stayed in for our honeymoon night. The suite is so quiet and clean that it makes you feel like you're at home rather than at a hotel.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights after reading the reviews on trip advisor. As it turned out it was an excellent choice and our thanks goes to all the previous travellers who posted reviews. We had travelled all the way from Hong Kong via London and wanted not only a good location in order to see Paris but also a clean, comfortable environment , in a safe area and with helpful staff. We got all of this and more, especially with the Hotel being a few minutes walk from Vavin Metro station (incidentally this is the same Metro line that will take you to and from Gare De Nord without need to change trains) . The room was spacious for Paris, immaculately clean, at a good temperature and very comfortable - and this was a standard room. All the hotel staff were openly friendly and on hand to assist with all the enquiries we had - exactly what we needed. Thanks to them we had a stress free holiday and we left Paris wanting to return. Unfortunately, we had rain for a few days during our stay and the umbrellas provided free by the Hotel were a nice touch and well needed. We didn't eat at the Hotel but in reality there was no need. Within a stones throw there is an abundance of cafes and we usually took a 10 minute walk to Germain De Pres which had even more choice. Also the restaurant just opposite the Hotel (Chez Marcel) is a must, although get there early or book as it gets very busy. When we do return Paris we will definitely be staying at the Hotel Le Six. Thanks to all the Hotel team for their excellent service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a great stay at Hotel Le Six. We arrived at about 9:00am from San Diego and were checked into our rooms immediately (thanks Morgan!!). The lobby area is all done in red and is quite stunning. The staff were all friendly and helpful with recommendations for food and train/metro information. Rooms small but lovely - nice sized bathrooms and very clean and modern. Location is excellent - close to metro, restaurants and shoppping. If you have a fun sense of humor - use the "other" elevator once in a while. Would totally stay there again - loved everyone who was on staff during our trip - Audrey was a complete doll and the young Italian gentleman (so sorry - his name escapes me, which is a total shame because he gave us the best recommendations and help!!!) spent plenty of time helping us and even serving up some drinks! Can't say enough about the staff! Suggestions: Bring conditioner or go to the nearest Pharmacie for it - the hotel does not provide it (at least not in our room) Bottled water and wine can be bought by turning left outside of the hotel to the end of the block, then left again - a natural food store is right there and has good prices - 3 minute walk. Cafes, restaurants and metro stops are to the right - 5 minute walk. Use the Metro and bus - super easy - mobilus pass is the way to go for a day of sightseeing - 5.90 Euro for all day, bus and metro lines anywhere in the city. Breakfast at the hotel is 22 Euro - we ate down the street for much less. Drinks at the hotel are costly too, but we had a few anyway!! Would totally stay there again!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “The front desk and housekeeping staff made our stay an enjoyable one”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Hotel Le Six for 6 nights. What I love most about this hotel is their nice and friendly front desk staff (esp. those serving in the mornings and in the afternoons) and the great housekeeping staff. The room is always cleaned properly during our stay. We like the modern decor and the very, very good condition of the room interior. My husband loved the big and comfy bed. Environment is quiet and location is close to Notre-Dame-des-Champs, Vavin, Montparnasse-Bienvenue metro stations and Gare Montparnasse. Morgane from the front desk had been providing me helpful information about the hotel in general right from the start. We are very delighted to receive the room upgrade. Angela was always cheerful and welcoming and very helpful with giving directions and cruise information. My husband and I really love the Seine river cruise Angela recommended to us. The cruise dinner wasn't cheap but it was worth the money and made our last night in Paris a memorable one. Evelyn was the one who received us upon our arrival and she was very friendly. Check-in was very quick. Morgane, Angela and Evelyn all speak fluent English. I agree with previous reviews that the evening staff members apparently cannot communicate very well in English and I wish we had communicated with the morning staff when we needed to see an English-speaking doctor. Overall, we love Hotel Le Six. It was very nice to see a nice welcome fruit plate when we returned to the Hotel on our first night, and to see our room perfectly cleaned EVERY night. Thank you to those from Hotel Le Six who made our stay a pleasant one.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Boutique hotel in the 6ème”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent two nights in this cute little boutique hotel in November. The situation is quite good, in the 6ème arrondissement, with two underground lines nearby. The 12 down the road (2min walk) and the 4 up the street (5 min walk). The room I stayed in was on the courtyard side. Note that courtyard here means a 10 square meter surface, so there’s not much to see through the window except a couple of walls, but it keeps the room very quiet, which is always a good thing in a big city like Paris. The rooms are small, but well arranged, and have high ceilings which give the impression there’s more space. The bed, cushions and duvet are very comfortable. Other than the bed, there are 2 nightstands, a wide but narrow kind of desk, a chair and a large mirror. The bathroom was also good. Nice design but not much more to say about it. There was no bathtub, but a large shower (I must admit I loved the stone floor that looked like wood). And something very nice in cold weather, a heatable towel rack. I still think the rates are high, but hey, it’s Paris, everything is expensive. There’s also a spa in the hotel but I didn’t get a chance to see it. The lobby is nice. There’s a sitting space with a good selection of magazines and newspapers. The breakfast buffet is good without being amazing: selection of croissants, bread, cereals, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, mushrooms, ham, cheese, yoghurts, fruit, and natural fruit juices. All in all I had a very pleasant stay, but if you’re considering spending most of the day out visiting, I’m not quite sure the price is worth it, depending on what kind of trip you’re planning.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just returned from a 10 day trip to Paris where I stayed at Le Six. I've traveled Europe and have been in Paris before... and the rooms are actually larger than standard European rooms. The bathrooms are modern with LARGE showers, the rooms are beautiful with wood floors (which you would think would be noisy but are NOT noisy). You are walking distance from a myriad of restaurants, pharmacies, metro stops, and the Luxembourg Garden (which is easily walkable in about 5-10 minutes and you will come out on the other side -- north side -- to the touristy area of the 6th). I am a adamant about staying at quiet places... I don't like to pay to be kept awake... and this place was wonderful. Though I did not have any noise complaints, if I had, I know they would have been taken care of immediately. The staff all speaks beautiful English and are willing and able to help out with everything from directions to making reservations for shows, restaurants, taxis, etc. (which is very helpful when you don't speak French). Angela, the manager (along with the rest of the front desk staff, gives impeccable and friendly service. Delightful! You can have a full buffet breakfast at the hotel (a smaller, and less expensive, on through room service) or literally walk around the corner to cafes every morning. Each night as we made our way in, we would have a cocktail at the bar. Anahyse, who runs it, has a wonderful selection of wines, etc. - including a very creative selection of yummy cocktails. Also a great conversationalist who can give you tips on Paris and French culture! I will absolutely be staying here next time I am in Paris (it feels like my new Paris home), and I will be recommending it to anyone I know who is going!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Hotel Le Six for 4 nights at the end of March for our 30th wedding anniversary. The room was good and clean, the bed was comfortable and there was a very good shower. There was free wi-fi. The hotel is in a good part of Paris, easy access to the tourist areas but not quite as busy or hectic. There are bars and restaurants around. We ate the first night at La Timbre which the hotel recommended and booked for us and we enjoyed. The exchange rate isn't kind to us at the moment and we did find Paris expensive. A glass of wine in the hotel bar was 10 euros - but 5 euros elsewhere. We bought a Paris museum pass which was good value and we found the metro easy (buy a carnet of 10 tickets from the m/c at the station or from the eurostar buffet which works out cheaper). Our room rate included breakfast which was very good - a good range of hot and cold on the buffet and the breakfast service was good. The one downside to our stay was the noise. We had a street facing room on the third floor and there was a lot of noise during the night - people shouting and traffic noise - which kept us awake. Also there was building work taking place in the building next door which disturbed us every morning at 8.30 a.m. A bit early when breakfast is served until 11 a.m. We did mention it to reception a couple of times and again when we checked out. We felt that they didn't really know how to handle a complaint - a shrug of the shoulder wasn't really good enough for us when we had paid 260 euros per night. In our reservation we had asked them to choose a nice room for us for our anniversary and for our first trip to Paris. Unfortunately this didn't seem to work out and we wouldn't return or recommend the hotel to others unless they could guarantee a quiet room.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I spent five nights in Paris at Hotel Le Six. Overall we were quite happy with our choice of hotel for our first visit to Paris. Since it was our first visit we did alot of sightseeing and were quite busy/tired so it was nice to come back to a room/hotel we enjoyed and could relax in. The positives: Very friendly and helpful english speaking front desk staff - overall they were really great and pleasant to interact with and made our stay that much more enjoyable Very clean rooms and prompt housekeeping and no smell of cigarette smoke whatsoever in the rooms/hotel We were staying in the jr. suite on the top floor, it has a beautiful bathroom and the room feels like you are staying in your own little apartment in Paris. Minimalist/modern decor with hardwood floors Ironing board/iron available in room Potential Downfalls: You can be fooled by the address, despite the address of being in the 6th arrondissment so you are in fact at the edge of it away from the heart of the area and you end up being closer to the Montparnasse area. Which is not a bad thing, it has cute cafes/shops in the area and we enjoyed it, but some people may find it far from the sites if they are only staying a few days. The internet connection was on and off during our visit which we did need access to so that was frustrating The breakfast buffet was quite minimal and sparse - we only did it once and opted to eat at the local restaurants instead We could hear the next door guest walking around his room in the evenings, luckily he was by himself and we didn't hear any talking etc. to keep us up. I think if you are flexible in terms of the area you would like to stay in and want something newer with a more modern decor and are not a smoker, Hotel Le Six is a good boutique hotel choice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a gem of a Boutique Hotel! I decided to stay in a more intimate setting after our large hotel in Madrid.My research led me to LE SIX... Modern, eclectic, Beautifully decorated, neon, Mobiles, HARD WOOD floor rooms with high-end hardware. They have 2 elevators one fairly large and the other tiny!... LOCATION to two metro stops...Montparnesse and Champs...Just a few flat walking blocks in your out of the tourist area...YAY! Lovely,walking everyday.Near the Gardens and great reastaurants. The STAFF are THE friendliest and MOST helpful-Yes excellent English I have ever encountered in France. Evelyn is going to school for her Masters in Hospitality and it shows. They have a small spa downstairs and the steam room is available to all guests.My husband had a deluxe queen room with a balcony-QUIET! My mother in law had a deluxe standard one door down which was so nice since she is 87 yrs old. The beds are fabulous...Extremely clean and the rooms are medium size. We were hardly there to hang out so NO Complaints on size. We included breakfast which I recommend... American coffee with CREAM...finally! Multiple choices and the salmon alone with all the fixings is wonndrful, especially with their artisan breads. I ate the best raspberries everyday! They have a reading room with a giant mobile and sky light near their small bar area. It was nice to wind down our sightseeing and have a cocktail before heading out to dinner. Their recommendations for food compared to my research matched pretty well. I always took their advice and we were never disapponted. I WILL stay there again when I return to Paris. I just hope it will not take as long to return! Paris number 3 is a must. I will be posting about sights and restaurants in another post. I wanted to focus on LE SIX and it's fabulousness...</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Style and luxury in a great area”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent 5 nights here with my wife on our first visit to Paris (having spent 5 nights in another great hotel nearby which couldn't accommodate us for the full 10 days). Our luxury treat in a Junior Suite on the top floor. A premium price (at the peak of the season) gave us a premium room, a king bed and impeccable service. Spacious, very quiet, chic decor and a massive bathroom with walk-in shower with great pressure, heated towel rails (with electronic timer and variable heat settings); large storage space, included iron and ironing board (whatever that is - my wife seemed to know), spacious safe, separate toilet, separate tea/coffee making. A view over spacious stylish apartments with gardens and a small viewing terrace. Very comfortable king-size bed and pillows. Good wi-fi access included in rate. Didn't try the restaurant here although it seemed very smart: we were happy to sit at a local cafe for a "formule" fixed-price breakfast and people-watching. Service was very pleasant and helpful - bilingual staff. Many advantages: this is not a large impersonal "chain hotel" - it is discrete and stylish. Placed perfectly for shopping and sight-seeing: the Vavin metro stop a couple of blocks away gives great access to the key north-south axis of the No. 4 line (including Montmartre, Sacre Coeur, Gare du Nord, Ile de la Cite, the Left Bank) and easy cross-over to all the other key metro lines. A short stroll to the exquisite Jardin du Luxembourg, a second metro line (No. 12 - Notre Dame des Champs) just down the street. Plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants - the best of which is the superb little Le Timbre restaurant a couple of blocks away. The hotel is close enough to quickly access all the key tourist areas but feels sufficiently removed from the hustle and bustle. Highly recommended if you can afford it.</p></li>

<li>Placed <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.998">perfectly for</span> <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.998">shopping</span> and sight-seeing: the Vavin metro stop a couple of blocks away gives great access to the key north-south axis of the No.</br></br></li>
<li>4 line (including Montmartre, Sacre Coeur, Gare du Nord, Ile de la Cite, the Left Bank) and easy cross-over to all the other key metro lines.</br></br></li>
<li>A short stroll to the exquisite Jardin du Luxembourg, a second metro line (No.</br></br></li>
<li>12 - Notre Dame des Champs) just down the street.</br></br></li>
<li>Plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants - the best of which is the superb little Le Timbre restaurant a couple of blocks away.</br></br></li>
<li>The hotel is close enough to quickly access all the key tourist areas but feels sufficiently removed from the hustle and bustle.</br></br></li>
<li>Highly recommended if you can afford it.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked a standard room at Hotel Le Six for two nights in October 2011, based on reviews I'd read at this site. My wife and I were not disappointed. Right from our arrival, we experienced the friendliness of the hotel staff that dominates many of the reviews. Our room was not ready (it was only 10:45am) so we were provided with a map of Paris and left our luggage at the hotel. After a pleasant day out in Paris, we returned to the hotel and checked in. Our bags had been delivered to our room (without us having to request this service). The room was very clean and tidy, albeit small, but for the price and proximity to central Paris we really could not have expected more. Bathroom was great, very modern with a decent sized bathtub, gorgeous shower and ample towels. After two long days in Paris it was a pleasure to find that the bed was extremely comfortable each night and there was certainly no problem sleeping! The buffet breakfast was good with a large variety of food available, everything from bacon and eggs to fresh strawberries. We had a drink in the bar the first evening. Again, the staff were very friendly; we experienced the same attitude from all staff. Not that this should be an expectation, but all customer-facing staff spoke fluent English. On the last day, upon checkout, we again left our bags to go out and about in Paris. The hotel staff gladly booked a taxi for us to the airport and when we arrived back to the hotel to pick the luggage up we ordered a coffee while we waited for our transport. A nice touch was when we went to pay for it and was told that it was provided free of charge, I highly recommend this hotel and will certainly be using it for our next Paris trip. There are two Metro stops a couple of minutes away from the hotel and it's ideal whatever tourist attractions you want to see.</p></li>
