<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a fantastic hotel right on the water. It has a park directly next door and a walking path out past the pools. Hotel staff were excellent although the breakfast staff looked short staffed. The desk staff were very friendly and welcoming. The pools were beautiful. Great location, quick 5 minute drive to Point Loma, Seaport Village, Gaslamp District, Petco Park, etc. Internet was free and rooms were spacious.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 nights in October in a room with two beds on 3rd floor. Pros: - new hotel with large and very comfortable rooms - even though close to the airport it's still very quiet at night - great value for money - good breakfast (extra, but not expensive) Cons: - not right in the centre of San Diego but only a quick 5-10 min drive to downtown While in San Diego we definitely recommend visiting San Diego Zoo!</p></li>

The courtyard area is beautiful, and you can walk on a boardwalk right out the back door. The restaurant breakfast was delicious and the service was excellent.</p></li>

In the Point Loma area, with easy access to downtown (adjacent to Harbor Drive), close to airport with free shuttle. Some aircraft noise at times, but not to the point of being a problem.

Internet was free and fast. Parking was free. Five minutes to the airport. Starbucks is nearby. Pillows were mediocre, but otherwise no complaints.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location for San Diego. Free parking a plus! Free internet in the rooms with easy accessiblity. Close enough to downtown and just far enough. New Courtyard and you can tell when you walk in. Staff still being broken in with it being opened a few months ago. Great access to bike and jogging trails along the San Diego Bay. Breakfast is not cheap; however, other options easily within walking distance and they have a deli on site as well with healthy options in the morning. We will be coming back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip because I didn't like the look of the hotel that the work conference was at. I was SO glad that I stayed here instead. The price was very reasonable, and the rate that I chose included breakfast (hot and cold buffet along with a waffle and omelet chef). Very tasty and quick if you are looking to have a good meal before getting on the road. The room was very comfortable, very clean, and met all of my needs. The hotel staff was pleasant as well. I would definitely stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Courtyard Liberty Station for our family vacation to San Diego. It was awesome! We had a room with a balcony that overlooked the bay and had a view of downtown. The staff was awesome and we got to check in early! The pool area was really nice with a hot tub and firepit area. Lots of seating. We only ate at the restaurant for breakfast and the buffet was really good. The area around the hotel was awesome! Lots of places to eat, shop and walk/run. Would definately recommend to anyone and would stay here again! :)</p></li>

Check-in was quick and we were given a room that was over looking the bay. This hotel is near the airport and freeway and is a short drive to many beaches and parks. There are ample places to eat around the hotel and a Starbucks within walking distance. We did not use room service but did have hamburgers in the restaurant the last evening and they were good. This is by far our favorite hotel in San Diego. The location is great and the price is reasonable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a great hotel. It was a little difficult to find after a long night of flying but its a beautiful well managed property. The rooms were wonderful and the beds were very comfortable. The hotel is very pricey I actually paid more for a night at this hotel than a night at the JW Marriott in Palm Springs. The breakfast at the hotel was average, the food was very greasy and I had a hard time finishing my meal, my toast was burnt as well. All things considered the hotel was very nice, the front desk was extremely pleasant and helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 2 nights on a quick visit to San Diego and Seaworld. I chose it because it was Number 1 on TripAdvisor at the time and was well reviewed. Its a great stopover hotel, near the airport and Seaworld 10 minutes away, service was great, hotel very clean, but it is a basic no frills stay and has a small outdoor pool. It was our first visit to San Diego so quite difficult to compare to any other hotels in the area. If you are driving there from LA, we stopped at Del Mar were there are some great restaurants looking on to the beach.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Courtyard by Marriott San Diego Airport/Liberty Station offers an excellent, elegant and very reasonable wedding venue! We were amazed at the magnificent and perfect wedding the Marriott provided for our daughter's wedding. The cocktail hour for the wedding is on a lovely Bayside Terrace. The Marriott is located on 46 acres of greenbelt and walking trail, along a channel of the San Diego Bay. The staff is excellent, dedicated and shows pride in service. Again, it is a very reasonable wedding venue with outstanding food, ambiance and value.</p></li>

The lobby was elegant, the rooms stylish and spacious, the breakfast was wonderful, and best of all, the service was excellent.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My son and I met in San Diego to celebrate his 26th birthday for the weekend. This hotel was clean, very modern and very comfortable. We had Bayside/Pool side views from the top floor so the view out of our balcony was very nice. Check in went well although when we showed up at 1pm our room wasn't ready. With my points status at Marriott's I'm used to be able to check-in just about anytime. Since we had lots planned for the day it was not an issue, just a surprise. Everything worked well, WiFi was a bit slow, beds were very comfortable, bathroom was immaculate!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We highly recommend this hotel. Very accommodating staff. Great location, right on the water, close to the city. Very impressive grounds. This courtyard is unlike the other "regular Courtyards". It is much larger building. The room is rather comfortable size. The bathroom is spacious, with large counter space. Even though the hotel is within airport's take off flight path, the noise of the airplanes are not bothersome. Clean. The furnishings are new and impressive. Very nice outdoor swimming pool/jacuzzi. Ample free parking. A lot of restaurants nearby. The entire Liberty Station area is very impressive.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 4 nights and had one of our best stays. Hotel was very clean and lovely. Our room had a nice little balcony with chairs that overlooked the pool, water and esplanade. It was so beautifully landscaped and quite peaceful. I was initially worried about the airplane noise but slept like a baby and never heard one plane at night. Also liked how easy it was to get to all the sites around the city we went to. The Liberty Sation area is also wonderful because there are restaurants very close as well as ice cream and a Trader Joe's. We will definitely stay here again if we get to go back to San Diego!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We so enjoyed our stay at this Marriott. We needed somewhere to stay the night between flights- this was close, had a shuttle and I knew I couldn't go wrong with a Marriott. We were not disappointed! The pool was nice and heated and the whirlpool spa was great. The rooms were beautifully decorated and the beds were so comfy, very sound proof. We did not get to use it but the fitness room was large and had lots of equipment. We tried a restaraunt nearby called Oggis Brewery- sooooo good, well priced and and had a huge menu. Our experience here was wonderful and we would never hesitate to choose Marriott again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at Courtyard for 2 nights while going to San Diego Zoo. 10 minute drive to zoo. Very nice and Clean room, well maintained property with water and walking trail out back-which our balcony overlooked. One of the best courtyards we have stayed and will definitely be back! Restuarant food was very good as we were pleasently surprised-most hotel restaurants -well-just aren't that good-but Shades is well worth it. Only small drawback was you can't check out on the TV like most hotels-but only had to wait a few minutes at front desk to do so. Not sure why this modern hotel doesn't have this feature? Stay here-you'll love it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Family of 6 (with 4 teenagers) stayed in June and were accommodated with a cheerful and helpful staff, good room locations overlooking the bay, with clean and kept up facilities everywhere. We found the location well suited to getting around the SD area with good access to major roads and highways and despite the proximity to the airport, did not feel intruded upon by aircraft noise. The only minor observations were the lack of microwaves in the rooms and the breakfast service that was on the pricey side for our vacation budget. Nevertheless, our experience was excellent and we would make a point of staying here at the next opportunity in the SD area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed in San Diego many times but Tripadvisor hit one out of the park with this one. The customer service was excellent. The hotel is close to downtown by car. The free parking makes a big difference since everywhere else in San Diego seems to charge for it. Who arrives without a car in San Diego? The front desk staff, specifically Stephanie and Thomas, were amazing. The hotel is relatively new and fresh. The airport is close by but I didn't really notice the planes that much since they are not directly overhead. The grounds are excellent for walking and the new Liberty Station area is cool, in a suburban sort of way. I highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

My husband used the gym which had a fantastic variey of equipment plus surrounding area great for running/sports etc. Supermarket and various stores just a few minutes walk away.Also quite a few restaurants to choose from, recommend Oggies Sports bar for the food and ambience.

The location is just a short drive from the airport and is outside of downtown SD. Parking is FREE. Not something you see in many SD hotels. There are several restaurants within walking distance of the hotel as well. Location is great. The front desk staff was very friendly. They even let me check in at 900am because a room was available. The entire property is very clean, there is a full restaurant and bar in the lobby, and the pool area has a nice jacuzzi. Beds are great as well. This would be a great hotel for both families and business travelers to the SD area. Definitely recommend.</p></li>

The hotel has spacious rooms, which were very quiet considering that there was an airport nearby. Our room had a view and a balcony. All the decor was very modern and the rooms were extremely clean. We enjoyed the buffet breakfast which was about $10. We were neaby Anthony's restaurant and the Fish Market, so we dined there in the evenings. There is a large park nearby so we walked the park near the shore line and enjoyed being out in the fresh air. The front desk service was helpful and answered all our questions regarding our stay. We would definitely consider this hotel for any future stay in San Diego.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Clean hotel. Has an outdoor pool for the kids. Located on the water with a nice walking path and park out back. On weekends a company comes and gives free paddle board lessons to hotel guests. I had a room on the first floor, much less noise than the upper floors. Keurig in room was convenient. Hotel also offered free coffee and tea bar in lobby along with refreshing citrus waters and juices. Was able to walk out back and watch three different firework displays on the fourth. Friendly staff, remembered our names. Would definitely stay here again. Also we had the breakfast special with room- great food! Omelets to order, waffles, oatmeal, cereals. Just a wonderful place, very family oriented.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I stayed at this hotel for one night. We were vacationing in Southern Cal and decided to move here the night before our early morning flight. Were we glad that we did! This was such a nice hotel. As my husband, who travels alot said, this wasn't your typical Marriott Courtyard. It was such a beautiful, well-maintained hotel. It had a resort-type feel to it. The rooms are very nicely decorated and the beds were very comfortable. The location was awesome - right on the waterfront and literally 1-2 miles from the airport. It was an easy drive to downtown San Diego also. The hotel was extremely well-maintained and very clean. The only complaint that I have is that we only spent 1 night here. I highly recommend it to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a very nice setting, right on the water next to a well-used path. The rooms are well-designed; they are beautiful to look out and easy to "live in." Also, everything was clean, in the room and around the hotel. The pool was clean, the perfect temperature and an OK size. Most things are really perfect about this hotel, except the noisy hallways. On both Friday and Saturday night, we were kept up by people being quite loud in the hall. Also, on Sunday morning, we were roused by a fire alarm at about 5:00. It appeared that an employee in the cafe burned something, causing all the hotel guests to be evacuated. I wonder what they can do about the noise. I want them to do something because I would love to return to this lovely hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a lovely Courtyard Marriott with free parking, wireless and printing services. It is located close to the airport, but the noise didn't really bother me. It is within walking distance to the Liberty Station plaza with stores and a few restaurants and markets. It is convenient and the front desk staff were very helpful. If you want more action, then you should stay near old town, downtown or the beach. But this was good for a business trip and I would stay there again with my family sometime. It was too cool for the pool, but it looked nice enough. The Marriott Marquis and Marina on Harbor Drive is more upscale, beautiful and within walking distance of the Gaslamp Quarter which is nice to visit at night. But it is more expensive for everything.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I looked at the ranking of this hotel and wondered if it could be true? After checking in, I realized why. It's not your typical courtyard. It has amenties like a restaurant and bar. Free WiFi. You can walk to some restaurants nearby and Trader Joes is in the neighborhood if you have a car. Overall, the location is perfect. Everything seemed so close to the hotel. The hotel/rooms are very new and spacious. My only complaint was the mattress; too soft. And we didnt get a room with a view of the esplanade behind the hotel. If we had, that would have made our day. The esplanade is beautiful. The staff are polite and helped us get a rental car. The old town trolley bus tour picks you up from the hotel next door. If I go back to SD, I will definately stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My daughter and I stayed here after staying intially at the Homewood Suites next door and touring around southern CA. We stayed here for our last night in CA before flying home the next day. We returned our car to the nearby airport and took the hotel shuttle back to the hotel. This was the nicest Courtyard I have stayed at. However, I did like the Homewood Suites next door better (owned by the same person we were told) because of the full kitchen and extra amenities. Free and adequate parking. Room were clean, large and beautiful. Snack area/deli closed too early for our use. Shuttle to the airport the next day was clean and reliable. Location is perfect - see my review on the Homewood Suites for more location information. Very nice hotel - I recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Rooms were very clean and updated. I arrived early at 1:00 pm and my room was ready (Holiday Weekend). Pool was a little small (4 ft deep), but my kids enjoyed it. My husband enjoyed the jacuzzi. Nice bike path or running path next to hotel and takes you out next to Harbor. Wish I would have known and could have brought bikes. When we first got off fwy, Area didn't look too nice but as you get closer to Hotel and Harbor it was very nice. Didn't hear airplane noise when we were in the room. We were very happy with our room and the cost. They had a breakfast buffet for $13.00 we didn't stay for it. We went to IHOP and that wasn't so good (cost $60 for 5 of us), we should have just ate at the hotel. There are a couple of restaurants and a Starbucks next to hotel.</p></li>

The front desk staff was very thoughtful and greeeted us as we came and went. The bar was very convenient, as was the restaurant and snack bar.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a great location -- serene beauty, views of the water and Harbor Island -- from almost every room. This hotel is very "Southern Cal"; smartly decorated in contemporary colors, very clean, professional staff, etc. The Pros: reasonably priced rooms; harbor views; waterfront paths for walking and jogging; nice pool and hot tub. The Cons: Large windows, but they only open about four inches (unless you get a balcony room); the most uncomfortably firm beds I've experienced in a Marriott brand -- they're probably good for your back though. Cautionary warning, this hotel is located in a beautiful setting, but one that is directly in the flight path of the airport. If you like your windows open at night, and really hate the sound of jet aircrafts, this place is not for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's an ok hotel but the rooms were small. We had a suite the first night and the bathroom drains smelled so bad we had to keep the door shut and request a new room the next few nights. The next room was down the hall facing the front of the hotel so there was an overhang that fronts the lobby. The overhang was used for other guests empty beer cans and cigarett butts. That was room 232. So needless to say when my daughter pointed it out I was a little disappointed. It's as if know one from the hotel has ever looked out these windows to see the garbage. Minimal sound proofing between the rooms and the worst is the slamming of doors from the hallway. It might be fine for a business hotel but is lacking for the family and is very average in my book. The front desk staff seemed great and very pleasant.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose to stay at the San Diego Courtyard Marriott as a stopover from Hawaii to NY. It was the perfect choice. There is a van service to and from the airport which is efficient and friendly. The hotel is spotless and the rooms updated, roomy and clean. The restaurant had closed prior to our arrival, 10PM is a weekday shutdown time in San Diego, but the front desk provided us with an Italian restaurnat that delivered. You have two choices for breakfast a simple Starbucks or a full meal at the 2592 restaurant. The bed was very comfortable, and the room had many energy saving features includng the shower. There is a walking, jogging path along the intercoastal in the back of the hotel which is a delight. We will be back! The staff is exceptional and assisted us "beyond the call of duty to help us make our plane.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Paid approx. £100 a night, but can't help but think this is overpriced for what you get. Rooms are nice enough - ask for one with a view of the pool/city. Staff at front desk are polite, but seem to lack the personal touch. Petty point, but towels are awful - clean and plentiful, but felt like rags and smelt of bleach. Guest laundry facilities for only a few dollars and they provide free washing powder and fabric conditioner. You need to drive if you are staying here (free parking) and downtown is probably a 10 minute drive, with the wharf a bit closer. There are a few decent places to eat only about 2-3 minutes away, including Thai, Pizza, Greek, Sushi cusine as well as a Starbucks. So, whilst the hotel is o.k, it could probably be better or reduce its rates to bring them more in line with the standard you get.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a nice hotel with all the Courtyard amenities that are so nice. The pool area is lovely and the hotel has lovely walking paths by the bay. However, being so close to the flightpath in San Diego makes it very noisy. The windows in the rooms are pretty soundproof but if you are going out to the pool or for an outside activity, it is noisy. The rooms are very nice and the beds as always are very comfortable. Didn't eat at the restaurant (breakfast and dinner only) but had 1/2 price appetizers in the bar area which were very good. There is an airport shuttle and parking in the hotel is free. The hotel is in an area being developed that was previously a Naval training center. There is a Hilton next to it and shops and restaurants that are not filled yet. It is very centrally located but traffic can be a problem.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a newer property located on the old Navy training base. The area has been commercialized and now has walking trails with a number of shops and restaurants in the area. The best part are the walking trails along the hotel that lead to Harbor Island across from the airport. The accommodations are what you would expect from a high end Courtyard, but during our stay there was some very noisy parties that the management didn't seem to care about. They even broke the elevator and were still allowed to stay at the property. It's also a little noisy being at the end of the runway for the airport, but you don't notice the planes all that much. It's easy to get both to the downtown area over the N. Harbor St. bridge and out to the Point Loma area going to the south. We would definitely stay here again given the opportunity.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We attended my husband's Navy ship reunion here in mid-October 2011. Area was formerly a Navy training base (with a mockup ship that never sailed). Great location with easy access to main routes. Beautiful setting on the canal and next to a nice park with walking trails, beautiful flowers and monuments honoring Submariners lost in WWII. Within walking distance of several restaurants, and 2 grocery stores. Lovely room with nice amenities; very comfortable bed; hotel staff pleasant and helpful; good food & drinks. Great shuttle service. Our room faced the airport but we had no problem with noise after 10 PM. We actually enjoyed watching the planes take off. Toured the Midway and took a lovely harbor cruise. The Zoo is fantastic and Balboa Park absolutely worth a visit. We hope to return to SD someday and will definitely stay at this hotel.</p></li>

The staff were always ready to help or answer any questions. Even as a busy hotel with lots of families, it was still quite a relaxing atmosphere . Our room over looked the pool area which was very nice. The gym was quite good, alougth there were plenty of walking/running tracks that ran through the hotel grounds. There were restaurants and take away outlets in and around the hotel complex, which was great if the kids were tired after along day out. The pool and spa were beautifully warm, even on a cold day! The buffet breakfast can be included in your room package and is well worth it, with lots of variety from hot dishes to traditional cold buffet. Parking is free. This was a relaxing and homey hotel and we really enjoyed the stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I had a nice three night stay at the Liberty Station Courtyard. It is located on the grounds of the old naval training base, right off of Harbor Blvd and near the airport. Because of the way that the main runway is aligned, we never had any problems with noise from take-off and landings at the airport, just a little from the room next door, but no more that you would expect from most hotels. The location made it very easy to access all parts of San Diego, Harbor and Shelter Islands, downtown, Balboa Park and the zoo and Mission Bay. The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. Due to it's location there seemed to be many reunions of older naval commands taking place and also a wedding but none of the events made for a rowdy or unpleasant situation. I would recommend this hotel and location for any trip to the San Diego area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was definitely a very nice Courtyard. Updated rooms with comfortable beds. Excellent on-site amenities like the ice cream and coffee cafe, outdoor patio and fire pit, and nice location near park, walking trails, and restaurants. The breakfast buffet although not included in the room rate, was excellent. My experience would have been near perfect had our adjoining rooms been in a better location. The selection of adjoining rooms at this hotel is not great, and even though my husband has status with Marriott, we didn't get a great room placement - our rooms were on the first floor very close to the lobby, and with a view of the main entrance and no patio. I would have loved to have been on the water side with a balcony. We have young children who still nap, so I was hoping to have a nice place (with some fresh air) to hang out while they napped. But regardless, this is definitely as nice as others have said. A great value.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had a Great stay at the Courtyard by Marriott San Deigo Liberty Station. We arrived early (11:30 am) and didn't think that we would be able to check in but, that wasn't a problem, our room was ready. The hotel is very nice, very clean and in an excellent location. Located on an esplanade it has very nice views for people fortunate to have a room on that side. If not, you can still enjoy the views pool side on when you walk along the esplanade. It is located across the river from the airport but, we didn't have any problems with noise. Close by you will find some good restaurants...like the Corvette Diner. It is also located a very short drive away to Sea World/Mission Beach, the San Diego Zoo, and Downtown San Diego.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from a great 4 night stay in san Diego. This hotel is very modern, clean, efficient and affordable. The Property is very well kept and the rooms and public areas are fairly spotless. Kudos to the cleaning staff. Highspeed internet (Wireless and Wired ) is complimentary. YOu got a nice 1 shot coffee maker in the suit, nice LCD TV, and nice bathroom. My only gripe was the thinness of the walls. And no I am not speaking about Airplane Noise (Which you do hear but you quickly learn to ignore). I meant the room to room discussions you can easily hear. I stay around 60-100 nights/year in hotels and this was easily the thinnest walls I've ever heard. It was very strange. The first night my wife and I had essentially front row seats to a lady discussing her failing marriage on the phone. Wow. clear as a bell! Other then that, nice place to stay. Lots of restaurants nearby, Park beside the hotel, VONS grocery store a few block away. A vehicle is a must BTW!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband, 8 year old daughter, and I stayed here in early July and really liked it. It was extremely convenient to the zoo and Sea World, and was near a very pretty park on the water. We did not notice any noise from the airport, and it was very nice to have plentiful, free parking. We stayed in a suite, which gave us tons of room, and our daughter loved the pool and hot tub. The beds were comfortable, and we liked the cafe downstairs for Starbucks and a quick breakfast. My only complaint would be the restaurant. We were very tired the first night, so we ate downstairs at the restaurant. The service was incredibly slow. I was a waitress in college, so I am usually very understanding when it is busy, but there were only 3 tables that night and our food took about 45 minutes. And it was not very good when it arrived. We ordered hamburgers from room service the following night and they were much better and quicker. Overall, a very nice place to stay with helpful staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just back from a week stay at the Courtyard Marriot San Diego LIberty Station. This was an altogether pleasant experience from beginning to end. The staff, from the front desk to the restaurant, deli and housekeeping were excellent. They were consistently friendly, polite and very helpful in regards to remedying a tiny concern we had. (missing sofa chair in our room). The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. In terms of location the hotel is near the airport, however, if you know San Diego this is not far from the city at all and also very close to Old Town. We had a car so the ample free parking at the hotel was a bonus. As parking in the city can be tricky we did cab it one night at a price of 16 dollars each direction. Parking at Old Town in the various San Diego State Park parking lots (free) or on the street never gave us a problem. I personally would be more than happy to stay at this hotel again and expect I very likely will in the not too distant future. Great stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent Labor Day weekend at this hotel with our 2 girls (ages 2 and 3). At first we were looking into staying Downtown as there was an Art Fair we wanted to attend but after much consideration, we found this hotel and read the reviews and thought we'd give it a shot. It looked more kid-friendly than the hotels in Downtown San Diego. It really exceeded our expectations! Great water front location, great staff, clean rooms, nice decor, nice outdoor pool & patio area, and excellent food options in the area. There is a nice walkway and about a mile from the hotel, there is a nice park with two playgrounds (one for older kids and the other for toddlers). Also, in the Liberty Station area there is a restaurant called the Corvette Diner that we stumbled upon which is a 50's Diner where the staff dresses up and the women have beehive hairstyles and dance around. The girls loved it and so did we. The location of the hotel is convenient and close to Downtown and Coronado (which we loved). Highly recommend!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">FREE PARKING! - VERY IMPORTANT IN SAN DIEGO WHERE HOTEL PARKING IS $30-$40/DAY Arrival: Friendly, no wait at desk, reservation. Allowed me to check in to room at 11AM! Room: Very clean, modern, asian motif, 2-cup coffee/tee maker with canisters of high-end tea/coffee that plug in to coffee-maker. Large LCD HD TV. Bed: The bed has hypoallergenic pilows already on it - as requested. Sleep: On one night only of my six night stay, there was noise from the next room at night. I found out the next morning that I could have complained to the desk and since they have a silent policy at night, they would have quieted those people. Breakfast buffet (not included unless you pay extra): Excellent - Staff makes omelets to your specs, waffles, bacon/sausage/potatoes, good cold cereal counter with home made granola, fresh fruits, and of importance to a New Yorker - a plate of lox, cream cheese, capers, sliced onions, tomatoes... All day - free lemonade and watermelon juice in lobby. ALthough next to airport, no airplane sounds are audible in hotel. Would stay here on next visit to SD.</p></li>

Omlettes made to order, waffles made to order, oatmeal with all the fixings, and fresh scrambled eggs and bacon etc... - the bar area was also very nice. -close to all the attractions, as far as freeway access and main street access. Cons: - maybe the airplanes were a little noisy, it didn't bothder us at all... But it is close to the Airport -the elevator was slow.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews and we would enthusiastically recommend it. We booked a two night stay in the beginning of July using Marriott rewards points. This is by far the nicest Courtyard I've ever seen. It, and the complex in which it's located, seem fairly new. Located along the esplanade, there's a great trail that runs along a river-like body of water behind the hotel that was great for morning walks. Starbucks and multiple quick service restaurants are in the same parking lot, just a five minute walk from the doors of the hotel. The room was spacious and clean. The main tourist attractions of San Diego are just minutes away. The hotel is in a quiet area; even the overhead planes did not disturb us.The pool area was very nice for a Courtyard and my kids. ages 8 and 5-turning-6-on this trip, loved that it was only 3-4 feet deep and never crowded. All this plus free wifi, free coffee, and personable and professional employees made this an exceptional property. Forgot to mention parking was free-- we paid $25 or more to park at some hotels on our trip up the coast</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Thank you fellow TripAdvisor members. I booked this hotel based on the reviews and was not disappointed. The staff were very helpful when we arrived and offered several options of rooms to see what would suit our family best. We settled on a courtyard, poolside room with two queen beds for myself and my husband and our two boys. It was lovely to have a small patio where we could sit in the late evening after the boys went to bed. The room was beautiful - it's like they addressed all complaints that travellers usually have: there were plenty of pillows, the beds were comfortable, there was a little espresso nook, PLENTY of counter space in the bathroom and lots of towels. We stayed at the end of our two week vacation in California and it was by far the nicest place we stayed. The only thing that was kind of annoying was the smoke detector. I assume there is some kind of regulation that stipulates that it must have a light on it, but I wonder why the hotel chose one that has a bright "camera flash" every 30 seconds and then mounted it right over the bed? Not very pleasant. Other than that, everything was perfect.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is right next to Homewood Suites Airport/Liberty Station - so they shared the same benefits of location, convenience. The shuttle driver told me that the owner owns both hotels, therefore they shared the shuttle service. This is a BETTER hotel than Homewood Suites next door. It is very clean, rooms are spacious (note they don't have suites), and they are much newer. We arrived late and the complimentary shuttles picks us up at Terminal 2 within 10 minutes since I called. Check in was a breeze. The carpet in our rooms are new and bathroom is spotless. Staff are also very friendly and helpful. Any dark side? Hum, a little bit - since it is right next door to Homewood you would expect the airplane noise. It is slight better though (maybe better insulation?). Homewood offers free breakfast, but the restaurant in Courtyard offers the same continental breakfast buffet for $10 USD. We ordered American breakfast for $12, that comes with a toast, 2 bacons, and 2 eggs. I'd suggest saving the money and go outside for breakfast. Anyways, this is a very good hotel (compared to Homewood which we stayed prior to our departure)</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a quite good airport hotel. We stayed for one night before flying out to San Francisco the next day. When we arrived, much later than expected due to car problems, we were quickly and efficiently dealt with by the hotel staff. There was ample space to unload and easily accessible free parking. Our room was even switched over to one with a nicer view for free. It was definitely a treat as the view from our balcony was quite lovely. The beds were comfortable and we all slept well. The bathroom was well sized and had nice amenities. While at the hotel we used the exercise facilities which were ok. The recumbent bicycle was a little uncomfortable, but the elliptical was fine. Afterwards, I took a lovely swim in the pool. It's not gigantic, but the perfect size for a relaxing dip. The hotel is an easy and short drive to the Gaslamp quarter, where we ate dinner, close to Balboa Park and the famed SD Zoo, and very near the airport. The hotel runs a shuttle, but as we were being dropped off by a friend, we did not need it. Overall, I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice, reasonably priced room near the airport and other SD attractions.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel for mine and my husbands 10th Wedding Anniversary. We arrived on a flight from London, UK and called the hotel from the airport. Within 10 mins a friendly driver arrived to take us to the hotel. Upon arrival we were welcomed with smiling faces wishing us a Happy Anniversary (I had made a note of it on our booking). The hotel was very nice. Within walking distance to restaurants and our rooms was spacious and clean. As a keen runner I was pleased to see a large grass playing field next to the hotel and lovely walking path for training. The breakfast was amazing and enough food to last us most of the day! (Fresh fruit, nuts, cereals, made to order omelets, pancakes, waffles etc...). We did not have a car, but caught the hotel shuttle to the airport and then paid the $5 into town on the downtown bus. The hotel is out of town (it took about 30mins with the 2 buses), but the sea village was nice to visit and worth the trip. The views from the hotel were not as nice as I had hoped, but the hotel were able to meet my request of a nice pool view on the 3rd floor (as recommended on Trip Advisor) and that made up for it. Overall, I would highly recommend the hotel and certainly visit again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose to stay here because it was close to downtown and we would have access to all of San Diego. I would have chosen to stay downtown, and could have for the same price ($150) at the Marriott marina or the Omni, but I hate parking fees and both charge in the $35 - $40 range so I went with Liberty Station. I was glad we did. Nice rooms overlooking the bay inlet, plenty of free parking, and a great bar with good wine and beer selections. The shuttle driver took us to dinner at Solare, a nearby Italian restaurant (read reviews - good place). There is also an Oggi's pizza across the street. It rained the whole day we were there so we did not explore the walking trail, or pool, but could see both from our room and they looked very nice. I really liked our shuttle driver, who gave us a little tour of Liberty Station and the buildings. Lindbergh Field was landing planes from the ocean in the evening so they were flying right over the area very low. It was fun for me and they stop by 10:00 ish so not a bad distraction, but more of an attraction. Hotel has easy access to the coast, Old Town, downtown, the airport, Point Loma, restaurants, etc. overall, a good choice of accommodations if you don't need to be right downtown.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here twice in 20ll; March and August. The price was excellent, especially staying for a week. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Both rooms had water/walkway views and the tiny balcony allowed me to sit outside and have my coffee in the morning. Both rooms were clean, modern, attractive, bright and had all the amenities I needed. The atmosphere was casual and comfortable, and I felt very safe.The surrounding area is very quiet and the plane sounds were not a problem. I was doing a lot of site seeing and day trips so it was nice to come "home" to quiet and a pool.The deli near the lobby sells nicely prepared salads and sandwiches which saved me eating out all the time. The stores and restaurants near by give lots of choices for food. I tried both room service and the hotel restaurant and the meals were good. I liked that I was in the city but away from the bustle (this may not be appealing to all!) I liked that it was quick and easy to get to and from the airport with the complementary shuttle. You definitely need a car here as you are away from the main attractions and transit is not convenient, but the ample parking is free. Driving in San Diego was relatively easy, and Rosecrans is a main route. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

Room service was not performed until after 4:00PM They attempted to charge for a movies not ordered or watched On one night the hospitality room was miserable due to noise from a band in the ajoining room. They promised adequate room for the Saturday banquet, they put 108 people in a room that should have only held 72. (according to submited plan in the initial planning stages) Excuse, they could not clear the ajoining room in time for the banquet. They charged the Association for 40 gallons of coffee at $40.00/gal. Coffee at the free breakfast was to have been included free. It is impossible for the consumption of that much coffee, my only conclusion is they poured it down the drain. The vast majority of the attendees were not at the hotel between the hours of 9:00AM and 3:00PM. Gratuity was excessive, 947.00 , I give on the basis of service beyone the normal.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel does a great job of providing a clean, functional place to stay, which is easily accessible to anywhere in SanDiego at a fraction of the price of other hotels with similar accommodation. Located less than 2 miles from the airport, yet surprisingly quiet, there is free internet and parking. The hotel has a restaurant and a snack bar as well as a tiny pantry where you can purchase food/beverages if you need them inbetween restaurant hours. The pool is quite nice. There are exercise machines and a lovely walking path along the canal right outside the patio area. There is a bar as well and conference facilities (large enough for reasonable sized meetings). The rooms are very nicely decorated and furnished. Everything you need to be comfortable, whether it is for one night or several, is there. THere are multiple restaurants (including subway) at the other end of the parking lot, and several blocks away, a fairly large mall with a grocery store. The front desk staff were very friendly. The entire building was clean and smelled nice. You can be on several major highways in a couple of minutes and right downtown in about 4 minutes drive. This place is inexpensive and as hotels go, excellent. Don't bother with somewhere else that will cost you double the money. This hotel is terrific.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the hotel for three nights the weekend of the 10th. We were extremely pleased with our stay. We arrived at 1pm, and they have a room with the harbor view ready for us. The room was well configured - with the bed facing the balcony. Also had a couch, desk, and flat-screen TV. My husband fell in love with the coffee machine in the room, though for some reason they only stocked decaf coffee in the room. Ice machine served up tasty ice (and it always worked). I recall reading some complaints about the towels, but I actually liked them - very lightweight and good for wrapping up your wet hair. Several times we visited the front desk to ask for directions to different venues, and we were always treated with courtesy. Kudos to the front desk. I was never worried about airport noise, as we live under the landing pattern of LAX. But, for those concerned about noise - yes, airplanes fly directly by the hotel, so you may want to take that into consideration if you wish no noise. Once you close your window, though, all the sounds are muffled. Unfortunately, we were unable to squeeze time in our stay to try out the pool, but we noticed a lot of kids enjoying it. The surrounding park and shops are very nice, with a very comfortable and safe walking path directly in front of the hotel itself. We will stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the hotel for a business meeting in early August. It's located about five minutes from the airport and accessed via a free shuttle. The hotel is in "Liberty Station" which house another hotel and a small shopping area with a few restaurants and a Starbucks. I had a larger King room with a balcony which overlooked the waterway behind the hotel. The room was in very good shape and seemed to feature Courtyard's newest standard design. Large desk, large flat screen, pull open wardrobe, mini-refrigerator, etc. The bed was comfortable and the A/C worked flawlessly (I like my freon). I ate breakfast twice at the buffet which offered made to order omelettes, Belgium waffles, bacon, sausage, fruit, and various breads, pastries, and cereal. The buffet was about $15 or $16 bucks and, to me, represented good value. The hotel has a bar which is open in evenings. I didn't use the pool or fitness room. We did have meetings in one of the larger meeting rooms. The service for our meeting was good. I think my room was a little over $200 per might which I thought was a little pricey for a Courtyard but it is San Diego (perhaps for a little more you could stay near the beach). For my purpose, a few days of meetings, the hotel was great. If you need a hotel near the airport or are planning a sales meeting the Courtyard's a good choice.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent 4 nights here in late May/early June; it was one of the official Rock & Roll Marathon hotels and was close to the finish line. The hotel is new (maybe 1-2 years old) and everything was fresh and clean. Our room was very well laid-out and housekeeping was thorough, although they did tend to come mid-afternoons rather than mornings. We also had a mini-fridge in the room (perfect for snacks and drinks) - apparently this is standard - and free wireless internet. The WiFi is set up to allow you to send documents to the business center for printing, and they have a dedicated PC just for printing boarding passes. Location was really good - it is at one end of a retail/residential complex that is still in development, so we were just a short drive/long walk from several restaurants, a grocery store, and coffee shops. (More shops are being opened - drive around to see what's there.) The hotel is also just 5 minutes from the airport and provides easy access to most of the western side of San Diego; we also drove 15 min to the Old Town trolley station to head downtown one night. The staff was helpful with driving directions and suggestions for local sightseeing. My only "complaints" were that while the mattress was fantastic, the pillows were awful (overly squishy). Oh well, guess you can't have everything! I would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed there in late August / early September on our last leg of our family's SoCal vacation. There are no words that I can express on how pleased we were with our stay at this property. The staff is absolutely amazing. We want to acknowledge and thank Miriam & Thomas (front desk), Hector (server), Jim (bartender), and Christian (cafe manager) for making our vacation memorable. We've decided to join the Marriott Rewards club after staying here. Here's a quick Pro/Con rundown: Pro: - Amazingly well maintained hotel - the entire property including the rooms were immaculately maintained and cleaned - the housekeeping staff should be commended and rewarded for such an excellent job. - Great location - Mins to all attractions & Airport. Also walking distance to other conveniences (pharmacy, supermarket, etc.). - Outdoor Space - pool, jacuzzi, firepit, patios, lounge areas - we spent hours relaxing here. Created the resort feel. - Great breakfast buffet (this is an addl price, but worth it in my opinion). For Dinner, we ate at the hotel 3 times during our 5 night stay. The clam chowder, thai chicken wings, and hawaiian ribeye were faves. - Guest Laundry - large room with 4 sets of washes & dryers - never had to wait for a free machine. -Free Parking & WiFi!! Cons: - More hooks / bars to store towels in bathrooms - esp for a family of four staying in the room.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am writing this review from the poolside at Courtyard Liberty Station, and we have been here for a week. We've been coming to San Diego from New Jersey for about ten years now, and have usually stayed at Hotel Circle's Marriott Residence Inn Seaworld/Mission Valley. We always liked the idea of having a suite with a full kitchen since our kids were younger and we'd often cook a few dinners throughout our stay. HOWEVER, our kids are 11 and 15 now and we will NEVER stay anywhere near Hotel Circle again. Here are the reasons... Courtyard Liberty Station: 1. is very clean and well taken care of, which the Residence Inn was not. 2. has a very nice pool area. 3. has balconies in some of the rooms that offer a beautiful view. We were overlooking the bay and North Island. 4. is walking distance to many good restaurants at Liberty Station. Our first night here, we walked right out front to Oggi's Pizza and had a very good, reasonably priced meal. They also have a Panera, Tender Greens, Vons Market, Subway, a Mexican Restaurant, sushi, etc. right out front. 5. has a nice workout room with 4 Lifefitness treadmills, 2 Lifefitness Elipticals, a recumbant bike, dumbbells, an exercise machine, water fountain, tv's, etc. 6. serves a great breakfast for around $12, including omelets, scrambled eggs, lox and bagels, etc. 7. has very nice employees who are extremely helpful. 5.</p></li>

<li>I am writing this review from the poolside at Courtyard Liberty Station, and we have been here for a week.</br></br></li>
<li>We've been coming to San Diego from New Jersey for about ten years now, and have usually stayed at Hotel Circle's Marriott Residence Inn Seaworld/Mission Valley.</br></br></li>
<li>We always liked the idea of having a suite with a full kitchen since our kids were younger and we'd often cook a few dinners throughout our stay.</br></br></li>
<li>HOWEVER, our kids are 11 and 15 now and we will NEVER stay anywhere near Hotel Circle again.</br></br></li>
<li>Here are the reasons... Courtyard Liberty Station: 1. is very clean and well taken care of, which the Residence Inn was not.</br></br></li>
<li>2. has a <span style="background-color:#fffac8">very nice</span> <span style="background-color:#fffac8">pool area</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>3. has <span style="background-color:#008080">balconies</span> in some of the rooms that offer a <span style="background-color:#008080">beautiful</span> view.</li>
<li>3. has balconies in some of the <span style="background-color:#ffe119">rooms</span> that offer a <span style="background-color:#ffe119">beautiful</span> view.</li>
<li>3. has balconies in some of the rooms that offer a <span style="background-color:#008080">beautiful</span> <span style="background-color:#008080">view</span>.</br></br></li>

<li>We were <span style="background-color:#008080">overlooking</span> the bay and <span style="background-color:#008080">North Island</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>4. is walking distance to <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">many good</span> <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">restaurants</span> at Liberty Station.</br></br></li>
<li>Our first night here, we walked right out front to Oggi's <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">Pizza</span> and had a <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">very good</span>, reasonably priced meal.</li>

<li>They also have a Panera, Tender Greens, Vons Market, Subway, a Mexican Restaurant, sushi, etc.</br></br></li>
<li><span style="background-color:#e6194b">right out</span> <span style="background-color:#e6194b">front</span>.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my first trip to California. I'm used to staying at bigger chains but this Courtyard's location, price and its reviews kindled my interest. I was definitely happy with the location. It's close to civilization but kind of tucked away next to the mouth of San Diego Bay. We checked in after 4pm but they didn't have the kind of room I requested. I chose to hold out and wait for something closer to my liking. The agent helping me for my entire stay was Joe. He definitely did a good job and hopefully somebody from this Courtyard will recognize him for his efforts. (He checked us in, was there when we went out for dinner and checked us out the next morning!) Our waiting for a room was actually a good thing as we were able to see the nearby attractions like the USS Recruit. We also walked up and down the area looking over the bridge (Halsey Rd) and had our 5-year-old play at the Park at Beacon Point. When we did finally get into a room it fit our requests. The room was cozy and clean. Although I would recommend staying in a King suite as it has more room and a better view. Our view was slightly obstructed by palm trees but all-in-all it wasn't bad. The area around the hotel is clean and there are plenty of restaurants in the area too if you don't feel like eating hotel food. It's close to the San Diego Zoo/Seaport Village/Point Loma. We will be back to San Diego before the year is up and we fully expect to stay here. Avoid the higher priced hotels and traffic... give this place a try.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Hotel for families with children”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband, 2 1/2 year old son, and I stayed 3 nights at this hotel. The hotel was very clean and well located. We had a room with a balcony that overlooked the pool, so the view was very nice from there. I had added a comment online when I booked that we would prefer a room with a balcony, and we did receive that type of room. Liberty Station was a beautiful, clean, and safe feeling area. There is a trail behind the hotel that you can walk down to go to a great park with a playground. This was one of the nicest playgrounds that we have been to. There are plenty of restaurants and grocery stores nearby, so we did a lot of our dining out near the hotel. The room had a refrigerator, but no microwave. This hotel is really near the airport, so if you are outside you will hear and see planes taking off and landing. The view of the airplanes taking off was a plus for us because our son loved seeing them. The noise inside was not enough to disturb us. I dropped the sleep quality down 1 mark from excellent only because one night there were people talking too loud and too late on the patio below our room which made it a little difficult to sleep. All of the attractions we wanted to go to in San Diego were just a short drive away from this hotel without having to fight downtown traffic. We did enjoy the fact that there was a nice laundry facility and free internet in the business center at this hotel. The only thing that could make this hotel better would be a free breakfast buffet, but I have not seen one of those in a Courtyard. We will be staying at this hotel if we return to the San Diego area.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Really Nice Hotel, Friendly Staff”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Brother and I stayed here one night while exploring the our old boot camp at RTC/NTC San Diego. I went to their website and found a really good rate using my AAA card. I requested an upper-floor room when making the reservation. When we arrived, there was one family being helped at the front desk, the second we walked up, a friendly and helpful front-desk clerk, Terry was there to check us in. She acknowledged that I had requested the upper-floor room and said she'd do her best to accommodate our request. She got us a room on the top floor with an awesome view! (see photos) She was really helpful with directions and information about the bar, restaurant and breakfast too. The room was very nice, well-maintained and clean, with a huge 32" widescreen HDTV, wireless internet, lots of gizmos so you can view your pictures on the TV, an iHome docking station and a Herman Miller ergo-chair, LOTS of room and a balcony with an incredible view. I'm not sure what brand of beds they are, but that was the most comfortable bed I can remember sleeping in. The sheets were high thread count stuff and each bed had 4 feather pillows. I was out the moment my head hit the very fluffy pillow. The hotel is very nice, but what really made it even nicer was the staff that work there. All the front desk people were really friendly and would smile and greet us as we were coming in and going out. I'm a grumpy old man when it comes to customer service and I was really impressed with the staff at Courtyard by Marriott San Diego Airport/Liberty Station and how friendly they all were and how they all seemed to enjoy working there.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Loved it! Best place I've ever stayed in San Diego!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having stayed several times in the downtown/harbor front area, and once in Mission Valley, I would have to say that this was my favorite place I’ve ever stayed in San Diego! The hotel is in the Liberty Station area, which is the old Naval Recruit Training Center. This area has retail shops, a Von’s Grocery, a Trader Joe’s, and restaurants too numerous to mention, including the fabulously fun Corvette Diner. There is 46-acre park (NTC Park, always brimming with activity) adjacent to the hotel, and a beautiful walkway (The Esplanade) along the waterfront, which is a boat channel off of San Diego Bay. We took advantage of the walkway to get in our exercise, and to enjoy the gorgeous weather that San Diego offers. The only “negative” is that the airport is so close, you can see and hear the planes taking off every few minutes during the day. We didn’t hear any late at night, so I’m assuming that no flights go in and out of Lindbergh Field overnight. This hotel is pretty new, so everything is in great condition, both inside and outside. There is a full-service restaurant, a bar with three large screen TV’s for the sports fans, and a deli, where you can get Starbuck’s Coffee, sandwiches and salads, and breakfast pastries. The room décor was very modern, efficient, and comfortable. All of the staff members we encountered were extremely friendly and helpful and, staying there five nights, we never had a single complaint. I would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to San Diego. I think you will be able to see from my pictures that the hotel property and surrounding area are top notch!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have to admit, when I saw that this was the 2nd ranking hotel in San Diego I was a bit skeptical. I recall telling my husband to maybe book a fancier hotel in a location not next to the airport. I'm so happy he didn't listen to me!! When you are traveling with a toddler, and when the plan is to stay for a few days only, it is actually good to be close to the airport. I usually have a list of pros & cons for the hotels I review. Or usually write that the hotel was almost perfect but... NOT THIS TIME!! Let me tell you nothing about this hotel was bad. Yes its close to the airport and sometimes you hear the planes, but it is not a problem at all. The hotel is not super fancy, but when you have a toddler a fancy hotel may not be the best thing, This hotel is new, clean and in a great location. Close to the zoo, Seaworld, Old Town, La Jolla, Mission Bay & the airport. The rooms are clean, nice and a good size. The pool area is very nice. The restaurant is great with a good breakfast buffet. The staff are nice and courteous. Both check in & out took 3 minutes!! The hotel is also right next to a plaza filled with restaurants & Starbucks. The restaurants might not be great, but it'll do for the first day you arrive. The hotel is also a 10min walk to another plaza with Vons, Trader Joes, and yes Starbucks! I actually have nothing negative to say!! Trust me this is a first. My tip to travelers is STAY AT THIS HOTEL. You will be surprised. Two other things that make this hotel a great deal: 1-FREE PARKING (some hotels were asking for $25/day) and room service until 10pm (we have stayed at expensive hotels with room service only between 5-8pm)</p></li>

<li>The hotel is also a 10min walk to another plaza with Vons, Trader Joes, and yes Starbucks!</br></br></li>
<li>I actually have nothing negative to say!!</br></br></li>
<li>Trust me this is a first.</br></br></li>
<li>My tip to travelers is STAY AT THIS HOTEL.</br></br></li>
<li>You will be surprised.</br></br></li>
<li>Two other things that make this hotel a great deal: 1-FREE PARKING (some hotels were asking for $25/day) and room service until 10pm (we have stayed at expensive hotels with room service only between 5-8pm)</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Simply Terrible to stick your hand behind a picture sitting on a ledge in the hotel and find 2 HYPODERMIC NEEDLES. Then after taking pictures i called and spoke with Joe the Manager, he wrote it off because he said probably insulin units.... My reply was are you kidding, what do junkies use and reuse!! They are very lucky that i had no young kids and the units had caps on the needle part. Joe made it up to our room and picked them up...NO GLOVES, weird? he than stated that the GM would be in on Sunday and they would call to discuss what could be done or simply an apology. NO ONE EVER CALLED!! When we went to check out Monday I asked for the General Manager and they said he would be up in 5 minutes, when he showed up he did not introduce himself nor offered any apology, he just stood there like I was some crazy person..... I was very cool but do need to let folks know that this hotel simply had an attitude of not caring and pointing fingers do not work with me when it comes to health and safety. As a General Manager he should have been rolling out the red carpet, they did give us some breakfast coupons of which on Monday we could not use because the kitchen closes at 10am and we got there at 9:58... The waffle bar was already cleaned up..... I guess if I did not have to wait for the GM we would have made breakfast.... O well, not going to change my lifestyle but could change yours.... It is not the fact that I found the needles, it’s was the poor and very unprofessional manner of handling it and being so lackadaisical about the safety of my family.... Very Disappointing, Very Unprofessional and a terrible way to handle a business especially a home away from home...... Jeff Perrin</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A great little hotel-perfect for airport traveler and business!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a great ending to our vacation! We stayed here for just one night before our flight out of San Diego airport. The location was ideal for us. The hotel, while not luxurious, more than met our needs and we are happy to recommend it. The hotel itself has contemporary styling. Not to my tastes, but it was clean, comfortable and very functional. The bathroom was great. It looked like they put a lot of thought into the needs of the business traveler, with easy computer hookups and a comfortable work chair. The flat screen tv was great, with HD channels---something our much higher priced hotel had lacked. Don't expect fancy sheets or towels, but do expect a comfortable sleep. We were pleasantly surprised that the airport noise didn't affect us at all. Free parking, too. The hotel is in the Liberty Station area. It is next to Homewood Suites, but is newer. We didn't need a suite and didn't need or desire to cook our own meals, so Courtyard was just fine with us. There are plenty of chain type restaurants within walking distance, but the hotel restaurant was an absolute gem! We ate dinner there, but had an excellent meal. After eating overpriced, ridiculous meals for a few days, the meal in the Courtyard was a welcome surprise! The wine list, although not extravagant, was well thought, and reasonably priced. The bar was also a welcome relief. The staff was excellent, friendly, but not over the top. Well done, Courtyard! If you have extra time, you might consider driving to the Cabrillo monument. It's an easy 15 minute drive through a mostly residential area. They have limited hours (9-5?), but it's well worth even a short visit to Rosecrans cemetery and the monument. The views are spectacular. Enjoy your trip!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you travel I’m sure you have been fooled and disappointed by the pictures and descriptions on hotel websites, I know I have, and feel the needles when those in the group tell you, “You know I thought this was going to be…….” We go to SeaWorld at least two times a year and have stayed at a few hotels and I must say if this place had a larger pool I would say it was as good if not better than the Hilton resort on Mission bay for $150.00 a night less. My only complaints were the size of the pool, (a little small, but very nice and there is a Jacuzzi) and no breakfast room service. Room service for dinner was very good and reasonable. I cannot say enough about the staff, professional, courteous and fast, make a request and it’s done. I was impressed from the barista at the hotels Starbucks, front desk, even housekeeping… The Liberty Station area is worth a little exploring. It’s on the property of the old basic training facility of the US Navy in San Diego and reeks with history. San Diego has done well to preserve the integrity of the area and honoring those who have served this country. I hope Monterey and San Francisco do as well with their inherited Military Installations... I found going to their web site and using AAA got me better rates than any of the online booking sites by about $30.00, so it helps to shop. I asked to stay on the ground floor but when I go again, and we will, I’ll ask for upper floor room with a balcony facing SeaWorld on the chance you can see the nightly fireworks. The area has plenty of shops and eateries, and this place seems central to everything Mission bay a miles or so north, San Diego harbor a mile or so south, if your new to the area don’t miss either one. Hope this helps… Good Travels.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is my third time staying here. Each Fri-Mon I really like this hotel. Though the rates kind of fluctuate I would say it is worth its price. Really close to Naval Base. Takes my boyfriend literally a 5 minute jog to get from there to this hotel. Front desk clerks that helped me; Jon, Beau, And Cara all very nice and helpful. I came around 10a.m on friday and wanted a view of the bay. Cara already had a room ready for me but I decided to wait it out for the view I wanted. In the meantime I walked to Vons/Trader Joes. Its very close by. About a ten minute walk from the Hotel. When I got back Cara had informed me my room was ready. There are a few food spots close by. Such as Subways, Oggi's Brewery, Los Primos, Sushiya. Sushiya is alright, not the best sushi but I would recommend the Bulgogi rice plate. The room is very modern. I always choose to stay in a room with 2 queens instead of 1 king. A lot more walking room(= NIce flat screen tv. Bathroom is spacious as well. I think the only problem I had with this hotel was the furniture collects dust fast. This was a leisure trip so my boyfriend and I mostly stayed in just to lounge around and watch tv. Its been 3 days and the telephone/desks have collected a lot of dust. I dont really mind though just putting it out there. Its Valentines day today and the housekeeping dropped off a little present with chocolates. I think this hotel really knows how to treat their guest. Overall my stay was great, really nice staff, and looking forward to coming back. Theres also a huge park right outside of this hotel. Though I didnt really get to spend my days outside its really a nice area to take a stroll. Airplane noise is to a minimum. Didnt bother me at all. *If anyone would ever wonder.. a taxi ride from this hotel to Mission Valley Mall (Center) is approximately 20bucks.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As long time San Diego residents, we normally spend our time with family and friends. This year, issues at a friend's house precluded us from staying in their guest bedroom, and thus we booked ourselves at the Marriott Liberty Station. We found the location to be ideal to get into downtown, just turn left from the hotel, follow harbor drive and you're there in no time, without even having to get on the freeway. Likewise to get into Ocean Beach, PB, or locations north; simply turn right out of the hotel to get to the beaches or head north on the 8 freeway to La Jolla. In short, we found the location of the Marriott to be ideally centered between the two areas of San Diego where we spend the most time. As they say, the three most important aspects are location, location, location. On top of the fantastic location, the staff at the Marriott could not have been nicer or more accommodating. They upgraded us on check in to a room overlooking the water, and handled our requests with ease. In the room, we found a flatscreen TV, a small fridge, and (most importantly) a Kuerig coffee maker. From the small balcony we could watch the sun set over the Pacific. Remind me again why we moved away from San Diego? Outside of the hotel, the liberty station area has almost every shop and restaurant that you could need, and others, like Target, In-n-out, and rubio's fish tacos, are just a mile or so east on Rosecrans st. Just across from the hotel in the parking lot is Sushi Ya, an amazing sushi restaurant in a town that has never blown me away with it's sushi selection. Also, a Starbucks, and a few other restaurants are within the same parking lot. If you are looking to explore San Diego, there are few locations as good as this one. Stay away from all of the San Diego hotels that line "Hotel Circle" on the 8 freeway and stay here on harbor drive, you won't regret it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose the Marriott Liberty Station for our recent stay in San Diego because it was a little out of town and hoped it would provide a peaceful location for our holiday with good access to all the sights of San Diego. We certainly weren't disappointed, and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The King-sized room (room 438) was huge, with a large bathroom and small balcony. Bed was super-comfy and although close to the airport, we heard almost no noise during our stay. There was a small fridge in the room, and a Keurig-style coffee maker, but no in-room safe which was a bit of a hassle (free lock-boxes are provided at reception). All the staff were friendly and very good at their jobs; nothing seemed too much trouble. It would help if the instructions on how to summon the shuttle bus from the airport were clearer. As it was, I called reception on a payphone and they dispatched the bus straight away, but we couldn't find any directions or a free phone (other hotels have this sorted). We took breakfast on a few mornings, and this was pretty good value for an unlimited selection of either continental, or hot items. During the day, free coffee is available near reception, as well as huge containers of chilled juices. There's also an on-site laundry which was reasonably priced at $1.25 per machine (free soap from reception). The surrounding area is gorgeous, and there's a Trader Joes and Vons supermarkets within easy walking distance. Buses into downtown leave from the main road opposite Starbucks every half-hour (not Sundays, and only hourly via the airport on Saturdays), but there's another bus route towards the trolley interchange which leaves from Rosecrans Street. We bought a 3-day MTS unlimited pass and this was really useful for exploring San Diego (good for buses and trolleys). Overall, a great hotel in a stunning location. We'd go back in an instant given half the chance.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A Stylish and Well-Appointed Courtyard”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When I typically think of the Courtyard by Marriott brand, the words that come to mind are functional, reliable, and efficient. Add the words “stylish” and “well-appointed” to the Courtyard San Diego Liberty Station. When it comes to my list of favorite hotels, this Courtyard would rank among them. There is an extensive lobby and bar, outdoor seating area, and pleasant pool scene. There is an on-site which restaurant which offers room service. The hotel is adjacent to a park, and there is a walking trail which follows the Liberty Station waterfront. The location is ideal for early morning flights from Lindbergh field and convenient to downtown and other attractions. The room décor is the latest generation design. Guests will enjoy the movable desk, flat screen television, and wireless internet. All three of my stays were in water view rooms, and these come at a $15 premium. The verdict is still out on whether this is a worthwhile upgrade. The view was exceptional the first time – a spectacular view of downtown, the airport, and water. The second time I was in a south-facing water room which had an unobstructed water view. The water is closer to a river than a bay, so it was not noteworthy. During my most recent stay, the room was at the corner of the “L”, so the view was interrupted by the building. All of these rooms had balconies. Finally, the hotel’s CRM is quite impressive. When I arrived for my second visit, the front desk associate acknowledged my recent stay. The associate also noted that my upcoming stay was not booked in a water view room and asked if I would like to change room type. This information often disappears into the black hole of an enormous database, so I was pleased to see this attention to detail. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel as base for exploring San Diego. Pros: Extensive common areas, attractive guest rooms, ideal location with complimentary on-site parking Cons: Dealer’s choice on if the water view is worth the additional expense</p></li>
