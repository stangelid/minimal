<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sax is a really lovely hotel in a great location. However, if you want to sleep before the club in the lobby closes at 4am you may have a problem. Even on the 8th floor, your bed will be shaking with techno beats and screaming girls.</p></li>

Got a great price here through Hotwire. If you're driving, beware of the steep parking fees, however. There's no self-parking, only valet at $52 a day. Lots of restaurants nearby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you like the Retro look and feel of an older hotel than this is great. I do think it was a great location and great view, however, I had to change rooms because I was given a double bed instead of a King. When I was taken to my new room there were still clothes and a suitcase in the room. Staff must have been busy and they were apologetic. It is located in a great spot in the city. It is near the House of Blues and a variety of other places to see. It also has a great view.</p></li>

We have always enjoyed our stay there, and this time was no exception! The staff is exceptional!! We met Catherine Davids,the Chef Concierge, who was so helpful and friendly. She helped us select several restaurants to eat while we were there, and we found they were excellent choices!!!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our first time staying at the Hotel Sax since it was converted from the House of Blues. The vibe is very hip and the location is great, but the room was not up to par with the price we paid. There were major chips in the tub, a burned out light bulb in the bathroom (that wasn't changed in our 4-day stay) and when I went to plug in my laptop, the outlet plate fell off in my hand leaving the outlet completely exposed. There are so many great places to stay in Chicago, we won't be back to the Sax.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I didn't realize that Hotel Sax is the old House of Blues Hotel. I like how it had a rock star personality with the Crimson Bar/decor while still maintaining the luxury look and feel. They let us check in early which was great! Plus their bell staff really went above and beyond to help us (especially Murphy!!) My friend fell on the sidewalk on Dearborn Street as we were leaving on Sunday. They helped us get ice, bandage, etc all while getting our car and packing us up. I would definately stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a surprise. We stayed here through priceline and loved every minute of it. We have been to many Chicago hotels and this one is in the top 5. The room are nicely decorated. The lobby and hallways are awesome as well. The front desk and guest services employees were very nice when we interacted with them. Nothing bad to say about this place. The building itself is old. Our toilet had running water once or twice and the windows could use some fixing but overall can't complain. We tried Bin 36 and A Mano and both are good places to eat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has a great vibe and is located in a great, convenient part of the city. The location is walking distance to everything. The price was also very reasonable. The concierge was helpful and gave some good recommendations on where to go to dinner, etc. The rooms were large and spotless with a very cool contemporary design. The bathroom was exceptionally roomy for a hotel. An added plus was the lounge downstairs. It was always fun and a 10 second commute to your room if you had a couple of drinks. I would definitely stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything about this hotel was outstanding. The service was beyond my expectations - the bellman took great care of our car, helped us get taxis, gave directions and even remembered our names during our whole stay. The room, although small was lovely with a window that could be opened and a fabulous bed. The whole hotel was very swanky and sophisticated. We didn't try the bar inside the hotel but there was a great steakhouse just across the parking lot, who served up steak and lobster at 11pm after a Cubs game. We will definitely be back!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall I had a good stay, the highlight for me was how quiet my room was. When staying at a downtown hotel I expect a bit of noise, however I slept like a baby at this hotel. Check in and check out was easy, the room was comfortable, and the bathroom was spacious. I especially liked the rainfall shower head. The shower had larger bottles of shampoo, which I liked for reducing the waste of small bottles, thanks Hotel Sax. The gym was a little awkward to find, and the lighting in the room was a little dim for me. Other than that, a nice stay.</p></li>

My husband and I appreciated every moment of our stay : great room on 14th floor, very comfortable bed and cleanliness everywhere.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Sax was an ideal hotel to stay in. Close to mass transit, restaurants, 7-Elevens, Mag Mile, and the river. The interior decor is very "hip" and would appeal to younger folk, but we enjoyed it too. The desk and concierge people were extremely helpful and knowledgeable. We used them to book restaurants and boat trips since we were there on the busy Chicago Marathon weekend. Tip: As previous posters have stated, the waters and snack tray will definitely cost you. Another tip: good breakfast next door. A little expensive, but you pay for location.</p></li>

I booked on Hotwire (or Hotliar) where they promise a main brand hotel. The room was clean and adequate but I could have gotten a much nicer 3 star hotel for a cheaper price. The room was small, dark and no dresser. The staff was very courteous and helpful and location is great, as long as you have a room facing the back.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel from a TravelZoo deal and were not disappointed. Decor was unique and trendy, and location was very convenient walking distance to the Magnificent Mile and theater district. The lounge in the hotel is swankiest hotel bar I've seen, with red leather chairs, paintings on the walls, dimly lit lighting and a DJ on weekends. Our room was comfortable and we enjoyed the iHome so we could play our iPod. Only negative: Valet parking is pricey at $50/day. In the end, we got a good deal from TravelZoo, but it was a bit more than we thought with parking figured in.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Sax is by far my favorite Chicago Hotel and one of my favorites anywhere for leisure travel. I go back again and again. Rooms are beautifully designed, with plenty of room to move. Suites are exceptional. Service is great. Staff could not be more professional and attentive. If something is needed or not to your liking, they will remedy it asap. The only thing that keeps the Sax from a higher rating in my mind is the food: average at best, inconsistent and overpriced. My suggestion: room service for breakfast and enjoy some of Chicago's fabulous restaurants for other meals.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The decor in the hotel is beautiful. The room is small yet functional and includes a mounted flat screen television. The bathroom is large and well-lit with a "rain" shower head. I received plenty of towels and the amenities were well stocked. On another note, the front desk employees were very sterile and not very cordial (almost dismissive). They didn't make me feel comfortable when I entered the hotel or when I asked questions about my bill. This hotel would receive a higher rating ( at least a 4) if the hotel front stafff were more cordial (at least smile and be attentive).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a great hotel!! The bed area of the rooms are on the small side, but the bathrooms are absolutely huge! What beautiful decor. There was jazz music playing in our room when we first got there, which was a nice touch. The bed was so comfortable, and there is a huge flat screen tv mounted on the wall. The location was perfect. Walking distance to almost everything in downtown Chicago (shopping, theatre district, Millennium Park, etc.) Although we did not go there, the Crimson Lounge in the lobby looked like a great place for drinks and dancing. We had a great, romantic weekend at the Hotel Sax.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A very nice hotel. Great location. We stayed at the Sax for the Easter weekend. Room was comfortable, the bathroom was really spacious. The hotel is centrally located, walking distance to many attractions. Recommend Einsteins for breakfast. The bagels are wonderful. Pay visit the House of Blues.... we met a great young man working there, he took the time to show us around the theatre. The live entertainment was wonderful. The parking was free through a Travelzoo deal. A very nice bonus. We enjoyed the the river walk and admiring the great architecture. Would certainly visit Chicago again. There is so much to see!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just spent one night at Hotel Sax and had a great experience. The rooms are large, well furnished and chic. The bathroom is very large, well lit and a had great shower head. The fitness center is up to date and had a lot of space in it. Hotel Sax is is a pretty trendy place as it's adjacent to the House of Blues. It's right in the heart of great restaurants, theaters, shopping and other attractions. The service was excellent too. My only complaint was the parking charge ... $49 for overnight! I'd definitely stay there again but will either take public transportation or park down the street at less than half the cost.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed for 4 days over a long weekend in this very well maintained hotel and was very happy with it. The location is close to everything downtown/the loop/the river/the magnificent mile etc. The hotel staff were quite friendly and accomodated us to our room even tho we arrived at 9am (official check in is normally at 3pm). The room on the 15th floor was very clean, pleasant, comfy and had a great view. Mini bar items looked expensive but mostly same cost as buying something at a lounge. Did not try the lounge or the restraunt below so dunno abt them. I did use the room service which came promptly and was good food too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not certain what this hotel is trying to be, but maybe I'm just not hip enough. This boutique 15 story hotel has some interesting plush decor and public spaces that vary from Victorian to sort of 60's star trek, very good service and nice rooms. The location is right next to the House of Blues, and Harry Caray's restaurant and is near a host of other great restaurants. The 4th floor houses the meeting space with odd shaped areas that zig and zag and include a funky retro resting space. The hotel which tries very hard to be different, no doubt succeeds. Good enough for Snoop Dog and other artists who play next door at HOB.</p></li>

The location could not have been better, close to Michigan Ave., within walking distance of great bars and restaurants. Really can not figure out why this Hotel is rated this low.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here 2 weeks ago. It was a business and pleasure trip. I enjoyed the uniqueness of the hotel and its furnishings. The Chef Concierge-Catherine- was fabulous. She remembered our names and helped us tremendously. The location is wonderful. Our room was small and the lighting was poor. The only other problem was there were only two small drawers. i asked for and received extra hangers which helped. Perhaps our room was not a four star room as we booked through PL. I recommend the hotel highly but I would request better lights in the room and a dresser of some sort. I loved the funky furniture throughout.</p></li>

I then overheard a manager checking to ensure that it was not too hot in the lobby. Our housekeeper doubled up on towels as the heat was such that people were taking extra showers. The Concierge went out of her way for us. The decor in the rooms is not typical and was very elegant. The fourth floor is georgeous. Conveniently located. I really enjoyed my stay and would stay again</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My friends and I found a great deal for Sax on Travelzoo. It was within walking distance of major shopping as well as restaurants. Directly across from House Of Blues. The attached restaurant Bin 36 was an added bonus, with a great menu as well as friendly staff. The Sax's beds were soft (doubles were closer to full size instead of queen) and the bathroom was HUGE! It appears as if many of the rooms were being remodeled (did have to complain of early am noise due to this), but not a big enough deal for the value we received. The front desk staff were friendly and accomodating while the bellmen were very friendly and helpful. Would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend getaway in chicago. We found a great rate ($109) on Travelzoo. The hotel has trendy decor; very small lobby area. Great lounge called Crimson Lounge and a restaurant/wine bar called Bin 36 that is attached to the hotel. The restaurant was great. Front desk staff and the guys working out front were great. Very helpful; always had a bad for us within seconds. The location was great; close walk to Magnificnet Mile.and steps away from the Chicago River. The room was small and it was obvious the bathroom hadn't been cleaned properly upon our arrival but other than that it was a great stay and a great value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location on the south end of the loop. No problem walking the Mile for shopping, plus it was a block from the theatre district where we caught a show. Surrounded by fabulous restaurants and fun pubs. Beside the locale, the hotel staff was so helpful with both shopping and dining tips. The room was the best part. I had the best night's sleep ever in a hotel. First the bed and pillows were heavenly. The blackout curtains allowed us to sleep in after a fun night out on the town, and the rooms were so quiet that I didn't hear any hallway or neighbor noises. We used the Airport Shuttle express service to and from the hotel for ease. Definitely would stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a nice hotel. It is "close" on a lot of categories so if you get a good rate you should chose this as a possibility. Here is what close means. The hotel is close to being very good, close to good neighborhood close to having very good service. Would this be the first choice - close but no. It is a pleasant hotel. the rooms are nice. the neighborhood is 3 blocks from nice. Having House of Blues 20 feet away is close to being quiet. Overall I liked the hotel and paid $160 a night and would stay again at that rate or lower. Because the hotel is not great, not great service, not a great heighborhood, not great sound proofing I would not stay at $200. Hope this helps.</p></li>

Staff was very friendly and helpful when advising on directions and restaurant recommendations. I felt that their service was top-notch and professional. The room itself was very clean, from a well made bed to nice towels to a bright and shiny bathroom. The was also nicely laid out and very well decorated, I mean very hip! As my business was downtown, its central location couldn't have been easier, walking distance from the business district. Getting to the hotel from the airports was easy too because the hotel is just a 3-block walk from the "El" stop. All in all I was very impressed, thanks Sax!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a frequent traveler to Chicago, IL, I have stayed at the House of Blues/Hotel Sax many times. Recently, the hotel has undergone a management change. Unfortunately, this has meant that the hotel now charges for internet access and the new staff aren't as friendly as former staff. As well, I used to get complimentary parking at the hotel, having been a frequent guest, and now I no longer get any perks. The hotel is very chic, but there are many other options in the city that will offer more for less. As a result of the changes at this hotel, I will likely no longer return. On the plus side, this hotel is centrally located, right next to the river and walking distance to State St and Michigan Ave shopping.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed nine enjoyable nights at the Hotel Sax. House of Blues is centered there. Hotel has been completely renovated and the new ornate and ultra modern Bar/Lounge next to the front desk is something to see and enjoy!! Very unique! Hotel is close to everything downtown and World famous Michigan Avenue Shopping is also within walking distance. Restaurants, steakhouses (Harry Carry's, Mortons,Sullivans,etc) are within walking distance. Great Full Service Gym connected to Hotel. Staff was very friendly.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here for a long weekend and enjoyed it very much. The staff are all very friendly...especially the valet guys. We stayed in, what appeared to be a wheelchair accessible room, so we are not sure if the other rooms are described the same way. The room was a very nice size and the bathroom was huge. The decor was posh and contemporary, yet very comfortable, nice and quiet. The bed was comfortable too. The location was great! The restaurant that is attached (Bin 36) looks like a good great place....we only went for desserts at around 10 and it was still packed and the food and wines and cheeses looked great! There's really nothing I can complain about! Would definitely recommend it and would return!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I took my family to Chicago and we stayed here one night for $240 from Hotwire. There was a convention that weekend, so prices were stiff around chicago. Negatives - The room was small for four people and there was duct tape across the bathroom sink. So I was disappointed in the room. Breakfast was $20/person, yet much of the food was prepackaged (e.g., scrambled eggs were from a mix). Neutral - location is OK, building nothing special. Positives - Excellent staff - front desk, valet parking etc. They deserve kudos. I don't think I would stay there for a price. i felt like we received a poor room because we booked through Hotwire for a supposedly decent price. There's alot of other hotels out there, I would shop around.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was a bit adamant after reading some no very positive reviews but I have to say I was impressed with the hotel from the second I stepped in. The checking in was fast and pleasant and I was able to go to my room way before the advertised check in time. The room was beautiful. I must admit the deco may not be to everybody's taste but it did it for me. The bathroom was nice and spacious and I loved the chequered tiles. The location is in the heart of the city, literally minutes from the Loop and Michigan avenue and there are lots of bars and restaurants just a few steps away on Hubbard st, which also boosts a pretty good night life. Overall a very pleasant experience and wouldn't hesitate to return to the Sax when I'm in Chicago next.</p></li>

I do have to agree with the last review that the house keeping was lacking and although the hotel had great offers to take advantage of the bath soap, and the maid service was very cheap with supplies such as soap and items you would expect to have and they had mini fridge stocked with so many items to make you spend lots of money you couldn't hardly keep your own personal items in it. In all I enjoyed the hotel and if they just give more attention to the little things such as soaps etc you would be even better.They did have free tickets to house of blues free appetizers in the lounge which was great and nice bar and music.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel has an attractive facade with glitzy decor and dim lighting. But the important features that one expects in an expensive hotel such as comfortable beds and bedding are sorely lacking at the Sax. Holiday Inn would be more comfortable and less stingy with hand soap, towels, and drinking glasses. The housekeeping was spotty at best. I had to request drinking glasses and we didn't get a fresh bar of handsoap until our fifth day at the hotel. The beds were saggy with mattress toppers that were too small, cheap pillows, and institutional style sheets. This hotel is not for the business traveler--Wifi is $10.95 per day and the hotel doesn't even provide ink pens in the rooms. The only impressive aspect of the hotel was the excellent service provided by the friendly doormen.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have severe allergies. When a place is not clean, I wheeze and suffer. This place was spotless. The staff were top notch. They truly pampered every guest. The bar is gorgeous, but a little too loud an hip hop for the over 40 crew. Bin 39 next door offers wonderful cheese and wine tastings as well as meals. There are many greatrestaurants within a block of the hotel. The only negative for the room is that the bathroom is small with no storage space. However, the room had a coffee maker, a mini bar/frig an iron, a safe and reading material. The fitness room was pretty basic, but adequate; free Internet in the lobby where they printed our boarding passes. They also serve delicious coffee and lemonade in the lobby. We loved this place!

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Definitely not my taste in decorating - I would call it heroin chic meets a vampire's eclectic garage sale. The halls are extremely dark and unlit. The lighting reminded me of bad, late 1960's Mediterranean motif - dark wood, dark lighting, and dark walls. The room didn't have a theme - every lamp, every piece of furniture, every light bulb was different - nothing matched a style or thought - it was all random.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good hotel overall. Pluses : champaign & peanuts in shell at front desk upon Friday night arrival. Large bathroom, ~42" LCD was fantastic, 6th floor computer/gaming room Negatives: not enough lighting next to bed but my #1 negative is that the bed itself was not on par with higher end hotels...I thought it was kind of hard and not even. I don't agree with previous reviews that it was soft. The comforter was very warm so you really had to turn the room temperature down. Ironing board was broke and had to use while laying it on the bed. Wife said she did not have enough counter space in bathroom for all her cosmetics. Bath tub wasn't a sunken tub. No coffeemaker but coffee was available in lobby although it could have been better quality though for hotel level. Booked via priceline for <$120/night so it was a very good value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I always have my doubts about these trendy, urban places -- but Hotel Sax was very nice! Went with a girlfriend for a lady's weekend. They upgraded us to a bigger room -- which was a nice size, had a decent view, and windows that opened! There was a big flat-panel TV and a huge mirror, and two super-comfy beds. We got champagne one night when we walked into the lobby, which was nice. Because of the club on the first floor, it was a little zooy, but you couldn't hear anything up in the rooms. We also went to the Bin?? and had a great dinner. This is in a very nice location -- close to a lot of things. My only complaint was that we asked for a late checkout because of delayed flights, and they told us it would cost $150! I've never heard of that before, and was rather annoyed. But otherwise, this was a great location for a jazzy little weekend in Chicago!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Since I was concerned about the bedbug reviews before my stay, I feel like I have to write my own review. I am happy to report that I did not have any trouble during my stay. The Sax does look like an older hotel (cracks on bathroom vanity/stains on curtains/peeling wallpaper etc.) but the room was clean enough to be comfortable. Like the other reviewers said, the mattress does feel old (a bit sagging) but I had a good night sleep anyway. If this hotel was 3 star, I would give "excellent" for its uniqueness and overall quality, but when compared to other 4 star hotels it lacks on many levels. However, I should note that for the price I paid (through the bidding site, my rate was more like 3 star hotel) I was a happy customer. The biggest plus was the customer service. Very friendly and upon check-in he gave me a decent room (2 beds with good view) despite my rate.</p></li>

Pros: The service: staff were very friendly, prompt to help out and always someone around when you needed them. The morning coffee and computers in the lobby were extremely helpful Location: great location, close walk to all the sights and shopping Rooms: very cool setting, huge washrooms and comfortable beds Gym: the gym facilities were excellent, clean and had all the equipment I wanted cons: This hotel is old, and there are some definite maintenance issues. For instance, when we arrived our toilet would not flush properly, On the second day, the door handle fell of the inside of our door. These problems were fixed very quickly and the staff were apologetic, but I think a major renovation and repairs is needed to keep this hotel up to a four star standard.</p></li>

(not that i asked either, but still.) got a pretty decent deal on priceline, but if i paid regular rates, would not have been super happy. tiny details were lacking. and please please for a "modern" hotel, internet for the love of god should be free.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Sax for a girl's weekend getaway and it was great! There was so much going on in and around our hotel we couldn't even decide what to do! I would definitely stay here again. The staff was great, especially Josh, the doorman who helped us out with choosing places to eat and go. The location was awesome, only a block or two from shopping, bars and good dining. If you haven't visited Chicago before, be sure to bring comfortable shoes to walk around in. The only complaints we had was that the walls were thin and housekeeping wasn't very on top of their game (eg: making beds but leaving our room without toilet paper). We walked in and walked out of Crimson Lounge because it was too loud and we wanted something more laid back. We found great bars on Hubbard which is only a block away. We had such a great time that we considered extending our stay....if only airline fares weren't so high!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Talk about Central! We were in town for a fun excursion and didn't even have a set agenda. Being very familiar with Chicago, we had our fav's lined up but it was a little too cold to walk as far as some -- so the very excellent conceirge, Sarah, directed us to some new favorites. We never walked farther than a few blocks to find everything from excellent Blooly Mary's at brunch to the local's half price oyster bar happy hour. As far as the Sax as a facility, it is first rate. The rooms are plush and mod and the views are what you want in the city. The snow coming down over the river was like a Monet painting. Don't forget to hang out at the Lobby bar with live music on Friday and if for any reason you get bored or have the DT's from missing your video game console, you should check out the Tech Lounge where we had a blast playing RockBand. We're already talking about coming back in the Spring. Stay tuned...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sax Chicago is the new choice for my family when visiting Chicago. On a whim my wife and I decided to take our 16 month old daughter to the zoo. We heard from a friend to try Sax. We did and could not have been more impressed. Before we arrived I called Samantha at the Concierge desk and asked her to make reservations for us at our favorite restaurant. She did so and very quickly, I might add. I received a confirmation email in about twenty minutes. Next I talked with Aisha at the front desk to see if there was a way to get a fridge and microwave. Done and Done. When we arrived, the bellman and the valet were very gracious and helpful in getting our luggage together and brought to the room. The room was very nice. Clean, comfortable, roomy. We were able to set up a play area for our daughter and she loved looking out the window. I will recommend Sax Chicago to anyone and we will definitely be staying again!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got this hotel last minute for one night on priceline. We got in around 10 pm on a thursday and there were lots of you young thin dressed up people pouring out the elevators. It felt like we walked into a club lobby to check in. Check in was smooth and easy, although the decor, doesn't make it obvious this is the function of the room. Elevators had some cool paintings. Hallways had some textured silvery-gray wall paper. Room was beautiful. TONS of mirrors. My guess is the this is a renovated old hotel as the tiles and tub were very 50ish. But the Wallpaper in the bathroom was modern. They should position the towel racks a little better. As your towels are not reachable from the shower. I would say the only downside is the pillows are way too soft. But that is just personal preference. The location could not be better. Restuarants, bowling, drinking all within steps of the hotel. Will cetainly consider this place for my next trip.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked our room via Priceline and was overall a great experience/choice. Can not say enough about the location - close walking all River North, Michigan Ave, Loop. Great decor - a little unual and modern. Very comfy bed, with robes, slippers and a VERY expensive mini bar! Since we booked via Priceline, I knew that we get a room for 2, usually a King. So, I emailed the hotel and received a wonderful response stating that our reservation had been changed to a double to accomodate our 4 year old. Well - that didn't happen! The gal at the counter was pretty much - take it or leave it, we're sold out! Liked 10-pin next door, and found cheap (for chicago standards) parking at the Sterling Lot 1 block away. The lounge in the hotel, Crimson, was pretty swank and crowded after 10:00. Nice and not overly priced. Overall, I give it 4 stars, as there are way better hotels in Chicago that get 5! I would definitely stay here again! Overall great stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for two nights, and I was glad to depart at the end. First of all: beds were lumpy. Seriously. Very uncomfortable mattress and hard pillows. Two: Our bathroom (huge while oddly shaped) came with a mini-shower and bathtub. Hardly first class. And they only gave us only two bath towels (isn't four the norm?). The toiletries were generic and not nice. Bathroom light was harsh fluorescent, and the heat lamp above kept going on and off. The shops are a bit of a hike (nearest Starbucks is a couple of blocks away). It's sandwiched between the business district and the shopping district in this odd little run down area, so the surrounding ambiance isn't nice. Get ready to shell out $10 a night PER COMPUTER to user the Internet. They were not accommodating with a late check out request; we had to call twice and practically beg for them to give us a one hour extension. If you're looking for an upscale, modern hotel, I'd recommend checking out the James or the Felix, both nearby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for a conference being held at another hotel because staying at the Sax Hotel has been excellent in the past. I was not disappointed. Even though I arrived early, Ana was able to check me in..no problem. The room was on the 16th floor with a great Chicago river view...Water Taxi's, tour boats, kyakers. Could sorta tell how cool or warm or wet it was from looking out the window at walkers below. River Walk is close to Hotel so able to walk along the river with no vehicle noise and nice. Halls, lobby all clean, neat. Room was very clean and quiet even though the lobby always seemed busy. Room not too cold/hot, Don't use the honor's bar but is available. Staff professional and friendly. I do recall some names but didn't get all the names: Samantha and Catherine (both very helpful concierges), Constantine (bellman...I think..), Rico and Wayne (doormen...), AJ (morning wake up calls were appreciated and got the weather report, too). To all the Sax Hotel staff who made my stay enjoyable, thank you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The House of Blues Hotel has been undergoing changes for the last five months. It is now called HOTEL SAX, yes, that's as in saxophone, or is it just a play on your eye? This place has problems: the front desk is currently on the fourth floor of this 16-story 353-room building. Getting there can be a pain. There's ONLY ONE working elevator in the whole place! One elevator for 353 rooms! Management decided to keep the place open while renovating everything. What a disaster that makes! Stairways lead to construction zones that are roped off from the public. Dust everywhere. Movie channels are not working. The newly renovated rooms are still relatively clausterphobic but far more tasteful than the House of Blues "style" (or lack thereof). Still, someone failed to do their homework. The tiny desk chair sweats against your back something terrible! No wireless Internet. Wait a while, and maybe they'll be ready for primetime. Meanwhile, think of 13 clowns in a VW Beetle, and you'll know what the pain is here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We liked this hotel. Great location. Within walking distance to some of the most popular bars, restaurants, music venues in the city. Ok, I'll be honest..the decor was funky, but in a fun, weird way. The lobby, if that's what you call it, is not your traditional Grandiose welcoming entry, but hey, who really needs that? The room was good. Lots of space, large bathroom, everything you really need for a good nights sleep. After getting a feel for the slightly tacky wallpaper, I wasn't sure if this is the contemporary trend going on now, or just a room that needs updating. I guess a little of both... After taking care of some business in town, having a great dinner at Shaw's, the wife and I headed to the lounge to take advantage of the two free drink tickets we received upon check-in. Walking in to the lounge I couldn't help being amused by the decor. What is this? A bar, a bordello, WTF? I really loved it! Comfy chairs, couches, niches, alcoves to relax in. A highlight. All in all, it was cool tacky sheik. I'd recommend..</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Sax Chicago - A 4-Star Hotel Better Than Most 5-Star Hotels”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Although officially rated a 4-star hotel online, Sax Chicago is more happening than most 5-star hotels at which I've stayed. It's elegant without being ostentatious, exceedingly clean and comfortable, and has all the amenities. The staff is courteous, genuinely warm, helpful, and professional. And the coffee and tea they serve complimentary in the lobby every morning is as good as it gets, rivaling what you'd expect from Chicago's top coffee houses. The hotel's Crimson Lounge is hip and contemporary, featuring DJs, live jazz, an excellent selection of spirits, wine, beer, and appetizers, and some of the most beautiful people in Chicago. The adjoining Bin 36 Restaurant/Wine and Cheese Bar is amongst the best of its kind in the country. And if that's not enough, Chicago's world famous House of Blues is right next door! I travel to the Windy City several times per year and I always stay at the Sax. Ideally located (walking distance to everything), the hotel has become a home away from home for me. I give it my highest recommendation.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Slightly funky boutique hotel but friendly and without any attitude”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not knowing Chicago too well, I was happy with the central location (next to House of Blues). The hotel is a bit self-consciously funky, but unlike the W was quite well lit, and you don't have to wear black to fit in. The best point for me was that everyone I met was super nice and helpful with no attitude and a sense of humor. I stayed three nights. The room was comfy and relaxed. It was pleasantly funky but not over the top and the bathroom was positively normal. Not sure I would get the two fake snakeskin armchairs for my own living room, but otherwise I felt right at home. Big mirror, great view. Heating worked fine, but needed tweaking with the weather (it was super cold). Blackout curtains really worked, bed was comfy. Overall it was very quiet and I got a lot of rest, although I was woken up (at 9am!) by the cleaning staff shouting and laughing. I tried the wine bar (Bin 36) and had a lot of fun there. I only chose this hotel because I got a great deal on the price, but I would definitely stay there again (assuming the price is still right!).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I usually stay at the Palmer House or Drake when I am in Chicago, but opted for this little gem because they had a special of $109. with free parking which in Chicago is worth $40 a day. Check-in was a breeze, front desk staff and and everyone I came in contact with was super. Room was a little small (1526) but nicely furnished; large plasma TV on wall very nice. Quiet area, good dinner choices within a block. Easy CTA (bus) service into the loop. They also gave me two drink coupons which I used in the Crimson Lounge which is a large nicely furnished bar area. Free internet terminals are available in the lobby. Workout room was okay, three treadmills, three elipticals and some free weights. Two televisions mounted on the wall, no headphone jacks. I was the only one working out so it wasn't an issue. Definitely somewhere I would consider again. For weekend visitors parking on the street is free after 6 p.m. on Saturday all day Sunday until 8:00 a.m. Monday. I had no trouble finding street parking if you don't get free parking in your rate. Cheers. Marius</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Here is an absolutely unbiased review: I was there for a National meeting, and stayed here even though the meeting was at McCormick place. I stayed in room 1014. It is really dark and depressing in the room, and musty and dirty as well. The bed was way too short for me (i'm 5'11...not a giant), and when you sleep on the bed the bottom sheet comes undone immediately and isn't really fitted, and the comforter is cheap, not a nice down one. There's some dirty, cheap, leather pillows on the bed. The room is not well lit, uncomfortable, and the bathroom is cold and not clean. An old pack of Rolaids was stuck in the corner of the room (if the hotel reads these: CLEAN THESE UP!). It was a total of $300 a night... so overall, it was terrible. There are many, many better hotels that are actually much cheaper. Don't stay here, pick somewhere else. I spend much less in a Westin ---I left to stay here I was so sick of the SAX, and even though I don't think Westin's are that great, it was at least comfortable, with decent beds and shower. The SAX was cheap, dirty, cold, and overpriced.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently went to Chicago for a 3 night getaway. Found the Sax Hotel about a week before heading to Chicago on hotels.com for $129/night + complimentary parking (parking is usually $47/night, so this was HUGE!) We arrived on a Sunday morning, approx 4 hrs before check-in. The staff was very nice and accommodating and held our bags and the valet parked the car. We started touring the city right away and the hotel is only about 2-3 short blocks from Michigan Ave. The hotel is located right next to the House of Blues and on the same block as Harey Carey's! I cannot say enough about the location, it was in the middle of everything. We never took our car out of the garage! No need to! The rooms were amazing! The view was not so good, but it didn't matter, we didn't plan on it, nor did we need it! The rooms (we had a kind room) was extremely clean and spacious! Cool decor, very different! We went to Wrigley Field for a Cubs game and the "El" station is 2 blocks from the hotel (only $9 roundtrip for the El.) If I ever return to Chicago, I will try my hardest to stay at the Sax Hotel!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is our fifth annual visit to Hotel Sax and although I have reviewed it before, I feel compelled to do so again. We booked our trip on travelocity and it was extremely reasonable to fly and stay over Labor day weekend. as always, the concierge, front desk, and the bell men were helpful and friendly. We stayed on the 10th floor in a room with a king bed. The room was clean, spacious and the bed was comfortable. The only complaint is that the bathroom sink was tiny and there was no room to set anything on top of it without it falling in the sink or on the floor. The maid service was slow but i would imagine they were full for the long weekend. we had wine and cheese purchased from Bin36 in our room during two nights of our stay and it was awesome. the people are friendly, helpful, and quick in getting you your order to go. we had never done this before and will definitely do it again next year. the hotel is close to everything and is in a great location. for breakfast, there are many options since room service is expensive (starbucks, einstein bagel accross the street, and the huge mcdonalds down the road). i love the hotel sax!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is my second stay at this hotel and it again was great! The only bad thing was we asked for "turn down" service, and they came at 10:30 PM to do it! We were already asleep! (Had kids, what can I say!!?) So they came the next night earlier and "turned down" the beds BUT no treats! We were expecting a little something from the other reviews, but nothing! No mint or jellybean! So the kids thought this turn down service was stupid! (Had to agree with them) Anyway, the hotel was nice and remodeled and clean. We even asked for a micro wave and they brought us one right away. The only drawback is parking. It was $40 a day, and the lot right across the street was $15 a day. Wish I would have used that one and spent $30 instead of $80...but they come and snatch up your car right away and you think that is the thing to do. Our car never left the lot for 3 days, so it really could have been parked across the street. Our rooms were nice and clean and large. It really is a fun stay for right downtown. You can walk to Michigan Ave. very easily. I enjoyed it and the kids thought we were "high class" They even had robes for us to wear, that was fun!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I believe the Hotel Sax is my favorite hotel in downtown Chicago. I have stayed many places in the area but the Hotel Sax offers an extraordinary experience. From the time I pulled into the driveway, I was wowed by the level of professionalism and warmth from the staff. I knew the staff by name and they treated me like I was welcomed and my needs were a priority. Charles, the valet was more than courteous and helpful. Our housekeeper, Tonisha made us feel at home and took care of our personal items with great care, in additon to leaving the room spotless and well stocked. We had the pleasure of having a few drinks in the Crimson Lounge and met Brad and Matthew, the host and bartender. Our room was beautifully decorated and the bathroom was huge. The shower head and water pressure was fantastic! The extra two bonuses to staying at the Hotel Sax is the parking and the House of Blues. I paid ONLY $42.00 with in and outs for my entire extended stay! This is simply unherad of in downtown Chicago. The House of Blues is literally 20 steps from the Hotel Sax. Check out their website www.hob.com to see scheduled events. I will be a returning guest whenever I'm in Chicago.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Can recommend this hotel. We got a really good deal through expedia hence the 5 out of 5. The hotel is centrally located at the Marina City development hence the strange towers (car parks/apartments in the photos). On some photo's it can look a bit uninviting with the towers but to be honest it's pretty cool. You don't travel to Chicago to be in the country side. Marina City is less than five minutes walk from Michigan Avenue and the Magnificent Mile. Friendly, helpful staff and a bar call Bin 36 specializing in wine and cheese just of the lobby, a bowling alley in the basement and another cool bar just of reception. Missing of the picture is a big flat screen TV, the rooms are nicely decorated, clean and of a fairly high standard. Complaints; glasses started disappearing after day one we started with six in the room and ended with one. The TV set itself to a high volume every time you turned it on (maybe good if you have gone deaf in the mean time), and I've learnt that it's maybe better to tip the maid a day earlier than you leave (there was a knock at the door at 9.45 the night before we left and again at 8am) if you want a lie in. All in all would gladly go back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Junior Suite was perfect for me and my 2 teenage daughters! King bed with wall mounted flat screen and living room area with a sleeper sofa with its own wall mounted flat screen. If bed privacy is an issue, this arrangement would not work because all that seperates the 2 sleeping areas is a sheer chiffon curtain. Bath area is gigantic with floor to ceiling windows, 2 sinks, large amt of counter space. Housekeeping was very attentive. Evening concierge, Mario...helped out with printing airline boarding passes at a certain time, even though we werent even at the hotel at the time they needed to printed. He was very accomodating Hotel is as close to everything as you need to be. Big city so you cant be walking distance to everything but definitely is in the middle of all. House of Blues is right across the driveway from the hotel and we enjoyed the Sunday afternoon Gospel Brunch......buffet style... so by the time you make it back to your table, food is cold but that happens at every buffet. Should have more that 2 guys preparing omelettes. Would stay there again for sure!!! Adult atmosphere...wouldnt be a place I would stay with young kids. Nothing is geared for youngsters. GOOD!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Definitely not your run-of-the-mill hotel. It's right next to the House of Blues and carries over that bluesy / southern feeling. I kept expecting to see Elvis come around the corner. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The location is great. The bed was wonderful. I flew in in the morning and arrived about 9:00 am, just planning to drop my luggage with the desk, but they had a room to give me already. Excellent! The ceilings were very high, which gave you a great feeling of space. There were robes in the room, and the towels were nice and thick. My few cons, which aren't deal breakers, but are good to know. $15 per 24 hours of internet in the room, although it was free in the business lounge. The room was a little on the tattered side - a broken switch plate, peeling wallpaper, some trash from the previous occupant that fell out from behind the desk. In my bath, there was nowhere to hang a towel where you could reach it from the shower, and there was no space on the vanity to put anything. Nothing huge, but not quite perfect either. I did get this hotel through a bidding site, so considering what I paid, it was great deal and I wouldn't be at all upset if the Sax came up again for me.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a group of 6 friends staying at the Sax to celebrate a birthday and were lucky enough to find a great deal on Travelzoo, $119/night with two complimentary drink tickets for the Crimson Lounge. The decor was unique and fun and added to the luxe feel of the place. The bathroom was huge and gave us a nice place to dress up before going out to a fantastic sushi place a few blocks away. The location of the Sax is great, really close to a variety of shopping (loved going to Nordstroms and Marbles the Brain Store) and restaurants. We really wanted to go to the House of Blues Gospel Brunch in the morning, which was right around the corner from the hotel, but it was sold out well in advance. The concierge recommended The Emerald Loop, a nearby Irish Pub, which was excellent! An all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet for $9.95 in downtown Chicago? It exists, and it is awesome. The only downsides to the hotel were the puzzling lack of towels and pillows for all four guests (only 3 towels/room and one small pillow per guest), though extra pillows and towels were promptly brought up when we called the front desk. All in all a great deal, and I would gladly stay here again if I found a room at a similar price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location, really good. Service, good. Decor, interesting. But, on the one thing a hotel MUST get right---BEDS---this hotel fails miserably. I stayed here twice, three nights each, in a month (for work...I had no choice but to return). Both times, I couldn't sleep AT ALL because of the lumpy and saggy beds. I seriously think that budget hotels have better beds. I actually slept on the floor the last night because the beds sucked so much. I'm a 30-year-old with no back problems or aches and pains on a regular basis, but every night and every morning, my back and hips were sore and I woke up many times during the night because I was uncomfortable. I wasn't just my room either. I had two different rooms in my differing stays and both beds were terrible, and two of my colleagues said their beds were also terrible. The center of the bed has some support running down in, so that's ok, but then each side dips down and sags. These beds must literally be 10 years old. I can't even imagine how disgusting they are under the sheets if they're old enough to be this saggy. And, the pillows, while fluffy and soft, also provide absolutely no support. I would never stay at this hotel again, despite the good location. NOT worth bad sleep...if you're sight-seeing you can't really enjoy it if you can't sleep. For work travelers, it's absolutely terrible.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I checked into Hotel Sax on the Friday night of Labor Day weekend. We had booked the room on Priceline, and check-in was effortless. The dramatic, red lobby set the tone for the hotel--very dim, moody lighting.

I loved the chandelier decal on the wall (not to mention the varied wallpaper patterns--some metallic--throughout the hotel). Really, life just feels more glamorous while sitting in a faux snake skin upholstered chaise louge. We had a nice Some might find that sort of thing tacky, but maybe they should lighten up a little.

The view was good, the location was great, and the hotel itself was like any other. One caveat, valet parking is $49 a day.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a wonderful stay at the Sax for our weekend celebration of our one-year wedding anniversary. Despite Chicago being very crowded that weekend due to a few major conferences, the receptionist was able to accommodate our requests for a king room. They were also kind enough to sign for and store our slice of wedding cake. :) We flew into Chicago and took the Blue Line train from the airport to downtown Chicago and really enjoyed paying $5 rather than $50. Especially as we zipped past the standstill traffic. :) We loved our room. It was spacious, had a little view of the river, and the decor was fun. The bathroom was nice and spacious. It was definitely the nicest hotel we've stayed at in awhile. The location was great, close to lots of Chicago attractions. The downstairs bar was beautiful (not exactly a hotspot, but a great place to grab a before or after-dinner drink). We both used the fitness center. It's not super swanky, but the equipment is in good condition. We ordered from room service once late night. We decided to avoid the $40 pizza, but did give in to a $17 plate of hummus. I must admit, it was pretty dang good hummus, though. There's a bagel shop right across the street, so we did breakfasts there. Even though I had a computer, we decided to avoid the surcharge and use the computers in the lobby. Perfectly adequate! We booked our room through PL and were still treated like Kings. I'd highly, highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My two girlfriends and I booked a room at the Sax over Memorial Day weekend. We got a good deal. We picked this hotel based on TripAdvisor's suggestion that it's good for singles. They were right! The Sax is definitely a hotel for people willing to stay somewhere a little different. The lobby isn't very big, but there are comfy chairs and couches to wait on. The doormen were extremely friendly. The front desk staff were friendly as well, although some of them were a bit hit and miss. The Crimson Lounge is definitely a pro for this hotel. The lounge seems very new, and is decorated in red and black. The drinks are a bit pricey, but the bartenders were extremely sweet and made sure we got fantastic drinks for our dollars. Only downside was that the lounge closed around 1:30am, but this is the same as most places in Chicago. The room was great. Luxurious, comfy beds, huge bathroom, the wireless internet worked flawlessly, and it was spotless every day. The big downside - the concierge. They had a few different people staffing the concierge desk and we only had one competant one - that was Christina or Catherine. She was fantastic, but the others didn't really know anything. They had to make several phone calls to find anything out and they didn't even know the way to get places! So overall, I'd stay here again, knowing that I might have to do my own investigating for where to go and what to do and how to get there. Otherwise, had an excellent stay!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked the Hotel Sax primarily because of the positive reviews on this site. Check-in was prompt, efficient, etc., rooms fairly spacious and clean. Only complaint would be a lack of storage - the hotel's website claims that a double double room sleeps 4 comfortably which is true but if they got rid of the outrageously overpriced mini-bar ( we did'nt indulge!! ) this would create more room. Only other issue of note was noise from a party in the room next to ours at 3.00am!!! which, when we rang reception to inform them of same, resulted in no action being taken as the noise continued for a number of hours. In fairness to the hotel they compensated us adequetly when we mentioned it the following morning. We had our 2 daughters with us ( 11 and 8 ) so could'nt make use of The CRIMSON LOUNGE but it looked like a food place to go. On an extremely positive note, my daughter's teddy bear was accidently caught up in the sheets and disappeared off to the laundry company, and after quite a number of phone calls both were reunited after approx 36 stresssful hours!!!! Hats off to all in housekeeping, front desk and even the bell boys for a great job. Checked out the STUDIO and it was a popular place to hang out. BIN 36 is also good for breakfast, evening drinks etc., We engaged the services of Katherine, the concierege who got us a 50% discount in tickets for the BULLS at the United Centre so all in all, we would use the hotel again. 3 internet ports in the lobby proved very useful also.</p></li>

<li>In fairness to the hotel they compensated us adequetly when we mentioned it the following morning.</br></br></li>
<li>We had our 2 daughters with us ( 11 and 8 ) so could'nt make use of The CRIMSON LOUNGE but it looked like a food place to go.</br></br></li>
<li>On an extremely positive note, my daughter's teddy bear was accidently caught up in the sheets and disappeared off to the laundry company, and after quite a number of phone calls both were reunited after approx 36 stresssful hours!!!!</br></br></li>
<li>Hats off to all in housekeeping, front desk and even the bell boys for a <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.998">great</span> <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.998">job</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>Checked out the STUDIO and it was a <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.986">popular</span> <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.986">place</span> to hang out.</br></br></li>
<li>BIN 36 is also <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">good</span> for <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">breakfast</span>, evening drinks etc., We engaged the services of Katherine, the concierege who got us a 50% discount in tickets for the BULLS at the United Centre so all in all, we would use the hotel again.</br></br></li>
<li>3 <span style="background-color:#d0d0d0" title="p=0.999">internet ports</span> in the lobby proved <span style="background-color:#d0d0d0" title="p=0.999">very useful</span> also.</br></br></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It saddens me that I can't write a rave review about the SAX. It started out great, the room was immaculate, bathroom, huge, the flat screen TV had access to HD channels, wireless access was seemless and the bed was extremely comfortable and soft. The location was excellent, just a short walk to the Miracle Mile and Merchant Mart. My husband and I were contemplating extending our stay at the hotel because it was so comfortable and, well, perfect. That is, until we retrieved our car from the valet lot a day after we checked in. Our car had been ransacked, with every compartmented rumaged through and our belongings scattered. Luckily, we removed all valuable items from the car except for some quarters intended for parking (those were stolen) but it felt violating to have our car vandalized like that. When we complained to hotel management, they immediately said that they do not run the valet parking service and they just send guests to the lot since it's right across the way. And, of course, the parking service didn't want to take responsibility either. My perception of valet parking is that the car is kept in a safe place where it wouldn't be ransacked so obviously, this kind of service was unacceptable to me. I was tired of getting the runaround so I asked that we not be chared for parking that first night (I parked on the street after that) and they did remove the charge. We decided not to extend our stay after that experience and their indifference to what had happened ruined our experience with the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Took my wife and two young children (1 & 4) up to Chicago to see the big-city during the Holidays. We put in a bid for $100 on a 4 star hotel along Michigan/River North and were lucky to have the Sax take our bid. The location was great for us as it's centrally located - easy access to both the loop and Michigan Ave. We took the short walk across the river and visited both the old Marshall Fields building (now Macy's) and saw their window displays and visited the Kristkindlmarket. All the previous posts that rave about the Hotel's staff are right on the money. From the bellhops, to valet (we actually parked the car up in Lincoln Park and took the Brown Line back, saving the Hotel's $50 parking fee), to the front-desk staff, they were all wonderfully polite and courteous, all eager to accommodate our needs. Although Priceline booked us into a room with one queen bed, we paid the extra $20 a night for two double beds and a lot more living space. We thought the extra space was well worth the extra charge. The room was very spacious and clean, with a full wet-bar, bath robes, and flat panel television. The room did have an art-deco style theme, but I thought it was very classy and well done. Beautiful long drapes hung across the windows, which we used to encircle our child's pack-n-play creating a nice tent-like effect. The only downside to the hotel was the lack of a traditional lounge area - but with two kids and so much to do and see in the city, this was the least of our concerns. Overall we were very pleased with our stay and will definitely stay there again, given the chance.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just visited Chicago and stayed at the Sax Hotel by a friend's referral. I'm from California, so I welcomed the "swanky" feel of this hotel. When you walk into the lobby, it is very modern with lounge music playing and a smell of incense in the background. The staff is very young and chic, they probably hire models for this hotel. LOL One of the floors has a business center with wall size flat panels, laptops and gaming consoles. I thought the gaming consoles were a little strange, I guess they cater to a younger clientele. Nonetheless, very chic and the Chicagoans fit right in to make this an interesting place to network even if it's just to check your email. The rooms have snake skinned chairs, 70's looking beds (that are huge), and a small radio that also looks like it was from the 70's. Turn it on though, and it's a blazing Bose system that will rock your room! Mini Bar has the cutest bottles of Patron Tequila, I thought that was a nice touch....At night, visit the Crimson Lounge downstairs. Great music with lots of nooks to hang out with friends. You need to be dressed pretty hip to mingle in that crowd! Lots of fun, loved it. Across the parking area outside is the house of blues. If you stay at Sax you get to visit for free. You also get to visit the private foundation room at HB, pretty neat place, make sure you book it through the concierge in advance, otherwise, they won't let you in! Just around the corner are some fantastic european style restaurants. Very good and healthy. Walk down the riverwalk and there are great steakhouses and Dick's last resort. I hope you visit, I loved it! Oh and each room has an X-box! I thought that was weird, but I thought I'd mention it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We come to Chicago a lot for our little get-aways and we usually do Priceline and we usually get the same 3-4 hotesl, so I was surprised when we were awarded Hotel Sax. $90.00 throug Priceline. Below I have listed the Pro's and Con's of our stay. Pro's: The hotel is located right in the heart of everything, shopping, dinning, sightseeing, it is next door to the House of Blues, adjacent to a bowing alley and has a nice resturant and lounge on-site. The lobby is well appointed, upscale anad classy, with a concerige . Front desk quickly upgraded our room when we complained about plaster falling from the ceiling. Our upgraded room was nice size, the bathroom was large (huge actually) and it was pretty clean. The kingsized bed was very comfortable (not the pilliows). Con's: Our first room was smaller than our guest bedroom at home. The queensize bed took up the entire room. The bathroom light was a heat lamp that glowed red - no other light in the bathroom. Directly over the bed plaster was falling from the ceiling from an old leak. The upgraded room had floor to ceiling mirrors, wood paneling and a faux alligator skin wing back chair - icky. The 1960 style dresser with the glass inlay top had visible dirt and other unidentifiable sutff underneth it.. The wallpaper had pictures on chanderliers and other wavy lines on it. The bathroom had green 1970's faux grasspaper wallpaper and floor to ceiling 1/4" cermaic titles - a heat lamp, but luckily one other small lightbulb. The hallways were very dark (poor lighting) with silver shinny wallpaper. Summary: The hotel is managable for one night or if you don't plan on spending much time in the room. I would not pay full price $150 for the two rooms that we were in.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The three of us arrived around 1030 pm to find no help in sight at the front desk. Even in front of the hotel, the employees looked like they felt they were way too cool to work there but at the same time help anyone out. After 5 minutes an attendant came out of the next door club/bar. He barely looked at us and asked for my ID and gave me a key and and room number quickly, although didn't let us know where the elevator was. When we found our room, it had one king size bed. The room was ok (bathroom looked old) and would have probably been fine, except for the fact that it was absolutely not what we needed nor booked. The reservationist confirmed to us specifically over the phone that we would have a deluxe room with 2 queen beds after we told him we no use for a king size bed (as there were 3 of us). Once we got back downstairs to the front desk, it took another 5 minutes to find the attendant. Guess where he was? Bar/club next door. When we told him that we did not reserve a king, he rudely responded that the room is what we booked. We clearly disagreed and let him know we had zero use for a king size bed and to please get us the room we requested and booked. It turns out this character was the night manager and he had zero response. After some poking, he offered a roll away bed. After more questioning on how he was going to accommodate us for their mistake, he basically gave us a rude response and tough luck attitude. We promptly told him to cancel our reservation and walked down to the Rennaisance where the front desk couldn't have been more responsive and helpful. About an hour after being in our room the manager called my cellphone to apologize and offer a suite for a rate of $99 a night. Too little too late. Perhaps it was just night management but would never go back to try it again.</p></li>

We walked in the door to a somewhat spartan lobby with crystal vases inside glass cases that are used as the front desk. The front desk staff were very friendly and customer service oriented. The Concierge Catherine was very helpful in setting up dinner reservvations for us as it was our anniversary and we wanted something upscale yet not "stuffy", Benny's Chop House was the perfect choice. (I will write a review on that). Once we had dinner reservations set we entered the elevators to our room. WE were on the 15th floor in a king deluxe. We overllooked the House of Blues (we were high above their building) and were overlooking the Chicago river and those "bee hive condo's. The room was clean, fresh, modern, large bathroom (with fantastic bath products), flat screen tv's, and honor bar. The room only lacked a in-room coffee machine (coffee was hard to find unless you were up before 0800-which coffee is served in the lobby 0600-0800) but who is up that early when your on a get-away. The hotel shares the building with Bin 32 (my favorite wine bar in Chicago--Juan the bartender is the best server I have ever had-anywhere). Crimson Bar inside the hotel, is dark adn mysterious and the progressive house music that Jason the DJ played was perfect for the environment. Travlers of all ages were in the house and once again service was top notch. Next time we go to Chicago, we will definately stay at the SAX Hotel. THe location is central to everything Chicago. 10-15 minute walk to Bloomingdales on Michigan Ave. 5-10 minute walk to the loop (Macy's/Marshall Fields/theater district) 10 minute walk to the Mechandise Mart. We travel to Chicago frequently (we live in Michigan) and we will be staying at the SAX again.</p></li>
