<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Modern and comfortable hotel in central Berlin. Make sure you ask for a room at the rear of the building, though, since the street side could be a bit noisy with all the bars around. The shower design is also unusual- there is no door between the room and the shower / sink area- just a very thin curtain. More appropriate for couples and single travellers than friends travelling together.</p></li>

You can walk through Brandenburger Tor and Reichstag within 20 minutes. The rooms were large enough for 2-3 days of visit. The bed was fit and sleep quality was good. If you had a room facing through Oranienburger Str , you can hear tram voice till late midnight.</p></li>

Free apples. Pretty and very courteous reception staff. Didnt have breakfast but can highly recommend a happy hour magic-mixtures made by Uwe - the skillful, helpful and charming Coctail-meister at the cosy lobby bar (with two internet stations for guests' use).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was very impressed with this hotel. It is in the middle of the "action" in Mitte. There were people up all night outside the hotel but it did not prevent me from sleeping. The rooms were very modern and the staff was great. The bathroom is funky with no real separation between the sink/shower and the room, but it worked for me. I would definitely stay here again as it was close to a lot of restaurants/sights.</p></li>

Our room had a total glass front with an open ensuite bathroom and a seperate WC. The spacious standard room was colourful and funky with a LCD screen and very comfortable beds. The hotel is in a great location in a hip part of East Berlin and is very central as well. Well worth a visit as reasonable in price.</p></li>

Fantastic use of space and floor to ceiling windows. It's maybe a bit too modern for grandma but maybe not. Would love to stay here again. Great cocktail bar in the lobby a bonus. Supposed included breakfast isn't anything other than a banana and piece of baguette so that is the only negative. Great coffee shop next door make up for it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's a nice hotel and right in the middle of everything. It's very modern. The shower and sink were in the room, separated by a curtain and the toilet was in a separate room. Our room looked onto the street which was hopping even at 4am. It's a little odd that anyone walking down the hall could find out if you were in the room or not (room numbers are lit in red or green) All in all, it's a very nice hotel, but I don't know if I'd stay there again.</p></li>

Like the sink and curtain wall. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast to go was not great. A icky sandwich and a cup of coffee.Oh and the location was brilant for galleries, cafes, street art, walking ect.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 2 nights during a weekend in Aug. The staff were really friendly and helpful. The Velvet Lounge bar downstairs had great cocktails at a resonable price. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. Even the view of the internal walls were decked out with lovely colours! Who needs a view outside! Though I do know if you ask for a room on the top floor the views of the city are amazing! Great price for a great location. All the bars and restaurant you can choose from just down the road!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Have just returned from a 4 day trip to Berlin. This hotel was 1st class. The rooms were really nice. We had a quite room with a conventional bathroom. It is very close to the Uban and the Sban which made it really easy to travel around. A really good place to eat was just on the corner from the Sban underground. We ate there morning and evening and the staff were great. Turn right when you leave the hotel and walk to the Sban underground. If you really want to shop you should stay near the main shopping area. The KaDaWe is like Harrods.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">- it is located in an alternative area of Berlin - Hotel also kind of strange but not in an annoying way - Breakfast very basic, according to the management they are unable to provide a better breakfast (one bagel max!) due to German law - Main annoyance was that the room phone was not working - it is a cordless phone which apparently doesn't charge unless you are in the room and electricity is on. Apparently it charges within 10 minutes but this wasn't the case for me. An employee brought a replacement phone which was just as bad. Very annoying.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have recently returned from a three night stay in Berlin at the Arcotel Velvet. We had a fantastic time and I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the city. On arrival our group was given adjacent rooms on the third floor of the hotel. Both the room and the view from the floor to ceiling windows were great. Unlike other reviewers we did not notice any noise during the night. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel is ideally located to explore Berlin. This is one of the best hotels I have stayed in and would certainly return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The arcotel velvet does what it does very well - rooms are modern, well appointed and a reasonable size. Rooms at the front of the hotel benefit from floor-to-ceiling windows over orienenburger strasse so are well worth asking for. There's no restaurant although the hotel serves an included bag lunch of cheese bagels in the bar until 10am. The velvet lounge cocktail bar is not busy, but well stocked and a nice place to unwind. In general the staff are young, knowledgable and very friendly. A great location makes this hotel a great base for exploring the east of the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Would definitely recommend. Stayed at the Arcotel for 4 days in August. The hotel location is very central, beside both U (U6 Orianburger Tor) & S Bahn (Orianenburger Str). It's on a street with loads of restaurants and bars. The hotel itself was spotless, newly and tastefully decorated. The staff were really funny, friendly and helpful. The only drawback this hotel had for us, was at the weekend, some people came back shouting and banging on doors, not sure if they were actually staying in the hotel or had slipped in. Otherwise, this is a great hotel and excellent value.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel due to its quirky presentation (glass walls overlooking the street) and its free internet availability. Was dissatisfied with the latter - couldn't get any connection on the upper floors. In addition, was asked to pay extra for the room which left a bitter after-taste. Breakfast was also OK. Staff were friendly and cheerful. Location was also good. I wouldn't be staying here again though - the shower in the room (literally) affords little privacy and so do the glass walls. I wonder what the residents in the opposite building have to put up with everyday!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 3 nights at the end of October. This hotel was great. Very modern, friendly staff and a comfortable room. Breakfast was included and, even though we only made it for one day, it was just enough to see us until lunch. Some great restaurants and bars on Oranienburger Strasse, and was good for exploring the city. Only complaint was on the last day as we were going to get our bags to leave, the key card didn't work (after numerous trips to reception). But the staff, although busy with other guests, were very friendly and helpful. Will definitely look to stay again.</p></li>

The location is very convenient, the rooms stylish and well-equiped and the staff really helpful.All major sights as well as the shopping area of East Berlin (department stores etc) are very close. We didn't try the breakfast, as the breakfast served in Oranien (some blocks away) was excellent and much cheaper. The lounge-bar is very relaxing after a busy day and the coktails served very delicious (Try "Velvet Berry"!). There is free high-speed internet next to the bar, which we often used to find restaurants, clubs etc. We would definitely book at Arcotel again!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First impressions were of a really nice hotel, in a great location, with pleasant, helpful staff. We had asked for a quiet room and were pleased to be allocated one at the back, given that the hotel is on a busy street. Unfortunately the noise from the surrounding bars and clubs kept us awake all three nights we were there, well into the early hours. One night, at 2am, it was so bad I had to take the mattress off my bed and drag it to the small corridor by the bathroom to get some respite. A great shame as otherwise the hotel is good value for money and I would have been very happy to go there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from a 3 night stay at the Acrotel Velvet and we were well and truly bowled over! We stayed in a Suite on the 7th floor which was just superb. The view was fantastic and the suite was large, spacious and made really speacial by the floor to ceiling windows. Also, if you are looking for cool shops, bars and a slightly 'edgy' feel then this hotel is in the best part of Berlin. Staff were great, giving excellent advice on what bars/clubs to go to and the check in/check out was seamless and easy (we even arrived at 10.00am and were given our room straight away). Would definitely go back...Berlin Rocks!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Reasonably priced, great location, interesting architecture, small but fun and well-designed rooms - but - the hotel needs to sort out its tedious neighbours. Constant thud-thud-thud until past midnight - I had got up early in the morning on the day of my arrival so was exhausted and needing sleep big time - despite great double-glazed windows which I closed, the thud-thud-thud was still there, permeating everything. The one thing you want from a hotel is to be able to sleep when you want to - Arcotel I'm afraid failed to deliver on this one. I like techno as much as the next guy, but not when I'm trying to sleep!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you like comfort, uniquely designed rooms and unpretentious luxury, I would highly recommend a stay at this lovely hotel. Our stay was for 5 nights, and we wished we could have stayed longer! The central location is perfect for city exploration, being close to the bohemian Mitte district, near good quality restaurants and bars. Transport links are within 1 mins walk. Staff were excellent, friendly and courteous. The cocktail lounge is a nice place to relax, and the prices arent bad. Free internet, arty films and interesting decor complete the look. I would highly recommend a visit to the galleries adjacent to the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is art deco with the bathroom in the bedroom, which is unique. There is a seperate toilet though!!! It is very near the S and U bahn and is an ideal base for exploring Berlin. The hotel is clean and the staff were helpful. There is a TV and DVD player in the room and they are a good size. although you only need to sleep in them as there is so much to do in Berlin. The street they are situated on has plenty of restaurants from all nationalities. There is a lovely pub across the road that does traditional Berlin food and an Indian further down that is very nice and extremely popular. I would definetly stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable staff who gave us excellent recommendations. Well appointed rooms, very large for the money by European standards. Highly recommended for travelers under 35 looking to explore Berlin's nightlife. Fantastic location near plenty of restaurants and nightlife, with good access to transit to explore the rest of Berlin. Street noise can be loud, so if you plan to go to bed early, request a room facing the back. The restaurant serves an ample all you can eat buffet (including champagne), but at 15 Euros per person is a pricey option, and can be easily skipped given all the great places to eat nearby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very nice hotel in central Berlin, close to underground station, plenty of cafes and restaurants around to choose from. Staff were very friendly and responded to every request. A perfect choice for weekend getaway! Panoramic windows are great, my little one loved it! Nightlife is very busy around the hotel, great for party-goers. Kunsthaus Tacheles is right next door, also plenty of other attractions within walking distance. On the downside if you are visiting by car street parking is scarce and expensive. However hotel does offer onsite parking for 18 Euro over night. Also no swimming pool/fitness center, something I expected from the 4 star hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is perfect for a city break, being walking distance from many places and with excellent public transport connections. The rooms are modern, clean and nicely lit/decorated, the reception helpful, and the bar serves a free breakfast (filled bagels, coffee & fruit) which was perfect for us to grab on our way out somewhere. The rooms at the front look out onto the street - if you are in front but high up this could be nice but on the lower floors you could feel a little exposed (the windows of the rooms are full-wall floor to ceiling, although of course there are drapes) - we didn't mind but I understand the rooms at the back are also quieter.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First off, Berlin was a revelation. We did not stay long enough, and when we do go back, we will stay here. The room rates were great, even with unfavorable exchange rates back then. They gave us a double room adjacent to, and connected by door, with our son's single room. Floor to ceiling windows, great views. The 'shades' were remote control (they started up in the middle of the night, hello!). The hotel is convenient to public transit, they have a wacky parking garage (your car is put at some level, on a carousel). Restaurants nearby, easy access to all. Convenient. Clean and very affordable. Cheapest rooms of our entire trip, and no sacrifice on quality.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in a suit which was on the 7th floor excellent room with a big window so you could see for miles over the roof tops. Some furniture getting a little bit tired like the dining table. Small Kitchenet with coffe maker and cooler. The room was clean and well taken care off about medium hard bed but we slept well. The staff which we meet was very helpfull and smiling. Well located with regrads to transport as there is a underground just around the corner about 3 km from Hfb and 20 min walk to Alexanderplatz. The street where the hotel is has good restaurants, coffeshops and on the corner is a pharmacy in addition Rewe is short walk and also various bakeries.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Decided to booked this hotel on our recent trip to Berlin based on the reviews given from Tripadvisor members and we were not disappointed. The location was just great and the hotel was new, trendy and it was a refreshing change from the standard hotel chains which we would usually stay in. The staff was friendly and efficient. We have requested for a late check out and was quickly obliged. Just outside the hotel are many restaurants. One in particular which we went to was a Cuban restaurant called QBA. The food was good, great cocktails and live Cuban music too. The place had a great atmosphere and was very reasonably priced. Both hotel and restaurant comes highly recommended !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The 4* brakfast comes in a small PAPER BAG. There is a cold sandwich inside, with cheese OR ham, a mandarine and a cereal bar. Coffee is in a paper cup as well, coffee to go... It was SOOOO DISAPPOINTING! It was written only in the SMALL LINES, in the contract. Nothing mentioned in the headline (breakfast included) So, please DON'T BE DECEIVE by them, they don't have a 4* breakfast, they should be ashamed from what they offer. Anyway, staff was nice and room was good. It would be MUCH BETTER NOT to offer any breakfast! Really! Because they don't even have a kitchen. Below check the picture of the 4* breakfast.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel is in a great location, with trams and U-bahn basically on your doorstep. The staff were very friendly, and rooms were stylishly decorated with flatscreen TV and CD/DVD player. Having the bath and sink in an open plan type way was different (in a good way) and toilet was separately enclosed. Floor to ceiling window provided great view. I was slightly concerned, reading the other reviews, about the prostitutes who were around, but don't be, as they don't bother you (maybe if you were a single or group of males you may get their attention) but it really just adds to the uniqueness of Berlin. We had 3 nights in Berlin, which wasn't really enough and will go back (and stay at this hotel).</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Two couples spent 3 nights at the Velvet in late November. It's unique, interesting, and comfortable. Felt special staying there. Good location with public transportation at the door. Lots of nice restaurants and bars in the area--all sorts of ethnic restaurants as well as a variety of traditional German places. Easy walk to the Museum Island and many other sights. Staff members were very helpful to us in everything from good dining recommendations, to providing directions and travel tips, to printing out our airline bording passes for us the night before our flight home. We aren't big breakfast eaters, so we got our breakfasts at a little place next door that had pastries, cereal, coffee, etc.</p></li>

Fantastic location, walking distance to great shopping, museums, bars and all kinds of restaurants right on our doorstep. We didn't eat at the Austrian restaurant downstairs, a bit pricey especially since we're veg., but many vegetarian options (falafels, italian, asian) just steps from the hotel. We stayed in a suite on the top floor of the hotel. Very reasonably priced, spacious and clean. Great views of the Berlin rooftops out our front windows and funky views of the graffiti clad club out our back door. Hotel staff was very pleasan, helpful and unpretentious. Definitely one of our best hotel experiences ever.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">An interesting hotel....but heck its Germany..! We visited Berlin in mid Jan 07 and stayed at the Arcotel Velvet. After a very warm welcome - and some efficient service before hand (changing a booking) we entered our room. For those of a traditional disposition - be warned - there are condom packs and an open bathroom (the loo is enclosed!). The room design worked well - the beds comfortable and the room service efficient. I can't comment on the breakfast or bar, but the restaurant next door (where breakfast is hosted) is excellent. This hotel is very well situated for the main rail station (5 Euro cab fare) and for both the U Bahn and S Bahn. Not my usual choice of hotel - but you know what - I would recommend and stay again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect little modern hotel with good service, good prices and adequate furnishings (but no toiletries), well located just a couple blocks into east berlin. Everything you need for a very low price. Impeccably clean, welcoming, free wifi in the bar which works on 1st floor rooms, stiff drinks at bar, staff ready to help w/ anything you need, casual informal modern atmosphere. Underground (1 stop to main station) and streetcar right across the street. You can walk to main train about 10 min on Berlin's main Friederichstrasse where you also get the main shopping, nightlife. The hotel area has very busy eclectic dining and nightlife - there is some street noise at closing time but it didn't hinder our sleep. I recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My friend and I stayed here last weekend and loved the hotel. Arcotel is in the perfect location - walking distance to the tourist sights and shops, and right on the main street for bars and restaurants, so no need to walk far or use public transport at night. 30 seconds walk to the U-Bahn if you don't enjoy walking. The rooms were lovely, comfortable bed, good facilities and very clean. Mini bar was overpriced though but aren't they always! The staff were friendly although our rooms weren't ready when we arrived mid afternoon. Didn't use the restaurant or the bar - far more interesting/cheap places and a great deal of variety as you make your way up the street. Have dinner and cocktails in the Singapore restaurant across the road.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you want to be in the middle of everything, the best sights in walking distance, if you like to go out at night and like comfort and style - thats your best choice! The hotel at Oranienburger Strasse is surrounded by bars, restaurants, the next tube 50 mtrs. From the next big Trainstation Friedrichstrasse just 7 min walk. The hotelstaff gave us a warm welcome, was helpful and friendly. We had a clean, stylish room with open bathroom (toilette is separate), a comfortable bed and a window to the oranienburger Strasse from ceiling to floor. The only thing I did'nt like was the loud discomusic i could here (only on weekends) at night in our room. But that disturbed only me, my husband slept like a baby. So I think it depends how you sleep.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">While i would take on board the last review and the issue of overcharging this hotel still represents superb value for money given the location and the excellent rooms. I have stayed here on numerous occassions over the last two years and have always found the service excellent and the value for money exceptional. There are numerous cafes/restaurants in the area, so the breakfast option is worth skipping, unless you are in a rush. The suites are extremely spacious with fabulous views and if you can get a similar room in London, Edinborough or Paris for less than twice the price i would be surprised. All in all a great choice for location, room and service - any shortcomings of the bar and breakfast are more than compensated for by the myriad of choice on the hotel doorstep.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked the hotel on the strength of the reviews on this site and was not in the least disappointed. The staff seem to take a great pride in the hotel and seem genuinely concerned that guests are happy. The hotel could not be better situated as it is within easy walking distance of most of the major sights and public transport is on your doorstep. A wide range of restaurants is beside the hotel. Berlin is a great city with lots to see and do, and we have found on our two visits that people are very helpful and friendly. The room is laid out in a 'fun' way with an open shower area. One big disappointment was the lack of tea/coffee making facilities. Surely this would be very cheap to provide! I am looking forward to our next visit to Berlin and will hopefully be staying at the Arcotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Arcotel Velvet in March 2004, for 4 nights. I found it on a website (never had heard of it before), and i must say the real thing was even better than the images on the internet. The location is fabulous (within walking distance to all major sites) and very vivid, but not too noisy. The entire building is decorated in a modern, yet friendly way. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the highlight are the huge windows (ceiling to floor) that have a great view over Oranienburger Strasse. The personnel is very friendly and helpful, and they were willing to recommend us great restaurants and bars. And all that for 110euros per night. In general, i would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a stylish and friendly central hotel, at a reasonable price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved the Arcotel Velvet -- the design theme was consistent throughout the hotel and incredibly inspiring. The room was large, spacious, and unique -- the sound system was perfect for listening to newly-bought CDs from Dussmann's -- the bathroom was a bit odd, since it converted into a full shower. We weren't sure if this was a design move or if we were in a disability-focused room. The bar has expensive but hand-crafted drinks and free internet. The area was fantastic and alive -- lots of Indian and Singapore food, youth, Vegas-like prostitutes (the other reviews are spot on...they're there but not pushy or annoying...more funny) and nearby shopping. If traveling to the hotel via public transport, take the U-bahn to Orianenburger Tor...it is much closer and convenient than the S-bahn to Orianenburger Strasse.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I took my partner to Berlin as a birthday surprise. The hotel was in a great location, just across the road from the U-Bahn, and a pleasant walk to Freidrichstr Station, Unter den Linden and Hackescher Markt. Mitte is in my opinion the best part of Berlin to stay - as the name suggests, it is the centre of the city. The staff were all friendly and helpful and the room as nice as it appeared on the web - well built unlike some "ikea" hotels which dominate this area of the travel market. We stayed in the front, so had fantastic ceiling to floor windows, overlooking Orienburgstr. One downer, we could hear trams when lying in bed at night. Finally, the design is great, but the sink and bath in the bedroom ( the toilet had a room of its own) may not be for everyone - I liked it, I could watch tv whilst bathing ! Enjoy</p></li>

The floor to ceiling glass wall overlooking Oranienburger Strasse gave a birds eye view of the restaurants and evening strollers. The atmosphere was terrific The bathroom being part of the bedroom.( separated by a transparent curtain ) was differerent but never a problem. The Reception Staff were very helpfull and informative as was the Turkish taxi driver from Schonefeld airport ( fare 30/35 Eur.)

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic hotel. It's worth getting a fourth floor upwards room. Really comfortable and clean and in a great location on Oranienburger Strasse. Don't let let the 'ladies of the evening' that frequent the neighbourhood put you off - it adds to it somehow! I loved the decor in the hotel though it may not be to everybody's taste. The windows (floor to ceiling) look out right on to the street - you can't hear a thing though it's very atmospheric. It's also right beside Tacheles which used to be an artist's squat - it now houses artists' studios, an art hosue cinema and a couple of bars with a huge beer garden. Completely run down but amazing and full of character. Lots of great graffiti too. Can't recommend it highly enough. Not for families though. A great base for exploring Mitte and would recommend for young(ish!) couples.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lively neighborhood within walking distance to lots of interesting Berlin sites, or hop on the public transit at the front door -- or even better, rent a bike from the hotel and zip around this fascinating bike-friendly city (OK, the bike rental is more expensive than the place around the corner, but you can't beat the convenience). Comfortable beds (although the mini-pillows were kind of odd -- adequate, but odd); good shower (although the funny tub/shower design resulted in a fair amount of water on the floor, but nothing unmanageable). What we liked the best: the outstanding bar tender, who really knows his cocktails and the interesting ingredients at his disposal. Don't bother springing for the breakfast as there is a great espresso place right next door with free wifi and really nice people. I would definitely return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location for this hotel. Close to U-bahn and walking distance to Friedrichstraße. A lot of cafés and restaurants in the area. The hotel was nice and clean with an unusual room layout with big windows. This could be negative if you have a room on the first 2 floors. Small mini bar but not much to choose from. I was surprised that there where not Wi-Fi in our room. The staff ask me to try the lounge bar hot spot which did not work unless i got out from the room. The beds where quite hard so be aware if you are used to soft beds. A nice thing was that the room had a bathtub. I´m not sure i think this hotel is worth the 4 stars. There might be better alternatives for the same price. Pros: Good location, bathtub, nice and clean and friendly staff. Cons: A little bit to cold in the room. Quite hard beds. No Wi-Fi in our room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from a week at the Hotel Velvet and was very pleased. We booked the suite on the 7th floor and felt we got great value for the money. Hotel Velvet is located basically at the corner of Orianburg Strasse and Fredrich Strasse. It's a 15 minute walk (max) to Museum Island or 15 minutes to Under Den Linden. If you don’t want to walk, there is an S Bahn stop 1 block away and the tram is either right in front of the hotel or a 2 block walk, depending on which direction you are headed in. Lots of restaurants and bars on Orianburg Strasse; Hackesher Hof is just a tram stop away and has even more places to eat and drink. Buffet breakfast was very good, service was very good as well. Orianburg Strasse is a Berlin night hotspot so expect to hear some street noise through the double glazed windows. TV had 30+ channels including CNN International and BBC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Was in Berlin from 7 to 10 December and being my first trip to Germany, I was a little worried initially as I don't speak German and I wasn't sure if I could get to the hotel on my own. Luckily this hotel was easy to find, being close to both the tram and Oranienburger Tor U-bahn station. The service staff who attended to me were also very friendly and helpful, pointing out the various transport options to the tourist sites I intended to visit in fluent English. The room I was allocated faced the rear courtyard and was quiet throughout my stay. It was of decent size and had a clean, modern design. The bed was comfortable although the pillow was a tad too small for me. Also, I missed having an internet connection and wished that the hotel had WiFi connections. On the whole, I enjoyed my stay here very much and would consider staying here again the next time I visit Berlin.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Arrived in a deluge of rain and was a little disappointed to have a room overlooking a courtyard rather than the Oranienburger Strasse. However, it was a decent room. Satellite TV/DVD player and great furnishings including an enormous wet room/shower albeit in the middle of the room. But hey thats why you stay here- for something different! In a lively area of town and brilliant for getting around. We did it all on foot bar the bus TXL to and from the airport. The hotel is placed at the top end of the the street near Oranienburger Tor and is very very close to the U Bahn. Didnt bother with a 15 Euro breakfast but went down Friedrich Strasse (or something like that!!) and picked up a coffee, cake and roll for undfer 7 Euro for the 2 of us. There is a great pizzeria next to the hotel with enormous pizzas at great value. If I go again I would definitely stay in this area of Berlin.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent hours researching this Hotel and chose it due to the great location with lots of bars and restaurants nearby. Although we booked it 5 months in advance, when we arrived at the Hotel on Fri 9th Feb, we were informed by the Duty Manager that there were no rooms, as due to an internet error the Hotel had been over-booked. We had booked a Superior room, as it was our anniversary, and was furious when we were told they were taking us by taxi to another Hotel about 10 mins drive away and we would have to go back the next day!. The other Hotel was OK, but we didn't get a Superior room and there were no bars or restaurants nearby. The next day we returned to the Velvet and kicked up a fuss and they did book us into a Suite for the next 2 nights with breakfast included. The Suites are fantastic and we did have a great time in Berlin, however a very shaky start to a weekend away!!.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Arcotel Velvet for a long weekend at the end of July 2005. The hotel is very informal, it has a great bar (very chilled out), the rooms are very good (but ask for a street facing room, ours just overlooked a back courtyard). The integral bathroom works really well, there is a separate wc and the shower room & sink area is curtained off. The transport systems are good but many of Berlin's high spots are within walking distance of the hotel (with flat shoes!). There are a lot of art galleries in the area which are very interesting. On the last night we found a great spanish restaurant which served fresh, tasty food at very cheap prices plus nice wines by the glass and good beer. It is called Ruz, in Augustrase 63, telephone 28 09 77 88 (no need to book), about 5 minutes from the hotel. We will stay in the Arcotel nexttime we visit Berlin.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from a two night stay at this hotel and couldn't fault it. I didn't expect the rooms to be as lovely as they were on the website but they didn't let me down. Clean, comfortable and stylish with amazing windows (try and get a front view). The staff were extremely helpful and friendly, nothing was too much trouble. Particular praise for the hotel bar ...

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After searching high and low for a hotel in Berlin Mitte I chose the Velvet based on the reviews it had gotten. This hotel in bang in the middle and accessile to all areas. Its spotless and the bar when you come though to the lobby does great cocktails. Be warned they are very expensive. Our room was on the 4th Floor and was a deluxe but to be honest i do not think there is much of a difference only ours overlooked some makeshift courtyard out the back. This was recommendxed to me as the front can be very noisy. All rooms seem to have the same decor and layout. The bathroom is separated from the room by curtain. I really like this idea it feels less cramped. This hotel is suited to anyone who is in berlin for a weekend break and wants to have easy access to all areas. The staff are great and the breakfast was fantastic. I would have no complaints whatsoever with this hotel only 2 vodkas with 2 mixers cost €17.30 at the bar !!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my 2nd visit to Berlin and this hotel and it was just as good this time around! The only difference was that I was given a room at the front of the hotel which was a lot bigger and miore spacious. I had also made a few special requests when I booked the hotel and all of them had been taken into account. This hotel is in a perfect location (good for nightlife and central to all the sights) and excellent value for money. If you get chance, try the Lutter and Wegner restaurant next door (there is a door through from the hotel into the restaurant) I never ate there last time but wish I had because the food is delicious. Although slightly more expensive that the other restaurants in the area, I would definately recommend it. The Oranien cafe/bar down the road from the hotel also offers excellent value for money and very tasty breakfasts!! Should I ever visit Berlin again, will still not hesitate to stay at the Arcotel Velvet!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The first impression great rooms, but as time goes on not very well thought out from a function point of view. The Shower has a tap sticking into it at knee level ( the tap for the bath) and every time you turn you hit and bruse your legs. The TV great to get a plamsa tv but I asume most people look at it from the bed, it's not facing the bed, to swithc channel or control you have to get out of bed!! The DVD good toutch again but it's completly uncolotrolabe fromt he bed again by it's position . I found that it was poor value for money, you pay arround 110 euro a night but EVERYTHING is extra, with plasma tv and dvd player and hot lamp in bathroom with electrical blinds it would have been nice to have had a coffee maker!!! or free wirless internet or free breakfast!! I stayed in a hotel in berlin a week before at half the price including breakfast and with internet connection at free, and much friendlier staff ( the Comfort Auberge)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed here several times. This is one of the best designed hotels that I have stayed in anywhere in the world at any price. To top it off he price is not bad either. If you want to splurge the suites are great, the double rooms are not bad either. I would only change the height of the bathtub (it is too tall to get in and out of easily). The location is great with easy access to transportation. Unfortunately this is where the good ends and the bad begins. This is a hotel designed to represent the 21st Century but has few of those features. Wifi only in lobby and does not work well. Hot portion of the breakfast buffet is generally cold after 9 even though they serve till 11. On a previous trip they ruined a new jumper (sweater) just bought at Etro down the street and after being contacted the management referred me to Austria to their corporate offices who said that they would check into my claim and get back to me. I am still waiting.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I enjoyed a 3 night city break in Berlin in December, staying at the Arcotel Velvet. We were very please with our choice and thought it was great value for money. The hotel was in an excellent location with the tram and UBahn (Oranienburger Tor) just outside/next street. The staff were very friendly and helpful and gave us an information pack on arrival. The hotel was very comfortable and stylish with a modern design and fantastic floor to ceiling windows. 2 PCs were in the bar where guests can access the internet free of charge. The breakfast buffet was very generous. The central location of the hotel allowed us to walk into the city centre, but we took the UBahn back after we were exhasuted from a full days sightseeing. Airport transfer: We took the SBahn to and from Schonefield Airport, it took about 1hour with 1 change (Route: UBahn Orienburger Tor to Friedrichstrasse, then changed to SBahn for Schonefield changing at Ostkreuz)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel for 4 days late December and the hotel was excellent. I agree with other TA reviewers in respect of quiet rooms at the rear (courtyard) otherwise you are in full view of all the bars opposite and on the main street. There are lots of bars and restraunts on Oranienburger Strass and also further on is Hackerscher Market and Alexanderplatz which both have good atmosphere at this time of year.The hotel is well located and in walking distance of many of the tourist attractions. It is also 100 metres away from the underground train system. You can buy a ticket for one day for up to 5 people, which covers train, bus and trams that will cover many of the tourist attractions for 15 euros, which I thought was great value. The hotel bar did not seem to be in use at night but this was no problem as you could sit outside at the bars opposite under the heaters and watch the world go by. I would certainly recommend this hotel for a long weekend or short stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Velvet over New Year 08/09 and it cost £70 per night, booking with the hotel's website. Finding the hotel was very easy - the nearest S-Bahn station is a very short walk away. Upon arrival I was impressed at the modern look and feel of the Velvet and the reception was pleasing. We were allocated a street facing room on the sixth floor so had the benefit of a floor to ceiling window - the views are great! I was a little disappointed with the room - the quality was excellent - but our bed was nothing more than a pull out sofa type and our room was 601.1 which had an adjoining door so I suspect that when the hotel isn't full, they treat our room as 601's sitting area to make 601 a Suite-type room. We also didn't experience the middle-of-room shower! Having said the above, it is a nice hotel and I wouldn't hesitate to return. Wireless Internet is free in public areas and Cabled Internet is chargeable in the room - I think it's 12 Euro a day. We didn't eat in the hotel at all, so I cannot comment on catering standards.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This has to be one of the nicest hotels we've stayed in. It is a fairly new hotel which is located in a very lively area on the east side. The street is filled with restaurants and bars and lots of people. It is very close to the U-bahn as well. The rooms are very spacious and decorated in an arty & modern way and was also very clean. The walk-in shower is huge - one of the biggest hotel showers I've even seen, and something we missed when we stayed at other places on our trip! We faced the back of the hotel so it was pretty quiet. Someone mentioned the prostitutes on the street - it definitely didn't come across as a sleazy neighbourhood at all, and these girls all look like models and are pretty harmless. One thing we didn't like is that when we put the do not disturb sign on the door, our room got cleaned anyway. I think this might be due the fact that we weren't in the room (as you have an electronic key you have to have to use the facilities and it indicates when you are there or not, but that's not big deal). We would definitely stay in this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the hotel for 7 nights in August. All staff were very friendly. The room was immaculate and decorated in a modern yet comfortable style. Rooms have air conditioning and external blackout blinds were good touches. The room had a large shower with a glass door which was within a curtained room, which also housed a large sink. The toilet was in a separate room from the bedroom and shower area. At first I thought having the shower in the main room would lack privacy, but actually it was fine. The hotel is located on a street with a lot of excellent bars and restaurants. The U and S bahn stops are only 1 minute walk from the hotel and the tram stops directly oppsite the hotel. The hotel is in an excellent location for visiting many of the sights Berlin has to offer. The hotel is also secure with a digital safe in the room and to get access to the rooms you have to use your room card to activate the lift. Although I should mention that this is a very safe and friendly are. I would definately recommend this hotel and I am in fact planning on booking another holiday here soon!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel – very modern, clean and comfortable, and with some funky, quirky touches that make it worthy of its fab East Berlin location. We stayed in a double on the fourth floor facing the street – it’s not a beautiful view, but it is colourful and the windows are great. It’s worth requesting to be high up in the hotel when you make a reservation. The bed was very, very comfortable, although the two single duvets were a little odd (we got used to them eventually). The room was much quieter than expected, the only noise being the hum of the air conditioning / heating. The carpet is a bit ugly – but this is the only thing I’d change. The staff were lovely and helpful, and were happy to make recommendations for restaurants, etc. The surrounding area is great for eating and drinking – we particularly like the pub outside the S-Bahn station on Oranienburger Strasse which serves hundreds of beers and some very tasty snacks and meals (it begins with A …). Overall, a fantastic hotel for the price (we paid 95 euros a night) and I will definitely stay there again when I return to Berlin.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this place last minute before heading to Berlin for my first time. All I knew is that it had a good review in Lonely Planet and was in the "moderate" price range. The sentence in Lonely Planet wasn't even the tip of the iceberg - this place was FANTASTIC! First of all, it's very difficult to find a room in Berlin for 3 people. Not only did Velvet offer such a thing, they upgraded us to a Junior Suite. We had plenty of space, a kitchenette, bathrobes and even slippers. The rooms are very clean and ultra trendy, yet warm and comfortable. The front desk staff were also very nice (and fluent in English). Another major perk - the hotel is in the middle of EVERYTHING. Within a 15-20 minute walk, you can be at the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, the New Synagogue, the Berlin Cathedral/Museum Island, and more. The subway isn't even a block away! I'd also like to note that on the original reservation, they had wanted to charge an extra 30 Euro per night for the third person. However, when I checked out, they did not include the charge. I don't however think words can do justice for this review. Check out my photos...</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned the beginning of December from my first visit to Berlin and found that this 4 star hotel was the perfect location for my 8 day stay. I loved every minute of my trip to Berlin! The hotel is located just around the corner from the Oranienburger Tor U-Bahn station on Friedrichstrasse. That makes it very easy to get from Tegel Airport to the hotel. Since I was traveling by myself I chose a budget room on the third floor (If you like it quiet I recommend a room facing the rear courtyard). The room was immaculate and stayed that way throughout my stay. If you plan to spend a lot of time in your room you might want to upgrade. The hotel staff were all fluent in English and always ready to help in any way. They even helped me with my lousy German. Instead of the breakfast offered in the hotel I elected to eat next door at the Ambulanz Cafe, a real hangout for young Germans. The staff at the Cafe is also fluent in English and for a light breakfast you can't beat it. Across the street from the hotel is the Mirchi restaurant. It serves excellent Singapore and Indo-Thai food at a reasonable cost. This is a hotel and a city that I would definitely return to visit.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Myself and business colleagues have previous stayed at the hotel as it is fairly close to one of our clients, and it is reasonably priced. Our recent experience though was pretty terrible. For a start, they allocated me to a smoking room when I'm a non-smoker; the room absolutely stank of cigarettes, yet they were unprepared to move me to another room. The reason? "We're fully booked". Funny that, because when I was later sat in the bar at least 30 more people checked in. In other words, they couldn't be bothered, which seems to be a personality trait required to work at this hotel. The rooms they assigned to my colleagues were equally bad - one ended up on a sofa bed in a room that was clearly part of a suite but had just been locked off to create an available room, another ended up in a room that seemed to be used as a meeting room and just happened to have an adjoining bedroom. I particularly liked my overnight entertainment, some kind of vermin scratching in the roof space above my bathroom. Nice touch. As a company we won't be using this hotel again, that's for sure. Just because you're reasonably cheap doesn't mean you can cut corners when it comes to customer satisfaction.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel after reading reviews and was not disappointed.Stayed for 3 nights,asked for a room at the front,view of the Oranienburg Strafze,which we got. Check in was easy,very helpful and polite staff,all spoke English well.Rooms were smart,very clean,and the open plan bathroom/shower set up was great.Flatscreen TV,DVD,CD included,plus A/con. The full drop windows at the front were very revealing,so care should be taken when drawing the curtains,otherwise the whole street will see you in all your glory ! Paid £270 for 3 nights,booked with Venere,com. Breakfast was buffet style,with a good selection,cost 12 euro's per person.We did not have this with our room booking and found lots of nice cafes in the surrounding area that were much cheaper,although we did have breakfast on the Sunday for convenience. The hotel bar was nice but a bit expensive for my liking,8 + euros for a basic cocktail,but it did not stop us enjoying a night cap or two. The hotel is located in Mitte and very handy for the tourist attractions,Reichstag,TV Tower,River Spee etc.,with trams running right past the doors of the hotel. All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a reasonable hotel in a good location</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Once again Trip Advisor helped us pick this hotel. Overall it did what we wanted, a modern boutique style hotel in Berlin at a reasonable price. The bathrooms were a little strange being part of the room separated by a net curtain, (so go with someone you are friendly with..) The bed was comfortable. FYI - the in room DVD player is hidden in the furniutre and the Infra Red could not see the front of the DYD player.. - hence you have to get out of bed to switch it off / change scenes / use the menu! Location is fine, about 20 minute walk to the Brandenburg gate. There are lots of restaurants in the area. We were there during the transport strike and got round everywhere by mainly our feet and the odd taxi and everything was easily reached which we wanted to do. Only bizarre thing is the internet access. In the rooms it is with a wire and wireless in the lobby. If you want a 24 hour pass, you have to decide on the wire or the wireless, so, its not possible to switch between the two locations (sometimes useful when my fionce wants to sleep in the morning. and I have insomnia....). However, this was quite easily solved by finding the coffeee shop next door (walk out of the hotel and turn left) which has free WIFI, power sockets and a great cappuccino.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Arcotel Velvet -- great location, but enough problems to irritate”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed three nights in a Velvet suite in this Arcotel property in Mitte during July 2006. We paid 210 euros for the first two nights and 310 for the final night (which was the day before the World Cup final in Berlin, hence the price increase) booked on the arcotel web site. Breakfast was an additional 15 euros per person each. The suites are on the top floors and have floor to ceiling windows with great rooftop views over Mitte. Some of those windows look out onto one of Berlin's (in)famous beach clubs with trucked-in sand and lots of loud music. External blinds were in place, apparently to shield the room from the noise; our blinds didn't work initially and, when fixed, didn't shield much. We needed ear plugs to sleep. The air conditioning only worked in the bedroom; the living room part of the suite didn't have any vents, so it stayed quite hot throughout our stay, almost to the point of unusability. There is a little kitchenette from Ikea, but no real way to prepare anything except ice cubes and coffee; don't expect to use these suites like an apartment-hotel. For all the space in the suite, the bathroom was too small. Even at 210 euros, we don't think we got much value for money as we couldn't comfortably use the entire suite. Unlikely we will return to the Arcotel Velvet.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a great hotel in a fun artsy area of the city. We stayed 4 nights at the Acrotel Velvet during our 3 week trip the Eastern and Central Europe. The Acrotel Velvet is right around the corner from the U-Bahn underground subway (U Oranienburger Tor Stop) and right across the street from the tram stop. We used the highly efficient and easy Berlin BVD Public Transit System to get to the hotel from the airport to get to the train station as we were leaving. There are dozens of restaurants in the immediate proximately to the hotel (five minutes or less walk) and dozens more within a a twenty minute walk in almost any direction. We had great food and good service everywhere we went in Berlin. We found Berlin to be an amazing and welcoming city with incredible history and culture and would be happy to spend more time there. The Acrotel Velvet was a perfect home base location for our daytime sightseeing and evening dining and nightlife. We walked most of the time and also used the U-Bahn and tram to get around with the Berlin Welcome Card which also gave us discounts at some attractions. The hotel public areas and our room was was very modern and nicely decorated. We received excellent service from the desk staff and the bar staff. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Berlin.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel because of its unique rooms and great location and were not disappointed. The hotel is in a great location with lots of restaurants and really great shops nearby - no chains in sight!! The other great benefit of this place was its proximity to the main sights and public transport. Many reviews have commented on the fact that the bathroom is not walled off from the room but I loved it - it's something different from the stock standard hotel room!! There is a curtain which acts as a wall, and in our room, the shower was in a corner so I couldn't see my hubby having a shower anyway. The toilet is completely separated which is the most important issue - after all, that would be way too much information!!! The welcome pack with information on Berlin was really handy and very welcoming. One thing I did find a little unusual was that the toiletries weren't replenished on a daily basis - not sure why but it didn't bother us as we'd collected more than enough little shampoos and soaps on our travels to last a long time! Free internet access was great as well to check your emails. My only word of advice is not to bother with the bar downstairs - we found that drinks were pretty cheap in Berlin with lots of choice, but the Arcotel's drink prices were not competitive, so we gave the bar a miss.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First impressions were excellent and the check-in was smooth and welcoming. The room design really creates more space with an open bathroom area but still retains the private toilet as there are things a loving couple shouldn't share! I travelled with my girlfriend to see in the New Year in style, but unfortunately despite getting decently intoxicated and stumbling home around 3am, we were kept up until at least 6 by the club next door and fireworks down the street. Not entirely the hotel's problem, but you do pay a price for floor-to-ceiling glass! Oh, and did I mention the fire alarm went off at 9am New Years Day and none of the staff seemed to have a clue what was going on? I reckon only 10 guests bothered to leave their rooms... My only other minor complaint was that the beds weren't that comfortable, but maybe we're just spoilt at home... As for the rest of the hotel, the bar was fantastic if not a bit on the stuffy side of cool. Great cocktails though! Didn't make it to breakfast, but it looked excellent and the variety of restaurants and bars nearby is fantastic. Definitely recommend QBA! To sum it up, great place to go and have a fun mini-break in this amazing historic city, the hotel is in a great location for getting to all the sights. Just don't stay in the Velvet if you want to completely relax!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here for a weekend and we really liked it.Room was extremely clean and we actually got what we requested - one that was far away from the elevator shaft - which is rare. We got a room facing the street at the front of the hotel but weren't bothered by noise at all. We struggled to get the blinds closed completely but given that we were in Berlin over a grey, wintery weekend there was no problem with light. Really liked the open plan bathroom, although my husband noticed that the shower was prone to sudden short, sharp increases in temperature - he tends to take hotter showers than I do, so beware of that if you're partial to parboiling yourself too. We took breakfast in the hotel each day - no doubt we could have found cheaper options in one of the cafes outside, but we noticed that most of these came with the cold meats and cheese that characterise German breakfasts which we don't eat, so taking advantage of the hotel buffet each morning was a much better option for us. You have the option to help yourself to champagne too if boozing at breakfast is your thing. Our only gripes with the hotel was that we had two small single duvets rather than one large one and the pillows were so flat and tiny that we woke up with sore necks - my husband's remained painful for a week afterwards. However, the receptionist took the time to ask us about this when we checked out which I thought was good. Watch out for the hotel bar prices - beers here were 6 euro compared to 3 euro outside. Overall I would recommend this place and stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Arcotel in September 2007 and couldn't have picked a better hotel if we'd tried. We booked a suite (more of an apartment) on the top floor, which was great value compared to other cities. The suite was spotlessly clean, had 4 rooms with great views and a very comfy bed. We didn't have the breakfast, as we had read it was very expensive, but there was no shortage of places to eat on Oranienburger Strasse, so no problem there. Also, don't get too concerned about the 'Working Girl's', they don't bother anyone (who doesn't want to be). Also, the post atomic looking hippy centre (I can't remember the name sorry), is definatly worth a look. We were initially put off but went in on our last night and realised we'd almost missed out on a bit of gem. Myself and my partner are in our thirties, so were aprehensive about the hotel and area possibly being too young for us. But on the contry, we found it to be a bit of something for everyone. The only bad point I can think of is on occasion the staff, while friendly, were lacking in customer service experience. When we were leaving, we were not informed that our cab had arrived (even though they booked it), eventually the cab driver asked us while sat in reception if we were his customer (luckily my German is good). Also, whenever we went to the bar, the barman was always trying to push us to buy cocktails, when the majority of the time, all we wanted was a beer. But these were very minor gripes compared to the overall experience, which was very enjoyable. I definately recommend the Arcotel Velvet and Berlin, a great hotel and fantastic city!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Manhattan in Mitte!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I looked at the reviews when I was planning my trip (6 months ahead) and booked so was lucky to get the 7th floor suites - with huge windows on either side - over Easter. (I note that the reviews are still as complimentary). For the price these rooms are superb - you would probably pay 3 or 4 times the price in New York for a similar penthouse feel. This set the tone off superbly as this is the happening and very cosmopolitan part of the City. Having not had too many expectations of Berlin it was a great break and prices in general are surprisingly reasonable considering it is a European Capital. The hotel is surrounded by bars and restaurants of every nationality and interestingly a whole plethora of cocktail bars. Trendy but inclusive - not elitist. This is particularly good if you are sightseeing over a weekend - as you can come back to the hotel after a full day, relax and then go out - everything is on the doorstep without having to worry about taxis/public transport. The hotel is within walking distance of most of the interesting sights and it's a vibrant atmosphere with the feeling of creativity and a generally positive mood. Don't forget to bring DVD's and CD's as you can play them in your room. The hotel has a link to a dvd store which is useful - they return them for you. If you want to get an insight into what Berlin was like around the time of the wall coming down (and you have time) rent Goodbye to Lenin (it's an amusing film). If you enjoy food and drink Berlin is surprisingly a good choice (dispelling the myths of endless Wurst and potatoes!). I think we would have had a completely different experience of Berlin had we not stayed in this area and particularly in this hotel- akin to staying in the meatpacking district in New York.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good Location, Snazzy Design - would stay again”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were very happy with our choice of the Arcotel Velvet - largely because for us location is very important. We expected the sights in Berlin would be very spread out - and wanted close access to the Metro, even though normally we'd walk everywhere. The hotel is literally around the corner from Oranienburger Tor metro stop, and it did prove invaluable. The area itself has lots of bars and restaurants - and to find somewhere good, and not hugely expensive we walked no more than about 10-5 minutes. We had good food at Sophien'eck (German), La Oliva (Italian), Mirchi (Curry), Schwarzwaldstuben (German) and Good Time (Thai). The room was a decent size - well equipped, funky design, large shower area. The only gripe I had was that I found the bed hard and I found it quite uncomfortable. We also had to ask for extra pillows as they were not great. An unexpected surprise was that breakfast is inlcuded in any price paid (we'd assumed we were room only). Now, breakfast wasn't amazing - but as far as we were concerned a bonus extra - and the rolls, cheese, pate, fruit, yoghurt, juice, tea and coffee were all fine. A final point on the 'Berlin Card.' We quibbled as to whether to get this or not - at 34 Euros for 5 days / all zones it wasn't cheap. However, if you are going to use it to get to and from the airport - that covers 5 Euro, you only then need to use the metro/tram/bus 4 times a day to make it worth it. Add in the fact that if you buy the ABC zones one you can get to Potsdam (we'd recommend) and that it gets you discount into various attractions it was worth it. We think we probably just got our money's worth - but beyond this, in a city where you WILL use public transport it was so easy to never need change, wait at the machine, validate tickets.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Incredible apartments in the bohemian part of Berlin”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I stayed at the Arcotle Velvet last August and thoroughly recommend it. We stayed in one of the "suites" - basically a two room apartment at the top of the hotel that was bigger than our London flat! And the price was very reasonable, too. The main view was along Oranienburgerstrasse, with a communal balcony at the back, giving views of the Fernshenturm and the Berliner Dome. A good sized bathroom, lounge area, two TVs and DVD players (!), kitchen area and a well-stocked mini-bar made this a very pleasant stay. Presumably the smaller rooms don't have all these features, but if you're there for a long weekend or a special occasion, you should treat yourself to the suite. There's potentially a problem if you're a family - the street has a busy nightlife and the other end of Oranienburgerstrasse towards Alexanderplatz can be a bit sleazy, but we were up for the arty, bohemian experience and loved it. In the summer there was a large outdoor bar area across the back of the hotel that was quite noisy, but I for one enjoyed listening to the music and watching the film shows from the comfort of our balcony - but beware if you want a quiet night's sleep! There is an art / bar building adjacent to the hotel which may put some people off, but it made this trip into the former East Berlin all the more fascinating. There are a couple of bars / food stalls opposite and a McDonalds and Spar shop on the corner for all your needs. Also, an Irish pub around the corner on Friedrichstrasse for the ex-pats. In brief - a funky young hotel with an excellent restaurant adjacent (where breakfast is served) and an extremely cool cocktail bar in reception. Staff were so friendly and helpful, everything was perfect for our stay. This hotel made me love Berlin even more...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Arcotel Velvet is in the perfect position right in the middle of the central district, Mitte. There are a wide range of restaurants and bars within a few minutes walk and it's conveniently placed a couple of minutes from a U-Bahn for easy access to everywhere you will want to visit. The hotel staff were all friendly and helpful, from the receptionists to the bar staff and the maids. The room was on the first floor facing the street and could possibly be a little noisy for some, but we had no trouble sleeping. The windows do come right down to floor level though, so you may want to close your curtains as there is a restaurant directly across the street! Although the toilet is separate, the bath/shower and sink area is only partly screened from the bedroom by a sheer curtain - we didn't have any issue with this, but it's something to bear in mind if you are travelling with a friend rather than your partner (I'm not sure whether there are twin rooms, so maybe they are different?). Everywhere was clean and tidy and well-maintained. The room is relatively well equipped with toiletries but there is no shampoo provided and no coffee making facilities in the room which would have been nice. There is a mini bar with a variety of soft and alcoholic drinks, snacks and other items at typical hotel prices. Even if you don't purchase anything, you can empty it out and use it to keep your own drinks cool. The bartender was very good and would make drinks to your own specification if you wanted. The free internet just off the bar area was extremely useful. The hotel reception area has wide range of Berlin guide books in English which was a nice touch - many of them giving information not found in the books we had read. Mitte is definitely THE place to stay in Berlin and this hotel offers such excellent value (we paid about £60 a night for a double room in July).</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we got a 3 for 2 deal which gave us an excellent price. the location is excellent, right next to Oranienburger Tor, it takes no time to go to any tourist attraction in Berlin. the room is pretty nice. i quite like the style, especially the glass window and the bathroom design (and the apples everyday!). however, the carpet is actually quite dirty. the carpet is dark red so is pretty hard to noice but once i stepped into the bathroom, i could see the dust straight away. they got a whole trolley of shampoo shower gel and lotion outside the room in the morning but i couldnt find a single one in the room at all...end up using the all in one shower gel + shampoo for 3 days, didnt expect that in a 4* hotel. free internet is avaliable in the room (no wifi, but i borrowed the cable from reception) but it broke down 2 nights out of 3... the reception staff told us there is a 'snack' breakfast in the morning that gave us a little surprise as our package does not include breakfast! since breakfast wasnt included in our package so i had no expectation. althought the breakfast was a bit light but it wasnt bad. the reception staff was really helpful, they dont have a potsdam map, which is understandable anyway but he offered to print us a google map as an alternative! the check in time supposed to be at 3 but we checked in at 11am when we arrived. i would recommond this hotel to everyone except those who need a really quiet sleep. the hotel located in a street that full of bars and clubs (and many good restaurants near by!) it could get quite noisy at night till early in the morning. we were in the 3rd floor but we could hear some music as well as the noice of those who got drunk...it wasnt too bad as we were pretty tired after walking all day and it wasnt that loud but it is something to be considered before booking this place if you need 100% quiet place to sleep!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Amazing hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I shared a junior suite with 2 friends on the 6th floor facing out onto Oranienburger Strasse. Amazing view through the enormous slanted windows. A spectacular room. I would have to say this was the best hotel room I have ever stayed in. The room featured a breakfast table and also a lounge area, flat screen tv, dvd player and a choice of cds. The double bed had individual duvets and was quite large so it felt like separate beds. The person on the sofa bed was also very satisfied. Loads of space within the room and plenty of cupboard space too. The kitchen has a kettle, fridge and hob. Impeccably clean. Bathroom very satisfactory. In the junior suite the bathroom was separate to the room, as opposed to a queen room where the bath/shower (although screened) was open plan. I viewed a queen room which was very impressive too. Initially we chose not to have breakfast in the hotel as it seemed pricey. However, after 2 successive mornings of wandering around the locality in search of a menu to satisfy everyone's needs I would recommend the hotel buffet breakfast. It was superb. I am a vegetarian and generally suffer when it comes to European buffets, but there was plenty of choice beyond the typical meat options. The cereals & muesli accompanied by a variety of seeds and yogurt were divine. Plenty of fresh breads, pastries and good coffee make it worthwhile. If you book the breakfast the night before you can avail of the reduced rate at 12 euro. The staff at Arcotel Velvet were very friendly and helpful. This hotel is in a great location if you want to stay in Mitte and are interested in a more bohemian area. Numerous buses, trams and the underground are available outside the door of the hotel so the shopping districts and sites are within easy reach. I would recommend the Welcome card for short stays. A 48 hour or 72 hour travel card are available which also act as a discount card for some museums and sites.</p></li>
