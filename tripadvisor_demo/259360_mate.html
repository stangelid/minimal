Might not be with springing for the Harbour view if you want quiet.</p></li>

Also - the swimming pool is more like an oversized bath - a joke really. Other than that though the hotel is ok - decor is good and the rooftop bar was lovely.

My girlfirend and I stayed here for three nights in March and had a fabulous stay. Location was brilliant and most things were a short walk away. Connections wise for further trips was easy. We had a great time and the staff were extremely helpful. the buffet breakfast set us up for the day but we didn't eat dinner there. All in all, would recommend this to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I arrived in Barcelona the day before our scheduled Mediterranean Cruise and stayed at Hotel Duquesa de Cardona because of its location close to the port. We were pleasantly surprised at the level of comfort and style the hotel offers... comparable to some of the boutique hotels we have enjoyed in New York City, Sydney, and other world class cities. We enjoyed great service, nice accommodations, and a fantastic walk down La Rambla, which is just a block or so away. Highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a lovely hotel with very friendly staff. Location is perfect!! The marina is just across the road. We had 2 rooms in a private area which is great for a family. The main room had a balcony to the front - perfect! - Very clean - really great breakfast!! (good value) - some fabulous CAKE!! :) Lovely pool area on top with GREAT views. Parking across the road - very handy. The Ramblas is disappointing. The zoo was well worth a visit - dolphin show especially! Barcelona itself isn't the cleanest of cities :(</p></li>

The breakfast was extremely good.Our only complaint was rather low water pressure in the bathroom, otherwise a first class hotel with very friendly staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is in a great location - walk to beach, lots of restaurants, on edge of old town, near zoo, aquarium and parks. We spent four nights with two young children. Visit was great. Room was spacious and comfortable (two bathrooms), but a little dated. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The rooftop deck is great for a drink and great view of harbor although the rooftop "pool" is more like a bathtub. Breakfast was good but very overpriced and breakfast room had plastic patio chairs to sit in. Save your money and visit one of the many bakeries in nearby Barri Gotic.</p></li>

We stayed in a junior suite 21 and we loved it! Good size room and beautiful decor. THe hotel was very little, that must be one of the reason ways it was so easy to feel that comfortable and get so much contact with their staff, who taked care of us all the time. Good restaurant area at the port for spanish food ( try merendero de la mari, barceloneta ) but also the roof terrace of the hotel, where the barbecue options are very decent for the price the charge.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is what a 4 star hotel should be. From the moment we got there, to the moment we left, they were extremely accommodating to our needs. The room itself was very clean, the shower pressure was great, and the bed was very comfortable. The location was great - mostly because it was close enough to La Rambla, without being too touristy. Our room faced the water, and we had a great view. The rooftop deck put this hotel is really what added the special touch, as we were able to have sangria and wine before we went out to dinner and after we came home. So great - highly recommended!</p></li>

Everything in the room and the bathroom, which were both very well-sized, was tip-top; Nice style, good materials, comfortable. Real four-stars luxe. The people at the desk were very friendly and helpfull. And of course the roofterrace is marvellous to relax on. Many nice neighbourhoods on walkingdistance. E.g.the Born is next door, with a lot of good places to eat and drink. And very nice as well: The low prices in Januar, when there are already much sunshine and good temperatures in Barcelona.</p></li>

It is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed, no doubt, a hidden gem. All the staff made it so special that I would never forget it, waiters and receptionist couldn't be more helpful. We stayed in a spacious suite vey nicely decorated, the maid put a special detail for us in our my room every day, truffes with champange one day, olive candles and a basket of fruits. The terrace has amazing views of the harbour, the waiter said they are opening soon the terrace service for tapas. Definitely we will come again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Duquesa de Cardona hotel in Barcelona. This was a lovely hotel and the best we have stayed in so far in Barcelona. The hotel is located about a 5 minute walk from La Rambla and about a 5 minute walk from the beach so you have the best of both worlds in terms of location. There is a roof top terrace with views out over the port where you can escape and watch the world going by with a nice glass of wine. The rooms were kept very clean and the staff are very friendly and always provided positive advise and information, we will definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was wonderful, on arrival we were upgraded to an amazing suite with a lovely harbour views and a bottle of bubbly. We were definitely made to feel special. The staff were all really helpful and polite. The roof terrace was a real treat, we ate there a couple of times and couldn't fault the food or service - the views on an evening from there are lovely too. The hotel is really well placed for getting around Barcelona - you can easily walk to the beach and you are on the doorstep of metro station or the main tourist areas. We would definitely recommend this hotel and hope to return at some point.</p></li>

Think of a beautiful building within minutes walk of everything you could need- restaurants, bars, shops, main gothic attractions etc. Then combine these attributes with massive, spotless, quiet rooms, incredibly friendly staff, great buffet breakfasts, an impressive roof terrace overlooking the marina (sadly unused owing to arctic temperatures) & good quality wifi. Could anything be better? Yes, how bout having all of that for 85 euros including breakfast. I will definitely go back. I want to try their other hotel in France.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a lovely boutique hotel, situated near to the old gothic quarter (Cathedral) and a short stroll from La Ramblas, overlooking the marina. The bedroom with small balcony was lovely (no noise at all with double double glazing) and superb bathroom - everything spotlessly clean and excellent service. Plenty of choice for breakfast set in a beautiful room. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a short break in Barcelona. We got the two day touristic bus pass which allowed us to visit all the main tourist attractions (hop on hop off) and found some lovely places to eat - one outside the museum and one in a lovely square behind the hotel.</p></li>

The room was really nice at the front of the hotel with a small balcony. We had no problems with noise once the window was closed and it was well worth the extra. We ate at a small tapas place around the corner but came back to sit on the rooftop terrace. It was a lovely evening and a very relaxing place to watch the world go by. The staff were brilliant and could'nt do enough for us. It is in an ideal location to explore the gothic quarter and Las Ramblas . We will definitely be staying here on our next trip to Barcelona.

Good location - turn left at the end of Las Ramblas and walk for about 5 minutes and it's on your left hand side. Good sized room. Excellent air-con / heating. Roof terrace would be great in the summer. The staff on reception were really helpful and made phone calls to sort out a ticket collection issue we had for a concert. Brilliant seafood restaurant on the port. Turn left out of the hotel and walk to the next big junction. Cross over the road towards the sea and in the large building in front of you at the end there is a great restaurant - we showed up at 10.30 on Saturday night and they fitted us in.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently stayed here with my wife for a weekend and had a great time. The location in front of Port Vell meant that in was only 3 to 4 minutes walking to the bottom of the Ramblas and 10 minutes to the beach. The reception was spotless and the staff we spoke to all spoke good english and were extremely helpful. The room was clean and functional for us, its not up to the Arts but everything you needed was there. The roof terrace is a great place to sit in the sun with a book and a drink and with a late evening flight home was a perfect for us. Stayed B&B, the breakfast was more continental but had a good choice of cereals, cold cheeses, meats etc. We would most certainly stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the hotel for a girls' week in Barcelona. Overall a very good hotel - would go there again. However, some things that could be improved .. - If you are a light sleeper and book a room facing the harbour be prepared to hear some noise through the windows at night. Nice view but this is the downside. - Ask for a non-smoking room if you want one. I first had a smoking room as I had not specifically asked for it. - Reception staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Some other staff members, however, we did not find very attentive - e.g. a waiter at breakfast or the maid not replacing tissues in the bathroom. Little things, all in all, therefore still a recommended place to stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A lovely hotel. Negatives: afternoon coffee is free BUT be careful not to take any cake or you'll be charged for it (€6). No evening restaurant service (at least, not at the time we went). Slow bar/snack service. Breakfast variable - for example, I pointed out one morning that the scrambled egg was cold. Whilst they offered to cook me fresh scrammbled egg (good), they did nothing about the fact that the "hot" food tray was sitting in a bain-marie of cold water (bad). When my "freshly cooked" egg arrived, it had black bits in and appeared to be re-heated egg. No English-speaking TV channels. Positives: good location for tourist locations. Free wi-fi internet. Lazy breakfasts. Good size rooms.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband & I just returned from Visiting Barcelona,Spain and stayed at this lovely boutique hotel - outstanding service and location. Quiet hotel with panaromic rooftop views of the Seaport (located in Gothic area - Port Vell). Perfect location - within walking to the seaport and all restaurants on the seaport - Ramblas was right in back of us. Mario at Hotel helped us with sightseeing attractions (buy a 2 day bus pass - comes with headset to hear about all the sites you are seeing). Buses run every 5 minutes and the only way to see the beautiful architecture Barcelona has to offer. We stayed only 2 days and then took a cruise of the Meditteranean out of Barcelona thru Italy and Nice France.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently booked this hotel through a booking company. In the process, the search engine reverted back to a 'default date', and not the date we needed the room. We never even stayed there, as the date they reserved was before we even left the USA! We advised the booking company, who phoned the hotel several times in effort to refund our money (as the hotel was now sold out for the dates we needed it). The hotel repeatedly refused to refund our money. In fact, the manager wouldn't even return the phone call to the booking company, and responded only with an email stating he could do nothing for us. And, the rate they charged to our credit card was double the rate they had advertised as 'on special'.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">High praise for this hotel and its staff specifically Marta and Luis. We arrived early after an overnight flight and Marta made us feel welcome and worked to accommodate our early arrival. She suggested a quick walk through the city to get us orientated and when we return the rooms would be ready. The rooftop patio and bar/lounge was excellent with attentive staff, sufficient towels and an adequate pool for getting cooled off. The prices for mixed drinks are a bit steep with a drink costing $10 euros however portions are large. Rooms were well appointed and the hotel was relatively quiet despite being located on a busy street. The hotel is situated close to the beach and the gothic area therefore making the location ideal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">With that many hotels in one city, and without any references it was a really hard pick. The nice website pulled us over. But we were very satisfied with our choice. Medium small Boutique Hotel, perfectly located near the marina and the ramblas. Perfect starting point to take some good walks in Barcelona. We only booked 2 nights, what was a mistake because we needed 3 nights. So we asked i've we could stay somewath longer. Unfortunately this was not possible due to the fact that the hotel was fully booked. But the last day there was apparently a 'no-show' so we could have that room. It was even more nicer then the one that we had booked. Unbelieveble big, for a city hotel. Nice cocktails from the rooftop at sunset, what more can you ask for?</p></li>

Our room was on the back side of the hotel. It is very comfortably sized and spotlessly clean. Many reviews mention the rooftop area. It was too cold for us to enjoy this but went up and enjoyed the view of the Barcelona waterfront. There is a very small swimming pool that would be nice on a wsarm summer day or evening. The Gothic Disrict which is located behing the hotel has numerous interesting bars and restaurants. Should you spend more than a day or two in Barcelona I strongly suggest that you purchase a Barcelona Card. You will get ulimited local transportation as well as free and discounted admission to many area attractions.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent one night in this hotel whilst in Barcelona for the weekend. The hotel is situated in a fantastic location, in easy walking distance to all the major hot spots, or easily reached by metro which is a 1 minute walk from the hotel. After an easy check-in, we used the pool and outdoor terrace which has a fantastic view over the marina. Our room was spacious with king size bed and two exceptionally clean bathrooms! One major draw back is the street noise. We stayed on a Saturday night and the noise from underneath and neat y clubs/bars was enough to keep us away till the early hours of the morning. Upon registering our disappointment with reception, the following morning, we were told that it is "a common problem" albeit the room was double glazed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Duquesa for a little over a week to both celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary and attend a Green Day concert in Sep/Oct 2009 . The hotel building was very pretty and the staff was always friendly and helpful. The location was perfect - right across the street from Port Vell and less than a 10 minute walk to Las Ramblas. The hotel is close to tourist buses, cabs and the subway and there were many restaurants within walking distance. The hotel's rooftop bar is also perfect - a perfect place to drink sangria while watching the marina and all the night life out on the street below. Should you need Internet access, they also provided free Internet service inside the hotel. I would highly recommend this hotel to others and would not hesitate to return here myself.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent 5 days @ the Duquesa a couple of weeks ago and we had an enjoyable stay. We arrived super early and the hotel allowed us to check in before noon! Room is a decent size but doesn't have much storage/closet space. Bathroom is huge but like hotel in Madrid shower door covers only 1/2 of shower, also shower head moved and we flooded the bathroom floor twice. Very clean, prompt service. We had room 43 facing the main street Calle de Colom - bar next door only noisey during our Fri night stay. Hotel very close to Las Ramblas and it's possible to walk (long walk) to most attractions. Little deli across from PapaBubble (candy maker) on Amble had great little sandwhiches. We felt pretty safe in Gothic district (except for the really small/dark streets). Would certainly return again.</p></li>

The hotel is small but we thought beautifully decorated and calm,with a great roof terrace bar overlooking the marina ,where you can watch the cruise liners come and go and chill out while drinking gin and tonics or cocktails before heading out at night to one of the dozens of restaurants close by,you will be spoilt for choice.Having stayed in the noisier place de catalunya area before i much preferred this part of the city,and so close to the fabulous beaches .Great staff and service,and lovely rooms and breakfast ,what more could you want!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Took a chance (based in trip advisor recommendations) on this hotel and was very happy with our choice. Most of the staff was quite nice and helpful. Breakfast (included was sufficient-my biggest problem was the coffe was never hot in the morning) I hate warm coffee. Great location, loved being off Las Ramblas close enough to get there but far enough away fromt he craziness of the street. Metro was an minute walk from the hotel and it was quite nice during the day and the end of the day to sit on the rooftop and look out on the harbor. Bathroom was not great, had trouble with the shower and getting enough towels everyday I had to ask (6 days). Hated asking for ice everyday as well. All in all was a great vacation, was there with my 16year old daughter and we had a blast! Highly recommend this boutique hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was excellent and lovely and cool as we got there in temps of 36 and 90 per cent humidity. We were grateful for the tranquil haven which it most definately was . The views from the rooftop bar which we frequented on the 3 nights we were there are breathtaking and the location is just right for everything and not far to the beach also. The bar staff were really friendly and the gin and tonics are excellent the best I have had and the extra touches count. The only negative was the breakfast which was advertised as American Buffett which it was not. Just a nornal continental breakfast which was not over exciting. The room we were given was also dark but the bathrooms are well lit which is the main thing . Overall a very good experience and would go there again but not in August because it was just too humid.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location: great. Rooms: good- smallish but nicely appointed and fairly quiet. The problem? DO NOT allow the staff to call you a taxi. For one, you can just walk out front and catch one any time of day. If you do, watch the driver come in and hand the front desk person a 5 euro note. Then, the driver takes you the scenic route to make it back. And, you waste 10 mins waiting. We booked a restaurant reservation at La Venta- which is a neat restaurant with a view of all of Barcelona and away from the tourist traps- the front desk and the taxi driver warned me it was 'very far'. And on the way there, it was- to the tune of 30 euros. When we caught a cab off the street to return to the hotel we were back in 1/2 the time and for 12 euros. Be warned- it was a small detail but enough to create mistrust of the seemingly nice hotel staff.</p></li>

This time I came back to Barcelona to go on a cruise , and the location from this hotel is so good, that I decided to repeat, so here I am again!!. The hotel is near to everything ...Ramblas, harbour, Gothic Area.. , The atmosphere, although is very relaxed and comfortable. It has a fabolous terrace on the sixt floor, with one of the bests views I have ever seen from a harbour. The rooms are cosy (try a junior suite if you can, is spacious, comfortable, very sweet and quite ). If you are active people, Barcelona is full of surprises. Get informed at reception desk about day trips , for instance, to Montserrat, Sitges, etc, museums, different restaurants, etc. They will give you a good hand on it</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Really cute hotel with an ideal location. Loved the roof top bar! Views were incredible, especially at night. Our room was adequate in size, a bit dark and not as charming as the photos...but immaculate. Breakfast was yummy too. The BUT is because they messed up on our reservations. We reserved two rooms for two nights and only one room was reserved for ONE night. Luckily, they were able to find one other room for our friends for the first night and then they had to move all four of us to a sister hotel about one block away for the second night. They were extremely apologetic and moved all our luggage and to the second hotel themselves. The other hotel was very nice but it was still very disappointing. I would stay here again but confirm and reconfirm my reservations!! p.s. Thank you to the staff for being so nice through all that!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Got a very good rate including breakfast on their website. Made a mistake concerning the numbers of persons arriving (marked "1" while we were 2 indeed) and sent a mail. Very fast and polite response that there was no problem and the price was the same. Very friendly staff, no problems at check-in and check-out. Room was quite spacious and had a nice view onto the beachfront. With windows closed no problems with noise, although there is main road in front of the hotel. Location ideal for shopping, lots of restaurants within some minutes of walking. As our flight departed in the evening, we could drop our luggage at the reception and made use of the loungers on the roof terrace. Would like to return any time, only thing that was not up to standards was the breakfast, not bad but not as sumptious as I´m used from other hotels in Barcelona.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We specifically requested a non-smoking room and were told upon checking in that we had been given one. The smell of cigarette smoke during the night and in the morning were overpowering. We went down to complain and were told by a different staff member that the non smoking floor was one above ours. We had been lied to and were told we had been given a non-smoking room. The room was spacious but had an old bed spread and thread bare carpet on the floor. Lobby small and dated looking. Bathroom was large and modern. Right beside a youth hostel with 2 beggers on the street and a good 15 minue walk to Las Ramblas. Breakfast was poor -soggy eggs and luke warm coffee so we stuck to the yogurt and croissants which were fine, do not eat at the hotel . We switched to Hotel 1898 right in the heart of Las Ramblas which was a fantatic, modern hotel which all the amenities.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel prior to the start of a cruise and were very happy with our choice. The staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. Our room looked out over the front and despite the proximity to the road, it was relatively quiet. The room wasn’t huge but was well appointed with a good bathroom and nice toiletries. Our only slight criticism was the bed which was rather soft, but then better than a lot of the very hard beds we’ve slept on in numerous Spanish hotels. We didn’t make use of the pool or restaurants but what we saw of the public rooms they were very attractive. Having stayed at three other hotels in Barcelona between Sept and November 2007, this was by far our best experience. The excellent location close to the water front, Las Ramblas and the Gothic Quarter (and therefore lots of restaurants nearby) make it a good choice. We will certainly try to book it again for our next visit.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I looked for a Hotel for months as we went to Barcelona for a special occasion, and I definitely made the right decision! The hotel has a very relaxed air around it and the staff are very friendly and make you feel very welcome. The room was well decorated and the bed was one of the most comfortable that we have slept in! We mangaged to get a Classic room at the front with its own balcony overlooking the port which was great. The breakfast was excellent and the roof top terrace bar was excellent with great views over the port. The position of the hotel could not be better. Las Ramblas is 5 mins walk and at the back of the hotel is the Gothic quarter, which you need to walk around to appreciate. 10 mins walk in the other direction is the wonderful Barceloneta beach front. We had no issues at all and overall it is one of the best hotels we have stayed in. We are planning a return trip and we will be going back to this hotel. Fantastic!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I arrived in Barcelona early on Friday morning - following an overnight sleeper journey from Paris. The hotel were welcoming at 09.00 despite our book in time being, notionally, 15.00. We were allowed to store our baggage with the hotel and offered a room to brush up and freshen ourselves before setting out to explore Barcelona. The hotel took my mobile number to call us once our room was ready. Our room was large with an equally large bathroom. Very clean with a well stocked mini bar and a comfortable bed. It was in the front overlooking the Marina on Passeige Colom. It was incredibly quiet with double, double glazing. The view was great and, despite the extreme cold, the boulevard was used to walk dogs and children, cycle, roller skate, skate board and generally promenade. In the summer this would be an amazing spectacle. Breakfast was generous (but, regrettably, no tostada & tomato). Staff were very helpful - booking taxis and recommending local restaurants.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here during the hottest and most humid week for a long time. The A/C wasn't working properly when we arrived and with one phone call the maintenance guy was up and fixed it within an hour. I wouldn't bother with any of the restaurants on the same street as the hotel. We tried a couple and we thought the food was average and expensive. Try the numerous ones down the side streets. The room was a good size by European standards. Bed was comfortable, bathroom BIG and we didn't suffer any noise problems. We faced the harbour on 4th floor - room 40. Rooftop bar and restaurant were great and it wasn't until the last night we discovered the delights of sitting there watching the sunset (from behind) and the light change over the harbour. My only "complaint" is I couldn't get my MAC connected to the WIFI - but my wife was pleased. I didn't bother to ask the staff to help. Would stay here again, but to be fair, would probably try another hotel in another area - just for a change.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a terrific 6-night stay at the lovely Hotel Duquesa de Cardona. We were in a Classic Room, which had adequate space for the two of us. The bathroom was large, with both a walk-in shower and a tub with shower. Everything was spotless, clean and fresh. The staff were very courteous and attentive, particularly Noemi at the front desk. She greeted us and confirmed our requested preferences, all of which were honoured. There is a lovely 6th floor terrace which we were able to enjoy on one of the warmer days. There is also a small “business corner”, complete with computer and printer, which is free to use. We received our wake-up calls as requested, as well as our ride to the airport. The hotel is on the palm tree-lined Passeig de Colom, overlooking the marina. There are several restaurants, shops and tourist sites within walking distance, as well as subway stations for easy transportation. We definitely recommend the Duquesa to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Barcelona.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel as a more luxurious weekend break for my mum's 50th birthday present, so obviously was happy to spend a little more for extra comfort. Wasn't at all disappointed, the location was superb and I'd recommend paying the extra for a harbor view if you can - it was worth it to watch the fireworks from our balcony when spain won euro 2008...! Little extras were always well received, like daily weather report cards to help us plan the next day, and we were greeted by some lovely staff members who did everything to advise us so we could see the most of the city!! The hotel reserved the terrace bar on one evening of our stay, so to apologise for the inconvenience, we even received a free bottle of cava which was much appreciated!!! If you're anything like my mum and I, you can get around the city without paying anything for transport at all, as the food and drink in barcelona is quite costly. The city is relatively small but very hilly, so if you're not much of a walker stick to the underground!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I got married in Barcelona and we used this hotel as our base. Some of our family and friends also stayed with us. The hotel was quite pricey but well worth it, I have stayed in numerous hotels in Barcelona at the same price and they were definitely not worth it. We found the staff at Duquesa Cardona extremely friendly and helpful. The bar and roof terrace is open to the public so friends / visitors were more than welcome to join us. The terrace is really lovely, I have stayed in several hotels in Barcelona that advertised roof terraces - this was by far the best! the pool isn't huge but enough to cool off. Great views over the harbour area. The rooms were small but great views from the rooms at the front of the hotel and reasonable sound proofed, rooms at the back are very quiet but no view :( The hotel is also in a excellant location, 5 mins to El Born - the old area of the city which has lovely restaurants & Bars. It is also only 10 mins to Las Ramblas & beach. Breakfast is good, all the usual and loads of it.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “disappointing well-located hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I found this hotel disappointing. The rooms were lovely—modern, spacious for this class of hotel, and adequately appointed. The hotel is on one of the largest streets in Barcelona. Our rooms faced the street and were noisy late in to the night and early morning, even though we were on the 6th floor. The rooms on the other side of the hotel were not noisy, but faced an alley. The hotel has a lovely, tiny, rooftop pool and its rooftop terrace offers a sweeping view of the marina and the city. The staff at the hotel was not as attentive or helpful as you might expect from such a hotel. The service at the rooftop tapas bar was unbearably slow, even in the middle of the day with no one else there. The front desk staff seemed to rely on Google for its knowledge of restaurants and other local attractions. While no one on the staff was actually rude, they were the least helpful of any hotel staff that we saw in Spain. Our stay here was pleasant enough, but I would try another hotel in this city that has many alternatives to offer.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have recently stayed at the Duquesa 11/11/2011 to 17/11/2011. Cant not really find fault, with the hotel or the service. The staff could not do enough to help at any time. The location of the hotel is perfect for visiting the various quarters of Barcelona, it overlooks the marina / port, you go left out the door and your heading in the Gothic area and zoo, turn right your going to the La Ramba area. Cross the road, and your in the marina / port area, aquarium etc. Good quality fresh breakfast ( we booked b/b ) you can pay at the hotel, the old saying you get what you pay for, suggest book breakfast when booking the hotel. It not to large hotel but not to small either, we had a deluxe room, view over the marina. Very important they had double, double glazing so kept the noise out, trust me its a noisy city, without sound proofing you would not get much sleep and we were on the 5th floor, and you could not here the people in the next room either. So there you have it, if back in Barcelona only one place to stay for us..... R Quinn</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Peaceful and lovely hotel across from the Marina and a few blocks to La Rambla.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location of this hotel is great if you like the waterfront and Marina view. It was a much more quiet location than hotels located on La Rambla like the Monte Carlo or Majestic. Be prepared to walk about 3 blocks to the main waterfront area and lower La Rambla. We also enjoyed the location as we were able to explore the Gothic quarter right behind the hotel. I recommend you look for restaurants in the gothic area just off La Rambla to save a few dollars. We also enjoyed an Irish Pub a few blocks behind the hotel. The rooms were good size for European standards, comfy beds and good size bathrooms. Coffee on the terrace was a fun way to start the day. Ask for American style coffee or you will recieve expresso. I loved Barcelona and if I were to go back I probably would have stayed closer to Plaza Catalunya. But if you are looking for peace and quiet and you do not like crowds I would recommend the Duquesta de Cardona as a peaceful alternative. We traveled with another couple and our rooms were next to each other on the 5th floor Bay View.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent a weekend at the Cardona. It's in a fantastic location - equal distance between the old port, marinas and the sightseeing of the old quarter. Lots of windy, narrow streets just behind the hotel, buzzing with life and we always felt perfectly safe. The hotel is quite small and friendly. We found the reception to be perfectly friendly and helpful - especially when they stored our bags on the Sunday and didn't object to our returning several times throughout the day to add or remove items. The room was on the small side and rather dark, though very comfortable. Strangely the bathroom was almost as large as the bedroom and was very luxurious. The hotel was very quiet, we never heard any room noise. Breakfast was excellent - typically continental, but a varied choice. The only negative was that we would have liked fresh coffee rather than the large thermos flasks which cooled rapidly. The open pool on the top floor is little more than a bath tub, but lovely views from the rooftop although the bar was empty when we visited. We'd certainly stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is a haven in a busy city. It is certainly ideally situated for getting to all the attractions you wish to see. It is down near the marina at the bottom of La Ramblas, so as long as you like walking its good place to stay. We had a standard room at the front of the hotel overlooking the main road and the marina, whilst it is a main road and has a lot of traffic you do have the benfit of double glazing so the trafffic noise is not an issue. Our room was large, clean and tastefully decorated. The Hotel is very comfortable and very welcoming. The staff are all helpful and anything you requested or needed was never to much for them to do for you. The buffet breakfast's accommodated everyone's taste and what we liked was that it was served from 7.00 until 10.30 -great if you dont like getting up to early. The only criticism is that they did not clean the rooms until mid to late afternoon, but in their defence we did request that they cleaned it earlier in the day which they did. Overall very impressed with Hotel and would certainly stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great view from the top terrace. We stayed there as much as we could. Very small pool, but it does the job on a hot day. Only 6 sun chairs, but we never had problems grabbing a couple of them when that was what we were after. The roof top also have a couple of comfortable sofas were we enjoyed some good Cava's (that were reasonably priced). Order your bottle right away, since the service is slow, and the waiter obviously has to visit the cellar to get it. We had a junior suite facing the narrow back street. We booked last minute, so did not even ask for a sea facing room. Next time we will. Stayed for 3 nights. The location is perfect for exploring different areas in Barcelona, and take a break at the hotel in between. We paid 225 Euros for the 4 of us. The junior suite was obviously 2 rooms that was permanently transferred into one. Plus: 2 spacious bathrooms that is very good with two teenagers in the family. Minus; 2 double beds, one of them extremely large but the other one a little to small. Very convenient but expensive underground parking just across the road.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel in a fabulous spot! We stayed three nights and then moved to another hotel because the Duquesa was booked for the weekend. What a difference! If you visit Barcelona (and you really should!) this is where you want to be. The hotel staff could not be friendlier. The rooms, while small by American standards, could not be lovelier. And the location is perfect. Walk to the best of everything (with the exception of a few spots -- more about that later). The view from the rooftop terrace is breathtaking; the terrace itself changes the whole vacation. It provides a wonderful, relaxing place to be outside! Bring your book, order a drink and enjoy one of most beautiful cities on this planet. Recommendations: You can walk to Las Ramblas, the Maritime Museum, the basilica of Santa Maria del Mar, the Olympic port, Port Vell, the Picasso Museum, the Gothic Cathedral, a gazillion plazas and tapas bars, etc, etc. See what I mean about location! Take the Bus Turistic to visit Parc Gueill, Sagrada Familia and Montjuic. Eat at The 4 Cats! Enjoy Barcelona and enjoy this hotel... we did!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel for a long wknd 20th Jan - 23rd Jan, after having stayed there last year. The hotel is ideally located for Las Ramblas, the port,and the Maremagnum. The staff are most helpful and greet you from the moment you step out of the taxi.Our room wasn't ready as we arrived early, so they store your luggage in the luggage room, and it is then waiting for you in your room when you get back.The rooms are of a good size and we had nice views, and a good sized bathroom.If you want anything ie, toothpaste,razor etc just ask at reception and they will bring it to your room.The breakfast is plentiful and a good choice, and we ate in their restuarant last year and was again very good and reasonable. The views from the roof top terrace are amazing, and I would love to go back in the summer and chill and enjoy a cocktail up there.This is our 8th visit to Barcelona and we love this city, so much to see and do and the shopping is amazing.There are so many hotels to choose from, but if you find a good one why not go back? We hope to see all the staff at the Duquesa De Cardona again soon.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent two nights here prior to joining a cruise. I have to admit that my first impression of the room wasn`t great. It was small with almost no natural light and overlooked an inner courtyard. The very helpful man on the desk offered us an upgrade for 40 euros per night to a front- facing room. I went along to have a look and loved the room, but then remembered that it was Merce festival time, and a front -facing room might be noisy. So we stuck with our small dark room which turned out to be blissfully quiet at all times of the day and night, so was probably the right call. That`s the only negative thing I have to say. The location was fantastic with loads of good restaurants nearby. The sun terrace was particularly lovely. It overlooked the harbour and made a great place to watch the Merce fireworks on the Saturday night. Then there was some gentle live music up there - a great way to accompany a glass of local wine. (There is a small pool up there too, but if you`re considering serious swimming - forget it) The people on reception were polite and helpful. They spoke near-perfect English and humoured my attempts at Spanish. Recommended.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel because it was recommended by Alaisdar Sawday and also because the price was very good. I emailed the night before to let them know we would be arriving after eight in the evening and requested either a king size bed or twins. We were advised that we had only booked a classic room which was double or twin, fair enough, so we were happy with twins. On arrival the lovely receptionist remembered my email and had found us a bigger bed! The room was lovely fresh and clean with a good size bathroom, big towels and bathrobes, chocolate on the pillow, weather forecast and even a choice of air freshener. Full bar and big tv that had a few English channels. We had a view of the main street, there was a little noise but not excessive. Out side our room was a lovely sitting area with lots of books to read. We could have moved in for a long holiday but we only had two nights. The staff were all very helpful and cheerful, we did not once feel we were in anyway ripped off! We did not eat at the hotel as we wanted to explore, but had tea and coffee one morning which we thought was tasteless and cold, the only negative in our stay. Will definitely stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went for our honeymoon for 8 nights. We paid well over 200 euros per night. Location is great. Housekeeping is very poor.

You could write your name on the dust. They come around 6 pm to give you a card with tomorrow's weather forecast and a piece of chocolate, but after we complained that service was totally gone. Coincidence? Not sure, but it did not feel like a place that you'd want to pay over 200 euros a night. The reception staff made every effort not to make eye contact, let alone greeting you as you come and go. Bar staff was surprisingly nice, though. It's right by the main road across from marina, so the street noise is there all the time. Non-stop ambulance sirens wake you up several times a night. I could not wait to get back home, and I am the type of person who likes travelling. A lot! In general I didn't find Spanish people very welcoming. They take your business for granted and do bare minimum. Needless to say, I'm not going back to Spain. So many other places in the world to be explored.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for three days before our cruise. Overall we enjoyed our stay, but there were a few downsides, many of which have been mentioned in previous reviews. Good points: Desk staff very polite and helpful. Called for extra towels and they arrived within minutes. The bathroom was huge, clean and beautiful. The shower had tons of water pressure and hot water. The bed was large and comfortable. Air conditioning worked well. Room and bath was very clean. Less than good points: Room was very small by American standards. Overlooked a cruddy, noisy back street. The noise was very bad until the bars close. The window did not close/seal tightly, which added to the noise level. Sad looking breakfast for 14 euros. Overall, I think if we were going to stay for a longer time, we would look for something different or upgrade to a larger room overlooking the main street. The location is excellent, within walking distance of many things to see and do. The small size of the room was somewhat offset by the high ceilings and the marvelous bathroom. There was one strange thing about the design of the shower...there was no shower curtain or door. Taking a shower basically floods the bathroom. We stayed in room 26.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Took an interior room to avoid street noise issues knowing that we had access to the floor deck with a pool and lounge. Had problems with noise coming from the 6th floor lounge but went quiet around midnight. On our last day/night we were told that a function was in the lounge and deck area so it would be inaccessible to us but we could have a bottle of sparkling wine on the house. We asked and were told that the function would end at around 11PM. We stayed out ‘till after midnight to avoid problems and the party was still going LOUD and strong when we returned to our room. We complained in very strong terms to the front desk and about a half hour later the noise quieted. When we asked to get the manager on the phone, he almost choked. "It's late and he's probably sleeping." was the response - We said "Exactly - that's what we want to do." We spoke to the manager on checkout and he took care of the problem with us. Room size was adequate. Again, the beds were very comfortable. Products were OK but Spartan. Breakfasts were like Meninas in Madrid but less selection, adequate but not replenished as the morning progressed. Well located on the harbor a short walk to the beach and a short walk to the Shopping, tapas bars and restaurants. A long walk (or short cab ride) to the train station.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for two nights on a break out of town. It was the first hotel we found on google searching and definitely made the correct choice. Found on the Passeig de Colom, the road that runs along the marina it is in a nice location for strolls along the marina front and is only about a ten minute walk from Las ramblas. The entrance area is classy, it has a laid back but businessey feel to it. If I were an advertising exec or an investment banker (i've actually been both) I'd feel comfortable staying here. It has a certain feel to it that speaks quality in subtle tones. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The view over the marina is great. Those morons talking about the noise on the road...either don't go to a city, close the window tight or don't stay on a main road! There really wasn't much noise anyway and if you're in the room a lot then you're not holidaying properly anyway! Don't let noise be an issue to you unless you have the hearing of a bat and the restlessness of a death row inmate. Room service is expensive but what hotel in room service isn't? The roof terrace is great, pool is more of a big bath but still nice and the sun loungers are great to sit on and relax whilst watching the stars and the cruise ships sail off. In a nut shell, decent value for money but a great location and excellent, high quality interiors. Go for it!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here prior to a cruise and picked this hotel due to it's proximity to the cruise terminal. We had a lovely view of the harbor and it's an easy walk to Las Ramblas, and a moderate walk to the Chocolate Museum and the Picasso museum (which mid-week mid-school term still had a line of over an hour each time we walked past). The hotel was very friendly to us as language challenged American Tourists. They happily exchanged money orders for us at better than bank rates and pointed out the very convenient nearby stop for city bus tours. While we were not honeymooning, it was a lovely location and we'll remember it more favorably than the significantly more expensive hotels around London that we stayed at prior to our Barcelona arrival. Restaurant hours were not favorable for us but it was a short walk to numerous locations. Internet access was no charge (surprisingly) but there was only 1 terminal for guests to use. Note - it's a bit of a walk to anywhere - if you are not up to that, be prepared to get taxi's to go much of anywhere. The taxi fares were reasonable from the airport and inexpensive for local short trips. It's NOT a resort hotel by my definition, and with the limited access to food, internet, and other exercise facilities in the hotel, I can't give it an 'excellent' mark. But it was an excellent choice for our needs and I'd book there again without hesitation.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 6 nights at the hotel. The rooms are clean, nicely furnished, we had a junior suite with our 2 kids of 3 and 4 years old. From the first night on we slept very bad due to the noise in the backstreet although we specifically asked for a room at the back as I read some comments about the noise of the frontrooms. It was hardly bareable as it was till 4 AM, we complained to reception the first night but were told the noise was normal and mostly at weekends so it would get better ... it didn't. After a few nights we complained again and somebody from maintenance checked the window: it was broken and was fixed the same day. For us this is not acceptable for this level of hotel. We got cava and some chocolates from the hotel which was friendly but too late. The matrasses on the beds are way to hard, even the pillows didn't charm us, at 10 PM it was not possible to get another pillow as housekeeping was gone home? Breakfast was included but not ok for a 4 star level, the breakfast staff is very poor, tables are not cleaned fast enough, buffet is not refilled on time, I felt like kicking their ... sometimes. Swimming pool is ok but small, loved the hot water though for the kids. The views over Port Vell and harbour are stunning. In general our stay was quite disappointing, the service not always very professional, although the reception staff was friendly and most of them ok.

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There are elements about this hotel that can not be knocked; the view from the rooftoop terrace, the proximity to Barri Gotic and the building itself. Nevertheless, I was less than satisfied with the whole experience. My friend emailed ahead to reserve a room higher up in the building and a twin room. I'm unsure whether it was due to incompetence or bloody-mindedness, but after waiting twenty minutes in reception for service on our arrival, we were given the lowest room in the hotel. The room was tiny and dingy and not at all worth the rather inflated prices that they charge. The receptionist claimed that was the only room available in the hotel but after arguing for a while, magically conjured up another on the fifth floor. This was nice enough (although it was dirty when they gave it to us), but with a double bed. We were not able to change rooms for the duration of our stay and were given a bottle of Cava to appease us (we had requested a discount). I have spent a lot of time in Spain and, although rusty, I understand the language fairly well. This helped when translating the rather loud argument the barman and maid were having on the rooftop and the griping the maid was muttering when I asked her for a towel. We once made the mistake of asking the barman for a towel, and he claimed he didn't do towels and stalked off in a huff. We were left hunting for another member of staff as he made no attempt to help us. Thoroughly unpleasant, rude and unhelpful. Oh, and the card keys never work.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Charming Waterfront Hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed there 3 nights following our cruise. I had a lovely room overlooking the waterfront, my daughter, son-in-law and grandson had a larger room in the back of the building, and were "treated" the first night in to a strip tease from the apartment across. The staff are all very helpful and friendly, all speak English very well. I booked this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews, and the fact it has a roof-top pool/lounge/waterfront view. Out of the 3 nights we were there, 2 nights we were not allowed to go to the roof top because the hotel had booked private functions. So, that was a disappointment to us. The staff was very accommodating, our cruise arrived early morning but the rooms typically are not ready until early afteroon. They held all our luggage in a secure area, then transferred them up for us when we returned from our walk across to the Aquarium, the 2nd largest in Europe and very enjoyable. The beach is about a 20 minute walk - be aware if travelling with young children that many people like to sunbathe "au naturel". Las Ramblas is very close by, we walked all the way up to Rambla Catalunya, about a two-hour leisurely stroll one way, but very busy and interesting to navigate with a stroller. If a quiet hotel is important to you, this might not be the best choice. The hotel is located on a busy avenue and sirens - police and ambulances - are a constant. Add to that the younger crowd from the hostel a couple of doors down enjoying themselves at the sidewalk restaurant right next door, it can get noisy.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Wonderful positioning, helpful staff but some odd quirks”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a lovely weekend at this hotel and overall were very satisfied. It was wonderfully positioned and we enjoyed having such easy access to the Port Vell and the Ramblas. The roof terrace is a treat so do take time to have a drink at least up there. We booked with the three day offer on the hotel website which was very good value but the first room we were given was rather pokey and disappointing. The staff were very accommodating however and when I asked whether we had been allocated this room because we had benefitted from the offer and explained that we were rather disappointed, they moved us to a much bigger room on the front of the hotel the next day which we much appreciated. The only problem with this room was that we could not open the windows because the noise was deafening because of the huge amount of traffic in front of the hotel and we were so very hot that we had to put the air conditioning on (in late October!). In fact we found that the hotel was generally overheated which might be a plus for some. Another curious observation - in the small room there was a very comfortable massive double bed whereas in the large room, the two single beds pushed together were each barely large enough for a normal sized adult - again odd and this made sleep much less comfortable. The breakfast buffet was great though the coffee was not freshly made odd once again for such a good quality hotel in other ways. That said the reception staff were very friendly and helpful. All in all I would thoroughly recommend this hotel despite some rather strange quirks.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at the Duquesa at around midnight and received a warm welcome from Rodrigo at reception. Check-in was quick and easy. Our room was on the 5th floor with a harbour view and was delightful! A comfortable size and good sized bathroom. We booked the romantic package, so when we arrived at the room there was a nice bottle of chilled Cava waiting for us, along with chocolate dipped strawberries, a single rose and rose pettles on just about every surface - it was superb value for money! Breakfast offers a small buffet of hot and cold items and is more than ample to get you ready for a busy day sightseeing. The rooftop terrace was lovely to chill out and enjoy the view. There are a few sun loungers and towels are provided. The bar service wasn't great and Spirits (Gin, Vodka etc.. we're totaly overpriced, wine was v.reasonable), but the terrace is a lovely space to spend some time. Most importantly the hotel is spotless in all areas. If you are taking the sightseeing tour, I would recommend taking an early bus from Plaza Catalunya (about a 20-30 minute walk) to avoid long queues. A one day ticket cost €24. We also took the Montjuic cable car, the views were amazing. The location of the hotel couldn't be better, lovely views over the marina, 5 minute walk to the Christopher Columbus statue at the foot of La Rambla, about 20-30 mins walk to Plaza Catalunya and about 20 minute stroll to the beaches at Barceloneta. We also walked to Sagrada Familia which took about 45 mins / 1 hour. Will definitely recommend the Duequesa de Cardona and would definitely stay again on our next visit to Barcelona.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked a junior suite as a bit of luxury. The room was in fact two singles knocked into one rather fully designed as a suite. Thus it had two bathrooms and two safes. It was spacious with a large and comfortable bed. Different pillows were available if you wanted them but the ones provided were good. There was a sofa table chairs etc, a large TV and in short the room was well equipped. The (two) bathrooms had both shower and bath. Plenty of soaps and good shower gels were provided. In short , a very comfortable room which was well decorated in muted colours. There were two small balconies overlooking the narrow street behind the hotel and there was no view except into the guest hour opposite. I didn't mind that as the bar on the top floor has good views over the harbour which sells food and wine until 0130 hrs. The staff were extremely helpful and welcoming and any questions were well handled and their advice on nearby restaurants reliable. I don't want to put anyone off staying in this hotel which is highly recommend by me, but from my room on the 4th floor you could hear the shouts and screams of the revellers in the nearby bars. Impossible to avoid in reality so bring earplugs like I did and you will sleep very soundly, as I did. Only one minor complaint but at breakfast the scrambled eggs which were cooked at maybe 0700 and left to harden in a warmer were not at all nice. But you could order fried/boiled eggs instead. Otherwise breakfast was good. The hamburger which I ate on the top floor was really good, as was the wine I had with it. The hotel located by the harbour is very convenient to all the locations that as a tourist you want to go. Wifi was free and fast enough for my needs. Great place! I will stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Duquesa for 4 nights. Highly recommended hotel! It’s in a beautiful, old part of the city, the Barri Gotic neighborhood, a lively, picturesque area with a wide variety of restaurants, bars, cafés, shops, and little plazas. The Duquesa is on the Passeig Colom which is along the waterfront and intersects the south end of the Ramblas, a short walk away. The Duquesa is easy to get to from the airport, simply take the RENFE train all the way to it’s terminus, the Estacio de Franca. From the station, walk along the Passeig Colom for about 3 blocks to the Duquesa. Real easy especially if you don’t have much luggage. To get to other parts of Barcelona, there is a subway station about 4 blocks away and taxis are easy to get in front of the hotel. The Duquesa is in a beautiful old former palace, it has an intimate but airy, and welcoming lobby. I was given a room (#28) on the backside of the hotel, it has a cute little balcony overlooking a small passageway/alley. The room itself has extra high ceilings, is spacious, just the right size for a couple. It has a nice mix of contemporary and traditional décor, but all the amenities are modern, well-maintained and everything works well. There’s both a shower stall and a bathtub. The bed and pillows are quite comfortable, towels plush. There’s wireless internet access but it wasn’t very easy to connect to, I gave up trying after a several attempts. There is, for free, one computer with internet access and a printer in the “business center” but it’s really just a little corner off a hallway. The staff is friendly, helpful, and very professional. They are very discreet yet readily available when you need them. Overall, the Duquesa is a great choice for its location, value for the money, amenities, service, ambiance, and comfort.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Duquesa de Cardona is a lovely small hotel. It locates waterfront area and you can walk to Ramblas street in a few minutes, 15 minute walk brings you to Catalunya Square. Tourist bus stop is also within a walking distance. By taking metro at Barceloneta station on LIne 4, you can reach CCBI easily. You can find good sea food restaurants along the museum nearby and we enjoyed a walk to a beautiful beach which is within 20 minute walk from the hotel. Piccaso museum which is within 5 minute walk worths visiting. The lobby was furnished with lovey furniture and scent of vanilla candle welcomed us.I stayed in a wheelchair accessible room with a roll-in shower. The bathroom is big enough for me to turn round there. The room was also enough big for us. We took breakfast at the restaurant on the ground floor for 2 days. It was good. We also reccommend you to visit the terrace on the 6th floor with your books and batheing suits. The view from there was exquisite and you can enjoy fresh breeze there with some wine and food. The hotel staffs were all friendly and very helpful. They speak fluent English. They booked wheelchair adapted taxi, booked concert tickets at Catalunya music hall, booked tickets of framenco show for us and showed us good restaurants. It was also fun to go to the guitar concert at the church. At last, I have to tell that you shoud be very careful so that you would not be targeted by pick pockets. My husband had his wallet stolen in a bus on line 24 which goes to Guel park. Some men surrounded us and while one man was pretending to help me with my wheelchair to attract my husband's attention, other men stole the wallet. I strongly advice you to take a tourist bus or a taxi when you move in Brcelona and never to take a normal bus. If I have another chance to visit Barcelona, I am sureto stay at Duquesa de Cardona again.</p></li>
