The room was a good size but for the price paid ($140) it was not worth the money. There are better value hotels in Sydney most of which are closer to shops, restaurants etc.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was not expecting much for the price (last minute deal on wotif) but was pleasantly surprised. The twin room was very generous in size and nice clean facilities. The bathrooms clean but a little dated but not dirty, just old. Only stayed the one night but would definitely consider this hotel again, even for a longer stay as there is plenty of room to swing a cat. Good location in the centre of Sydney an easy walk to the Convention Centre.</p></li>

The poor Citigate is well and truly ready for a make over but in the meantime you can pick up a great sized room in a reasonably good location for a fair price. The description on the mystery pick is "4 and a half star... near Chinatown, Darling Harbour and Cockle Bay". The staff are lovely. We stayed in room 1502 which had an amazing view.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice rooms. close to monorail, Chinatown. 15 minute walk to Darling Harbor. Helpful staff. In-hotel restaurant was mediocre. Good wired in-room broadband internet access but expensive at $Au 0.55/min, max $Au 29 /day. All-in-all a pleasant stay at a resonable price. Note: While we were there, this hotel was in the process of being re-named as Citygate Central, but as of 3/29/07 it is still listed as Carlton Crest on their website. This may change in the near future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My sisters and I booked the Citigate on a TV deal. It was $140 with breakfast and parking. We found this great value. The hotel is in a handy position. We found the staff to be exceptional and the breakfast was one of the better ones I have had. The hotel was very busy but we received excellent service. I have read that people have had trouble with rude staff but we found them to be very friendly and obliging. We stay in Sydney quite a bit and wouldn't hesitate in staying here again, especially at that price.</p></li>

The hotel held our luggage after we had checked out so that we could see the sights. Very close to Chinatown and Darling Harbour and the train station. After a day sight seeing, it was good to go back to somewhere peaceful, ordered a coffee and it came with a large glass of iced water, nice added touch. will come back soon. Only negative was that we had to lug our bags up the stairs, needs a lift or a ramp.</p></li>

Staff were fantastic and happy to help with anything, even the house keepers were very happy and chirpy in the mornings. The room must have been renovated within the last 12 months because it was fantastic, new looking paint, bathroom looked modern, no leaky taps! Fridge is tiny, can only fit one 2L bottle in there. The bed was fantastic, big queen bed with fantastic quilt. plenty of carparking, so this is not an issue. Will be staying here again for sure!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have never stayed in a hotel where there is no noise. Didn't hear any road traffic, no other bathrooms, no lifts - was fantastic and we stayed there on a night when there was a big rock concert in town and lots of concert goers coming in late and in party mode. Room was large compared to many and the value (booked way in advance) was great. Two queen beds and very comfortable. Bathroom aging, but rest of hotel looks recently refurbished. Staff friendly and obliging. Walking distance to Central Station, Entertainment Centre, China Town - very central.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for one night and enjoyed our stay very much. Rooms are a good size with 2 Queen Size beds, 2 desks and a big bathroom. The room has been refurbished with new furniture, manchester, etc, but carpet and bathrooms look to not have been touched. The carpet was very worn and had some well weathered stains that were unfortunate. The bathroom looked like it had been there since the hotel was built in the early 80's (at a guess) with a very outdated vanity and shower. Overall comfortable with good staff, posh lobby area and good car parking facilities.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'll keep it brief. Not too bad if you get it for a cheap Wotif rate like we did. If I paid any more than that I'd be pretty annoyed. I'm not really sure how they can claim it as 4.5 star. The rooms are spacious but old, dirty and in need of a refurbishment. No fans in the bathroom and there is water damage and mould everywhere. Finishings are all rotten and cracked and the carpet is dirty. The location is excellent. Across the road from Central train station. All up it's not too bad as long as you don't pay more than a heavily discounted rate. It's about 3 - 3.5 star.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Citigate central located in the heart of UTS. Surrounded by student accomdation and car parking. Close to china town which was a benefit. I only stayed one night to go to the casino down the road. Really I thought I would get a decent 4 star resort and I got something close to it. Breakfast was expensive and room service is a long wait. There were problems with checkout when i intended on paying using a $100 note for room service and they told me to pay card or get $64 change. Hmm not good for 4 star. I really wouldn't recomend staying here if it is longer than a night or two.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked through Wotif.com. This was a mystery hotel booking, $150.00 a night. Allocated a top floor room with King Bed nothing flash but very comfortable. Facilities in the room were adequate and in good condition. The location was ideal close to central & only a short walk to the SCEC Darling Harbour. A good variety of eateries around to choose from, predominantly Chinese/ Asian. There are a few decent bar/pubs nearby to relax in close by Reception staff were pleasant & helpful both at check in & out, housekeeping staff were also friendly & pleasant. Would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Date 15th June We stayed at The Citigate Central at Sydney from May 11th till May 16th and we had a great experience. Excellently located, just 10 minutes walking distance from Darling Harbour the hotel was fantastic. We arrived at 7.30 am and the hotel gave us an early check in at no extra charge, which was very sweet of them. The rooms were great with 2 queen size beds and three of (my wife, daughter and I) were extremely comfortable. The food was great and the breakfast spread was amazing. The staff were very helpful and couteous at all times. I reccommend all Indians to stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stay here a fair bit for work. I return here every 2 or 3 weeks as I believe it is good value for money, especially as the hotels in Sydney can be quite pricey. As previously stated it is right next to Chinatown so there are heaps of chinese restaurants along Dixon St. Also close to the Capitol Theatre & Central Station. Easy walk to Darling Harbour, Entertainment Centre & surrounds. Check in & out are always quick & efficient. Beds reasonably comfy. No real view to speak of. Internet in the rooms is expensive. Could do with a few more Foxtel channels. Carparking is an extra $20/day.</p></li>

Had the best time on a dinner bed and breakfast 'Spring Package'. The location was perfect for what we wanted - access to Darling Harbour and the Capitol Theatre. The executive king room offered on this deal was very spacious and clean and on the top floor with city views. Service throughout was helpful and professional. We especially enjoyed the taste and presentation of the meals at dinner in the restaurant. This was a great hotel and represented exceptional value comparatively for Sydney accommodation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is close to Central Station and very convenient to get to from the Airport. The hotel is trying to be fashionable, but is tired and worn out. The price is a bit high, in my opinion. I pay less for nice hotels in Tokyo. But what really gets me is the internet service. It has a daily download limit of 300MB. Watch one Youtube video, or have a 3 minute Skype conversation, and you're done for the day. If you don't need internet, well then it's just an alright hotel. If you're a business traveler, and rely on the internet. Then you'd best find a different hotel, 'cause you're not going to get your work done here.</p></li>

The hotel has a holiday inn feel to it - within walking distance of the train station and Hyde park + surrounded by shops this is a good base if all you want is somewhere to sleep. Beds were comfortable and rooms were clean. The shower was powerful and the water was always hot. I slept very well though my friend said she could hear the theme tunes from the theatre across the street - mary poppins was showing :-) The breakfast was average but as I said you are surrounded by places to eat. The room has a fridge which is a bonus.</p></li>

We had a hen's night booked at a venue in Oxford Street so the receptionist rang thru and booked a mini bus for us. The breakfast area is downstairs near reception.

You can walk to Darling Harbour, Paddys Markets are down the road. It was so great. The room was basic, comfortable. We had 2 kids and it fit us all comfortably. The breakfast was pretty average. The service was terrible. It took 3 times to get a portacot delivered, and that was even in the email booking. It eventually came as a bed at 1130pm!! Then was taken back and brought back as a cot. The kitchen staff were also very short, dropped items and did not return to pick things up. I would return for the great location and hope that the service improves.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very obliging staff, nothing was too much trouble. On check out, before I even got a chance to ask, a staff member had checked if I needed any storage for my luggage for the day, and whether I would be needing an airport transfer. Both of which I needed, and probably would have had to ask about anyway, but it was nice that they were proactive and obliging to help. Booked through wotif as a mystery deal, and couldn't be happier with both the price and the service. The hotel is also situated in a great location, a little walk from the CBD heart, but very accessable and I felt very safe walking around the area. I would definately visit again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for a quick weekend getaway. We found it extremely handy to walk to Darling Harbour, Paddys Markets, shopping and other transport options etc. The whole place was so well kept and clean. The pool area is really nice - not huge but enough to cool down on a hot day. The staff were friendly and helpful and the food in the restaurant was great and considering where the hotels is it wasnt too badly priced. They even cooked us food that wasnt on the menu (fussy kids and husband). Also amazingly as you are in the middle of a city there was no noise because the hotel is kind of tucked away in a nice quiet street. Really great value for money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our 2nd stay at Citigate and we will be back. Easy walking distance to Capitol Theatre where we watched the wonderful "Mary Poppins" production. Our teenage daughters walked to Paddys Market on Saturday afternoon - only a couple of minutes away. Plenty of restaurant and food options close to Citigate or you can dine at their restaurant/bar. We paid for buffet breakfast which was good value - also 24 hour parking in the parking station next door. Only complaint would be the fact that we were woken up at 5am by noisy neighbours which went on for over an hour but once I rang room service they sent Security to speak to the occupants and noise stopped.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this on a discount website at a very good price and thus didn't know what to expect. I was very pleasantly surprised by how wonderful the Citigate Central was. It is tucked away on an obscure street but just off a main street (George), and is very conveniently located...a 5 minute walk to Central Railway Station. The front desk staff were VERY helpful and accomodating and gave me my room prior to check-in time. The room was very bright, airy, clean, and modern. Comfortable bed. Great views. Again, very clean. Everything has been recently remodeled and there is still some renovation going on. Nice rooftop pool. One of the best hotels I've stayed at in Sydney.</p></li>

At 2 pm the room wasn't ready, at 5:30 pm we got key and found out the room had 1 king bed only for 3 adults. Reception told us they would bring up bed. After dinner at 9:30 pm we went back to room and still no bed. Had too complain and got bed straight away. The bed was a roll out that wasn't made up and all dusty. Not happy. Facilities were clean and working. Pool was very nice but on the small side. Great views of city. Only average for $250 a night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Definitely not a 4 star hotel. The age of the hotel is showing, especially in the bathrooms in the rooms. They've kept the function rooms and reception areas nice but forgotten about the actual rooms. You expect at least an above average bathroom when you pay for a 4 star hotel, but here they are ancient and very ordinary, with simple plain tiles and fittings you'd find in a modest house, not a 4 star hotel. There are only two lifts servicing some 18 floors, and if your room is on the higher floors, it can be a commute to get down to reception. It took them days to get the Internet in my room working. And no it wasn't wifi. The buffet breakfast was expensive and didnt have much variety.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First, I would normally give this kind of hotel 3 stars. However, most hotels in Sydney seem over-priced these days and it was delightful to find a good place, in a good location at a good price. I stayed here when was the Carlton Crest and, besides the new (simplified) lobby, not a lot has changed. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable of the local area and the rooms are comfortable. I have read a lot of negative comments about this end of town, but I much prefer it to the northern end of the city. There are plenty of great restaurants (especially Chinese) and Paddy's market is only a 2-minute walk. As one of the other posters mentioned, stay there if you can get a good package/rate.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently spent one night at this hotel and was satisfied with my choice! Firstly, may I just say that I got a cheaper rate on 'wotif' which included full buffet breakfast for 2 & parking. Reception staff very efficient, courteous and cheerful. Breakfast was very good with plenty of hot food, pastries etc and definately value for money! Parking was just that....can't fault parking. Room was quiet and spotless. However, there was a shower curtain over the bath and I did not like that aspect. Also bed mattress was a bit hard but that is probably due to my own preferences and no fault of the hotel. All in all this is a good, clean hotel with a terrific buffet breakfast and pleasant staff. Would stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked the mystery deal on wotif and got this hotel (we were pretty sure it was the hotel from the description before we booked!). It was $120 which is cheap for Sydney. The check-in was quick and polite and we were allocated a room on a high floor, as requested, with a King Bed. The corridor is a little off putting as it is very bright and sparse, but the room was fine. It was large with a big TV and a reasonable sized shower (but the bathroom was a bit dated). The TV had a few extra channels but no digital. The bed was comfortable and we enjoyed our stay. We would recommend for the great location in Chinatown - really near to all the shops, bakeries, Market City etc. And easy to get to from Central station.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our room was definately not 4 star quality (on some sites it's even described as 4.5 stars!). To me it was more like 3 star at most. Carpet horribly stained and old, rust marks on walls, desk coming away from the wall, tatty cheap sideboard.Tiny bathroom - could barely move about in it. Couldn't relax in the bath as it was stained and had grey patches. We asked for another room but it was even worse. Most rooms look out into what seems to be student high rise flats- interesting if you like observing other peoples' lives at close range. A minority of rooms have a panoramic view. I got the impresison the hotel is just letting its rooms run right down. How it got a 4 star rating I don't know -unless some floors are better than others??</p></li>

The rooms may be a bit dated to todays standards but still very functional and comfortable. The pool was great, heated which was good as the kids still wanted to go swimming even when it was cold. Buffet breakfast was good lot to choose from. The breakfast staff I felt were a bit rude, but maybe just very stressed with the breakfast rush. In all our stay was very nice peaceful, will stay there again...</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at Citigate Central just before the New Year celebrations in Sydney. One of the main appeals of the hotel is the outside pool, handy in the summer. The pool itself is quite compact and also offers a jacuzzi as well. Hotel seemed very popular with families, may just have been the time of year. Hotel room was decent size, good bed, sofa and modern TV. The thing that let the room down was the bathroom. Bathroom definitely needs replacing, looks dated and old. Cracked tiles, cheap fittings. Looks like it may have been put in quick for Olympics in 2000. Staff generally friendly and helpful. Hotel location is just north of Darling Harbour near China Town. 20 minute walk to downtown CBD. 5 minute walk to monorail and 555 free bus taking you downtown.</p></li>

Also be aware - there's no way you'll be allowed to check-in a little early at this hotel (even if your room is ready and cleaned). When i stayed there, due to my international flight (14 hours) I arrived at the hotel about 10:00am. I was hoping that I could maybe check-in a little early around 12:00 if my room was available.... though I was very rudely told that regardless if my room is ready or not I could not check in until 3:00pm period... When checking out (which took about 15 minutes) the reception seemed to be receiving a lot of complaints. I definitely wouldn't stay there again. Many better options in that district.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed with partner and it was a great hotel. Beds and quiet surroundings excellent considering location of Haymarket. It was actually in a very quiet and safe area just a 2 minute walk to Central Station. About a 10 minute walk to Town Hall Station. Breakfast was very good clean good selection. Cappacinos were extra (only $3) but the staff were upfront and the coffee was well worth it. (regular coffee from percolator available for free) Given the taste of the food from the restaurant I am disappointed that I didn't try dinner. For the price this was a bargain, bathrooms a little tired but for the price who cares, the beds, TV, staff, breakfast and location all fabulous. I would stay here again. Walked home at 11pm from the station safe area loved it. Staff were fabulous.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This would be our sixth stay at the Citigate Hotel Sydney. Our previous stays were acceptable but our stay on Friday 7/10/11 will be our last. We arrived at 3 pm. I had book two rooms for two couples and found that they had cancelled one of the rooms because they thought that I duplicated the booking. Wouldn't you at least ring to confirm??? The room we were finally given was dirty and not in the best condition. The shower walls were mouldly, the cupboard that had the bar fridge inside had fallen off it's hinges due too water damage, stains on the carpet and to top it off there was a condom wrapper on the floor behind the waste paper bin in the room. There is far better hotel rooms in the city for $200 a night. Think twice....... I have stayed in better backpacker hostels.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for two days in late December after Christmas. We stayed under the Sydney Weekender promotion, which was excellent value and I didn't feel that any aspect of our stay was compromised by getting this heavily discounted rate. Great staff especially at check in, early check-in and getting a balcony room were not a problem. The room was clean and comfortable with two queen beds, and great blackout curtains. Bathroom was a little bit dated, but clean and well equipped. Didn't hear any noise from street or other guests. Breakfast was good, parking easy on-site, and the pool area, although small, was nice with chairs and a few lounges. Great location one block from Paddy's Market for cheap shopping, and a huge food court area. Excellent value, would definately stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for four nights on business in Sydney. Firslty, the staff were very pleasant and helpful and the beds were fantastic. The location is very central for walking to the convention centre, paddys market and Chinatown. My allocated room had a problem with a noise coming from a pipe above the ceiling which sounded like a running tap all night. On request, on the second night of not being able to sleep I was given a change of room. The second room was on the same floor as the pool ( which was closed for repairs), and the hallway stank of damp mouldy carpet. The food in the restaurant was pretty ordinary and there are lots of better option nearby. Overall I would stay here again if the price was right as it is so centrally located, the staff were helpful and the beds were great.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for the long weekend - special occassion. I booked on wotif.com and requested a non smoking room with a nice view. We got a room on the 12th floor. The staff were friendly and the room was nice and clean. The furniture was nice- recently refubished. The hotel is located on a quiet street in china town. There are plenty of cheap places to eat near by and Darling Habour and city central are walking distance (don't where heels =o). I reccommend the Dela France on George st for brekkie or naughty snack. Yummy quiches, french pastries and beautiful coffee - open 24/7. mini bar is overpriced but there is a conveniance store accross the road. Over all I really enjoyed my stay at the citigate central. I liked that it wasnt in the heart of the city - it was a bit more relaxed and there wasn't swarms of people everywhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this trip as a suprise for my very pregnant sister. We had tickets to a concert so I picked this hotel because 1. It was close to the entertainment centre and 2. there was a parking garage attached to the hotel. When we arrive at approx 3pm we went up to our room and the room had not been made up, sheets still messed up from last guest , towels on the floor and ironing board in the middle of the room. We were then given a new room. After returning back from the concert late we got a phone cal at 455am and when I answered it was the hotels hold music. When I checked out a day early and told the reception staff about this they just said " thats weird" Then after paying an arm and a leg for parking I returned to my car to find it had been broken into. I have to say circumstances spoilt this weekend but the hotel did not make it any better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is a little hard to find, being tucked away at the end of Thomas Street. Once you do find it however, you realise the perfect location !! Its right near Chinatown, Paddy's Market and an easy stroll to the harbour. The hotel has had a renovation and the foyer, restaurant and rooms are fantastic. The only thing lacking in the room we had was the bathroom. I really despise paying good money for a room only to find it has a shower curtain instead of a glass shower housing (just a little quirk of mine). The hotel itself was quite nice, however, the service was not ideal. The concierge was a little snooty and cleary thought that the cut to my friends leg and buttock sustained from the rough edges of the soap holder where of no great concern. Apart from this, our experience at this hotel was quite good. Ask for a harbour view room if possible!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay at the Citigate Central Hotel was great - the location is fantastic, the staff were always extremely friendly and helpful, the room was very clean and spacious - absolutely no complaints. We got great rates and realised when we got there that it was probably because the hotel is undergoing renovations at the moment, but it didn't affect us in the slightest. (We were up on the 10th floor so lower floors might be affected..not sure though...). We had a room with 2 queen beds and there were 4 of us girls but still more than enough space for all of our suitcases etc. The only thing that went wrong was the hairdryer in the bathroom stopped working on the 2nd day, but a replacement arrived about 5 minutes after we called reception. The little rooftop pool is great, too! Underground parking is also considerably cheaper than other city hotels, so a great deal all round! Will definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hard to believe this claims to be a four-star hotel. Stayed one night for in a standard queen room for business, which was $229- I would not be happy paying that price if I was staying for leisure. Location is ok for transport but not near good shopping, about 500m walk from Central station, next to UTS and on the edge of Chinatown. Rooms are decorated in a 'modern' style, which in this case means drab and lifeless with no flair whatsoever. Bathroom was the worst part - dark (one fluorescent tube above the mirror which provided very little illumination into the shower with the curtain drawn), chipped tiles, stains in the bottom of the bathtub. Soap wrapped in plastic wrap instead of an option of liquid shower gel. Really, this hotel needs to get with the times, see what is offered overseas at this price point, and not rely on its convenient location alone for business. I will choose to stay elsewhere in future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We discovered on arrival that we couldn't check into our room after a 9 hour flight until 2pm - it was only 9.30am!! I had even requested an early check in time but they still wouldn't let us check in. They did allow us to leave our luggage there while we left to see the sights of Sydney (the last thing you want to do after a 9 hour flight!). The staff were friendly enough but their service wasn't much to rave about. I didn't use the gym but had a look at it and it looked quite good, so did the swimming pool. Our room was a good size, clean and had a comfortable bed. The view was of other buildings. The bathroom was tiny & a bit run down. We looked at the room service menu & then put it back down again as it was really overpriced. The location isn't too bad though for places to eat at night (instead of the expensive hotel) but it is quite far from the harbour. Overall not too bad but I've stayed in better hotels.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I along with my 2 girls aged 10 and 12 stayed at Citigate Central Sydney for 2 nights and we couldn't have asked for more. We had a great room on the 8th floor, our room had a sliding door which lead onto a little verandah and garden and also a heated pool which is very clean and inviting. The rooms were really clean and comfy and it was so quiet at night so sleeping was no problem. The staff which includes house keeping and the door men were always polite and acknowledged us if we passed them in the hall way. The buffet brekky was to die for and if you like a sleep in, that's ok because their brekky goes till 11am. Citigate central is exactly that, central to the entertainment centre, paddys markets, chinatown and you can just jump on the monorail and in a few minutes youre at THE STAR. Has undercover parking. Would definately recommend Citigate and they will definately see me and my family back there.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Citigate last week-end and were very disappointed with the customer service and blandness of the hotel rooms and reception area. There was no storage space for clothing other than hanging space, and the only light in the very small bathroom was over the vanity mirror. After returning from the Mardi Gras Parade at 10.30pm we discovered the hotel bar was closed, and we were told rather curtly we could drink in our room. While the location was good, it does look out onto what looked like a bomb site. The service lift was out of order so the hotel staff had to travel in the guest lifts with trollies etc, and on more than one occasion when the lift arrived it was not possible to get in because of staff transporting dirty crockery linen etc. We stayed with a couple visiting us from the UK and were embarressed at the choice we had made having stayed in much better Sydney hotels in the past for less than we paid at the Citigate.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the hotel for a week on business. It's in a good location to the south of the CBD, close to Central Station, Paddy's Markets and Chinatown, so there's plenty of restaurants and shops around the area. It's a bit of a walk to Darking Harbour, and further still to Pitt St Mall and Circular Quay. Sydney is expensive, but the hotel seemed relatively good value for money. The room looked rather tired - especially the bathroom. I'm sure everything here pre-dated the Sydney Olympics. My colleagues complained of noisy neighbours to their rooms, but I lucked out and had a quiet stay. The room was not afforded a great view - I was looking straight into an office building. There was an LCD TV but the stations were analogue and distorted. I tried room service on two occasions - it was tasty, but slow and expensive. Given my work commitments I wasn't too fussed with the hotel, but if I were coming back to Sydney as a tourist I'd look elsewhere</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed her for 4 nights and really enjoyed our stay. The rooms were very nice and had all the satellite TV stations. Chinatown is right around the corner and Central station is no more than a 6 or 7 minute walk which makes getting around the city very easy. We did not find the staff to be unpleasant as such, but we did not find them overly pleasant either. One example would be that we kept getting messages everytime we turned on our TV offering us discounted breakfast the next morning. We mentioned this to reception and they said that that was fine so we proceeded to the dining area where we were told that they didnt know what we were on about. The girl in the dining area reluctantly rang reception (about 10feet away) to look into it and then told us that it was ok. She didnt seem very happy about it for some reason. There is a small gym on the 8th floor and a small swimming pool and jacuzzi on the 11th (if I remember correctly) Overall a very good hotel and compared to the prices in Sydney it is good value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here only one night and was pleasantly surprised by appearance of Citigate and professionalism of front desk staff upon arrival. Was upgraded to one of only four suites on the 18th floor without even asking-the suite was larger than some apartments I've lived in. Travelling with a 2 year old and 3 month old I was impressed they took the time to bump us up and it was greatly appreciated as they could have kept us in a standard room (which I'm sure would have been adequate). Ordered a baby cot which arrived within minutes of checking in and then room service. Food was adequate-soup was excellent. Location was perfect-a 5 minute walk to Central Station so you could stay here and go anywhere easily within city or outer burbs-was a $33 cab ride from the airport. The hotel seems to spring out of nowhere-area is obviously getting developed but if you're not fussy about a harbour view I would forgo all that for pleasant, professional staff and clean, comfortable, reasonably priced room. Would stay here again anytime in Sydney.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for one night, whilst in sydney on business, great location near darling harbour, short walk to chinatown and george street. The hotel is not a luxurary hotel for the honeymoon, romantic weekend or view of harbour and city lights - but it was clean, comfortable and decent. My husband and I bring our kids to sydney frequently to catch shows, city ambience or shopping and mostly select hotels near to Darling Harbour - I would stay here again. Room 1016 had 2x double beds, mini bar, shower/bath, window outlook to garden below and budildings across, blackout curtains. Access to paid parking next door, busy foyer - felt safe -lots of people coming and going, nice bar area - comfortbale lounge. Good breakfast- small area, basic selections but covered all the neccesities - bacon, eggs, tomato, sausage, fruit, toast, muffins, cerals and juice. I would reccomend this hotel for location and not breaking the bank, it would suit business stay, trip with the kids and anybody else looking for good location. Bookable on wotif for $120</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I would never go back to this hotel. After 3 weeks of excellent hotels and service on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland we were dropped back down to earth when checking in. First of all, we booked 2 rooms as there were 4 of us, when checking in they had us down for 1 room, 2 double beds (1 being a settee). We argued and argued with different people until they agreed to put us in two separate rooms (no apology or anything). Then one of the 2 no smoking rooms we were given smelt of smoke. Not just smoke but fresh smoke. The carpets in both rooms were also stained and needed a good clean and the shower in 1 room was not working properly. It seems that with this hotel if you a business prerson they accomodate you, if you are on holiday you are just an inconvenience. To top it off, we wanted a taxi and when we asked it was as if it was a hassle to ring. The location is not too good either, right in the middle of chinatown. $8 for 1 hour of internet access is extortionate and everything that is in your room you have to pay for.

<li><b>Title:</b> “Second â€œDateâ€� At The Citigate. This Could Get Serious.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staying at any hotel is a bit like dating, if youâ€™re impressed by your first time, given the opportunity; you hope for a second date, just too make sure that you werenâ€™t taken in by the occasion the first time out. Recently, I had my: â€œsecond dateâ€� at the Citigate Sydney (again for business). This time, I was allocated a room on the 11th floor which overlooked the pool. Thanks too the Sydney winter, bathers were at a premium- apart from a couple of foolhardy children, who splashed away with thermal insulated abandonment, while their frozen fathers watched on with rapidly freezing pride. I have already written a longer review on my first stay titled: â€œAll Business with A Little Pleasure.â€� Therefore I donâ€™t have a great deal to add. The room was clean, the bed very comfortable.

<li><b>Title:</b> “Charged additional money afterwards - without reason!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay itself wasn't terrible, but what happened afterwards was more than that! When paying the bill with my european credit card an AUD and a Euro ammount was shown. I asked twice, whether I will be charged in AUD, being aware the the exchange rate wasn't good. I was twice told that I will be charged in AUD. Checking my account later, I saw that they charged for the bad Euro rate - that cost me about 10 Euro (approx. 20 AUD). OK, I checked the receipt again and saw that I signed to accept this - my fault but however a really bad behaviour of the receptionist I think. But it came better - some days later I realized that they charged additional 3 Euro from my credit card. I tried to contact the hotel twice per mail, without any reaction. That's a really presuming behaviour! I know that it's not really a big amount of money, but it's the principle. Besides that trouble the standard of the hotel is not 4.5 stars. Huge stains on the carpet and a perhaps 2 star bathroom. Small and old. After this experience, I will avoid to book a room in any of the hotels of this group.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am normally willing to overlook small issues with customer service, however this place was no where near what a 4.5 star hotel should be like. I think because it is a very big conference centre, the individual customer does not matter. On five of the six occasions we had to deal with reception they were bordering between indifferent to very rude. We had booked a deluxe double room (king size bed) and were put in a twin room, this was not fixed. The room itself, looked like and old 3 star hotel with some new furniture. The carpet was badly stained all over, the desk was unclean, but the biggest issue was the bathroom. In all the 4 star hotels I have stayed at, none have come close to the one in the city gate central. It was OLD, small, and downright dingy. Hopefully the photos will do it justice, no wonder they donâ€™t show photos of it on the website The only positives were the soft beds with nice linen and large TV and location wise it is very close to central station and china town. Overall there are better places to stay in Sydney for better customer service and rooms, at similar rates.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have recently returned from the Citigate Central with my partner and also met up with my family over there. Check in was very easy and they gave us rooms next door to each other. The rooms were very clean and comfortable for what we paid and I find any one travelling with a family will not be disappointed with this hotel. The hotel is situated right by the Paddy's Markets (within 2 minutes walk) and two blocks away is the monorail which will take you to the heart of Darling Harbour as well as around the city centre so you can hop off and on where ever you like (AUD9.00 for an all day pass and family passes are cheaper). From Darling Harbour you can catch a ferry around to the rocks (still very cheap about AUD5.00) and have a look around the rocks markets which are fantastic as well as go under the Sydney Harbour bridge and beside the Sydney Opera House. Also from where you catch the monorail you can catch the tram and go to the fish markets for all you seafood lovers. I believe it is definately a great hotel in a prime location without paying the costs of staying in Darling Harbour itself!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just spent one night in Sydney to see Jersey Boys. Chose the Citigate Central because of offer on Getaway-$140 including full buffet breakfast and parking. Arrived at 12-30pm and check-in was efficient, friendly and immediate. Room had twin queen beds-very comfortable, very clean and linen beautifully laundered and room had an interesting view of a multi-storey home unit block- felt like being back in Hong Kong. Being a week day the pool area was deserted and great to have pool area to ourselves-ample fresh towels in pool area for guests. The buffet breakfast was adequate and regularly restocked. Location is close to George street which meant an easy walk to get a bus or train to uptown. Ok, it is not the Hilton, Shangri-La or Swissotel but I have paid three times the price of the Citi-gate to stay in such hotels . Had a beer and buffet dinner at the Sky Tower-you do not go for the food but the spectacular 360 degree views of Sydney- it is a must for first time visitors to Sydney. Midweek the buffet is $64 a person-good value considering it costs $25 per person just to take the lift for the spectaculr views.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Citgate for two nights at the end of November. I found the overall experience satisfactory and felt with the deal I had got which included breakfeast at $AUD189 per night was reasonable value for Sydney. The hotel is really a typical four star property (even though they give themselves 4 &1/2) and I found it to be clean, and reasonably maintained with large rooms and relatively comfortable beds. The reason I say it is 4 star is it just lacks some of the trappings of luxury required to be at that next level. My overall experience with the staff was generally positive although the desk staff need a little more training as a few of my simple requests confused them pretty quickly but they were at least polite. My only minor negatives are the lifts which are inadequate and at peak times are painfully slow, and the location. It is not a particularly pretty part of Sydney but luckily the nicer surrounds of Darling Harbour & Cockle Bay are only a 10 min stroll away. Overall if you are in town and only require somewhere to lay your head that a) isn't a dump but b) isn't going to break your budget, then the Citigate fits the bill nicely.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel staff lost one of our bags, and we discovered they had "misplaced it" by giving it to another person leaving the hotel. In the time that the hotel had "possession" of our bag (although its hard to know how long it left the hotel for), valuable items were stolen from the bag. The hotels response at the time was lazy and inept, providing us with little information about what was going on, and took them nearly an hour into the ordeal to even apologise. We missed our bus home because of their incompetency, and then when they gave us cash to catch another bus, they didn't give us enough. The most offensive aspect of this trial, was that when we asked if we would be compensated for the items lost, when the hotel gave our bag to a completely different person, we got a cold response of "no we are not liable". They may as well left our luggage out in the street, to be plundered - and if they had done this, they apparently still wouldn't have any liability. This may be a typical stance of many hotels, but considering that Citigate actually gave our bag to another person, and then poorly managed the situation was enough to convince my partner and I that this hotel is worthy of 0 stars.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at this hotel and was keen to come back for another pleasant stay. However this time I booked on the internet, and not through a travel agent as I had before. That will teach me! The site said that our room came with a balcony, and as I had noticed on my previous stay, not all rooms came with a balcony - so after making the booking I quickly rang the the website to confirm that would indeed have a balcony room...to which they promised. However upon arrival I brought this up at Check-In and a Balcony Room had not been specified at all...VERY annoying! After a lengthy discussion with the Receptionist who initially said that we shouldn't exepct an automatic upgrade (Which we didn't - we just expected the room we booked!) she finally relented and met us halfway by only giving us a part charge for upgrading our room. ...Can I please make it clear that this was not the Hotels' fault, and may I warn you to be very clear when making bookings online and confirm that you are indeed getting what you pay for! From here on in we had an amazing stay - they were more than helpful on any requests we made, the rooms were more than adequate, the pool was well heated, and I was pleased to have the Balcony I actually booked - what can I say... I like fresh air!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room was spacious, but sparsely furnished. Bathroom dated. Considering the price tag of $250+ per night it was incredibly average. The breakfast: I probably wouldn't bother & just go to a nice cafe instead. The main issues: * When the bathroom got steamy I could see writing in the mirror (see attached photo) hand prints & writing that said "I see you" - very creepy. * I mistakenly left my mobile charger in the room after I checked out. I approached the front office staff & asked them see if Housekeeping could retrieve it for me, I was advised that it wasn't in the room. I insisted that they re-check & that I'd return after my conference to collect it. 2 hours later I returned to reception to be told it definitely wasn't in the room. Yet again I explained where it was & that I knew it was there & asked them to check again. In the meantime I needed to leave to make my flight. Sure enough they hotel called & they had it. Today it arrives - but get this ... they charged the postage on collection!!!! Ok, I acknowledge it was my error in the first place, but the cheek of charging me for the postage when they told me on 2 occasional that it wasn't there when it was PLUS they never told me they were going to charge me the postage! Absolutely appalling service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Describing the Citigate Central in one word I would say it is OK. I have stayed multiple times at the Citigate for business. The lifts are sooo slow, one morning I waited 8 minutes for one of the 3 lifts to come grab me from level 12 (not the highest!) everytime I have waited for the lift it has taken ages, with this in mind I started leaving my room 5 minutes earlier so I wouldn't miss my bus! The breakfast bar is sometimes a bit hit and miss- some mornings it is really nice fresh food and some mornings its a struggle to get anything remotely nice. The toaster is an issue and the bread is always stale. On multiple occasions there have been tour busses come through with loud, rude people who the hotel have trouble catering for on top of their guests who are staying at the hotel. The front stairs are a pain when arriving, as no one has ever been there to assist me with carrying my heavy suitcase up the stairs. The rooms are ok, the plumbing was extremely loud last time I stayed and the carpeted floor is stained pretty bad in some rooms. On one occasion I rang the hotel to ammend a booking and was kept on hold for 10 minutes only to be told i'd have to ring back in half an hour! The staff are generally nice but some of them can be quite rude. I would never stay here if I had a choice but I don't.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pretty reasonable hotel in an area undergoing renewal. Not quite in the heart of things, this 3.5-4 star hotel is on the edge of Sydney closer to Ultimo than it is to Chinatown. The area is a little seedy but lots of new buildings underway. A 10 minute walk from Central Station, it is close to all the major bus lanes and you can be at Circular Quay quite quickly (a 25 minute walk otherwise). I was there for business so didn't use the car park, gym or pool so can't comment on these. The restaurant was really good for dinner and has a very good, comprehensive buffet breakfast which would please anyone. Ambiance in the lobby and restaurants was OK and service very good. The rooms though felt very sterile even though the room I had was large and well equipped with a king size bed, sofa, work desk, flat screen TV etc. Stark white walls would have benefited by a picture or two. I was on the 18th floor so the room was quite quiet - although no real views to speak of. Room service was very good...fast service and good food at reasonable cost. Overall, this is a good choice if you really want to be up this end of town and practically on the edge of the CBD. It is close to Chinatown and the UTS. Personally, I think there are much better choices closer to the heart of the city but at least the Citigate is close to most transport options.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I travelled to sydney recently and stayed in the citygate, I found the service at the front desk really great and the staff were always pleasent and willing to help in anyway they could. When i got there my Airline had mixed up my bags so i had no clothes, the staf said they would take what bags i had 2 the room and then pointed me in the right direction...not that i had to walk far as the Citygate is very near central and george st...also Chinatown and Paddys markets so i was spoilt for choice! The room wasnt amazing but very big and spacious with everything needed for a modest hotel i would advertise it at 3 star if they didnt have the rooftop pool The 1 thing that i could complain about was the fact they advertised broadband in the rooms and there wasnt any, when i asked about it they sold me a card that was $10 for an hour, but u cant use it for 5 and still have 55mins left...it was literally for that hour so i ended up paying $10 for 5mins internet...other than that though i thought it was excellent and would stay there again. I would recommend staying here if you want good service and a roof over your head while you look around the city..DONT stay here if u want views of the oprea house and harbour and expect your poodle to have spa treatments everyday...in fact if your 1 of those people please dont come to Australia at all!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Citigate Central for 2 nights in early November. We got a really good deal through Wotif (it was one of their Mystery Deals where you don't know the name of the hotel until you've booked) and this hotel is fine for the money we paid. However, if I'd have paid their basic rate, I wouldn't have been very impressed. The rooms are OK but could do with refreshing and updating. The bathroom especially needed a lot of work doing to it. It was very dated and there was a lot of water damage to part of the door and the door frame and it just looked tired and scruffy. The bedroom carpet had a huge pink stain on it and the room just needs a bit of a 'freshen up'. The walls between the rooms are also very thin and so if you're next to someone a little bit loud, you'll be able to hear them really clearly. However, the bed and pillows were nice and comfy, the hotel is in a convenient location for the train station, China Town and Darling Harbour and the room we had was a nice size. The restaurant also looked nice and seemed to have food at a reasonable price (although we didn't dine there). They were also happy to store our luggage for us as our flight back to the UK wasn't until late afternoon. All things considered, an OK hotel, especially if you can get it for a good price. But there are so many other options in Sydney, we won't stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My mother and I booked this hotel as a Wotif mystery deal for $140/pn for a twin room for our short trip to Sydney. Upon check-in/check-out the staff were very friendly, helpful and professional, which made for a nice stay. Our room on the 9th floor was well appointed, spacious and maintained to a good standard - beds were large and comfortable enough, tea and coffee making facilities well stocked during our stay and rooms aptly cleaned everyday. We had to close our curtains a few time as we were directly opposite and within close proximity to a large office building â€“ though we were out most of the day, so this didnâ€™t affect us a great deal. The pool & attached spa were a treat and open till an appropriate time in the evening (10pm) which meant we could go for a relaxing dip after returning from a huge day of sightseeing (not too many children about either which was peaceful :) ) We did notice the construction work across the road but never really heard any disruptive noises etc. We opted to leave out breakfast at the hotel, so canâ€™t comment on this (though skip the charge and head down the road to the beautiful Chinese garden for some lovely scones and tea!). Same goes for internet â€“ not sure what the rates are, there are e a few computers available for use in the lobby though which may be handy for some. Overall we had a pleasant stay and would consider returning in the future if booked at the same price.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On the surface, this is a clean hotel, with decent service, comfortable beds and good facilities. A short stay soon reveals its flaws, though. I ordered room service at what was obviously a busy time. The person who took my order apologised that I would have to wait 40 minutes. 90 minutes later I rang back, found the order unfilled, and cancelled it. Luckily it wasn't much of a walk to find a late night takeaway. The broadband was equally disappointing; it was frightfully slow and at times just stopped, just like the room service! And if that wasn't enough, the lifts were also extremely slow, and just as prone to stopping. Of the three lifts, only two were ever working at one time during my two night stay, and sometimes only one was functioning. Using the stairs to go down from the eleventh floor was equally frustrating, as the ground floor is not marked from the stairwell, and I found myself (along with a few other guests) interrupting a school excursion when we found ourselves on the lower ground floor instead. I also had to leave extra time in the morning for ironing, as the iron is the steamless variety and wasn't particularly useful. The catering is reasonable. Mushrooms marked as 'eggs' isn't a big problem, but it reflects the general atmosphere in the restaurant. On some fronts, this hotel is better than many, but some of these problems were particularly frustrating, and overall, I just found myself running around the whole time trying to make up for lost time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed in Sydney on business about 5 times at different hotels in a price range of $125-$350 per night The best being Swisshotel, We had two nights at this hotel it was not the best at any price. The reception staff are very welcoming and willing to help with anything you needed, We got a good rate for this hotel so I think it was good value for the price given its central location, But would not have wanted to pay more as the hotel seem to need some maintenance. The cleaners are less than impressive, the shower floor was black with mould and the grout was dirty.... could go on but you get the idea(Would not recommend leaving valuables in the room,as we had some money taken from our room) the house keeper must have thought it was payment for not cleaning it properly. Breakfast buffet was very nice with a good variety freshly made hot and cold food (TIP PREPAY BREAKFAST ITS CHEAPER.) If you don't wish to dine here there are plenty of food outlets with in short walking distance Swimming pool was warm which was good as it was quite cold when we were there there is also a hot spa The gym had good equipment which was in use both times we tried to use it so may have been a bit small It was possible we had higher expectations of a Citigate hotel, as we had stayed at the Citigate Brisbane prior which is a much better hotel so don't expect this hotel to be up to the same standard Saying this I would stay again depending on the hotels price and availability of other hotels</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed in Sydney many times on work-related business, however this is the first time I had stayed at the Citigate Central. As this was a work conference with bulk booking of rooms, I thought I would get one of the least modern rooms, but this wasn't the case. The room was very large, nice flat screen TV, the bathroom could have done with a revamp as the grout had gone mouldy in quite a few places. There was obvious signs of wear and tear around the room, but nothing bad at all. The room was very quiet and the queen bed was quiet comfortable. I didn't hear a thing from outside the room once in bed. The breakfast and lunch supplied as part of our conference at the Citigate were both very impressive. I enjoyed both meals as did I enjoy the morning and afternoon tea offered as part of the conference package. We walked down to Darling Harbour precinct for dinner, and although the walk as a bit long, it was enjoyable after being inside all day. The conference room was just perfect in size for our needs and apart from a loud crowd in an adjoining conference room and the air con which was a bit cold, despite asking for it to be turned up a couple of times, I don't think the temperature changed at all. The conference room had a balcony as part of the break out area, which was pretty nice. All in all, I dont think the stay there was bad at all. Could do with disabled rooms, which they don't seem to have and I thought would almost be mandatory with any renovation now in such a modern multicultural city as Sydney.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband & I stayed here in recently and were very pleased. We stayed in the Harbour View Executive suite on the top floor. Its one of 2 rooms that has a balcony. The room wasnt as big as I thought it would be but very modern and clean. The King size bed was the most comfortable bed Ive slept in for years. There were lovely soft robes hanging up for us, plenty of towells even though we only stayed 2 nights and all the things you might need like tea & coffee making facilities, iron, hair dryer, phone, internet access. The one thing that was missing was a spa. We thought that the best room in the hotel would have a spa or atleat a bath but there was only a shower but it could fit 5 people in there...if you wanted to. We had a lovely view of Darling Harbour & it was a 2 min walk to Paddys markets & China Town. The staff were very helpful & friendly and well mannered. Just be careful walking around that area late at night. I felt a bit uneasy because its on a fairly quiet street and someone was stabbed on the street the day we got there but i guess that can happen anywhere. There arent a lot of restaurants near by unless you want chinese food so I suggest talking a short walk to Darling Harbour & eating at one of the many grat restaurants there. I would definately go back. Luckily we got a deal through a friend & only paid $150 a night. Its usually about $300 a night which is well worth it. Its also only a few mins walk to the Entertainment Centre so its perfect if your going to a concert there. One tip though: use the parking across the street, its only $10 a night compared to $35 a night in the hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A good hotel in central Sydneyâ€Ž”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were a bit worried by some of the poor reviews but decided to try it anyway. Parking our car in the adjacent carpark was easy, and the $23 cost for 24 hours parking seemed very reasonable for the Sydney CBD. No hassles at all with our booking & the check-in/ check out: staff were efficient & friendly. The reception area was spacious & pleasant and the three main lifts worked well. The corridors and our room were spotlessly clean with seemingly newish carpets & paint. Our room on the 17th floor had great views across the Anzac Bridge & beyond. It was surprisingly spacious, the king-size bed very comfortable, and the TV, lights, iron, fridge & air-con (on a 36C day!) all worked fine. We had a very good night's sleep despite the low rumbling of the air-con which is almost always present in these sort of big hotels. Bathroom was a bit small and a little dated but it had everything you need & was spotlessly clean. Room service was rather pricey, but as the hotel is in a great location (very close to public transport and with heaps of cafes & great little asian restaurants nearby) that really wasn't a problem. We got a very good deal through wotif, and after our stay there Citigate seems like amazing value, especially when compared with some of the cramped, run-down & hugely overpriced hotels we stayed in in Europe last year. Only thing we didn't like was the doona on the bed, which we promptly chucked off & replaced with the blanket we found in the closet (why oh why have they done away with blankets in the name of "smartness"? - these stupid over-hot doonas are everywhere now). In summary, Citigate is highly recommended if you want real value for money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was recently in Sydney for 3 weeks with work, because of the last minute descision to send me from Melbourne and the fact that it was Mardis Gras in Sydney meant that I had to change Hotels for one night (the night of the Mardis Gras) because of most of the town being booked out. TIP - If your visiting Sydney over the Mardis Gras period book your accomodation well in advance. The concierge at reception was perhaps one of the most couteous and friendly I have ever met, being Mardis Gras I asked for a late checkout which was handled expertly and with no extra charge. I had been allocated a room with 2 queen beds, and had made arrangements for 2 friends who were marching in the parade itself to spend the night as they could not find appropriate accommodation, I had expected to be charged for the 2 guests and was more than willing to pay this but this was also handled by reception and was no problem for my guests to stay with no extra charge, we were ech given our own entry card and wished a very happy Mardis Gras. The room was modern and it was the most comfortable bed that I had slept in during my 3 week stay in Sydney (four Hotels). The location was close to Central Station and while i admit the view from our room overlooked what I take to be student accommodation, the overlooked buildings did have architectual merrit, I have read some reviews criticising this, but consider this, that the young age of Australia means that many of our buildings have not yet achieved a status to be recognised as beautiful. If this same hotel was as central to Il de France as this hotel is to Sydney and overlooking the same student accomodation it would be considered a quaint advantage and insight into the Parisian lifestyle (just a thought).</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great location, lovely staff, desperately needs an upgrade”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here while visiting family over Christmas. The hotel is in a great central location, and has car parking on site for around $23 per day for guests. The foyer is lovely and the staff are really helpful.... but the rooms are not good at all. The room we were originally booked into was so bad we complained. We're not 'complainers' usually, and I can handle modest, but this room was so run down it felt dirty. We were moved to another room, which was better, but only marginally. Really got the feeling that the staff are used to complaints about the place - which is a real shame for the staff, as they were all fantastic! Honestly, as you can see in my photos, the carpet in the first room we were in was so stained it looked like someone had been stabbed in there or something! The rooms were refreshed daily, but the towels and linen reeked of bleach, which was a little disconcerting. In our 'upgrade' room the bathroom was in bad condition - broken tiles, chipped enamel and dirty grouting - and because there are no exhaust fans the ceilings are getting a lovely coating of mildew. The bench for luggage looked like it was about to collapse and the furniture was old and falling apart. At one point I pulled down to doona to discover the sheets didn't even cover the whole bed! I have to say though that the staff were fantastic - one girl in particular, I think her name was Elly, was so friendly and accommodating. We ordered room service once, for breakfast Christmas morning. Nothing to write home about but fine. I booked this place as a 'secret deal' through wotif, and it is supposed to be four star, and it may have been once, but it's sure not any more. It's really central and convenient, but I wouldn't stay again, unless I knew the place had had a major update.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed here several times in a variety of rooms since my last review in 2007. The hotel has been taken over by Mirvac group and over the past 18 months or so they have been doing quite extensive renovations, which the hotel badly needed. It appears from reading some of the reviews that not all of the rooms have been renovated as yet (especially bathrooms, the older rooms have grey tiles and a bath, newer have a shower and white tiles in the bathroom). Request a renovated room on check in as they are considerably better. Our last visit was for three nights in early January. We had booked an 8th floor balcony room (all rooms on the 8th floor and some of the king rooms on other floors have balconies) for the four of us over the hotels web site, but on arrival were 'upgraded' to a king room on the 18th floor with views over darling harbour (I suspect that the hotel over booked themselves) This was a much larger room, newly renovated and had great views over to Darling Harbour. Pre purchased breakfast (cheaper option than pay as you go) and parking in the hotels car park. We had a comfortable stay and would recommend except for a couple of niggling issues which need fixing. Breakfast is inconsistant (they seem to get slammed and then the food runs low, or out, crockery/cutlery runs out, and depending on who cooks flavours vary). What is with toasters in this place, two domestic toasters to serve a restaurant of 100 pax?? Also waitstaff 'please smile at your guests' at least try? Towels, have stayed here several times, four guests need four towels not two or three every day we had to request extra!. That said the place is well positioned about 12 minute walk to Darling Harbour, 5 to the monorail and about 30 mins to Circular quay (via George St) Please note that construction is just starting accross the road for new apartment block, so expect some noise and congestion around the hotel for the next couple of years.</p></li>
