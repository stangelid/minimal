<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Finding this hotel on the internet was a gem. 5star comfort and service. Breakfast was superb. Rooms on the Executive floor overlooking the green are great and with its own direct lift make it special. Yes the hotel is 15 mins from Dam Sqaure via the tram make it a peaceful location. Stayed in the best hotels in Amsterdam but this is 5star first class. Book your self a trip !.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">During our stay at this hotel we encountered rude staff members, a wait of 40 mins for our dinner at the restaurant and a bathroom which leaked whist the shower was in use. Additionally, we were over-charged for wifi Internet access. When we approached the reception to lodge a complaint, the staff simply dismissed our concerns.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The write up said it was very central - which is not true - it's a 25 euro taxi ride - or a 6 stop on the tram. We specifically asked for a queen bed but were told they'd all sold out - sorry but they can't be guaranteed. The receptionist did find us another room for the following night however. The barman was in the bar, but he turned people away who wanted coffee because they were closed. Definitely NOT 5 star. Very bland service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for 5 nights at the hotel. It's an exclusive area with beutiful private villas. Tram 5 or 24 would take you to the center in a 5-7 minutes. If you want to relax after a busy day, go there. If you need crowds shouting under your hotelroom take another hotel. It's up to you. The hotel stuff would make a 50-euro reservation for every single night, so have enough cash or credit on your card. The breakfast price is 22 euro/person a day.</p></li>

They were a bit old (old TV, old carpet, old bathroom) and definitely not a match to what I was expecting. It's a positive overall experience, as long as don't expect any luxury in the room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've been to Amsterdam several times. This was my first time to stay at the Bilderberg Garden Hotel. The rooms were great, the hotel was clean and the staff was fantastic. The only problem is the location is just outside the city center. For me, I prefer to be in the action. Don't get me wrong, the area where the hotel is located is a beautiful residential area only 2 tram stops from Mueseumplein. The tram stop is about a 4 or 5 minute walk from the hotel and for most people, this is perfect and I recommend the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Highly recommend this Hotel I am extremely fussy, but I just couldn't fault anything about this Hotel - the rooms were very clean - white bed linen was gorgeous. The breakfast was superb, the staff were amazing - couldn't do enough to help. Although the location of the Hotel is 30 minutes (perhaps a little more) walk from the centre, it's not far from Museum Square and is very quiet. We thought there was no-one else staying in the Hotel! I would love to go back and stay in this Hotel. Fabulous place! Linda & Michael Noble</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a great stay at the hotel - the rooms were super spacious with large, comfortable beds and a jacuzzi in the bathroom. Everything was super-clean, and the small extras (great-smelling shampoos and shower gels, coffee/tea/cookies in the room, etc) really made it that little bit nicer. Staff were extremely helpful, from renting bikes to paying and placing your daily parking ticket in the car for you. A little bit pricier than what I would normally go for (and still a 20-min walk from the center) but otherwise great value-for-money!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were very impressed with this hotel. Its location, right on the canal, makes for a beautiful setting, and it is easy to get to by public transportation. It was also quick to get into the centre part of Amsterdam, but not at all loud. It had the feel of being sort of suburban, while still being close to the action. The staff is wonderful- smiles, very welcoming and very helpful in giving directions, restaurant recommendations, etc. Our room was clean and quiet, and the bed was very comfortable. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.</p></li>

Checking in at the hotel was quick and painless, we had booked our room through lastminute.com and just had to pay an extra charge for the city tax. We drove over and they also sorted out the parking fee so we could then drop our bags off and get straight out and tour the town. The room was clean and comfortable and the beds were perfect.

Lobby/lounge area is fine; too short menu at the bar, but food is decent. Very kind reception staff. Once you move to the rooms, it becomes another story. Rooms are tiny except "executive" rooms; doors are of the noisy "slam" type, and sound insulation is poor. Sometimes they seem to have some difficulty starting breakfast service at 7 am. As a whole, definitively not up to the claimed 5 stars, but a correct business hotel if you need be in this area.</p></li>

Although it isnt centrally located it is very close to a tram stop and you are at Liedsplein in less than 10 mins. The breakfasts were amazing, the staff were the best we have encountered for a long time. The style and decor of the hotel and rooms were modern, bright and fresh.

Tiny TV, noisy AC. Hotel : Not very fancy, the hallways make it look cheap, but the lobby is pretty cute. Service : Fast check-in/check-out. No complaints! Surroundings : We fell in love with Apollolaan street. It's peaceful and lovely. There's a grocery store about 5 mins away, also a couple of little boutiques and restaurants.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were booked in for 3 nights and it was amazing! All staff were extremely friendly and helped us with any and all questions we had. Breakfast is very good and offers lots of choices. It was also not very crowded which is nice as I personally hate a rushed breakfast (but lack of stress could be that the hotel was probably not fully booked). The spacious rooms offer everything you might need. The whirlpool tub is a big plus. The only (small) disadvantage is the location which is outside of the city. But about 5 minutes walking distance away is the next tram stop which takes you in the city centre (within 5-10 min).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose the Bilderberg Garden Hotel because of favorable reviews, and we were delighted to find the hotel just as described, with very clean, modern rooms and baths. We opened our windows to the brisk evening breezes and slept like babies on comfy beds fitted with crisp white linens. The location, in a lovely, quiet neighborhood of wide, tree-lined streets with easy access to Amsterdam's excellent tram system, is terrific. The youthful, good-looking staff could not have been more professional or more helpful. Don't miss the on-site restaurant -- the food is fresh, inventive, and delicious, and the wait staff is friendly and solicitous.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice hotel but not five star, dont know how they got that rating. Staff were pleasant, decor in the bar leaves alot to be desired, and the prices are abit on the high side even for five star hotel. The room decoration was good and clean, although the curtain over the bed could have done with a wash. Linen was changed as and when you wanted it. Taxis from the hotel varied in cost from 12 to 15 euros, so best to take the tram which is available just round the corner which passes all the major attractions. I would not stay at this hotel again, although had a pleasant stay, I am sure that for the cost of it you could get better value for your money elsewhere</p></li>

We were traveling for business and found the local restaurant choices excellent, with a variety of menus and prices. All of our meals, from pizza to fine dining were excellent. The front desk was excellent. They noticed it was raining and stopped us at the door to provide umbrellas for our walk to the restaurant area. With a tight schedule, the front desk was able to check the train schedules, museum hours and provide taxi's when needed. We were able to visit the musueums, enjoy the local fare and conduct business on a very demanding time frame. Excellent rooms and in-house restaurant as well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a very comfort variant for us, because the conference we participated was held in the hotel, so we could save a lot of time. The cuisine was excellent! Gourmet items were real masterpieces! A big deal is that breakfast was included (also delicious). Rooms are neat and cleaned in time. The staff is very friendly and ready to help. This is no-smoking hotel, however it was not laborious to go outdoors and enjoy a cigarette in a pretty open lounge. Situated in a park zone, the hotel is protected from noise and fuss of central streets. But souvenir shops, museums and restaurants are 5 minutes from the hotel and you can get to the center in 10 minutes by taxi.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Visited Amsterdam in April/May for art/museums/tulips. Glad we chose this location as it is out of the centre, down a very pleasant and quiet street - not far on the tram back to the action though. Tram stop only 5 mins walk. Booked a suite on expedia - found that it was not on executive floor as expected. Rooms were decorated as executive rooms, but were 2 rooms on the 1st floor at the end of a corridor which had an interconecting door. One room was usual bedroom with large double, and 2nd room had a dining table, sofabed, 2nd minibar and 2nd TV. Had a view of the top of the restaurant, and car parking spaces unfortunately, but didn't matter as weren't there much.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is clean and well presented. I had read a lot of the reviews on this website and was worried. The staff are very friendly and helpful but the hotel bar and room service is pricey! A few things to be aware of..... even is you place the do not disturb sign on your door the cleaners still come in and reception phone you. I accidently left some chocolates in the mini fridge which I went back for before departing as they were a present but they had been taken by the cleaners and I was told it was my fault for leaving them! The hotel is not in the heart of Amsterdam, although it is situated in a lovely area and is only a 10 minute tram ride (number 5) to Dam Square.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Refreshingly quiet location yet close to a gorgeous canal and an enticing pocket of upmarket shops, restaurants and cafe's. Staff were very friendly, helpful and professional. We accepted an upgrade to an Executive Suite for a reasonable price and thoroughly enjoyed our last night in Europe ahead of a long journey back to Australia. The jacuzzi bath was heavenly. The hotel restaurant was immaculate and very tempting but the warm evening enticed us out to enjoy an authentic Italian meal in a romantic outdoor setting. The Bilderberg is highly recommended if you prefer a little distance from the bustling, eccentric city centre atmosphere which is only a short tram ride away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">To put in context, my bill for 1 night with breakfast and a room service burger was â‚¬300. At that price, this is a very disappointing hotel. Plus side: - great neighborhood - smallish hotel Negatives: - breakfast was â‚¬20 with mediocre quality of food and staff who, when you could get their attention, seemed irritated to be asked for espresso rather than bad filter coffee - room service burger was â‚¬20 and was clearly very processed meat plus some soggy fries - check-out took nearly 15 minutes - rooms and public areas (apart from reception) are very tired - water pressure was almost too poor to have a shower over the bath At very best, a 4* hotel.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is located about 10 mins from Dam square on the tram. It costs around â‚¬35 for a taxi from the airport. Its a lovely large reception area which houses the bar. There is also a large open fire for warming those toes after a winter stroll! The rooms are a little on the small side, but comfy beds. We didn't get breakfast included as it was too expensive however my brother was also staying with us & he got it but said it wasn't worth the money. So we went into a cafe in Dam square instead. Even though our booking advised that all taxes were included we were charged another tax on top. It was only a few euro but just be aware of it. Overall its a nice quiet hotel for a relaxing stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in an executive room on the third floor which was very large for Europe and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Our stay was for a Sunday night only with a late Monday checkout. The restaurant was closed so ate in the bar/lounge from their limited menu and we enjoyed our meal. This hotel is not located in the tourist centre which we found a blessing as it's situated in a quiet, pleasant neighbourhood. It is about a 30 min walk or a short tram ride into the busy, noisy part of town. We walked in to town both days and trammed it "home" once. Each day, on arrival back to the hotel, we felt we'd arrived back to the sane part of town! Reception staff very helpful and friendly staff in bar/lounge area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a 4 day stay in Amsterdam and before our departure I was a little apprehensive about this hotel, having read the very mixed reviews on this site. However my concerns were completely unfounded - the hotel staff were most helpful and all requests were dealt with promptly and courteously. We were provided with a great map and given good advice about places to visit. The breakfast was in our opinion good value as after eating it you really didn't need another meal until the evening. Our room was comfortable and had all the necessary facilities. The hotel is only a short tram ride from the centre and all the major tourist attractions and I would definitely recommend it to friends visiting Amsterdam.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked the romantic special. I thought it was quiet expensive for what we got. The room was a deluxe room allthough i think the word "deluxe" is a little exagerated. I stayed in a lot of hotels all over the world i would rather call it a standard room. Ok there was a large balcony but it was to cold to use it anyway. Oh yes, don't get wild by reading the word "jacuzzi". The staff was very friendly though. The breakfeast on the room was very nice and the restaurant superb. Would I go back? Yes but in a standard room at 1/3th of the price i payed. If you don't rent a car, you have to know the hotel is not in the center. you'll have to take a (crowded) tram it'll take you 20 minutes. nevertheless we had a great time and i would certainly return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I liked this hotel. It was not in the centre but it was very easy to get a tram, taxi or walk to the town. Being a little way out mean't we saw other areas on the way in, it was never a problem and the hotel is situated in a nice, quite residential area. The staff were very helpful, checked if our room was ready even though we were early, allowed us to check in early, responded to any request and provided us with local information and a map. The room was comfortable and clean and the apples left by the bed is a nice touch. Everyone speaks English without any sign of it being an annoyance. The food in the resturaunt was the best I've had for years although the service was a little slow. Breakfast is expensive but very nice. I would recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights at the end of January 2008 and it was simply fantastic. Other reviews have commented on how this hotel is slightly outside the main city centre but to my mind this is not a bad thing. 1. It is only 15-20 minute walk into the centre of town and it's a wonderful way to explore the city and escape the traditional tourist path. 2. The trams in Amsterdam are v. easy to use and reliable and it is only a 10 minute ride into the centre. 3. If you want to get a taxi back after an evening out it is only about $12. We booked one of the excutive suites on the top floor which are spacious and well appointed with a jacuzzi. Lastly the staff could not do enough for you; always going that extra mile. We will definatley be returning.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is a little bit far away from the center (Dam Square). It's about 5 minutes walk to the nearest Tram station. We've got this hotel from bidding in the priceline, so we feel the hotel is rather nice to the value. The room is clean and relatively spacious compared to the European standard. The staff is friendly and quick during the check in / out process. But compared to other "5 star" hotels, this hotel is really a plain 5 star. The hotel is in a quiet neighbourhood and just beside the Hilton. Because it is the first time we went to Amsterdam, it's quite difficult for us to find a restaurant beside. It took about 20 minutes to walk to the Museum and fashion quarter where you can find a lot of shops and restaurants. Also, the Tram can easily take you to Dam Square.</p></li>

Rooms were designed for simple, comfortable luxury with good proportional amenities. Hotel location was good to World Trade Center complex, tram and train access points to/from airport as well as near by local eateries with great food. The service staff was outstanding and professional - special acknowledgement to Lucas N. who was courteous, knowledgeable and exceptional in his accommodation to guest requests and making this American feel comfortable about venturing out and navigating the unfamiliar city of Amsterdam. His recommendations on local eateries, hot spots, and must sees really enhanced the value of my week long stay. The Bilderberg Garden Hotel has found a successful formula.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a good experience here. This hotel was more affordably priced than many others in its class. Although rated as a 5 star, it was more like a 4. It is located in a lovely neighborhood in a quiet area. It is a few blocks from the tram stop, which was very convenient. You can buy tram passes at reception. The hotel was modern and updated. Our room was clean and nice, but not fancy. We had a big window. It was very quiet every night. We just had a couple of complaints about the room: no drawers and very few hangers. The staff was friendly and helpful. The parking area was small, but we had reserved a spot (this is necessary) and the doorman parked the car for us when needed. It worked out well. We didn't eat at the restaurant, but ordered room service one night. It was prompt.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just came back from a few days at the Biderberg. The staff are incredibly helpful, for example I wanted and extra pillow....asked at reception and by the time I was back at my room(3-4 minutes later) the pillows were being put on my bed. I do agree the housekeeping staff are very impatient, but if you are an early bird, this should not be too much of a problem. Loved the "turn down"service...beds turned down and a snack put beside your bed in time for you returning to your room. Only negative is the extremely overpriced restaurant....ok food but oh my god, they know how to charge for it...although once again, the staff are lovely. There is a great Italian restaurant called "La Palma" nearby(as the receptionist) and she will direct you. Much cheaper and fantastic ambience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Bilderberg Garden Hotel for 3 nights in July 2011 and pretty much loved everything about the hotel. Firstly the bedroom. Clean and very comfortable. Lovely sized bed. House keeping every day, although they did attempt to clean our room very early one morning but I partly blame myself for not putting the Do Not Disturb sign on the door! The area is ideal, it is out of the main manic area of Amsterdam, tram runs only about a 5 minute walk away but far enough away not to be able to hear. The usual links (Bus/Tram etc) are all very close by. Reception were very very helpful, good English. One minor complaint was no printer available to print off boarding passes for the flight home, but they were able to print off via their own PC's at the desk, but thats really nit picking!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel during a weekend getaway in Amsterdam and absolutely loved it. The service at the hotel was fantastic. They had made a mistake with our original reservation and we were upgraded to a superior room. The room was spacious with a large window overlooking the street. The hotel itself has a very 1970s feel from the outside, but it is clean and fresh on the interior. The bathroom was large with an excellent shower and tub. The bed was huge and comfy. The hotel staff were very helpful at all times during our visit. The hotel is ideally located away from the bustle of the main drag but not too far to be inconvenient. The hotel is located less than a five minute walk to the tram (#5 or #24) which takes you into the centre of town. Loved it! Definitely would recommend it to anybody.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived in Amsterdam on an early morning flight, much too early to check into the hotel. When we arrived before 9am, we requested a place to house our bags until check-in. We were extremely pleased to find that, with just a brief wait, a room would be readied for us! We parked our bags in a spacious, updated, clean room with excellent lighting and places to store our 2-week supply of clothing and shoes. The bathroom was huge, by European standards... and even by spoiled American standards! The tub was full sized and deep! Towels were plush and oversized. Bed was big and comfy... with blankets warm enough to fight off the the chilly October damp and cold. Far exceeded our expectations on every level! A good hike to museums, even further to the city center but trolly service was close by and frequent.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was everything it promised to be. About 3 km from the centre, it was in a very pleasant area ,close to a canal with nice walks. Travelling round the city from the hotel was easy - either by tram or walking, and we bought the tram tickets from Reception, which was brilliant. The quality of service - bar service, Reception, housekeeping and restaurant - was of the highest standard, efficient, friendly but unobtrusive. Breakfast was excellent at the hotel and the choice of local restaurants for dinner was impressive. We had a problem on departure when our Connexxions Shuttle bus failed to turn up but the Hotel staff did everything they could to solve the problem for us. We would certainly stay in the Garden Hotel again and indeed hope to do so in the future. Thank you Bilderberg for a lovely break.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked over Expedia and expected the executive room as per the picture, but got a deluxe style room on the executive floor, so felt this was misleading. However, for the price per night, the accomodation was great and the hotel is near a tramline so no problem getting around, despite being out of the city centre. We were supposed to have a non-smoking room, and when we got there it stank of smoke, despite the receptionist assuring us it was a non-smoking room. Also had extra stuff added to the bill, but it was removed without question when I queried it. Staff all very polite and helpful and the rooms were clean, with a turndown service and apples placed in the room each evening - but the quality of the toiletries was a very big disappointment, would expect better from a 5 star hotel. Overall, happy because of the low price.</p></li>

When we arrived, we were pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the public spaces and the rooms. The hotel is spotless. In addition the staff is quite friendly, which I experienced even before arriving when I called the reception to recommend that they take good care of our friend who was arriving before us by train from Paris. The reception staff was extremely helpful throughout our stay as well, with their advice on restaurants, sightseeing, etc ... The quality of the breakfast buffet was excellent. The restaurant staff was also quite friendly. Finally, the only negative comment was the limited number of TV channels in the room, at least for me as I am always looking for Euronews, BBC News, ...

Location wise it is very inconvenient if you want to explore amsterdam or you are visiting. It is a clean area and the hotel facilities are clean and the staff is nice enough as well, but just given that I was expecting a 5 star hotel and wanted to explore amsterdam and was told it is convenient to get to the center and then being nickel and dimed for all small charges.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Reception staff were very friendly, polite. All of our requests were met. When we entered our room we found the mini-bar had been left open, and unfortunately the contents were not chilled. However, some chilled drinks were bought up to us immediately and were not charged to our room. The room was very spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable and the maid service was very prompt. Breakfast was a good selection and the service in the restaurant was friendly and efficient. The location is in a very nice residential area, however it may be a little far out for some guests. But for people wishing to see a nice residential area, it is within a comfortable walking distance of all the attractions, with plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. Overall, I would highly recommend this Hotel, we had a very pleasant and memorable stay. Thank you very much Bilderberg Gardne Hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed two nights here over Easter 2012 and very much enjoyed our visit. The location for us was pefect - a quiet street in an upmarket suburb but only 2 minutes walk to a tram stop and from there 15-20 mins into the city. It was great to arrive back after a busy day sightseeing in the centre of A'dam, Our room was quiet, comfortable and well furnished, bathroom clean and well equipped and good tv and clock radio. All staff were charming, friendly and helpful when approached. We didn't eat breakfast as it wasn't included in our rate and at â‚¬17 per person was not within our budget - the restaurant did however look very nice. If you stay at the Bilderberg I recommend catching the 24 tram across to De Pijp where there is an excellent choice of bars and restaurants. Also, 5 minutes walk towards the city is Wildschutt - a cafe bar which did great food and had a nice atmosphere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Beautiful, friendly, comfortable place to stay with everything you could possibly need. It is not downtown, but the 20-30 minute walk is scenic and riddled with cafes, bakeries and great shops. There is an expensive, but I imagine wonderful restaurant downstairs. There is also less expensive food options like soups and sandwiches available at the bar. Real nice touch: room service came to my door ever day and gave me two freshly picked apples. The only complaint I have about this hotel is that they charge for WiFi access BY THE HOUR!. Come on, it's the 21Century: Internet access is no longer some rarefied thrill to be reserved for the few select people who happen to have one of those "new fangled portable computing devices". It is a requirement for the modern traveller. If I had of been held-up in my hotel room for some reason, WIFI access here would have cost me more than the room itself.</p></li>

On arrival in amsterdam city we got a cab to the hotel which cost us â‚¬30 which i thought was a bit much seen as hotel isn't that far from city.

I went back down to repection where a manager (who hadn't a clue what he was doing)told me the hotel was full and then apoligised & suddenly an executive suite just became available.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Bildberg Garden Hotel the last weekend November, 2006. We had a great time hotel very clean, the room was smashing lots of hot water. Well stocked mini bar, english speaking channels on tv. The hotel was in a very upmarket suburb of Amsterdam about fifteen minutes on the tram. the tram stop was abouit five mins walk away. think it was tram twenty four which runs very regularly to the centre. We found a very nice Italian restaurant which we ate in in the evening. Didnt go back into the city decided to eat locally too tired after being out all day sightseeing. Went to the Cinema one afternnon by Rembrantsplein to watch Casino Royale, enjoyed this very much. Love Amsterdam this was our third visit in three years. Would recommend the hotel, althought not central very easy to get to other places in amsterdam Museumplein etc. Overall a smashing time was had . Will no doubt be returning to Amsterdam again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed as a family of four for two nights and booked the suite. The rate was pretty resonable and the accommodation was huge. Large lounge with sofa and two armchairs and a dining table for four. Two full bathrooms and a very comfortable king bed. The rooms have obviously been renovated recently and are of a very high standard. The bathrooms were not part of the upgrade and look a bit tired but were fine. Service was incredibly friendly and efficient. Breakfast was nice and the staff were particularly friendly. Special note to Sigourney who was charming. Minus is that the public areas are quite small and the outdoor space is really a patio on the street. However, the location is very quiet and peaceful but near to tram links when you need to get into the centre. We slept very well both nights. In summary, I would definitely stay there again but better for families and business people than those looking for a wild nightlife.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Positive points: Hotel is located in very quiet area. Convenient location near Mseemplace (15 minutes walk or 2 stops with tram). Taxi to hotel from Dam square cost 12 Euros Suggested walk to Museumplace, through 'Cornely Schuystraat' with many trendy fashion shops and nice cafÃ©s and restaurants, and then you can reach in 20 minutes, Rijksmuseum and VanGogh museum. Buy tickets in advance from reception desk so to to avoid long waiting queues. Negative points: 1- There is no separate Reception and Concierge desk, and during day, only 2 persons and at evening only 1 person are available. So it is necessary to wait every time, you need information about Amsterdam and/or about your room. 2- Internet works very poorly, even if you choose Business connecting service provided by Swisscom (WIFI hotel provider). In addition, necessarry to register twice separetely, (2x the cost) for a pc and a Iphone or Blackberry, which is not correct.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed there by accident, as I booked at the Bilderberg's other Amsterdam property (better location), but, because I am an idiot, I mistakenly booked starting the day before and they had given up our room. Completely my mistake and they quickly found us a room at the Garden and paid for a cab to get us there... I stayed on the "Executive Level" (third floor - room 1403) which had its own elevator and everything, so I'm not sure if my perception applies to all rooms... Room was solid and, by European standards, pretty sizable. Comfortable bed and very clean and well-appointed.. Staff was helpful enough... Two minor complaints... The breakfast is outrageously overpriced - 21 Euros for what many hotels offer for free... Then, the location was pretty poor for anything to do with the city center. We rented bikes and were fine, and I appreciated being so close to Vondelpark, but if you're on vacation I'd look for the other Bilderberg location...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is located in a quiet residential area of Amsterdam, very close to the tram station (5 min walk) and close to a main shopping area (10 min). They managed to check us in at 8 o'clock in the morning and the staff was generally very nice to us. We could purchase tickets for 2 of Amsterdamâ€™s main museums from the hotel reception (Van Gogh and Rijksmuseum) and thus avoid a huge queue at the entrance. Also, we could arrange for the shuttle bus to come and take us to the airport, but I would not recommend it , because it was almost an hour late (although it was ok from the airport to the hotel). The room was spacious and clean, as well as the bathroom, but as with all hotels, there are the thin walls to be considered.The bed was very comfortable and they came and change the sheets daily. The hotel restaurant is called 'De Kersentuin' and it's a very good one - I recommend it. Overall, it was a nice stay and I would definitely go back to stay with them.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">At the beginning of our trip to Europe we stayed two nights at the Bilderberg Garden Hotel. We arrived early and were delighted to find our rooms were ready. Upon arrival we spent some time reception area and had some of the best coffee ever. We found our rooms spacious and just as described. The front desk was very helpful and were always happy to answer any questions and help us with reservations and information on how to use the tram. Access to the tram was just a short walk away and getting around Amsterdam using the tram was very easy. Overall we had great accommodations great service and a great time!! Highly recommended. The only draw back may be that the hotel is in a out of the way very quite area. Not a problem for us. We just hopped the tram and were in the thick of things in no time. Watch out for the bikes, scooters, trams and cars.....pedestrians seem to be at a disadvantage in Amsterdam. We had fabulous time!!! Would love to go back and explore some more.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at the hotel an I was a bit apprehensive as I had read some bad reviews on trip advisor. I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is not the most beautiful from outside, but never judge a book by its cover. The staff at the front desk were helpful, courteous and efficient. The hotel foyer is lovely and the room we stayed in was very nice, lovely bathroom and very comfortable bed. Although we did not eat at the hotel the menu sounded delicous and they had a very good snack menu in their bar. Overall I think the hotel is lovely set in a residental area, which was nice to come back to after the noise of the centre of amsterdam. The tram stop is just round the corner and a number 5 will take you past all the sights and straight to the central station. All in all we had a great trip and the hotel was great value for money. Tip: buy a tram ticket from the reception of the hotel. They area for different lengths depending on your stay. Good value for a 3 day ticket, 13 euros.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I really enjoyed the Bilderberg Garden Hotel for my quick visit to Amsterdam. I visited just for an afternoon and evening, but everything was great. Upon arrival, I thankfully noted that I had pre-booked parking as there are only a few spots. They took the car and nicely parked it under a little carpark area and brought in my luggage. The room could have been a bit larger, but overall, it was quite nice and clean. The reception staff were so very nice, and helped me out with some things to do in my really short time there. I walked all over town and figured out the tram as well! I ate in the bar, which was delicicous. Had I had more time, I would have tried the restaurant, which looked amazing. However, my food in the bar was not only delicious, but also beautifully presented and simply amazing. Everyone there was very helpful and I really enjoyed myself. I would definitely stay again. Also, this part of town was simply perfect! You can get anywhere, but you are away from the hustle and bustle of the main square and all of that silliness.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Wife and I stayed here for 3 nights as part of our Honeymoon trip. The hotel is located in a leafy residential sector of the city about 2.5 miles south of Amsterdam central train station. There is a tram stop just 5 mins walk from the hotel. The entrance boasts a well planed marble themed reception area. The staff were very well presented and friendly. Realising we were not there on business (the impression this is that type of hotel) they were keen to show us a map of the city and give us tips on getting around the City. We stayed in the exec suite which felt very homely. It was spacious well laid out, very clean. All the suite furniture, bed, bathroom facilities and soft furnishings were of high quality. The room felt secure and very comfortable and was very quite, couldnâ€™t hear a thing. We didnâ€™t try the hotel food/bar or facilities as we were out most of the time enjoying the City but it was a pleasure to come back to this hotel in the evening....... or early hours..........Amsterdam eh?? If we ever come back to Amsterdam we will stay at this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here during a conference and was not told that they were refurbishing this hotel. It's located in South Amsterdam in a very expensive residential area. The area is ruined by the presence of this concrete "layer cake". When I went it was being refurbished - plastic sheeting over the walls and scaffolding in the interior. The restaurant was closed and there was constant drilling - made me think of a Spanish tourist resort from the 80's with the construction! My room was very 60's - brown swirly carpet, old furniture, minibar with drinks etc that were nearing expiry! The staff were very nice and I got the impression that they were doing their job well under the circumstances. The owner/management should be severely chastised for not closing down completely during the renovations - and for this reason I wonder what their opinions of dealing with customers is. The location is half an hour by crowded tram from the sights of Amsterdam - not ideal. Do not waste your time or money (or anyone elses money if someone else is paying) staying here. I travel a lot - and really and truly this place is awful! Ignore this at your peril.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">4 star hotel. Okay I was little bothered when I pulled up due to the building not giving me impression of 4 star. The staff made the differance, and were beyond professional. It was obvious after staying here that the hotel had a reputation, and the clientel were upper crust. Me being american am used to smoking outside and did so here. Smoking is still allowed in the hotel, and every time I went out someone from the hotel was soon out to see what I was doing. So security was good there. They had parking, and was reasonbable. It was street parking. I did not opt for internet and cannot comment, but it was time pay. Room was grat and extremely comfortable. Hotel places green apples throughout the hotel, and I soon learned to love these and would grab one from time to time. Location is in an affluent area of town with local eating and shopping. Not real close to touristy part of Amsterdam but tram was close. I actually enjoyed the distance at this hotel as area was maybe 10 minutes away, and points in between were of interest and I might have missed otherwise. If you want to feel quality stay here. This hotel gave me a breathe of fresh air after one month in "charming" hotels.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is a little out of the way however we came to appreciate this very quickly as it gave us the chance to explore the city in full and not just the immediate area to Dam Square. We had booked ballet tickets for Swan Lake on Christmas Day at the Europaplein and found that the hotel was just a mere 5 minute walk away. The trams were every 5 minutes - even on Christmas day they were operational every 12 mins. Check-in was done swiftly and with good customer service. They did give us the wrong room however this was rectified promptly and the front desk staff apologised profusely. Our room had a whirlpool bath, which was one of the reasons we booked it, and it was put to use every night to warm us up after our day of snow filled sight seeing. I was disappointed that although the hotel is a 5 star it didn't have any leisure facilities although you could use the facilities at their 4 star sister hotel. My only gripe was the maid service insisted on knocking on our door every morning to make up our room. I even hung the "do not disturb" sign from our door and guess what they still knocked! No rest for the wicked then! Overall opinion, i would stay in this hotel again but i may bring my own pillow!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Well, I booked this hotel after reading all the reviews here. The first leg of my family's18 day trip to europe was in Amsterdam (We stayed at Rokin APT) and this was our last leg of our travel before returing home. I have sorta mixed feel about this hotel. I booked 2 rooms adjoining together since we were a family of 4. My wife, 2 young boys and I. The service was fast, efficient and great. They didn't have any problem with early check ins and tried to accommodate whatever we' had needed upon check in. However, I thought the place was a bit odd to derserve 5 star ratings. The rooms were richly decorated and were modern enough. However, the building itself didn't have the normal 5 star hotel feel to it. It was more like a semi luxury country inn with 4 star rating. There aren't anything around the hotel since it's located in a very nice residential neighborhood. The tram stop was a good 15 minute walk. It took us about 20 minutes to the main part of the town. I saw a Maybach(a $300,000 mecedes) parked in one of the houses near the hotel. If you do not mind being away from the happening places, go right ahead since it will be cheaper and cleaner, but if you want some action till late night, go stay near the dam square.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything about this hotel is a ripoff. Read their website and you think it is spectacular but once you arrive it simply does not deliver. They claim they are a 5 star. It's maybe a 3 star at best. I checked in at the front desk and went to my non-smoking room only to discover the room was filled with old cigar smoke, the rug obviously worn out and dirty, the room dated, dark and dank. They advertise they have marble bathroom with jacuzzi baths. In fact, my room had a chipped porcelin midget tub with no marble in sight with the bathroom light inoperable. I immediately left the room and complained to the front desk. They said tough luck--they were going to charge my credit card because I did not preview the room before I gave my credit card at the front desk. I demanded to see the manager but he or she refused to come out of hiding. I finally told the front desk clerk that I refused to stay in a hotel that misrepresented their amenities and walked out. Upon leaving a bell boy apologized to me and said other people have experience similar problems. He was tired of covering up for management and was looking for a new job. Now I am fighting them with my credit card company and a lawyer in Amsterdam. So look out for this ripoff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Bilderberg Garden Hotel for 3 nights and had a great stay. The hotel is located about 3 km away from the center of Amsterdam but within a few minutes walk you can get on to the tram no. 5, 15 or 24 taking you straight to the center of the city. The hotel is in a very nice neighbourhood with the museum and fashion district in walking distance. Parking is â‚¬24 per day but you can use the Park and Ride facilities in the nearby Olympisch Stadion and pay only â‚¬6 per day. You dont need your car when getting around Amsterdam anyway. We went on a 4 days/3 nights deal with breakfast included + 1 dinner at a nearby restaurant. We didnt have high expectations for the dinner but it turned out that we had a fantastic 3 course meal in one of the better restaurants in Amsterdam. Try it out, it is named "Spring" and located 10 minutes walk from the hotel. I would rate the hotel as follows: Location 3 of 5 (but you know this before you go) Staff 5 of 5 Room 5 of 5 Cleanliness 5 of 5 Breakfast 3 of 5 (great buffet but a 5 for me is something like Hilton buffet) General comfort 5 of 5 Area/Neighbourhood 5 of 5 Overall 4 of 5 We paid a total of â‚¬392 for 3 nights breakfast included and 1 dinner at restaurant Spring. Excellent value for money!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My five month old son, two dogs (can't leave dogs in the room if you're not there), husband, and I stayed in this hotel for almost two weeks while waiting our apartment to be ready. The porters were incredibly helpful, room service and staff at the bar were fabulous, the front desk was hit or miss. Some of the staff went above and beyond (found us daytime quarters for our dogs, gave us suggestions on where to eat/live/visit/etc). Some of the staff told us they were too busy to fax documents for us, turned their nose up at an unusual request, etc. We figured out quickly who to ask for help and stayed away from the other staff. Housekeeping was fabulous--always had a green apple and turn down ready for us at 7PM. Everything was a little expensive but the room service was yummy, the service was pleasant, and it was located in a lovely neighborhood. The only downside (which for my needs was a very large downside) was that the internet was down for quite a few days and when it came back up, we had a very slow poor connection. I would highly recommend this hotel to any businessperson. In response to those saying the rooms weren't very large--I found them to be quite large. We came with 10 bags and a ton of baby gear but still had quite a bit of room left for ourselves!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the bilderberg in March, 2005, and really liked it. The location is very nice, very close to trams, and out of the hustle of downtown tourist areas. We stayed in an executive room, which was very nice. Others who complain that this hotel is "not really five star" are probably correct, but for the money it was absolutley a great value (at least when I went). I think anyone who trashes this place in a review must have higher standards than I, because I really can't think of anything else this hotel could have done to make my stay better. I would observe that, in reading reviews, those who upgraded to an executive room have better impressions of the hotel than those who did not. So if you have the choice & the money, I'd say upgrade. The hotel is also close to the trams. The 5 or 24 will take you to the museum district, Leidesplein, or into Dam square. Lastly, the staff were very helpful, which I was somewhat surprised at since my wife and I were younger and not rich/fancy/upper class/etc. I expected to be ignored and/or be treated with indignant behavior, but everyone was very nice and helpful. PS - the resteraunt is rumored to be good, but is so expensive I had to skip. There are some fairly nice/upscale places just down the street (South of Appollan) which are cheaper and plenty nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was very pleased with the Bilderberg Garden Hotel'. The room we had was extremely comfortable and the decor was warm, welcoming and very clean. On arrival we were given the opportunity to upgrade our room (25E per night). We did upgrade to the executive suite, however I don't think that it was really necessary - then again when your on holiday its always good to treat yourself!!! The bed was ever so comfortable, so much so that we slept in until midday and kept missing our alarms. Make sure that you familiarise yourself with maps because it is very easy to get lost and the Biderberg Garden hotel is a little out of the way. We got lost one evening and not many local people could help us out when we asked if they knew the hotel. PPl seemed to know the apollolann street near the hotel. But it is well worth noting the surroundings and using a map!!!!! Lastly, if you want to go to the museums make sure that you go really early or later in the afternoon. I've never seen ques so long! They were so long that we didn't visit them - very dissappointing! So we ended up spending our short stay drinking (expensive) beer and eating (expensive) food - However, largely because of the state of the exchange rate. Also the first week of Jan is local holidays and not an aweful lot of establishments are open. Apart from that enjoy and I give this hotel 4/5.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We read the reviews and you always worry. Im from London and dont like to be let down and we honestly were not. We went pre rebuild as such and we had no problems there. Staff nice polite and very helpful, restaurant was easy to book and staff again were very informative, the cuisine was exceptional, the waiters more than willing to help if you were not sure what to order. the surrounding area is lovely, quiet and very well kept. We never once caught the tram and only got a taxi once and we were in and around the square everyday at some stage. We walked everywhere and if it was not for the location we would never had seen so much of Amsterdam. It is approx 20 mins to the square in all directions, we walked a different way everyday which in my opinion is the only way to see everything in Amsterdam, I could not imagine staying in the Square. Dont forget that Amsterdam is similar to London, Paris, Milan etc, if you want to spend money you certainly can, The hotel sells some very expensive food, wine and fine cigars, they also sell some very good Heineken, lovely cheap white wine and standard cigars. More importantly they dont look down or upto you regardless of what you spend or how much you tip. If you are concerned about the American ladies review about the taxi drivers, book them from the hotel, they are cheaper, especially the drive back to the airport. Just book the hotel, we cant wait to go back. Monty.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is the third Christmas we've used Bilderberg Garden Hotel as our base to visit family and as on previous visits, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel offers excellent value and great five star service, particularly when compared with other smaller, more impersonal hotels in the center of Amsterdam. The rooms are spacious - in our experience more so than others, particularly the executive rooms. The breakfast was varied, plentiful & delicious. The hotel is not located right in the center of Amsterdam, however, it is only a very short tram ride away from all the main attractions. In our opinion, the hotel's location is a benefit since it means we have a 5 star hotel, with spacious rooms, at a very affordable price. We were particularly impressed with the hotel this time round as a result of the flexibility they offered when our flight to Amsterdam was canceled due to the snow at Heathrow. We'd pre paid our hotel reservation via Expedia back in Oct and booked at a rate which prohibited changes or cancellation. When our flight was canceled the hotel could have simply refused to help & we'd have been stuck having to pay for another reservation. However, they were very reasonable and helped us as much as possible. As a result, we were able to re-book with no penalty and thus, we were extremely grateful for their help, professionalism and flexibility in difficult circumstances. This is a really great hotel & we'll definitely be back in 2011.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Bilderberg Garden for three nights in the week before Christmas. The total cost was â‚¬500 and we stayed in an executive room. The room was lovely, really clean and large, with modern furnishings and a huge bed, TV with many stations in english, CD player and seating area. Each evening a lady left us an apple each. The first night, the room was really hot and we couldn't get the air conditioning to work properly, but we mentioned it to the receptionist the next morning and when we returned in the evening it had been fixed. During the evening a staff member came to check that it was OK and brought us a card apologising for the inconvenience, and a box of chocolates, which was a pleasant surprise. Although we did not eat in the hotel restaurant, the menu was modern and not unreasonable for a special night at â‚¬39 for three courses. Many of the guests were obviously business people but we did not feel out of place, and the receptionist gave us a very helpful map and showed us the best places to go. In fact, that free map was more useful than many of the maps in the guide books as it contained tram routes, canal bus routes and shopping areas all on one page. It was a five minute walk to the tram stop and there were 8 trams an hour into the city centre - about a 15 min journey. We bought a three day tram ticket from the hotel and it was hassle-free after that. The hotel itself is in a leafy suburb just off an up-market shopping street and the area was very quiet although there were restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. I would stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice hotel, but won't stay here again”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is certainly a nice hotel, large rooms, comfy beds, very quiet and peaceful and could be ideal for those not too interested in a quick Amsterdam trip wanting to see many of the sights and enjoying some nightlife. It is located far from the city center, a good distance below Vondel Park. We booked via Hotwire fpr $159US/night (comes to $180/night once taxes are added) and didn't get to see which hotel before we booked, but requested the central section of Amsterdam. Not sure how this made it to "central' but this is the first time Hotwire has let us down. The hotel is located in a very nice quiet residential section, removed from everything. Two trams reach the closest stop (#5 & 24) which is about 3 blocks away from the hotel. From the train station, it is about a 20 minute ride to that stop. The 5 minute walk from there to the hotel was picturesque. We did appreciate the fact that we had the opportunity to see a piece of Amsterdam that we would have never otherwise seen. Our room was a double, but it was 2 separate single beds. They did move us to a more comfortable arrangement for our 2nd night, which was very nice of them. The Hotel itself was probably the best of our entire trip. The area around the hotel was great. The staff seemed very pleasant. It just wasn't located in a convenient proximity to the city center for us, and reaching a bike rental place, or the train station for our day trip to Haarlem (and our trip to Prague) or a nearby cafe in the morning, or dinner in the Jordaan area (which we love) was very frustrating. I am sure that this would be a perfect place for many, but for us the logistics detracted to the point that we wouldn't choose to stay here again, especially if we only visit for 2 nights.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Bilderberg Garden Hotel is located in a lovely neighborhood to the south of central Amsterdam, within a 10 minute walk of the Van Gogh Museum and the Rijksmuseum. It is a pleasant location with lots of greenery, set among beautiful houses, lovely shops nearby, and canals to explore. The hotelâ€™s brochures and website information describe the area of the hotel quite accurately. However, it is over-rated as a 5-star hotel and over-priced. Most of the rooms look like a typical 3-star hotel would look in the US with similarly modest furnishings. The room we stayed in was rather worn-out and needed updating, carpet-cleaning, etc. Staff at the desk were polite but not well-informed and not especially helpful. There is a rather spartan â€œBusiness Centerâ€� consisting of 2 computers and a printer in the hallway of the lower level of the hotel. There is no Fitness Center or pool. Several guidebooks described this hotel as a top-level hotel with beautiful furnishings, etc. Maybe this is true of selected rooms, but it seems that most rooms are not like this at all. Beware â€“ guidebooks say that rooms have Jacuzzis. This is not the case for the average room here. One guidebook called the Lobby â€œspectacular.â€� We thought it was rather small and darkly lit --- not very inviting at all. We felt ripped off by the high prices of this place and left after 2 nights to move to a real 5-star hotel in the center of Amsterdam. We are not sure why the guidebooks have gone so far wrong on this place. Unless you stay in the very top-level rooms, you will not find this to be a 5-star hotel. If you want a quiet and pleasant suburban location, walking distance to the big museums, and a rather unspectacular and somewhat over-priced hotel, this is it.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Bilderberg has it pros and cons, but all in all it's an OK hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed there for a couple of nights back i August 2009. Had some meetings in Amsterdam and the weather was nice, so we walked to the city everyday, but it took 20 minutes or so and in bad weather you would have to go by bus or taxi. Located next to Hilton in a neighborhood that can be characterized as suitable for upper class residents of Amsterdam and Businesses. I would probably book Hilton the next time depending on the price or perhaps something closer to the City center - There were several charming hotels in the city center, but since the weather was nice we stayed in the Hilton garden after our meetings and enjoyed the tranquility there and the boats passing by instead. The Bilderberg didn't have the same charm but the staff was very service minded towards me and my companion while my colleague had to wait quite a while for a room (even though it seemed like they had several available rooms despite our early arrival). The breakfast was OK, not exceptional and the same goes for the small cafe serving coffee outside the hotel. The staff provided us with an excellent service later on though, as we had booked a table at a restaurant and was running a bit late, but that was expected as the only reason we booked a table in the first place was because the restaurant at the hotel was closed down for renovation and the room came with a free dinner at the hotel restaurant. The restaurant they referred us to was Chinese and the food was excellent there, so no biggie! On a side note I had some problems with the Internet, as the only place you could get access to the Wi-Fi was in the lobby - Otherwise you had to pay for it and use a cable and I simply don't accept that you have to pay for Internet access - it should always be complimentary and that is why I often tend to look at Radisson hotels before researching the rest of the market.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Bilderberg Garden hotel from the 5th-7th August. We had booked a double room for two nights. Upon arrival I was shown to a twin room. I explained to the reception staff that this was not a double but it was in fact a twin room. The receptionist said that this is what they called a double room. I told her that no hotel in the world calls two single beds a double room and their terminology was incorrect and that perhaps they should change the wording on the website. (After reading other reviews it seems this trick is pulled quite regularly). She wanted to charge me Â£50 to upgrade to an executive room. I refused. Eventually she said we could move the two beds together and that for our second night she would move us into a room with a double bed. We were kept awake most of the night by a dog barking in the next room that a woman had left locked inside. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THEY ALLOW PETS IN THE HOTEL ROOMS. I have never encountered this before. The next day our room took a long time to be ready. When we finally got the keys I noticed that it wasn't an executive room as it didn't have a whirlpool bath but it was in fact a deluxe room with a double bed (which is exactly what we had wanted in the first place). When we checked out, the receptionist tried to charge us for a dog in our room which was ironic! As we were getting ready to leave four poor jet-lagged americans had arrived and they couldn't find their reservation at the reception. They had to pay to use the internet to print out the confirmation of their booking. The reception staff were totally incompetent. I must add I found the restaurant/breakfast staff to be very helpful and friendly as were the bar staff. The same can't be said for the receptionist's who never smiled and rarely tried to help. To access the wi-fi is 17 euros for 24 hours. I've never had to pay for wi-fi in a 5* hotel before.</p></li>
