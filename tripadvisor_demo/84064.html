<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Stay for our family I chose this hotel for two reasons. I think the Hilton brand hotels are the best and because of the reviews on Tripadvisor. I must say we were not disappointed! The room was large and clean and the staff was very friendly. The kids loved feeding the fish and the breakfast was awesome.</p></li>

Not able to place any call from the room (local-long distance), nobody could help up (in 2 different rooms). Breakfast is great. Rooms are big. Location is Okay in DC. Last year, stayed the Sheraton Four Points for 110 USD, was a better deal than Embassy Suites DC on 22nd.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great place near DuPont Circle Great hotel near DuPont Circle. Beautiful large rooms. Front desk was very helpful and polite. The only downfall is the price to pay to park. After taxes and all it comes to about $30.00/day. I guess that is standard for a major city but seems very pricey to me. I would definately stay there again. Great location.</p></li>

The breakfast buffet was a real nice add on. The staff was friendly. It was a bit of a walk to the White House especially considering the wind, but it was not terrible. I found the hotel very kid friendly and highly recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location We have just returned from 10 days in Washington, this hotel was great and so was the location and the breakfast to. My only negative would have to be the kitchnette, which was a microwave, fridge and coffeemaker. There were no plates, knifes forks etc, so we couldn't really eat in as we had planned. That said there were plenty of cheap eating places near by particularly the Froggy Bottom Pub which was fantastic.</p></li>

Breakfast is included, but the lines can get long, and if you are a businesss traveller you might get annoyed with all the children running around. The Manager's reception was terrific too. Drinks and munchies from 5:30 to 7 was a great way to end the day.We wen to Famous Luigi's for a pizza dinner and loved it. Highly recommend for the price vs. quality.</p></li>

The hotel was really excellent and would be great for families as well as couples. Suites were spacious with excellent facilities The breakfasts in the atrium were an additional bonus. Dupont Circle was only a short walk away so getting around the city by bus or metro was easy. A very good base in a quiet area, which we would strongly recommend, but don't try to walk to the White House - it's a long long way!</p></li>

The staff was very helpful and courteous. Trust their recommendations-they never steered us wrong. The breakfast in the mornings is hot and fresh with a wide variety of foods. Perfect way to start a day. The rooms were clean and nice size. The fitness room is great with individual TVs on each piece. Book early-there is a reason it fills up fast.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">short DC visit Embassy Suites is in a great location - a 5-10 walk to Dupont Circle Metro. Property is well-maintained and the breakfast spread is excellent. Rooms are very clean and room service was quite timely. Food from on-site restaurant is above average as well. We also were quite pleased with the room rate for such a roomy well-located hotel. We will stay here every time we stay in D.C. One caution - the pool is small and crowded so you can't do much relaxing or actual swimming!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel for a weekend trip to DC w/ kids Stayed here last weekend w/ our 3 kids. The room was large enough to accomodate all of us pretty comfortably. The location makes getting around easy by metro, taxi or foot. And, my kids couldn't wait to get back to the hotel, there was lots to do - pool, small game room, ride in the glass elevator etc. The breakfast that is included is plentiful and most importantly even the coffee is good! Additionally, the staff was very nice and accomodating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel My son and I stayed here on a weekend trip to DC. We were here about 6 months after it was built. The place was beautiful and very clean.The room was very nice. We had a flat screen in the living room and another TV in the bedroom. The pullout bed in the living room was much better than other hotels I've stayed in. It wasn't fantastic but I didn't hurt my back like those torture devices always do.The hotel is in a good location and within walking distance of many of the museums.</p></li>

Our bedroom area was quiet, but hallway and living room noisy with constant running  yelling of children. Impossible to get a table at breakfast time, lots and lots of families with young children.

We enjoyed the neighborhood and easy (4-5 block) walk to the subway. My children enjoyed the pool, game room and movies. We found the hotel clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly, although I didn't see the concierge once. As with any city, you will have noise and I think being close to GWU hospital we heard many ambulances. We enjoyed our stay and would stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, good deal We booked this Embassy Suite because of the reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. The rooms were big and clean. The beds were comfortable, including the sofa bed. The staff is very friendly. The breakfast was tasty with a big selection and the afternoon reception was plentiful with drinks and snacks for all. The location is also good. It is a little walk to the Metro. Would stay there again and again. We also really liked the free internet kiosk in the lobby, about 8 stations.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good Choice We stayed at the Embassy although we were going to be attending a family wedding in another hotel two blocks away that offered a similar rate. We are HHonors members and have been completely satisfied with all the hotels in the Hilton group that we have stayed at in the past two years. The reviews on trip advisor had convinced us that the Embassy was the right choice. We had a very long walk to the elevator from the room but despite that this is a professionally run and friendly hotel and we would recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">shame we only had one night! First sight of the interior is quite spectacular - the waterfall flowing into the courtyard, with the rooms onto balconies all round the outside. It was so restful.The rooms (we had a suite) were spacious, comfy and clean. I had a lovely complimentary pina colada in the evening, and the breakfast was lovely- eaten in the courtyard - with masses of choice. Shame we only had one night there, our last in America after travelling for 3 weeks - it was probably the nicest hotel of all those we stayed at.</p></li>

The staff are great and can not do enough to help and the hotel is really family focused. Breakfasts are great and less stressful than at other Embassy Suites and the evening receptions are fun and a great way for the children to meet friends. The children's cinemas and goldfish feeding are a great touch. The rooms are also very nice and unobtrousively made-up everyday. We only wish we had stayed longer.</p></li>

The location is the hotel's biggest asset. We walked almost everywhere. The staff were very accommodating with restaurant recommendations and directions. The rooms and amenities were exactly as advertised, but I've stayed in better-maintained Embassy Suites. The Sunday breakfast service was severely understaffed -- some items didn't get replenished for ages. We didn't use the pool, but it was extremely small.</p></li>

The only problems I had were with the pool and the breakfast. The pool was too small and my kids said it was freezing. Usually we spend every vacation at the pool at some point during our day and we didn't because it was crowded and cold. The buffet in the morning was not for me because I am not a morning person and there were crowds and a mess most of the time. If you are an easy going person this might not bother you because it is afterall free!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The best, by far! We stayed here for four nights over the Fourth of July with three small boys (ages 6, 4 and 3). This hotel is perfectly located and is incredibly family friendly. The breakfasts and the afternoon pool scenes can get a bit crowded but with some simple time planning you can work around it.Three blocks from Dupont Circle and the Metro, about a mile rom the White House and close to several family-friendly resturaunts. We were completely satisfied with our expeience. If you are travelling to DC with your family, this is the place to stay.</p></li>

<li>This <span style="background-color:#e6194b">hotel</span> is <span style="background-color:#e6194b">perfectly located</span> and is incredibly family friendly.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">breakfasts</span> and the afternoon pool scenes can get a bit crowded but with some <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">simple</span> time planning you can work around it.Three blocks from Dupont Circle and the Metro, about a mile rom the White House and close to several family-friendly resturaunts.</br></br></li>
<li>We were completely satisfied with our expeience.</br></br></li>
<li>If you are travelling to DC with your family, this is the place to stay.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent Hotel  I stayed at the property the weekend of Dec. 12th. When I entered the hotel, I was amazed at he beauty of the property. The staff was welcoming and helpful. They made sure both of my rooms were placed next door to each other. The rooms themselves were great! Plenty of space and very clean. Love the HD TV in the living room. And finally, I LOVED the breakfast! Food was good and I loved the make your own waffle station (I'm a nut for a good waffle). Overall, excellent choice for the money and great location in DC. Will be coming back soon with the family.</p></li>

Nice and clean, fine breakfast, and close to the Metro. Very prompt maid service. Also, our first time in DC, with kidz 16,13, and 11... (Think I met Arizona and her family there). Anyway, for the price in DC, location, close to Georgetown and George Washington U. The place is very good. Big enough for 5, as long as you are not in the room too long together. Smallish pool shaped like a U. But free computer terminals to check e-mail, print boarding passes, etc. Would definately stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Below Average Service Stayed in this hotel during Spring break. I found the front desk staff to be unfriendly and not very attendant. There were three staff members at the desk when we arrived but they seem more interested in talking amongst themselves rather than greeting a new guest. The concierge was also not very knowledgeable or helpful. My telephone was not working and I asked for a replacement but no one ever came to fix it. The maid also did not change the bed sheets on the pull out. I would only recommend this hotel to families with kids that were more concerned with large rooms and free breakfasts.</p></li>

I use a network of friends and colleagues for references on where to stay, and had tried several DC area referrals; until I locked in on the Embassy Suites on 22nd Street, NW. The staff here remembers me after just a few stays, is always friendly and very gracious, and seemingly is that way to all their guests. It is my only choice for a hotel when I stay in DC here after. It is always clean, the service efficient and responsive, and the management clearly very competent. It has truly become a home away from home for me.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great place to stay. I wish I knew about it earlier. I have been in a few hotels in DC over the last couple of months but I settled on this one because it had larger rooms (they are suites with two rooms) and because the staff seems willing to make the stay an enjoyable one. I just liked being there. The restaurant downstairs is convenient and even though it's a large hotel, it doesn't feel busy. There were taxis outside waiting all the time, so I never needed to walk to a corner to find one. It's a few blocks from the Metro and sort of within walking distance, but it's not too pleasant on a cold day. I certainly agree with it's current #1 ranking in DC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Place for grandparents and grandkid Excellent experience. Staff was terrific excluding one young desk guy with kind of an attitude on checking in. Doorman alerted us to a free space on the street, which saved us a day's parking charge. Breakfast was excellent, but earlier advice to be there by 830am was right on. Pool was crowded, but lots of families were there vistiting the DC sights, so understandable. Concierge was very helpful in getting us tickets to a Wizards BB game. Work out room was excellent with PreCore elipticals and good treadmills. Only complaint was lack of really hot water at 8 am on day we left. (We were in King Room on 7th floor.)</p></li>

This is a highly ranked hotel for one reason! PRICE For the price I paid ($150 per night for a suite) it is the best value in DC for a family. Everything about this hotel is good or better (ie location, free food, pool and most important kid friendly). The only negatives were in room internet charges ($9.95) and parking ($28 - but it is a city location).Do not stay here if you do not have kids with you. It felt like a Orlando hotel located in DC.All in all, I was happy, my kids were happy and my bank account was happy.</p></li>

The suite was clean, spacious, had a flat screen t.v. in the living room and included everything you need - from ironing board to coffee maker. The hotel provides both breakfast (omelettes, waffles, etc.) and a manager's reception in the evening with snacks, soft drinks and complimentary cocktails. They even had a movie for the kids each night.The hotel is a little far from D.C. attractions, but the metro station is a short walk and was a pleasure to ride.Next time we head back to Washington, we will definitely stay at this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Best hotel on our trip! We were a group of friends travelling together and decided that a suite style accommodation would work best for us. This was truely the best value and experience we had on our trip! Newer hotel, nice flat screen (HD TV, I think!), and 3 sinks. The full breakfast (omlette  belgian waffle station plus a full breakfast buffet!) was situated in a beautiful atrium and paid for nearly half our hotel cost itself! Terrific service. On the last day, my friend accidently left her PJ's on the bed and they ended up being taken with the sheets. The housekeeping staff found it and put it with our luggage before we had to depart no problem. We totally recommend this hotel!</p></li>

The hotel is conveniently located (about 3 blocks from Dupont Circle and the Metro), the staff is friendly and accomodating, and the suites are comfortable and well laid out. The 32'' flat screen tv in the living room area is a definate plus. Like all Embassy Suites this hotel offers an excellent breakfast buffet and cooked to order items (eggs, omelets, etc) and an evening cocktail reception, both of which are fantastic. The Dupont Circle area offers a number of dining options and DC attractions are only a few stops away on the Metro (about a 5-10 minute ride).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a disappointment After reading such glowing reviews for this hotel, I was stunned to find what I did. The rooms were run-down and shabby. The carpeting was stained and dirty. The furniture scratched. The cushions and decorative pillows stained. The front desk was rude. And the parking was several blocks from the hotel. Apparently they had met the capacity in their own parking lot, so we had to park in a lot belonging to another hotel. We were not offered a parking discount for this inconvenience. I love kids, I have three of my own, but this hotel was swarming with them. It felt like we were at a 24/7 party at a Chucky Cheese. I can not understand why this hotel is rated so highly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a great experience at the Embassy Suites We visited this hotel during spring break, a particularly busy time. Despite the crowds, the hotel staff was courteous, helpful, and efficient. The room was beautiful and very comfortable. The breakfasts were wonderful, and the manager's welcome reception each night was much appreciated. This is a great location, too. The only warning I have for others is that if you are not accustomed to driving in a large city, or don't want to, then use alternate directions to/from the hotel from the ones they give out. They direct everyone right through downtown DC, a harrowing journey for those who are not prepared for such an adventure. We would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pretty nice.... PROS:Kids will love it. They can feed the fish in the hotel lobby. Was notnoisey, since the sleeping room is one room removed from the hallway.Fast elevators. Breakfast was above average for a continental. Never had a problem finding a seat for either the breakfast or evening cocktail reception.CONS:Pool is too small, although we usually used it during odd hours and the crouds we lower then. The cocktail reception has chips and other bar-basket food....no real hors d'ouvres. Parking for us was off siteabout a block and a half away (since the on-site garage was full) with no valet service, and expensive at $23 per day.Overall, a good place for families, but expensive (like all Washington hotels).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved Embassy Suites!! We had a great time at the Embassy Suites. The service was great! Our room was ready early and the breakfast and happy hour is awesome! The hotel is in walking distance of the metro and is a few blocks away from Georgetown. The area was safe and we felt comfortable walking around. We loved all the shops and places to eat in Georgetown. The rooms were clean and nice. We liked the fact that you had a bedroom and living room. Also, they had a coffee maker in the room with both coffee and tea. They also gave you shaving cream, razors, and toothpaste if you needed them. My husband and I would stay at this hotel again. Everyone was very nice and we enjoyed our time in D.C. and at the Embassy Suites!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice Hotel  Was last here in spring of 07. This time it was easter break. LOTS OF CHILDREN!!!! The staff did an amazing job with the FB for Breakfast and Manager's reception. The hotel did switch over to compact florescent lighting in the room fixtures. Grade A for effort, but D for execution. They have mixed color types. Some fixtures within the rooms and complete rooms are super nova white (industrial parking garage/spot light) and others are natural soft white. You can tell by looking at the picture windows in the atrium during the evening. They did change my room over to the soft whit when asked, but hopefully this will be delt with soon than later. But given they last five years, I hope they realize the mistake and take the hit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very Practical for the Business Traveler I passed two nights here while I visited Washington, D.C. on business. This property was very clean and quiet and offered great value. The machines in the gym here are newer than the equipment I used at the Embassy Suites in the Chevy Chase Pavillion, where I spent 30 nights last summer. My organization organized an evening cocktail in a private room here and this worked out extremely well. The only disadvantages are a) the location of the metro. The nearest station, Dupont Circle, is about 4 blocks away; and b) the business center computer terminals are a bit slow during peak hours. Nonetheless, the hotel itself is in all respects excellent and I would recommend this property to any traveler.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect! We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and we do not have a single complaint. The room was spacious, clean, and well kept. The facility overall was very clean. The complimentary breakfast was good, and the complimentary cocktails at the nightly managers reception were great. The single thing that made this hotel shine was the staff. This was the friendliest staff I have ever seen, not even one sour face. I could go on and on, but I'll say this - I was attending a conference at another hotel (very well known and high end hotel) so to stay at the Embassy Suites we had to walk to the metro, take the metro, then walk to the other hotelin 32 degree weather. Next year when we go to the conference - we'll do it again. We would not stay anywhere else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great for families I love this hotel. It's beautiful without being snobby. The breakfast buffet and the manager's reception help make it a great value! I really didn't care for was how tiny the pool is. I sat poolside and sipped a cocktail while my daughter and niece swam, and I could not believe how many people just sent their kids down to the pool without accompanying them. After a while it became a screaming madhouse of shrieking kids, and we were happy to leave!I also wish the bathrooms were configured so that someone could use the sink and mirror while someone else was otherwise occupied. There is a sink and mirror outside the bathroom, but having one inside with the toilet and shower ties up the whole room. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, though.</p></li>

Not expecting the Southern hospitality of my hometown, I was quite surprised to find a little bit of home while there. The staff was courteous, helpful, and welcoming, The breakfast and afternoon managers reception was such a treat. The hotel was beautiful and very clean. I loved the beds! I had no idea I could sleep so well away from home. The waterfall and lobby were just lovely!I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit the DC area for fun or business. It's location is central to many of the main attractions. But most importantly, the staff completes the experience by making everyone feel so welcomed!</p></li>

Suite really huge, we had two double bds in one room but plenty of space. British airways lost all our luggage so we had nothing to check in. Reception staff really great and gave us loads of toiletries to put us on. Complimentary b'fast good. Get there early though as it gets crowded and not too well organizes for that many. Also avoid room service, total disaster. We ordered a meal one night and three hours later still not come! Staff admitted that was a major problem. Location great, we walked everywhere. Was pointless walking to metro as it was over halfway to most places! If I went to washington again, I would definately stay there.p.s pool very small!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Manager's Reception is divine! My husband and I recently spent time at the Embassy Suites in Washington. We are not accustomed to staying at large chain hotels, so I had pretty low expectations. (We prefer small, boutique-y kinds of places...) Happily, I was surprised and delighted to realize what a superb experience and fantastic value you get at this hotel. The rooms are lovely and huge and the facilities numerous. They have special activites just for kids. The free breakfast in the morning is great, too. What REALLY makes this place superb, though, is the Manager's reception that is offered daily from 5:30 to 7:30 pm. Included in the reception are snacks and FREE cocktails. FREE!!!!!! You aren't even expected to tip. We were so pleased with our experience we'd do it again, and I'd recommend it to anyone I know.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">overrated on this website I do not see why this hotel has been #1 on TA for so long. I was disappointed. The rooms/carpets are dirty, The pool and health club have a nasty odor.The housekeeping is really sloppy= they dont wipe the bathroom counters, vacuum rugs etc... The reception staff is ok but not overly helpful. We had three rooms for three days and were celebrating my mother's 70th birthday and the hotel did nothing. Some Chocolates, cookies something small might have been nice. When we asked to be together - they got us on the same floor- but not together. We did get the requested early check in. The hotel sticks to its formula with the big breakfasts and happy hours but at the price point is pretty unremarkable and certainly not deserving of its high ranking on TA. I'll stay elsewhere next time and will not return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Where Do I Begin I can't even begin to tell you all how wonderful this hotel is. It is a beautiful hotel that has an open atrium with waterfalls and fish in the ponds. The foliage is lush and the sounds from the water are tranquil. The hotel offers a complimentary breakfast and complimentary drinks and snack (at 5:30 pm). We did not know that there was a game room until we were leaving but we did manage to see the pool which was small but sufficient (anywhere from 10-15 ppl).Another advantage is the location. You're only 5-6 blocks from either the Dupont Circle or Foggy Bottom station. Rooms are cozy with microwaves, refridgerators, and small sink for 'kitchen' needs. Bathrooms are nice too. Staff is very friendly and I am sure you will enjoy your stay. It is #2 on this list for a good reason. It is worth the price. Trust me.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">second time at Embassy Suites This was our second stay at this Embassy Suites having stayed last September as well. We knew what to expect and we were not disappointed. The hotel was naturally busy being summer school holidays and sometimes it was difficult to get seated at breakfast but otherwise everything OK. One of the three lifts was not working so it was a bit frustrating getting up and down to the 8th floor! Front staff were very helpful. We find this location very good - close enough but not too close to the famous locations. The nearby metro system is first class and we recommend the shopping centre at Pentagon City which is easy to get to on the metro.The hotel rooms are now beginning to look a bit tired...the bathroom in particular had some grimy areas.Overall this hotel offers good value for money and good service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Beautiful Hotel; Small Pool Area I was very pleased with the Embassy. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were nice and spacious. The hotel was very clean and updated with flat panel tv's in the living room. My biggest complaint was the amount we had to pay for parking. I believe it was $26 a day which is really ridiculous. The manager's reception was not much to brag about but the complimentary breakfast was one of the best I have ever received from any other hotel I stayed at. There was plenty to choose from. The pool was small and full of children but the kids enjoyed every bit of it. They did complain about the water being salty but other than that they had a blast. The kids also got to feed the fish in the atrium which they enjoyed doing as well. We had a blast and will return when we head back to DC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Place in the Downtown Stayed here for 8 nights for convention in May/June of 2006. Brought along my wife and 14 year old son. Suite was great and in excellent condition. Had in-room safe that was very handy. Fair number of children about, but this was not unexpected. Still pretty quiet and could not hear my neighbors through the walls. Free cooked breakfast was nice. I staged a luncheon at the restaurant for 15 folks and was given a private room at no extra charge. Happy hour in the late afternoon was also good.In room internet costs, but there is a free internet kiosk in the lobby. This is a super location for those going to the new Washington Convention Center and there are many very good restaurants within a short walking distance. Put on your walking shoes to get to the Smithsonian museums (or taxi it). Overall a great experience. Worth every penny.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the Embassy Suites at the Convention Center The Embassy Suites Convention Center, DC was an excellent location to stay and see all the sites in DC. Easy 15 minute walk to the White House, Spy Museum and 20 mins from the Mall. The rooms are perfect for families traveling with kids. The previous problems listed regarding the buffet breakfast seemed to be resolved. We were down at 'peak' times and always enjoyed plenty of fresh food and the lines were not too long. There are plenty of places to eat near by...from fancy to fast food. Starbucks is right across the street. We encountered a Black Out one of our nights stay. The management quickly alerted us and told us what was happening and kept in contact with us via the intercom system. It was very reassuring.I'd highly recommend this property. It was clean, the staff efficient and a safe neighborhood of DC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic Hotel - Would Definitely Stay Again!! We stayed one night at this hotel and would definitely stay there again. It is in a great location, near Dupont Circle and is an easy walk to many restaurants and neighborhood coffee houses. The underground parking garage is very convenient, the staff was extremely helpful and the room itself was emaculate and posh. The room was a suite which included a living room area, bar area with separate sink, large batthroom and large bedroom. The decor was beautiful and contemporary. Some of the amenities in the room were a microwave, small refrigerator and of course a coffee pot. Not having any kids, we noticed it had a lot of families staying there. It was also very difficult to take advantage of the free buffet breakfast - very long lines. So, we recommend getting up very early to get the breakfast in a timely manner. We would definitely go back there, however. Great place!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect for families We have just returned from a two days trip of washington D.C.The stay at embassy suites was perfect. Room was bigger.It had a living room with flat screen T.v and a bedroom with normal tv and a little kitchen with microwave , small refrigerator and additional sink which was perfect when you have 5 years old and 6 monthe old. The extra sink was perfect for washing bottels and other stuff.The complementry breakfast was very good with wide selection of food and cook to order breakfast. The ambience of the hotel was excellent with two waterfall and palm trees and gold fish in the pond. It was very relaxing after a long day of sightseeing. Evening manager's special was fantastic .With a wide range of beverages (including alcohol) and a snack like nacho cheese, prezel, salsa and cheese cubes which made a perfect snack for kids. Overall, this hotel is perfect when you travel with kids .i would definately stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great family accommodation This ranks as our favourite hotel so far on our vacation - according to our children and ourselves.There were lots of holiday makers/ families staying here, but also business people.The atrium is a huge hit - great to look at, and the opportunity to feed the fish twice per day is wonderful.The rooms are spacious, having two vanities outside the bathroom is handy and having a door between the bedroom and living room is needed when you have children going to bed. (Beds are wonderful.)The included breakfasts are great - lots of variety. Plenty of room to find a table.The free evening nibbles and drinks are also great when you have kids - saves rushing out for an early dinner.The laundry fees are only a dollar per wash, which is good value. Internet costs $9.95 per day, which is our only gripe.Concierge and all staff were friendly and helpful. I definitely recommend this as great accommodation - including for families.</p></li>

<li>)The included <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">breakfasts</span> are <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">great</span> - lots of variety.</br></br></li>
<li>Plenty of room to find a table.The <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">free</span> <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">evening nibbles</span> and drinks are also great when you have kids - saves rushing out for an early dinner.The laundry fees are only a dollar per wash, which is good value.</li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Kids Cried When We Left Room was very clean. It was great having the separate living room, and 2 TVs! Bathrooms and beds were very clean (duvets are washed as well as sheets). Free buffet breakfast was good (included in the price of the room), as well as evening cocktails/snacks. All of the employees at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. Very convenient to both the Dupont Circle (Red Line to zoo) and Foggy Bottom (Blue and Orange Lines to Smithsonian). Kids loved the GameCube in the room, too! Dinner at (and room service from)the hotel's restaurant Nicola's was excellent...kids menu too!Hotel was very busy when we were there. Couldn't get a seat for breakfast at 9am. They ran out of plates, bagels, etc both mornings we were there. Recommend you eat by 8:30 to avoid the rush and have a good selection of food, bread, pastries, etc. Also indoor heated pool was very crowded, ran out of towels. Try to swim at dinner time while everyone else is eating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great family hotel, good location Satyed at this hotel for 6 nights with my husband and two chldren (9 and 13). Didn't have a car, as we were flying to our next destination, so parking not an issue.Lovely big rooms with a sitting room complete with flat screen television plus television in bedroom. Breakfast was excellent and queues not enormous. Children stocked themselves up for the day and we saved a fortune! Manager's Happy Hour between 5pm-7pm was a great way to relax at the end of a busy day. Films were shown for the children, plus popcorm and soft drinks, whilst the adults could choose from a whole range of alcoholic beverages and snacks. Easy 5 minute walk to metro which has to be the simpliest metro system to navigate that I have come across and very cheap. Only about a 20 minutes walk to White House and 10 min walk to Georgetown which is lovely - good shops and restaurants. Area felt very safe to walk around.Would certainly choose this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Definetly enjoyable, we'll be back ... Well, let me say I picked this hotel based on the review I read here, the price, the hotel photos/amenities and the price ... and I was not disappointed. Everything was bang on what we expected from the excellent breakfast buffet to the open-bar managers night reception. We really enjoyed the pool, hot tub and sauna as well. My only complaints (and these are minor) was that the internet kiosks they provide are painfully slow. I was very pleased they provided them at all but they were dreadfully slow. Seriously though, that was my biggest complaint. Service was very good and friendly, the hotel was clean (despite a bit of routine garage elevator maintenance), and that fact it is so close to everything is handy. We walked everywhere from the Caiptol Building to the Zoo and never had to take the Metro. Great job to the Embassy West ... we'll be back in about 3-4 years for sure but next time we're bringing family. Great hotel for kids as well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice hotel - but did not meet expectations We just returned from 5 nights at this hotel, which included president's weekend. We picked the hotel because it was rated #1 on this site. It was very well located, and a good value compared to other similarly located hotels, but it clearly was not able to handle a crowded situation. One of the elevators was broken for the first 3 days of our stay, and we often had to wait over 5 minutes to get an elevator. The stairs were difficult to find and only went to the 2nd floor, not to the lobby, and the stairwells were FILTHY. Once the elevator was fixed, then the elevator wait was fine. In addition, the first two mornings (when the hotel was crowded) the hotel was unable to handle the breakfast crowd, with many people not finding seats and the food ran out frequently with long lines for replenishment. Our room was only marginally clean, and it was very dark. This was the only time we have been disappointed by a hotel selected using this site.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Close to everything Stayed for six days in early August. The staff was friendly and provided good suggestions on getting around and directions. We walked to Georgetown University and Lincoln Memorial on two different days - on other days we used the metro to travel. The manager's reception had good drinks and plenty of soft drinks available with different munchies each night. The breakfast was good, but very hectic in the last hour of serving. Many foods would run out and weren't replenished quickly. Also, the setup of the area was inefficient causing people to bunch up when waiting in line.Embassy Suites has become a hotel of families. That's why we stay there, but it can be noisy depending on who your neighbor is. Given it is mainly a hotel of families, it's surprising the in-hotel restaurant is a fancy Italian restaurant. Perhaps making it a bit more family-oriented would result in more people eating there in the evening. However, there were plenty of more family-oriented restaurants in the area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Perfect Place! I go to this wonderful hotel every year for my annual girls' road trip with some girlfriends and co-workers - and we have never failed to be delighted! While it looks very non-descript from the outside, The Embassy Suites at Dupont Circle is MAGNIFICENT inside: coy pond, water falls, plants and an amazing open atrium make it a hotel that you can just relax in... the lobby is unlike any other hotel I've ever stayed at! It is just beautiful!Plus, there's a free breakfast (which is GREAT) each morning and a free cocktail party each night.. The hotel has gone through some upgrades recently, too: there's now a waffle maker at breakfast, some extra munchies at the cocktail party and free internet access. Also, we got a call from the hotel restaurant (where we ordered a very nice pizza from) asking if we liked the food. There are just so many nice touches to this hotel - they are TOTALLY customer service oriented. Don't forget your swim suit - there's a lovely indoor pool, too, with a hot tub!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great place to stay if you have kids... We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights during a recent trip to DC. The hotel is located in a nice area with restaurants within walking distance and a drugstore right around the corner.The breakfast was a definite bonus for a family with 4 children. There was something for everyone to eat. The staff was friendly and seemed very attentive to clearing the tables.I would agree that there were a lot of children (tweens) mulling about the hotel, but they didn't seem disruptive or poorly behaved.The pool was pretty crowded. It was tough to find a spot to put our things down, but other hotel guests seemed willing and friendly enough to give up a seat. The kids had a great time.My husband noted that the parking lot was a few blocks down at the Ritz Carlton lot. This may be a problem for people with difficulty walking.Overall, our stay here was very pleasant. The rooms were cleaned properly. When I called to request extra towels, pillows, and hangers, the staff was very accommodating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the Beds! We were guests, and were treated to a non-smoking suite. The room was very nice, with a wide screen plasma tv, a couch, desk, microwave and fridge ... all very nice.The bedroom was very nice and the bed was delighhhhhtful.. it had a down-like comforter and lots and lots of pillows. It was very high off the floor, so when you are all wrapped up on the bed, you feel very cuddly and safe.The staff were very friendly, the restaurant is very pricey ... in fact, the is one of the first hotels I've experienced where room service is less expensive than the restaurant. I wish I had realized that sooner in our stay.There's a manager's cocktail hour from 5:30-7:00 every night (never attended) and a nice breakfast buffet that isn't as wonderful as other places, but it's certainly fine to get the day started--I'm guessing kids would like it, too.The business center is down in the basement which was a bit inconvenient, but there is an Internet kiosk in the hotel lobby to sign on and check your email or surf the web.All in all, very nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Watch the doors Decent, convenient, place to stay in DC, even though it was ridiculously expensive when we were there ($350 per night). However, we were staying for a week and nothing else in the area had availability.Although there were a good amount of business travelers staying in the hotel, it is primarily a family hotel, as many of the ES tend to be.Typical Embassy Suites with the breakfast in the am, and the cocktails in the pm. Good gym with modern machines. Fast room service and nice people working at the hotel. Negatives are the $10 per night internet charge and lack of an in-room safe.My one big problem was I came back one day and my door was open, apparently the maid had not closed the door tightly enough when he or she finished cleaning the room. Although nothing was stolen (I took everything with me due to a lack of above mentioned in-room safe), it gave me a major heart attack. The mechanism that keeps the door from slamming shut (see above mentioned kid friendly remark) also keeps the door from closing securely without a solid effort.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel, superb staff Stayed here on the basis of the great TA reviews and the hotel certainly lived up to it's good reviews. Airline lost my luggage and the hotel staff couldn't have been nicer, providing lots of toiletries and checking us in really late at night.The room was really lovely, smashing bed and lots of fluffy towels in a very smart bathroom and all so clean.It's a pretty busy hotel so if you're looking for tranquility and real peace this is not the place for you. The location is not dead centre but it's near enough to walk and there's plenty nearby.It's a fabulous hotel for kids they all seemed to be having a ball - from the big breakfasts to the free drinks and popcorn feast each evening. The breakfast was ideal - a good selection and although it seems really busy you don't have much problem getting what you need.The free bar each evening is amazing . They have really friendly staff who chatted to all the guests, there was also snacks every night to accompany the drinks, nachos, salsa, pretzels etc a nice wee cocktail break. I would definately stay here again when visiting Washington.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">An excellent hotel in a good location Overall we had a lovely stay here. The good: - Rooms are very large- The main sleeping room is set back from the door so this is a very quiet hotel at nighttime- Free breakfast is excellent with order your own omlette- Staff are friendly and efficient- Managers reception very good value - you can pick the wine (from small list) and there are some good ones available. The snacks are just crisps, popcorn and natchos- Restaurant on site is good, a little more expensive than average but only what you would expect in a hotel - service is very quick. - Location good for day time - you can walk everywhere! Furthest away area of Capitol takes 45 mins good paced walking- Walkable to Georgetown - we found a lovely Italian restaurant - Papa Razzi - M Street and Wisconsin Av (15 mins walk with lots of choice and excellent service). The not so good: - At night there are restaurants within walking distance. However the only area we found with lots of choice was GeorgeTown. This is a 15 min walk away up M street. I have out this in the 'not so good' category as we didnt find lots of restaurants close by.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Exceeded expectations The host hotel for my conference couldn't accommodate us for the duration of our stay so we were happy to find this hotel close by. Not only do the suites make life easier (separate bedrooom so if one of us wants to go to bed early or get up early, there's additional space to hang out), there's an extra sink outside of the bathroom, there's two TVs and lots of outlets for electronics. Best parts though were the included hot breakfast buffet (made to order omelettes, waffles, etc), but the manager's evening reception which was any well drink, draft beer or specialty drink they could concoct -- especially friendly staff, snacks that were different each night (veggies and rip, chips, pretzels, nachos w/jalapenos and cheese) and the opportunity to feed the koi (if so inclined). OK, yes, it's a chain and had that kind of Holiday Inn feel with the big atrium and waterfalls and generic room furniture, but the rooms were clean, fairly modern, quiet and again, the staff were especially friendly and unobtrusive. For the money and great location (close to Dupont Circle), I wouldn't trade it for something more typical DC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Happy with my hotel choice in DC I just spent 5 nights at the Embassy Suites in Washington DC. We checked out the reviews of many hotels and chose this one because of the size of the room. We are a family of 5 (kids are 14, 12, and 9) and it seems that most hotels only have room for 4 people squished into 2 double beds. My wife and I slept in a king bed in a bedroom and the 3 kids slept in the main room. Two shared the queen pullout and we brought an air mattress for the other. 2 TV's, one bathroom, overall perfectly fine for us and better than spending $$ on 2 rooms. The managers reception is daily from 5:30 to 7:30 and we didn't miss a day. Cold beer, veggies, nachos, chips, popcorn etc. The kids made use of the small but adequate indoor pool almost every day. We had friends who stayed at the Westin Grand around the corner and they spent their spare time at our hotel which was much more fun for the kids.The decor is not the greatest, but the hotel was clean, comfortable, and the service was very good - including the restaurant. The location seemed fine. I would certainly go back without hesitation. Not a cheap hotel by any means, but nothing is in Washington...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Decent Hotel After reading many of the reviews on Trip Advisor I was a bit apprehensive about this (and other) hotels on our recent vacation to the East Coast. Our four night stay at the Embassy Suites was quite pleasant. The food was OK, and much better than what we had at many places on this trip. The morning breakfast had some lines but what would I expect from a hotel with nine or ten floors. We made it a point to get down there early enough and our breakfasts were always hot. If I had to define a criticism of anything on this stay I guess it would be that the front desk personnel didn't seem very friendly to me, but they were usually pretty busy with waiting on customers so that's understandable too. We would definately stay at the Embassy Suites again. Our son loved the pool and game room, the elevators were fast and the location was very convenient with a pharmacy/convenience store on the corner and a Starbucks next to that. The traffic in Washington was absolutely horrendous, but that wasn't the hotels fault, :), and in spite of that we still managed to take the van out and about the city on numerous occasions because we had very convenient underground parking with our room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lived Up To The Hype And More I recently stayed at the Embassy Suites for a week to attend a seminar in Washington. I also brought along my family so I was looking for a more family friendly hotel. After reviewing Trip Advisor I chose the Embassy Suites. Not to be snobbish, but normally my wife and I would never stay at an Embassy Suites as we usually stay at higher end places when we travel alone. So with some reservation, and based solely upon the outstanding Trip Advisor reviews, I booked the hotel. Let me just say that my stay proves once again that Trip Advisor is never wrong. My family and I had an absolutely wonderful stay. The staff is the most friendly and helpful group of employees that you will encounter. The hotel is also beautiful. The room was spotless, comfortable and big. The free food at breakfast and at the manager's reception is fantasic for the kids (ok, I admit I also took great advantage of the free drinks). For whatever reason, the other guests and the numerous kids running around were also extremely friendly. Finally, the hotel is in a excellent location. If you have kids (or even if you don't have kids) this is the place to stay. KUDOS ONCE AGAIN TO TRIP ADVISOR!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great vacation My family and I stayed at the Embassy Suites DC over 4th of July weekend and had a great time. I used Hilton points to book the stay, requesting the two bedroom presidential suite, and actually got it. The room was huge! Two full bedrooms and two baths, living room, dining room. Way more than we needed but the kids loved it. Flat panel TV's in each bedroom and the living room. The service was very good. The staff always helpful. There was a water leak over the bar area that was fixed in a flash. I guess the only complaint would be the air conditioner was quite noisy so I guess if you were a light sleeper you might have problems.As with all Embassy's, full breakfast is included. Being the 4th of July weekend, it was pretty crowded each morning but the food was fine and we were always able to find a table. It saves a lot to be able to eat a free big breakfast each day.The location of the hotel is great. It's a quiet area close to DuPont Circle. There are many restaurants within a 10 minute walk. The Foggy Bottom metro station is a 10 minute walk away which will get you anywhere. We walked into Georgetown one day with no complaints from the kids.I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very Happy With this Embassy Suites This was our third time at this Embassy suites and we were very pleased. the front desk staff and manager were excellent and after loosing my key a couple times remembered my name and laughed with me about it. they make you feel very welcome at this hotel which is in a very safe area of D.C. We have always felt safe walking around this area at night. The front desk staff know the directions anywhere and the best places to go. They are truly trained well.Breakfast and happy hour get very busy here, but everything is fresh and they serve great drinks at happy hour. From frozen margaritas to bottled beer they don't go as cheap as I have seen other Embassy Suites do. The soft drink station also has a huge selection including powerade and an energy drink. One morning I brought my breakfast tray to the room because lack of seating, but found this to be enjoyable.We enjoyed the equipment in the exercise room and it was always kept clean and filled with water and towels.Some people may wonder how can an Embassy Suites be the #2 hotel in D.C, and i think even though the property is not the Four Seasons, the overall customer service and value lead to a great D.C. deal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">good- a bit overpriced hotel itself is very nice. Positives-good location, breakfast included, nightly open bar reception with cheap snacks, big rooms with flat panel tv, frig, microwave, kid friendly. Negatives-- not cheap (free breakfast, recption etc is not really free- its part of your room rate which was 350+ a night during late april ), managers recption is really fair wine , watered down frozen drinks etc. with pretzels, chips--not real food in the evening although kids were happy), slow elevators with other kids often pushing all the buttons, a tiny indoor pool that is as overcrowded as ive ever seen and completely overrun with kids (and i love kids!!), extra charge per day for in room internet-insane!, small computer terminals free in lobby often were nonfunctional, parking was in the hotel 1 block away --same charge as lot in hotel always too crowded, one day the maids just never came--several phone calls lead to this being rectified at 730 pm after being out the whole day. All in all would stay here only if i had kids and while i would return it would only be with a better deal on the room. Will likely consider other places although all in all it was nice --keep in mind the above and look for a discounted rate.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel for family of 4 on 4 day weekend We chose this hotel for a family junket to DC with two kids, ages 11  14 because of the location, free breakfast and reviews on this site. We were not disappointed! Our room was a King suite with a seperate Queen sleeper sofa that the kids shared. The room was clean and well furnished. Our bed was divine, though the kids complained about the ding of the elevator (we were down the hall from it). We thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast in the mornings, though try not to get there too late as everybody else does, or you'll find yourself in line especially for the popular Belgium waffle station. We used the on-site secure parking at around $26/day and left the car there, opting to walk about 4 blocks to the Foggy Bottom or Dupont Circle Metro stations. We dined at the on-site Italian restaurant the first night. The service and food were great. Because of the location, there are plenty of other dining choices not too far away (loved Marakesh Palace!) Dad and kids enjoyed the indoor pool and hot tub (especially after a full day of sightseeing!) The staff was also very helpful, and there is a free Internet kiosk in the lobby so you can plan out your day. We will definitely return to this hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Really Enjoyed the Embassy Suites - 22nd St NW The staff was very friendly and helpful from the moment we checked in. Our room was ready when arrived in the early afternoon on a Friday.This is a family friendly hotel, so be prepared for lots of kids. We had the breakfast buffet every morning. Note if you want the made to order omlettes, you need to get downstairs early. The later you go down, the longer the omlette line. There is a wide variety in the buffet with many hot entrees to choose from without having to wait in the omlette line.Prime times during the breakfast buffet and cocktail reception, elevators are slow. There are 3, but during prime time you have to wait for an elevator. If you stay here and are on floors 3 and 2, do yourselves and fellow guests on the upper floors a favor and get some exercise by walking down the stairs!Rooms were always cleaned in a timely manner. We really enjoyed the food at the italian restaurant in the hotel. Loved having the computer kiosks in the lobby so that we could print our boarding passes the night before we left.We were able to walk to the Metro stops and if you walk over to M Street you will find McDonald's, Chipotle, Cosi, etc. Otherwise restaurants in the area can be relatively pricey for a family.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Experience at the Embassy Suites - Washington D.C. We recently returned from an eight day vacation in Washington D.C. and stayed at this Embassy Suites Property. Our family of five, including two teenage girls and a 12 year old boy, booked two spacious rooms that met all of our needs. The property is located in the NW quadrant of the city and is a short walk to all of the sites including the White House, the memorials, all of the Smithsonian museums and Georgetown. We walked everywhere and when we didn't want to walk we took the very efficient Metro which was only three short blocks away. The hotel rooms were clean and comfortable. The small refrigerator came in mighty handy to store lots of water and snacks that were bought at the Walgreens or CVS which was only one block away. (along with the Starbucks which for me was a necessity). The free breakfast in the morning combined with the free cocktail hour at night put the icing on the cake for us. This hotel made our stay in Washington D.C. much more relaxing and enjoyable. I highly recommend the Embassy Suites in Washington D.C. at M and 22nd streets. One hint for families traveling to D.C. in the summer. It's hot so stay at this hotel and walk three blocks to the large free public pool for a quick refreshing dip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good for families First and foremost, this hotel is great for families. And that is why it's packed with families. If you really don't like children and want a peaceful breakfast, I recommend staying elsewhere.The breakfast was great, particularly for a family. The buffet was wonderful and the coffee nice and strong the way we like it. Watching the carp swim in the pools while eating breakfast is a lot of fun with young children.The restaurant on site has terrible service and I don't recommend it because of that reason only. The food was actually decent, if they remember to bring it to you. We went twice and regretted it twice. Other families had the same problems on different days so it wasn't just an isolated experience.The pool was fun for the kids and they also show movies in the afternoon for kids. Given the outreach to families, I wonder why they don't have a separate play area for younger kids. It would help keep them from running around the atrium.As a gold vip, I can tell you that there are no additional perks worth discussing (I did get two bottles of water, but for a 4 night stay, that's not much). Not even late checkout when I tried. Kevin or Keith (sorry, I can't remember his name correctly) is a wonderful bellman who is friendly to the kids and adults alike.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice hotel, kids loved it My husband, two daughters (ages 6 and 8) and I stayed at the Embassy Suites for 3 nights. We were impressed by the size of the room considering the location of the hotel (being so close to downtown Washington DC). The room and bath were clean and modern, and the room had a microwave and small fridge. The kids bed was the sofa in the living room, and it was nice to have our own bedroom. The pool was sort of small, but it was clean with tons of towels and the kids loved it. Also, they were able to go into the hot tub so they wanted to swim each day as much as they could. There also was a game room which had about 6-8 machines for the kids. Breakfast was plentiful and although the hotel was full, we had no problems getting a table each morning and having plenty to eat. Between 5:30 and 7:30 in the evening, they had an open bar with snacks (popcorn, chips, salsa, etc) which was great for us to chill out after a day of sightseeing. The staff was friendly and came right to our room when we needed anything. As for location, the hotel is in a nice area and there is a Starbucks within a block, which we loved. The Metro was a few blocks away and cabs were plentiful when we preferred to take them. Overall, a great stay - we will return when we get back to DC!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect family hotel with a great location Based on reviews we read in Trip Advisor for families travelling with children, we chose the Embassy Suites hotel on 22nd Street (Foggy Bottom area) in Washington DC. We could not have been happier with our choice! We were travelling with our 3 children ages 16, 13, and 6 who had never been to Washington before. The hotel was in a fantastic neighborhood location, a short and easy walk to the subway and with plenty of neighborhood restaurants nearby. We like to use local transportation when we travel, so this was a real plus. Since the room had a seperate living area (with a sofa sleeper), it gave the 5 of us plenty of room to spread out. The room was nicely decorated and very clean. One of the best features, especially from a family perspective is the free breakfast...not a continental breakfast, but a full buffet with lots of choices. They managed to feed a huge number of people, but kept everything stocked and clean. The staff at the hotel was excellent as well, very service oriented and willing to answer all our questions, in fact, one of the bellman took us under his wing and explained the whole subway system to us in detail, which was a big help! We will definitley stay here again and would recommend the hotel to anyone travelling to Washington DC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a wonderful stay here! We just spent a week in Washington, DC at the Embassy Suites and it was fabulous! There were 4 of us, my husband and I plus our two teenage daughters. We stayed in an executive suite (I think that's what they called it). It had a bedroom with two queen size beds and then a living room/kitchenette room with a nice TV and a sofa bed. (The girls took turns on the sofa bed.) We were very comfortable. It was very conveniently located right in the middle between Dupont Circle and George Washington University. The breakfast buffet was nice but I recommend you get up early to eat because it gets really busy after 8am. The manager's reception is kind of lame. Popcorn, chips and salsa. Not too much fun if you're not a drinker. We didn't really spend time in the pool. We live in Florida so pools aren't a big deal for us. We ate at the hotel restaurant one night and it was okay; nothing spectacular but everything tasted fairly good. We were in DC for the 4th and that was great fun! We stayed away from the Mall and watched the fireworks sitting in front of the Federal Reserve building. It was the perfect spot, no crowds! The hotel staff was very friendly and met our every need. The cleaning staff was great, too. We came home to nice, clean rooms every night. I highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved it! We will definitely stay at this embassy suites when we go back to D.C. The atrium is beautiful. The room was very nice, although in my opinion the living/dining area was a little plain. The flat screen tv was nice. The bedroom was very nicely decorated and very quiet. Breakfast was great (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, grits, oatmeal, waffles, omelets, fruit, yogurt bagels...) and we never had a problem finding a seat. The manager's reception was also a great way to unwind in the evenings. Our 3 year old loved having snack and soda, and also loved the kids movie that plays on the 2nd floor mezzanine each evening during the reception. She also enjoyed getting to feed the fish a few times. We walked to 3 different metro stations from the hotel, and didn't consider any of them too far, in fact we actually enjoyed walking through the city. The staff is excellent!!! One thing, the pool was much smaller than we expected, so we didn't end up swimming as planned. Also, they have a computer in the lobby right by the front desk that you can look up local attractions/restaurants etc - don't use it, ask the staff instead. We looked up drugstore, and it pulled up a CVS that was like 8 blocks away, only to find on the walk home that there is a walgreens 1/2 block away. Anyway, I highly recommend this hotel, particularly to families.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Place For Families Great hotel for tourist travel to DC, particularly with kids. Very family friendly. We were there for a week this June and found it to be a perfect location to see all the sights. We took cabs to the museums from the hotel and never paid more than $13 for the trip (with two per day, that comes to the same price as parking a car at the hotel). The included breakfast every morning is tasty and extensive and my son loved the managers reception every evening for snacks. I also can't say enough positive things about the staff. They were friendly and helpful with directions, flagging down cabs, and keeping the rooms and the grounds clean. The biggest downside to our stay is that we appeared to be there during school field trip season, so there were large swarms of somewhat unsupervised kids using the public areas. While this is a downside, it is certainly not the fault of the hotel. The Itallian restaurant in the hotel was very good, and there are a number of other restaurant options in easy walking distance of the hotel, through nice neighborhoods, including a number of embassies. Tip for tired sightseers - there are several local restaurants that will deliver to your room! We stretched a tasty Thai dinner out for two days. SInce the rooms are equiped with microwave and refridgerator, eating in the room is a reasonable option as well.</p></li>

<li><span style="background-color:#f032e6">Great</span> <span style="background-color:#f032e6">Place</span> For Families Great hotel for tourist travel to DC, particularly with kids.</br></br></li>
<li>Very family friendly.</br></br></li>
<li>We were there for a week this June and found it to be a <span style="background-color:#e6194b">perfect</span> <span style="background-color:#e6194b">location</span> to see all the sights.</br></br></li>
<li>We took cabs to the museums from the hotel and never paid more than $13 for the trip (with two per day, that comes to the same price as parking a car at the hotel).</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">included</span> <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">breakfast</span> every morning is tasty and extensive and my son loved the managers reception every evening for snacks.</br></br></li>
<li>I also can't say enough positive things about the staff.</br></br></li>
<li>They were friendly and helpful with directions, flagging down cabs, and keeping the <span style="background-color:#f58231">rooms</span> and the grounds <span style="background-color:#f58231">clean</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>The biggest downside to our stay is that we appeared to be there during school field trip season, so there were large swarms of somewhat unsupervised kids using the public areas.</br></br></li>
<li>While this is a downside, it is certainly not the fault of the hotel.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">Itallian restaurant</span> in the hotel was <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">very</span> good, and there are a number of other restaurant options in easy walking distance of the hotel, through nice neighborhoods, including a number of embassies.</br></br></li>
<li>Tip for tired sightseers - there are <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">several local</span> <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">restaurants</span> that will deliver to your room!</br></br></li>
<li>We stretched a <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">tasty</span> <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">Thai dinner</span> out for two days.</br></br></li>
<li>SInce the rooms are equiped with microwave and refridgerator, eating in the <span style="background-color:#557585">room</span> is a <span style="background-color:#557585">reasonable</span> option as well.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Family Friendly But.... We stayed at the Embassy Suites the week after Easter 2007.The place was jammed with other families on Spring Break.There is a free breakfast buffet that comes with the room charge. The food is just average and the staff had a hard time keeping up with demand. There were long lines, empty serving dishes and the clean-up crew could barely keep up with the stacks of dirty dishes littering the tables. (This is not a criticism of the staff--they were obviously working very hard). There is a happy hour from 5:30-7:30p each day with free cocktails for parents and snacks for kids. Many parents seemed to stay out in the atrium enjoying their drinks while their kids swam in the nearby pool. The pool was tiny and crowded and many young kids were unsupervised. The chlorine smell was overwhelming.The staff could not keep up with the demand for towels.In the evening, it seems every family has a different idea of the best time for lights out. On Saturday night, there were two different groups of unsupervised young kids running wildly through the halls after 10pm. Neither the hotel management or the parents seemed very concerned about this behavior. Needless to say, that made it pretty tough for the rest of us to get to sleep!Bottom Line: Think twice about visiting D.C. at Spring Break. The crowds can be overwhelming both at the hotels and at the various sites around town.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent! Our singing group of 8 women traveled to Washington at the beginning of December. (We were singing at the White House.) We booked 3 rooms at the Embassy Suites.Upon arriving, we were greeted warmly at the desk, and were treated wonderfully by EVERY employee the entire duration of our stay. Everyone is friendly and helpful - we were just so blown away.In the middle of the first night, the hotel alarm went off and everyone had to head to the lobby. Again, the staff answered all questions and put people at ease. (False alarm.) The following morning the night manager circulated at breakfast, explaining why the alarm had gone off and asking everyone how they fared the night before.Speaking of breakfast - WoW! There is so much to choose from that I can't imagine anyone would go away hungry: hot and cold cereals, pancakes, waffles, bacon, eggs, made-to-order omelets, biscuits and gravy, fresh fruit, and much more... all included in the room rate.The rooms themselves were very clean and nicely decorated. The bedding is crisp, clean and comfortable. A few of us slept on the sofabeds and they are comfortable and clean, as well.Again, we were thrilled with the hotel and plan to stay there again if we return to Washington. ***One word of advice about the taxis...get a quote BEFORE you get in! The prices are supposed to be standardized, but we were charged widely different amounts for our day trips.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Number 1 in DC? No Way! We have been here for 4 nights and are leaving tomorrow. We have stayed here many times before and thought the value was excellent, but now we feel differently. We paid $ 399 for our room and it is not worth it. the room and hotel are starting to show their age. The hallway carpets are old, buckling and filthy, the wallpaper in the room is peeling off and stained, the room carpet is in terrible shape and the trim needs a good coat of paint. the pool is the size of a matchbook and is way too small for a busy hotel this size. there are about 10 chairs for 400 guests. After sightseeing all day, this is not a relaxing pool to be in. The tiles are moldy and falling off and the ceiling tiles are off because of leaking.My husband was the only one to do breakfast this morning and he stood in line 3 different times, each one for 15 mins. He then sat at the only available table that was dirty with dishes and syrup. He said next time he will go somewhere and pay for breakfast.The only great experience we had with this place were with the bartenders at the manager,s reception - they were excellent. The location is good, about 5 long blocks each way to the 2 metro stations about 15 mins, but there are many hotels in this area.I guess we are just getting old and less tolerant with crowds and busy hotels. We figured next time for the money we can stay somewhere nicer and have a relaxing time instead of being annoyed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great stay, would highly recommend Just returned from a lovely one night stay at the Embassy Suites.Took the train from our home in VA to attend an evening performance at the Kennedy Center. Easy metro trip from Union Station-then about a four block walk from the Dupont Circle stop through a nice neighborhood of upscale townhomes and apartments.. Two room suite spotless and spacious with wet bar, small fridge, microwave, coffee maker with tea and coffee selections. Enjoyed complimentary cocktails at manager's reception prior to delicious dinner in Nicola's- their on site Italian restaurant. When we told them we had limited time for dinner as we needed to get to the Kennedy Center, they could not have been more accommodating, suggesting entrees that took less time to prepare. We were out in plenty of time, and bellman got us a cab when we were ready -$6.50 each way.  We enjoyed a quiet and comfortable night's sleep. Individual temperature controls for each suite worked well.Extensive breakfast buffet with an omlet station the next morning was a bit crowded with families, but this was a holiday weekend, and we chose probably the busiest time to eat-around 9 am. But tables were cleared promptly and we had no difficulty finding a place to sit-there is lots of room. We stored our luggage at the hotel while we visited some museums prior to our early evening departure on the train-we will definitely stay here again on our next visit to DC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great family hotel - not for business We had a very good stay here and would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling with kids. Just a couple issues worth noting. The business center was overrun with children playing computer games all the time. That made it impossible to use a computer when needed. I need to stay in touch with work even on vacation (as most people do I expect.) I access my email on my blackberry, but cannot print and find it difficult to read long messages which show up as attachments. There are standup computer stations throughout the lobby, but those did not solve my printer problem. I guess the long and short is that I think business centers should be for business, and the family slant of this hotel means there are no 18 and over rules for the business center. It was a relatively minor inconvience for me, but if I had been travelling on business it would have been a huge problem. In a similar vein, we had a lot of delays caused by tween kids having races in the elevators. One last thing - I called the concierge the second night of our four night stay for dinner reservation assistance and had to leave a voice mail ... I am still waiting for a call back. All in all, for a family trip at well under $300 a night it was just fine. Delightful personnel (the woman who cleans up during breakfast is one of the nicest service workers I have encountered in a long time!) The room was nice and the breakfast was the best free breakfast I have ever had at a hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great for Families, central location to metro This was the 3rd time we have stayed here in 3 years. 2X while we looked at local colleges. On our first night as we came back from dinner I requested extra towels at the front desk, there were 5 of us, the towels were in the room before we even got upstairs. My daughters have very long hair which gets everywhere when they brush it, each day the bathroom and rooms were spotless, they even left extra soap and shampoo once they knew there were 5 of us in the room. Staff always said Good Morning  Good Evening. The breakfast is one of the reasons we stayed here each time. Each person was able to find something to eat each day, whether it was the pancakes, omlettes, waffles, bagels or oatmeal we never went hungry. There is plenty of other stuff to eat too! Garage is spotless and you can fit a minivan in the space. You need a code to get in and out of the garage so we knew our car was safe. Use the metro instead of driving around the city. Metro is very easy and fast and Dupont Circle is only 4-5 blocks from the hotel. There are many restaurants in Dupont Circle so we ate there 2 nights after our travels around the city. If you are not from a metropolitan area like New York, Boston, Chicago be prepared for the food prices all over even pizza places. Dinner for the 5 of us at nice restaurants averaged $110 including tip, no alcohol, only sodas. Good prices since we are from the NY Metro area where dinner for the 5 of us averages $150 but others have found the DC prices high.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Reliably Good We've stayed at this Embassy Suites several times over the past 10+ years (both before and since our son was born), which I suppose says enough. While the property doesn't wow, it's dependable, comfortable, and pleasant.The location is great--out of the immediate bustle for downtown but part of the vibrant Dupont Circle area. The Mall, Georgetown, and other attractions and neighborhoods are a very manageable walk away, but the Metro station is nearby if you want to catch a train.The breakfast buffet is a nice perk. It's diverse and substantial enough to satisfy a full range of appetites, from those wanting a healthy, post-workout refresher to those who view all-you-can-eat as a challenge. The evening reception is OK--worth going to if you're sitting around the hotel but not worth hurrying back for. The snacks are standard reception fare, with the healthier options being particularly uninspired. Likewise for the beer and wine selections. The frozen drinks--popular with many--are crazy sweet. Still, there are various soft drinks and juices available too.If you're craving a good workout, there are endless great places to run from the hotel. If you want to stay in house, the workout room is well-equipped for being as small as it is. Likewise for the pool/whirlpool/sauna area. It can be a raucous kid-magnet at times, but there are also a couple adults-only hours each day.I've taken to describing this as our default hotel. Until something else comes along with a better combination of location, price, and amenities, we'll keep coming back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Highly recommend this Embassy Suites! We stayed here for 4 nights (9/29-10/2/07) while visiting Washington DC. We both loved the hotel which is within a 10 minute walk to either the Dupont Circle (Red line) or the Foggy Bottom (Blue or Orange line) metro stations. The room was lovely - we had a corner suite and it had 2 flat screen TVs, one of which was HD, a dining table, wet bar, microwave, refrigerator, coffeemaker, good sized bathroom and king bed. The free breakfast was great - made to order omelets, plus a large buffet selection of grits, potatoes, eggs, bacon, sausage, bagels, rolls, cereals, oatmeal, fruit, danish, a large variety of juices, soft drinks, coffee, tea, etc.. We ate a large breakfast each day then skipped lunch which saved us a lot of money! Every evening the manager's reception had FREE drinks - beer, wines, margaritas, strawberry daquiris, and various other liquers, along with pretzels, popcorn, potato chips and snack mix. It was a nice way to unwind from the long days we spent sightseeing. The hotel was in a very nice and safe area and we never felt nervous about walking to or from the hotel. The Chinese restaurant Meiwah is only 2 blocks away and it was one of the best meals we had in DC. I'd skip the restaurant in the hotel -- it wasn't all that good and it was fairly expensive. There is also a CVS store a few blocks away - hard to find so ask someone where it is if you want to get some water, soda, snacks, etc... All in all we had a lovely stay and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Washington for business or pleasure!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">DC GETAWAY Stayed here for 3 days in August with a family of five. The hotel is in a nice safe area of Washington DC, just north of the George Washington University campus. There were 2 other hotels on the same block, a Marriott and Ritz Carlton. The suite was a standard room for Embassy Suites hotels, with a good size living room area that had the pull out sofa bed and 2 double beds in the bedroom. The room was very clean, but had a bit of old and new in it. The living room had a flat screen TV with HD, while the bedroom had a standard one. Sinks had granite tops, but the tub/shower and toilet were dated and a bit beat up. The decorating was a late 80's, early 90's vibe, but overall for the price, compared to other DC properties it was well worth it. The breakfast buffet had a nice spread, but I agree with other reviewers that it was crowded and not easy to find a seat. I saw many people taking their trays up to their rooms. The restaurant in the hotel Nicolas was a solid choice if you don't feel like going back out for dinner after a day of sightseeing.Please note that the hotel is quite a ways from the major attractions. Walking to them is possible, but we mixed in cabs with the walking. There are 2 Metro stations nearby, but we figured with a 12, 9, and 4 year old with a stroller, cabs would be easier than lugging everybody to a train.Overall a pleasant stay and a solid hotel. The atrium interior was also fun for the kids, as they got a kick out of the fish. It probably shouldn't be rated #2 overall in DC, but definetely #1 for families looking to visit Washington.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great value! We arrived in around 5:00 and received a warm welcome from the staff. Our room was spacious and comfortable and it was great that everyone had their own bed. The loveseat in the sitting area folded out into a bed. My daughter who slept out there did complain about the noise so be aware that that noisy neighbors can be heard from this room. The evening reception was delightful and very much appreciated. Beer and wine and various drinks were served as well as soda and juice. There were munchies that my family of four enjoyed. During the weekend the place was milling with kids. We have two teenagers so this did not bother us at all. The complete breakfast was the highlight and it does pay to get up early to avoid a long line. The one morning we slept in there was still plenty of food. There are coin laundry machines for those who desire to do some wash. There is a walk of a few blocks to the metro which under normal circustances would never have phased us but because there is so much walking/standing in DC we did feel quite tired by the end of the day. We ordered a delivered pizza from Luigis (just okay). We ate dinner at Johnny Rockets, (decent and 50's atmoshpere) a Chinese restarant right around the corner that was decent, TGIF (great food but just okay service) and The Front Page in Dupont Circle which was excellent in every way. The hotel was a great bargain in every way and I would highly recommend it to families wanting to visit DC. If you have young children, you may want to tour with a company that picks you up and drops you off due to all the walking you will end up doing if you tour on your own.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect for Kids - Just visited Two families of 4 each travelled Friday night to Tuesday night in April. Very clean and nicely decorated rooms. Window in bedroom opens - which I love for fresh air. Three different mirror/sink areas to brush teeth/apply makeup makes it easy to get ready with 4 people in a room.Excellent hotel experience. All rooms open to courtyard and we liked that because if feels safer than long hallways - the older kids (we had two 9 year olds and two 12 year olds) could roam, go to the gift shop, ride the glass elevator, get snacks, etc. Free breakfast was yummy and saved us $$$ every morning for 8 people. Evening cocktail receiption/snacks reception was very nice too. Only drawback would be that the Metro is 4 blocks away so we hardly ever rode it - too far to walk in not-so-nice weather with exhausted kids- but the taxis run on a zone system so most rides to the major sites (the National Mall area, the Smithsonian, etc.) were only $11 or $14 for four of us each way. But even on our most active day it was only about $25 pp/day but we were saving so much money by having one room at the hotel instead of two and by not buying breakfast or drinks later... and taxis are everywhere in D.C. Staff helpful and nice. Remember to tip the ladies that pour the free drinks - they'll appreciate you!We ate at Nicola's (the private restaurant on-site) with the kids. It was very good and the service was excellent but it was pricey so be prepared. Also, if you like a nice glass of wine and the large no-name bottle at the free bar just isn't doing it for you, you can go into Nicola's and they have some nice wines by the glass. We will definitely look for Embassy Suites hotels on future trips.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great value for the money We stayed here in June for a long weekend to do some sight-seeing with our family of six (age range of kids - 8 to 20). All in all, an excellent experience for the price paid, especially if traveling with kids. This was a typical Embassy Suites in terms of service (i.e., adequate, not excellent), but for the price, I think it was what I expected. The suite was very clean and nicely decorated, with plenty of room for all of us. The breakfast each morning was very good, with lots of selection. The hotel was very crowded, and the staff did a good job keeping things stocked and clearing tables. We never had to wait for a table. We attended the cocktail hour once, which was nice. We also went to the Italian restaurant once for dinner (Saturday night -- -we had not made reservations anywhere becuase we tried to go to ESPN Zone, but the wait for that was over 2 hours, so we decided to try the hotel restaurant). It was a bit over-priced, but the staff was friendly and everyone enjoyed the food. Not the best meal to be found in DC, but if you find yourself without a reservation, I would definately suggest trying it. As I said above, the hotel was very crowded, but I did not notice any noise once we were in our suite. The location is great -- a short walk to two different Metro lines, which gave us flexibility. Walking distance to Dupont Circle, where we ate a few meals and did some shopping. Really, the only negative that I can think of is that every morning the maid opened the door without knocking (the chain was always on, so she never came all the way in, but it was a disturbing way to be woken every morning!). Over all, a great stay for a great price if you are not expecting anything too fancy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very Nice Property We stayed at the Embassy Suites near Georgetown from Dec. 25-20, 2007. I must disclose upfront we are Hilton Honors Gold members and received an upgraded room. And what a room. It had a dining room and living room and bedroom, two flat screen tvs and was well-appointed. It was probably the nicest upgrade we've received so far as Gold Members, although the Disneyworld Hilton was pretty great, too. We had two teeanage daughters and one slept on the pullout sofa and the other, for some unknown reason, slept on two lounge chair pushed together with extra bedding. At least they weren't kicking each other all night. The nightly refreshment hour varied, but the drink offerings were always good. They had two kinds of slushies that alcohol can be added to, if you want. They also had all kinds of sodas and a full bar with decent brands of beer  wine. The snacks ranged from veggies, dip, chips, and pretzels to (one night) just chips and canned salsa. The breakfast was a standard (i.e. good) Embassy Suites offering with pancakes, bacon, eggs, and all kinds of pastries and cereals. The juices were the watery, dispensed kind and not good. Management greeted folks at breakfast.The restaurant was Italian and the food (the pastas tasted fresh made) was good but service was inexperienced. Turnover must be problem here. The pool and hot tub area was clean and warm -- nice during winter. Plenty of towels restocked.The location was a bit of a walk if you weren't cabbing it. We generally took a cab out in the morning to see the sights and took the Metro back home in the evening. We mostly exited at Dupont Circle and walked (downhill!) to our hotel. The area is residential and felt very safe for our family.Overall, I would very much stay here again. The property is on the high end of the Embassy Suites experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good hotel and location My husband, 14-yr-old son and I stayed here for 6 nights at the end of July. We took a cab to/from the hotel (~$17 ea way). It is within walking distance of the metro, but if you have luggage I would recommend a cab instead (you never know when the escalators may not be operating plus it's just a hassle to try to drag luggage around on a metro). We had a suite (dining room, living room w/ flat screen and pull out queen bed, and separate bedroom w/ king bed and tv), so there was plenty of space and the refrigerator and microwave were useful for leftovers. The room was clean and spacious, and housekeeping did a good job every day.The breakfasts are pretty good -- you can make your own waffles, or stand in line for made-to-order eggs, and they have everything else buffet-style - scrambled eggs, pancakes, sausage, biscuits and gravy, hash browns, cold cereal, juice, coffee, muffins/danishes, yogurt, etc. You do need to get there early enough so they don't run out of something you might want (such as fruit). They are also very busy unless you get there early.We did not go to any of the manager's cocktail parties, or use the pool or fitness rooms as we ended up either returning late in the evening, or, on the few days we got back early, we were too tired from the walking and heat to do anything but relax in our suite.We also had 1 dinner at the hotel's Italian restaurant. We found it to be pretty good, better quality than we had expected for a hotel restaurant. Price-wise, it was about what you would expect from a hotel restaurant. (For fun restaurant, we really enjoyed the Capitol Grille on Pennsylvania Ave....it was expensive, but it was a really neat atmosphere. )I would recommend this hotel for a family or business trip. (The reason I rated it 4 stars rather than 5 is I thought their rates were a bit expensive)</p></li>
