The Pantheon was in our backyard and we walked to the Vatican and the Coloseum. Rome is beautiful. Santa Chiara has a nice breakfast. The beds are hard, just like everywhere else in Italy, but the staff was extremely helpful. Would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed at the Santa Chiara twice, in May 1999 and May 2004. In planning my current vacation, it's the first place I am checking in Rome. It is centrally located, behind the Pantheon and has the benefit of offering single rooms. Also, they offered a substantial breakfast buffet in '99 and '04 and I hope that they are still offering it included in the price. I would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Albergo Santa Chiara is in a wonderful location in Rome. It is walking distance to major sites -- only steps away from the Pantheon. It is 5 minutes from Piazza Navona and many restaurants. The hotel is clean, nice size rooms, well priced. It has a nice lobby to sit and have a glass of wine at the end of a long day. Breakfast, which is included, is very nice. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location couldn't be better - behind Pantheon but on a quiet street. There is a new section and an older one which was somewhat under renovation when I was there in Feb. All is clean and neat however. Family owned, so the staff is attentive. The breakfast IS a bit ordinary - canned fruit cocktail, weak coffee, but the value, attractive lobby, and steps from the action make it a good choice.</p></li>

Yes the location is good but as you walk the streets you'll find many more nice hotes in the same area. Having spent nights in Lecce and Sorrento before coming to Rome we found the breakfast to be only fair. Fredrica is helpful but the desk clerks were far from friendly and I'm sure they do not like Americans.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is our second stay at Santa Chiara. In the interim, we've stayed at others. I think S.C. is the best hotel we've found in Rome for location, service, breakfast, and rooms. We got a very good price through their website for our new, large room in the newly renovated area. Lovely, but also enjoyed the large older room we'd stayed in previously. Comfortable, king beds. We will return on our next visit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">3 star hotels in Europe can be anything from great to horrible. This one is a good bet if you find the price acceptable. The rooms are clean and pleasant. The location is excellent: not only it is very central, it is quiet! The people working in reception are ok. Here is how I see it: they do not own the place and there is lack of leadership/ example of what good customer service means. In any case, it was not an issue for us as we are very independent travelers.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location of this hotel really could not be better. The hotel itself is well decorated, well managed, comfortable and clean. The staff are helpful. It all comes together to make a memorable stay. The only quibble is that the bedroom walls were a bit spartan. A picture or two would not have gone amiss. However that is not worth bothering about given the rest of the décor and furnishings and when the Pantheon, the Corso and excellent restaurants are all within a stone’s throw.</p></li>

The breakfast room is big, the lobby has a small bar area, an outdoor patio, large sitting area with windows to watch for taxi, and a library/ siting area with good tour books. The staff cool, but helpful. Directly behind the hotel is the Pantheon and plenty of shops. The location is safe and perfect for walking to all the famous fountains and squares.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We are in our mid-sixties. We were given a room on the 4th floor with no tub and only a shower. The elevator was broken for 3 of the 4 days we were at the hotel, requiring us to go up and down stairs several times a day as we came and went from our hotel into the city. Since we were paying $315.00 per night for a standard double, we didn't think this hotel was worth the cost. There is another side to the hotel where we were told the rooms are better, but this is what they gave us "senior citizens."</p></li>

It is also an oasis when central Rome gets hot and noisy: small, cool, and quiet. While not cheap, the hotel provides value in its location, free breakfast, wi fi, and large, clean, and attractive room with huge bathroom and comfortable amenties (at least in the newer wing where we were).

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location was perfect for great restaurants and shopping in little boutiques. It was walking distance to many major tourist attractions, yet is on a quiet side street just behind the Pantheon. We loved this nontraditional hotel -- it had the comforts and conveniences we wanted as American business travelers, with clean, modern decor and amenities. Small and comfortable. The breakfast was outstanding. The front desk help spoke perfect English and were extremely helpful. I think it is a bit pricey, but we did not mind since it had everything you could want without alot of fuss.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family of five recently stayed at the Albergo Santa Chiara which we chose for it's location. The room was fine, but the shower was so small - approximately 2' x 2', that when I dropped the soap, I had to squat to pick it up, because I could not bend over. The staff never greeted us when we entered the hotel and with the exception of one young man behind the desk and the bellman, no one was especially friendly. The breakfast was mediocre. If you can find a hotel for the same price with a good location, stay there. It's nice to see a smiling face when you return from walking all day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just returned from a weekend in Rome. I was booked at this hotel by a third party as I was on business, What are the pluses- a fabulous location- literally a block from the Pantheon. It is on a very quiet street- hence NO noise. My room had a balcony with a small table to sit outside. The room was small with a single bed but very clean. I had a shower but no bath. The staff was proficient but nothing beyond. Would I return? Absolutely!! I love beeing in an area that is so close to everything. I can over look a slightly dated decor and size given the location. The AC was a real plus given the temperature 95F.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed end of August, and enjoyed the hotel. Staff was accomendating, lobby was very nice and well kept, and complimentary breakfast was nice. As for the room, it was a little 1970's, but the bathroom was redone recently, so it was very nice and clean. The A/C was brilliant, seeing it was very hot out, and was essential for daily breaks. They seem to be doing alot of rennovations while we were there, so I'm assuming they are working on updating the rooms. I'd stay here again, mainly because the location was absolutely amazing (right behind the patheon), and the hotel was nice and very clean. We stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 4 nights from late May to early June and were very pleased with our double and triple rooms. Rooms were clean, bright, comfortable and very quiet. Breakfast did not include a hot meal, but was more than adequate. Front desk was was not overly friendly, but helpful when making dining reservations. Francesca, who booked our rooms, was probably the friendliest and most helpful of all. Location was a few minutes from Pantheon, yet in a secluded area so it was quiet. We walked from the hotel to the train station, Colosseum, Trastevere, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain and St. Peters. Rome is a very walkable city.</p></li>

Our room was a good size with a reasonable sized bathroom. The room staff all greeted you in the corridors with a nice smile. The breakfast was plentiful - the coffee was from a machine but expressos and cappucinos were available on request. The croissants were excellent. The hotel is within easy walking distance of a large number of historical sites and churches. Santa Maria Sopra Minerva across the square should not be missed. There are plentiful restaurants and pizzarias close by.</p></li>

We walked nearly everywhere from here! Interesting room with vaulted and beamed ceiling. Our room for 4 was a 2-room suite with a curtain between us. Very small shower. Front staff was very helpful advising us how to catch bus to the train station, providing tickets. Also best tip of the trip: change money at the post office!! By FAR the best rate in the country with very low (2.58euro) commission no matter how much you change! Wifi very good; had to pay but it works very well. Nice breakfast in the am.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our room was absolutely fabulous for our family of 5. We had one of their apartments located on the 4th floor that was quite large. The room had two levels, a state of the art bathroom , sitting area, walk in closet, and a large terrace to sit outside. It is a bit of a maize to get to the room but well worth it. Clean crisp sheets we loved on beds that were a bit hard. The room seemed completely sound proof of any noise. Even with our window open it was very quiet. Breakfast was fabulous with a wide variety of choices. Location, location, location....walk to everything. The Pantheon is literally right behind the hotel. Santa Chiara is a gem.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The nearby Pantheon and the piazza just in front of it is worth seeing -- an ancient temple embedded in a still-vibrant & bustling neighborhood, charming lanes with great little shops, a couple of Michelin one-star restaurants, & fabulous architecture. Just don't assume that you'll get a room with a window. And if you have to engage the front-desk staff for any reason, good luck. It is their place, I reminded myself, because the sense of hospitality is just not there. For example, after I paid the bill, they simply turned away without saying anything. From the Piazza Santa Chiara, the Minerva Hotel certainly seems like a more appealing place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent location (can't think of a better one), within walking distance of all the major sights in Rome. The hotel was clean and well managed, Federica (concierge) was extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was better than all other hotels in Italy as it actually had some salty options (hard boiled eggs, cheese, etc.) in addition to croissants, pastries, etc. There is a renovated wing to the hotel where the rooms have hardwood floors and are more modern, although smaller. Bathrooms in both wings were new and very clean. Wifi service spotty at times and may not work in some rooms. In all we were very pleased and would definitely stay again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We reserved a quad room, which had two twin beds in one room, a double bed in the other and a marble bathroom in between. The AC worked wonderfully well, it was cool, quiet (for the most part) and the breakfast was wonderful - Loved the apricot filled croissants and the easy cappuccino machine! The best was the location - everything was so easy to get to from here. There was even a tiny bus which stopped right outside to zip us up to the Borgese Gardens. So easy to walk around Rome from here. A little pricey, but worth it. The front desk was so pleasant - they so kindly arranged for our reservations at the Borgese Gallery, and for the taxi back to the airport all without a hitch.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything about Albergo Santa Chiara exceeded my expectations. My room was spotlessly clean, shiny with new amenities. It had a balcony with 2 chairs, unexpected for a single room. The staff went out of their way to give detailed directions for taking public buses in Rome and to help in other ways. The location was perfect, 1 block from the Pantheon and adjacent to the Piazza Minerva with the delightful statue of the baby elephant holding a small obelisk. The location allowed me to explore the charmingm old streets in this area and enjoy tartufo etc at the Piazza Navona. A nearby restaurant that I especially enjoyed was Maccherone -- excellent rigitone with bacon and delicious grilled steak.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was our second time in Rome and we wanted a hotel closer to Piazza Navona this time since that was one of our favorite Piazza's. This time we went with our "travel friends" who were visiting Rome/Europe for the first time. They loved this hotel as well, we spent evenings at a wine bar on the Pantheon square and loved how close the hotel was to this area. Staff was helpful with restaurant suggestions. I'm a shopper and there were multiple boutiques near the hotel also. We loved the breakfast. especially the warm Nutella croissants! We would drink wine in the comfortable lobby before going to dinner, relaxing after a day of sightseeing. We all agreed next time we are in Rome we will stay here again!</p></li>

The staff are exceptional (a special mention to Frederica and the young gentleman at the front counter in the evening) and went beyond my expectations on any request, big or small, we had. It is in a great location (our kids are 6 and 8) and we walked everywhere except the train station. The bus stop is around the corner if you need it. Our rooms were spacious, very clean and the linen was of a very high quality. The breakfast was adequate and kept you going until lunch time - what more do you really need?? In summary, next time we visit Rome we will stay at the Santa Chiara.</p></li>

Our AC didnt work when we checked in but the staff made it a priority and fixed it rather quickly. Location was excellent. The Panthenon was a block away, Also Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain a walking distance away. Good restaurants are nearby as was the Piazza Venezia. The staff: Sergio, Luigi, Maurizo, Pirro and others were fantastic, Especially super was Federica who helped us get cabs, assisted us generously with her time. Other staff were excellent, too.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of five just had an excellent experience staying at the Albergo Santa Chiara. The location is truly unbeatable. The Piazza della Rotonda is particularly beautiful at night, and we enjoyed strolling out for dinner and gelato in the evenings. Our quadruple room with an extra bed was a perfect option for a family. Although they called it a quadruple, it was really more like a suite, with separate nooks for the beds so we didn't feel as though we were tripping over each other in one room. Everything was impeccably clean, and the lobby is lovely and gracious. My only complaint is that they failed to give us a requested wakeup call on the morning of our departure, which could have made us miss our flight. Fortunately I woke up on my own!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Two friends and I stayed at this hotel for three nights. We had a triple room which was clean, modern, comfortable and quiet. The beds were much more comfortable than beds we had experienced in other parts of Italy. The bathroom had a large tub/shower combination. Our room overlooked the terrace area and it was so quiet! The air conditioning worked perfectly. We never experienced crowding in the breakfast buffet area. We found the selection of pastries, cereals, juices and fruits as well as eggs, ham, cheese to be more than adequate. The location, a half block from the Pantheon, is centrally located for many sites in Rome. We felt safe walking in the area quite late at night. The hotel staff was very professional and polite. I would definitely stay in this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was great ! It has a fantastic location the rooms are very clean. The Pantheon is just round the block. The Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Piazza Navona, collaseum are all within walking distance. The Vatican is a bus ride away. The only thing i would say is that the rooms are not very well decorated and the rooms are a bit dark. However the matresses are clean and the bathroom was very nice. I stayed in a single room with a queen bed and if you want to save on a bit of cash and your a couple this would be more than comfortable (room 10). Access from Ciampino is easy the Terravision bus take you to Termini and from Termini you can get the number 60 bus to Argentina. ... The hotel is central to everything would definitely recommend you stay there! Suheda (London)</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at Albergo Santa Chiara on my third trip to Rome. I will stay there time and time again. Albergo Santa Chiara far exceeded my expectations. Our renovated room was clean, stylish, and had everything we could possibly need to make our trip to Rome enjoyable. The location was one of the things that made the hotel so perfect! It is directly behind the pantheon. Previous reviews made me wonder if we would have problems finding the hotel, but upon arrival in Rome I showed a taxi the address and the hotel name and he knew just where to go. We felt extremely safe walking to the hotel each night. Police are stationed right near the hotel on watch. The hotel staff assisted us in every need. The best restaurant we ate at in Italy was recommended by the staff at Albergo Santa Chiara.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved staying at the Albergo Santa Chiara. My husband and I stayed for 10 days. Our room was big, king bed and a full bathtub. Federicka was so very helpful, as was the other hotel staff. We did keep our room window open at night, there was some noise, but nothing a little wine could not reslove. It was a perfect location. Walked to almost everything. Took a taxi to the Vatican, Museums and Catacombs. It was steps to the Pantheon and we ate at the best place!! La Sagrestia This family owed pizzeria was upscale, good prices and the best food we found in Rome. Only steps from the hotel. Via del Serminario (road) Next to the Pantheon. We went to other pizzeria's, but nothing came close to this place. The pizza, mussels, chicken and service was perfect....................you must go!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I read some good reviews for this hotel. I only read 2 bad ones. I have to wonder if the good ones were staying at the same hotel as we did last week. The staff is very rude. We were in a tiny room for 250e. We complained until they finally gave us a nice room. The location is good, but don't expect any help from the staff whatsoever. I asked for hot water for tea one night and they acted like I had said you could you bring my car to the hotel door. There is a sign in the breakfast room to not take anything like coffee to the rooms. The room was very dimly lit. There isn't a lamp on the desk so impossible to read in the room. My advice is if you go there, take anything and everything you might need because they complain if they have to do anything extra. I would never stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got back and the hotel was everything we expected. Convenient to everything in the tourist zone was the main reason for staying but we also wanted the ambiance of a amily run quality hotel. Breakfast was ok but not exceptional. Room had crisp ironed linens and the bed was just a tad hard. Staff helped us on a couple of tours and car service. Staff was efficient but not overly friendly. They did their job and helped us as needed. Last year we stayed at the Hilton by the airport and had the hassle of riding the hotel shuttle to the tourist zone. This was much easier and I'll do it again. I did think we were quoted 250 a night in dollars and when we checked out that was in Euro's so it ran 400 dollars extra but I put that off to my own stupidity. Just be sure you check for yourself.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The best thing about this hotel was the location, just in back of the Pantheon, in a quaint neighborhood full of enticing restaurants and gelaterias. It was easy walking distance to most of the major attractions in Rome, including the Vatican, Colosseum/Forum, Spanish steps & Trevi fountain areas, as well as Piazza Navona and Campo de Fiori. The room itself was small but clean and modern. I had followed advice from other reviewers and asked for a renovated room. Our room was facing Minerva square and there was a bit of noise from down below our room but not bad. I have learned to always travel with earplugs and so it wasn't a problem. If you'd prefer a quiet room I'd suggest that you request it when making a reservation. Very good and plentiful breakfast buffet. English speaking and helpful staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel is in a great location, had very nice corner room with beatiful windows to the Piazza. Breakfast is very good indeed, much better than going to a cafe so be sure to book it. Staff is typically Roman - very upnose (especially to Americans - we Europeans are treated a little better ;-) ). Actually asked for rate directly in the hotel and got 130€ after some bargaining (220€ at start) - of course we were lucky because the hotel was not full. Nothing more to say - great choice. Oh by the way - exploring Rome by bike was "our" good idea. Beware the Bikes at the internet cafe round the corner though, you will break your kneck. It is fun, you quickly get to all sight seeing locations and it is fun. Don't worry about the traffic - Romans drive like hell but they respect bikers (at least some of them).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Albergo Santa Chiara is situated on a quiet street in an absolutely perfect location for walking to most of the major historical sites in Rome. It is on a quiet piazza that boarders the beautiful Santa Maria Sopra Minerva gothic church. It is also a couple of hundred yards from the Pantheon. The very capable concierge, Frederica, was key to our memorable Christmas and New Years stay in Rome. She worked with us before, during, & after our stay to secure reasonable airport transfers, as well as, unique event, tour and dinner reservations. Attention to detail and quality are prioritizes as she continued to inquire about our satisfaction with her recommendations. The reception and breakfast staff provided warm and efficient service as well. We will definitely return to this gem on our next visit to Rome!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was clean, comfortable and had great AirConditioning...which is very important for Rome in August! We had received some sage advice to stay near the Pantheon, even if it cost a little more, because you would save so much on taxis and by walking. We were right in the heart of everything, as this hotel backs up to the pantheon. Awesome restaurants, gelato, espresso...everything you could ask for was just outside the door. The staff was hugely helpful getting us taxis, dinner reservations, a car to the airport....no hidden fees etc. Because of the heat...you want a place where you can come back frequently during the day. We are a family of 5 that got a double and a triple next door to each other. The triple was huge and had it's own outdoor patio. My only (very minor) issue was that the coffee wasn't hot enough :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nothing fancy but good value in an excellent location near Pantheon. Walking distance to most attractions - Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain, Coloseum, Piazza Navona. The concierge is excellent - her name is Frederica and she speaks superb English - lots of great advice and suggestions. The front desk staff was a bit stiff but otherwise fine - I think they just didn't speak English very well so if you can say a few words in Italian, they loosen up! You must leave your key at the front desk every time you leave the hotel - it is very heavy so you won't want to carry it with you. Near bus stops and check out the hidden church behind the hotel Santa Maria Minerva, it has a very plain exterior, doesn't look like a church but it is beautiful inside. We used a company called Viator.com for all our walking tours - they were excellent.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was an accident stay. I forgot to book an extra night at the hotel we were originally staying in, so we had to find something quick for the night and was recommended to go here. This hotel is beautiful! It is in a great location right behind the Pantheon. The concierge was very accommodating and helped us get situated right away, after a long train ride from Venice to Rome. The hotel room was beautiful, quiet and modern. The beds were very comfortable and the bathrooms were nice and spacious. Breakfast was filled with variety and delicious. We wanted to see if we could stay the remainder of our Rome trip here, but they didn't have another room for us to stay for the next 4 nights, so we ended up going to the hotel we were originally supposed to stay in. If we could've stayed at Albergo Santa Chiara, we definitely would've!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Honestly we couldn't have imagined of a better location to stay in Rome. Via Vittorio Emmanuelle, Via Del Corso, Parliament, Vatican City, Trastevere, Colleseum, Palantine, all walkable. You step out, turn left and you're at the Temple of Minerva where Gallileo was forced to say the world was flat in the 17th century, another 1 minute you're at the 2000-year old Pantheon, which was the inspiration for St.Peter's cathedral. Went for a nice dinner at Hotel Minerva (try their Mojito) and found lots of other restaurants in the area. The famous Gelateria Giolitti is also not too far away. In terms of the hotel, we just needed a place to crash. Bathroom amenities are basic, room is clean, in-room safe, pay-for-wi-fi only available in lobby, breakfast was surprisingly ok. A "locally-run" hotel with a location that truly made our trip to Rome special.</p></li>

I found the staff to be responsive and extremely efficient. The breakfast buffet is lovely. The location of the hotel is superb and considering the central location, it is remarkably quiet. I was in a single room on the front with a small terrace. The room was small but bright and very clean - everything I could ask for. The glass door onto the balcony was the room's only source of ventilation and it got a lot of afternoon sun and it quite warm even in October. There is a thermostat and although it activated a fan, it did not seem to put out any cool air. I did not find it enough of a problem to register a complaint but NEXT time I will ask for a room on the other side. I do recommend this hotel. I loved my trip to Rome.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Choosing a place to stay in Rome is always problematic for us because we often end up spending a fortune and getting a miniscule room. This time around, we got a very good corporate rate so we didn't mind the fact that our room was very small even though it was one of the larger rooms on the property. (I think they called it a suite or a deluxe or somesuch). We consoled ourself with the brilliant location and the extremely helpful concierge (Federica) who came up with a number of excellent sightseeing suggestions including a nearby Palazzo which is open only on Saturdays and was not crowded. Otherwise nothing important to say: there is a little outdoor seating area where people sit and smoke. The breakfast room is windowless and crowded. There are a couple of notable places to eat nearby: Armando's which has excellent home cooking and the famous San Esutachio cafe.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Did a lot of research before finally chosing the Santa Chiara and I feel I definitely made the right choice. It seems that hotels are expensive in Rome but Santa Chiara offers a lot for a reasonable price. Of course the location is best. RIght in the middle of everything. But what with all the narrow winding streets it is hard to get your bearings. It is very close to the Pantheon but it took us 2 days to find that out because we happened to go right out from the entrance instead of going left! It is situated in a relatively quiet area within walking distance of just about everything. The air conditioning is also extremely quiet, rooms very clean and breakfast above average for Italy.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Albergo Santa Chiara combines everything you'd want in a hotel in Rome. Its central location near the Pantheon allows you to easily walk in any direction - north to the Spanish Steps and the Via Veneto, east to the Trevi Fountain, west to Piazza Navona and the Vatican, and south to the ancient city. It's a 1 minute walk from one of the most charming piazzas, the Piazza della Rotunda near the Pantheon. The hotel has remodeled one side of the hotel into crisp, modern decor, but even if you're stuck in an old room, the location makes it worth it. A great breakfast with a wide selection (including special coffees made to order) is included, and if you're there in warm weather, there is a private small patio off the side where you can sit and have a drink. I brought a group of friends, all with special needs and changing schedules and the hotel was wonderfully accommodating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was in the best location for a Rome Experience, but that is it. The service as horrible, the front desk personnel were not nice at all. Italians need to learn from the Americans about service quality. No one smiled, nor was anyone willing to help. The manager was rude. It had nothing to do with the language barrier. The personnel spoke English. They just did not want to be of service to anyone. We were treated as second class citizens. Our air conditioned did not work in the room. They took 24 hours to even look into it. Then they said we could move to another room that was the size of a closet. We had to move everything right then or we would lose getting that room. So we had to delay our tour with our friends to do this. Would not let us stay in the air conditioned room for the night and then move our things in the am. They acted as if it was our fault the a/c did not work.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">So many hotel choices in Rome and so expensive. Where to start? Rick Steve's Guidebook suggested several hotels which Trip Advisor helped us narrow to the Santa Chiara. Great choice! It's location could not be better. The Pantheon is 100 yards away. Piazza Navona 500 yards. We walked to all the major sights easily from the hotel and a cab ride to the Vatican is short (10 Euros) too. Staff is friendly and don't miss asking the concierge about restaurant suggestions. We had a great meal at Armando's. Room was surprisingly roomy with a queen size bed and adequate wardrobe space. Bathroom of decent size with a tiny shower. Very clean with good linens. Breakfast buffet is included which had both hot and cold choices. One last thing: the hotel will provide a private car upon request to pick you up or take you to the airport (50 Euros). Since there was a taxi strike the day of our departure this saved the day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have been to Italy over thirty times.

You are within walking distance of the Coloseo, Piazza Navona, its right around the corner from the Pantheon, 20 minute walk to Piazza di Spagna and along the way, you can stop at Trevi Fountain. Its only an eight to 10 euro ride to the Vatican. Campo de Fiore is a short walk away, as is Trastevere and all of the good places. All of the routes along the way to these attractions are well policed and extremely safe. There are plenty of restaurants along all of the routes. The hotel itself is a charming place, clean, and has a fantastic breakfast. Rooms are immaculate, and the front desk is very helpful. It is a family run hotel, and someone from the family is always there. I recommend it highly. Alberto</p></li>

After reading about it on several different websites, I booked this hotel for my husband and I and our son who is in the Army. 3 adults in one room, and we had plenty of room! There were 3 large closets, 3 tables, a desk, mini bar, etc. The bathroom appeared to be all marble and it was beautiful. It had the best shower of any hotel I have ever been in. We arrived at 9:30 am and our room was ready 45 minutes later. The lobby was large and had several chairs and tables. Everything was very clean and the staff was very professional. The breakfast buffet was great. The only thing missing was bacon and eggs, but you won't find that in Italy. The elevator is very small, but you can always use the nice stairway. We had a swift check-out and they had a cab waiting for us by the time we were done to get us to the train station. The location was great and I would stay here over and over again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As others have written, this little gem of a hotel is literally around the corner from the Pantheon. If you've got the energy and enthusiasm you can do a nice walk from the hotel to the Spanish Steps and nearby sophisticated shopping or to siteseeing at the Roman Forum and the Colesseum. Whatever way you wander you will surely travel exciting lanes and avenues - the city is truly 'at your doorstep' from Albergo Santa Chiara. Americans will find the rooms somewhat small (and some of the showers very small!) but everything is shiny clean and there is a nice security to the place. The desk clerks may seem a bit cold only because they have to listen to and process our English, but we found all of the staff to be genuinely helpful and kind. As others have mentioned, a breakfast buffet is included and the price is fair for the area. We stayed three nights and returned after a cruise to stay one more.

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Albergo Santa Chiara is a good hotel in a great location. It is literally around the corner from the Pantheon and only a few minutes from Piazza Navona and other great locations such as the Trevi Fountain. The hotel is clean and rooms are OK. The breakfast room is large and the food was very good. Overall this is a good selection. My only complaint is the front desk staff. They completely ignored us when we arrived and at several occasions when I needed assistance, they appeared to be annoyed with my inquiries. Overall not friendly or helpful. There was one lady working at desk over to the side that seemed to be freindly and attentive although it did not appear that this was her main role - she was just stepping in to be helpful. Overall, you probably would not be dissapointed if you stay here, the overall experience would be far better with a friendly and helpful staff in the lobby. If we return to Rome, we will take our chances and try a different hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location of this hotel cannot be beat! We had a suite with a lovely balcony! The furnishings in the room could stand to be updated a bit, but we found the accommodations very nice anyway. We stayed on the top floor, so there is slanted ceiling in the bathroom, which has a very narrow tub with a shower head but no curtain. Showering was interesting... I am not tall 5'4"... and had to bend over to use the shower. The staff that we encountered did not wish to be helpful at all. We were told one morning (we asked for a cab to be called to get to the Vatican) that no taxi's were available! After stepping outside for a moment (to discuss the rude attitude of the front desk) my mother went back in and demanded that a taxi be called...2 minutes later a cab arrived! I still cannot figure out what the problem was... we had tipped and been polite! In general, the location was worth the price of the room, we also took full advantage of our balcony both in the morning and evenings! The breakfast was very well appointed as well!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location is wonderful. It just behind the Pantheon next to the Piazza Santa Minerva. The hotel is simple, clean, very pretty....excellent staff. For a three star hotel, this hotel is outstanding. I had a room on the 4th floor. It was simple, clean, comfortable, excellent bed, spacious, had a nice television (flat screen), great bathroom with a shower (no bath biut a nice shower). Bathroom was spacious with a nice sink space and many toiletries. I was quite pleased. The room also had air conditioning and it worked quite well. The buffett breakfast was delightful....meats, cheeses, cereal, fruit, breads....something for everyone inlcuding americans...very nice. On my last day I left quite early and they arranged for coffee for me as the breakfast room was not open yet. This was nice. Staff also suggested that I hire a car instead of a cab to airport...this was much appreciated....very efficient and no extra charges for bags. About the same cost as a cab and a direct route....would suggest this. This hotel takes care of you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our first trip to Rome for our 25th wedding anniversary trip and the hotel was a fantastic first introduction to Rome. The staff was very helpful before and during our stay. They happily arranged for a driver to pick us up from the hotel and delivery us safely to the front door of the hotel in the area of the Pantheon. They arranged reservations for us all three nights and also gave us excleeent walking directions. The hotel room was very nice with a big bathroom and a balcony over looking Minervia square. It was very hot in Rome the days we were there and the room was very cool and we had complete control over the AC. The hotel had an outside "garden" area for relaxing with a great bottle of wine. The bar staff was very attentive with snacks offered with the wine. Everyone spoke excellent english and was very professional. I loved Rome and this hotel. We would definitely stay here again. The location was perfect and i cannot honestly think of anything they need to change. Love it. Also, the breakfast was very ample and good.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Albergo Santa Chiara Hotel for 2 days at the end of June 2011 and for 3 days in the beginning of July 2011. This hotel has a very good location. The Pantheon is around the corner and we could walk to every site. The hotel is very clean. The rooms are a good size, clean , non- smoking and a big bathroom. We stayed in both the new and old portions of the hotel. The new section has a shower stall no tub. The older portion of the hotel had a tub/shower combo. The staff is friendly and is there to help if needed for reservations or travel. Breakfast was included in our price for two people at 250euros. The hotel is quiet for being in the center of Rome. This hotel is very popular and you need to make reservations far in advance if you want to stay there. I would highly recommend this hotel. We have been to Rome 4 times. Go on their web site at www.albergosantachiara.com. The street address is on Santa Chiara so be careful to find the right hotel because there are numerous hotels with the name of S. Chiara or Santa Chiara in that area.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just been in Rome for the 4th time during the latest 3 years. We have stayed at 4 different hotels. Albergo Santa Chiara is absolutely the very best and will be our preferred hotel in Rome. Location is perfect - in the very middle of the historic heart of Rome. Within walking distance to all major attractions. The rooms are spacious,and so is the bathroom. Everything is very, very clean - no dirty carpets on the floor (wooden floor), no dirty bedspread. The breakfast buffet is the best we have tried in Rome - lots of choices, eggs, bread, ham, sauges, different kinds of cheese, yoghurt, cerials, marmalade, juice, water, coffee, tea, fresh fruits, etc. It's only in the morning - at breakfast - you realize how many other guests there are in the hotel, during the evenings and nights the hotel is very quiet. You do not hear your neighbours through the walls. The staff is very helpful and service minded. Only thing we missed was the possibility to make a cup of coffee or tea in the room. The price for one night is above average for a 3 star hotel. We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Best landing place after arrival in Rome, charming and best continental breakfast.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There is lots to like at this property. Though it does not have it's own restaurant, you are served snacks with your cocktails on the lovely patio, just adjacent from the charming lobby. There are many restaurants within walking distance and the concierge-like service will be a big plus for you. The desk attendants are very nice and speak English as well as Italian and other languages. Very impressive front desk. Rooms had such lovely Italian linens. The bed is hard, as was my bed in other properties I have stayed in tn other parts of Italy. However, the little touches like the shutters opening onto a courtyard and a fancy ice bucket when we requested ice, make this place feel more 5 star than 4. It is luxourious while being small enough that you are able to stop for a chat with the staff. The double room felt roomy, especially for Europe. The bathroom had my favourite bidet, and the bathroom was roomy as well. The location could not have been better, especially if you are a walker- each direction there is something to see. The breakfast was the absolutely best continental ever. I had toasted croque madams (toasted cheese, with the ham) each morning and there was so much more. Enjoy this property.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wanted to do a Mother, daughter and Grandaughter special trip to Rome for my birthday. Against all odds we flew out of New Jersey after a big snow storm only to arrive in Rome and find they were having their first snow in years as well. We pre- arranged for a triple and double room in new section of this hotel. We were pleasently surprised the hotel is very attractive and spotlessly clean. Some of the staff, while being very efficent were not overly friendly others were . Federica a gal not at front desk made up for them. she was great. You cant ask for a better location. The Wi Fi (with a charge) did not work very well in our rooms. Breckfast was good. What we did not like: When trying to obtain info. for our return trip to airport We were given conflicting answers one was they did not recc. a cab for they start out at a fixed price and then have add ons and were not good if you left anything in them.. They kept reccommending a private service they highly rated . But we were given 3 different prices from 45 -55 Euros.. from the different personel we asked. (had a feeling commissions were a factor here) We were only 3 returning to airport. We contracted our own cab, paid the fixed 40 Euro and it was fine.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for three nights with our two adult sons in a quad room. While the location was great and the quad room we stayed in was very spacious and updated, I agree with other reviewers that the staff is arrogant. The one bright spot was Frederica who was very helpful with general questions. Internet is expensive and they wouldn't even look up the weather in London for us from their computer claiming they didn't have access but we could pay for it. Ridiculous for the type of hotel it is. We left the hotel on a bad note: We decided to use their car service to the airport thinking it would be better than a cab. Wrong. The first driver was upset at having to take us for the rate the hotel quoted us so even after leaving for the airport late and getting several blocks from the hotel, he turned around claiming car trouble, and sped us back to the hotel where we were transferred into a much smaller vehicle. This driver talked on his cell phone for the first part of the trip until a police officer caught him then he dropped us off at the first possible place at the airport which meant we had to walk quite a distance to reach our check-in counter. I have contacted the hotel about this but expect nothing. I would recommend with caution.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I love this place the very moment I stepped into the hotel lobby. The staff were friendly and inviting and I was able to check into our room when I was there at 11am (check-in time was 1pm). Location. This hotel is very centrally located at a quiet street, just a few streets behind the Pantheon. Everything was very easily accessible. Piazza Navona is like 5 min walk away. Rooms The rooms were very spacious by Europe standards, in fact one of the most spacious I've seen. As the hotel is located along a quiet street, sleep was peaceful and wonderful. All rooms were accessible via elevator. My room came with a personal electronic safe too. Plug points on the desk were very conveniently located. I've been to some hotels where the plug points are in some ridiculous locations making connecting power a pain but not for this hotel. Breakfast Breakfast was buffet-style and the portion and variety was generous. Internet My only small gripe was with the internet wifi. First of all, you have to pay for it - Euro 10 per day. And there is no connection on the fourth floor. Every time I need access to the internet, I have to bring my laptop to the lobby area. All in all, a very pleasant experience. Definitely a place I would recommend when you're in Rome.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I have stayed at the Santa Chiara 9 or 10 times since October, 2000. We always enjoy our stay, our spacious, quiet, and comfortable room, the helpful and efficient staff, and the excellent breakfasts (especially the capuccino con double espresso and the rosettas). When I read the last 10 reviews I found misstatements or traveller mistakes that required some response, hence this review. First, if a room is too dimly lit to read, ask for a lamp or another room. Second, if traffic noise is bothersome, switch to an inside room. Rome is noisy like all big cities, though less so around the Santa Chiara after traffic restrictions were imposed a few years ago. Third, the "70s decor" is continually updated. For ultramodern decor, try the new non-smoking wing. Third, the "haughty"staff and front desk where "no one ever smiled, greeted us, or even looked up". Though there are times when front-desk people are frantically busy, we have always received friendly responses to our "buon giorno" and "buona sera" . Other guests seeking a similarly friendly response might try the same greetings. Finally, this is a family operation whose care and foresight are clearly reflected in efficient service, continual refurbishing, and multi-year renovations. Experienced travelers should appreciate this, and note it in their reviews.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “nice hotel, great location”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family of 2 adults and 2 teenagers stayed at Albergo Santa Chiara for 3 nights the second week in June '08. We paid 290 euros, with the Rick Steve's discount, for a quad which is hard to find in Europe. We had read the good reviews in Rick Steve's book and on Trip Advisor. The location is great because you are about halfway between the Vatican and the Coliseum-about a 20 minute walk to those 2 sites as well as the Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps. Also, the Pantheon is right around the corner and Piazza Navona, a great square with restaurants, artists, and people watching is 5 minutes away. Our quad room was on the top floor which consisted of riding 2 elevators and 2 flights of stairs to get to the room but not too bad of a hike. The room had a double bed in one room and two singles in the other room. It was very clean and organized. Breakfast consisted of breads, yogurt, fruit, cheese, meats, cereal, juice, coffee, and the best chocolate croissants in Rome. The concierge was very cheerful and helpful. She did set up a taxi to the airport that was at the hotel on time for 50 euros. The front desk was helpful when asked but not the most smiley or cheerful bunch in Rome. I would probably stay at the Albergo Santa Chiara again but would also look for other hotels in the same general vicinity that are less expensive. The location is hard to beat.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent two nights at this hotel, in a perfectly adequate and clean single room, probably quite recently renovated. An 'internal' room, it was utterly quiet though had no view - in fact looked out onto a brick platform and wall covered with plastic leaves two feet away! This did not bother me in the least but what did was the lack of a working air-conditioning unit in Rome with 32 degrees celsius. I had purposely chosen this hotel for its location and the air-conditioning. There are others in the area I could have chosen. I complained each time (often) I passed reception and was repeatedly told that the technician was working on the problem. Both nights the temperature in my room was 26 degrees, whereas outside it was 18. I did not want to open the window for security reasons. Apart from this the hotel was wonderfully central and the staff, with a possible exception in the reception area, were polite and helpful, if not effusive. The crockery at breakfast had had a dishwasher problem and some of it was a bit gritty, but avoidable. Breakfast itself was quite satisfactory. There were many regular and obviously valued Italian guests. Downstairs in the public areas the air-con worked very well! If the management had made some gesture of goodwill when it came to producing my bill I would not be writing this. Of course they did not. Next time I may go elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of 5 spent December 19-23 here, and we loved it. We paid the Rick Steves rate of 260 Euro for a 2 bedroom suite, including all taxes and a delicious breakfast. Our suite looked like it had been remodeled recently. Everything looked new. All the beds were comfortable. The large bedroom had a twin and an American-size king bed! The other bedroom had 2 twin beds. The sheets were crisp and white and a dream to sleep on. Large bathroom, shower pressure was great, large white towels, toiletries provided, towel warmer, excellent housekeeping, with friendly and helpful front desk. Our suite also had a small alcove with an extra sink and mirror. This hotel is right behind the Pantheon, in fact, it takes about 30 seconds to walk to the entrance of the Pantheon. The hotel is surrounded by fantastic gelato shops and restaurants. We never had a problem getting a taxi, and everyplace that we did not walk to was a short, cheap taxi ride away. The breakfast buffet includes fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, eggs, juices, coffee, teas and a wide variety of fresh baked breads and croisants. The server also brought us fantastic cappuccino every morning. In fact, the cappuccino was so good, we have just ordered a cappuccino machine as I am going to try to duplicate the cappuccino we had at the Albergo Santa Chiaro Hotel. There is not one thing I would change about this hotel. I expect that this hotel will be near the top of TripAdvisor's hotel list very soon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Many on trip advisor will tell you the location was perfect, but near Termini or stuck on one edge of the centre really isn't. In the heart of Centro Storico really is the ONLY place to be. And the Albergo Santa Chiara is exactly that. We got off the bus from termini at Torre Argentina and walked up the beautiful cobbled narrow street to the hotel, stopping for a panini and it was simply perfectly placed in the Piazza Miverna, right behind the Pantheon. I have been to Rome before, so I have the benefit of knowing the best location to position myself. The hotel itself was a good 3 star, and as for the comments about moody reception staff, well we did not encounter that at all, we spooke to 4 different receptionists in our 3 day visit and all were all poilte and helpful. The breakfast is superb, I defy anybody not to find something they like, ask for the cappuccino its great. I stayed last time in the Caesar residence Romane, rated 4th in Rome. This is better. It is a good comfortbale 3 star hotel with a great breakfast in the romatic centre of the Centro Storic. If you want to stay indoors all day, other hotels will surpass. If you want a clean comfortable base with a great breakfast in the ivy clad heart of the centro storico in the absolutley BEST location in Rome. I promise you you will not beat this hotel. Spend 4 times as much on the Minerva next door and you will be dissapointed. Spend 1/4 of the Minerva on the Santa Chiara and you will be delighted.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just want to add my few words of praise for the Santa Chiara. We stayed in room 228, which seemed to have been recently renovated. Hardwood floor, flat screen TV on wall, very comfortable beds and we especially liked the soft sheets and thick towels. The included breakfast was as good as everyone says. The buffet is self serve, including pots of coffee, but I saw several people request espresso shots, served by the waitstaff. See pics attached of breakfast buffet. It was always well stocked. I also liked the fact that breakfast is available from 7am to 10:30am, a pretty generous window. WifFi internet access is available, for a fee. You must prepay for the increment of time you choose, price varies from Euro 3 for 30 minutes, better rates for longer times. Note that the time you purchase does not have to be used all at once.Just be sure to log off their service correctly and the clock is stopped. All of the front desk staff seemed to speak English, not sure about the waitstaff. In general we found the Romans on the street quite helpful with directions or random questions etc. Found that people in service positions everywhere spoke some English. We spent 4 nights at the Santa Chiara. The location was perfect for exploring the historic areas of Rome on foot. A taxi cab from anywhere in the city centre back to Da Vinci airport is a flat 40 Euro, but be sure to agree the price with the driver first.. I am not sure if the same fare applies in the opposite direction.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family of six (aged 75, 46, 45 x 2, 16 and 14) stayed here as part of an Andante tour. As we were in Rome for the archaeology the location was very good as we were in walking distance of most of the important monuments. On occasions we did use the buses which are numerous a few minutes walk away and cheap at 1 Euro for 75 minutes. (buy your ticket in advance) Taxis are not cheap nor easy to come by in the area of the hotel so be prepared to walk. We were accomodated in 3 adjacent rooms, two were good sized, the third adequate. All were spotlessly clean, with very comfortable beds and sparkling white bed linen. There was a lack of drawers and hanging space was limited in the smaller room. Our rooms faced an inner court and were very quiet, except for the local seagulls who seem to be active 24/7! I find the criticism of breakfast strange: there was, indeed, tinned fruit, but also a variety of fresh fruit as well as cereals, yoghurt and fruit juices. Scrambled and boiled eggs were hot and there was a variety of cold meats and cheese, rolls, bread and croisants. Coffee came from a machine but there was a good selection of decent tea bags. The breakfast room was always busy and a bit claustrophobic but the staff were attentive and kept everything replenished. There is a small bar and sitting area downstairs. The staff were pleasant and plentiful. Because we were on a tour we did not need their services to any great extent but other reviewers obviously found them helpful.</p></li>

<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>On occasions we did use the buses which are numerous a few minutes walk away and cheap at 1 Euro for 75 minutes.</br>
<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>(buy your ticket in advance) Taxis are not cheap nor easy to come by in the area of the hotel so be prepared to walk.</br>
<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 0.999&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>We were accomodated in 3 adjacent rooms, two were good sized, the third adequate.</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 0.987&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>All were spotlessly clean, with very comfortable beds and sparkling white bed linen.</br>

<li>There was a lack of drawers and hanging space was limited in the smaller room.</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Our rooms faced an inner court and were very quiet, except for the local seagulls who seem to be active 24/7!</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 0.942&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>I find the criticism of breakfast strange: there was, indeed, tinned fruit, but also a variety of fresh fruit as well as cereals, yoghurt and fruit juices.</br>
<span style="background-color:#f58231">FOOD</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Scrambled and boiled eggs were hot and there was a variety of cold meats and cheese, rolls, bread and croisants.</br>

<li>Coffee came from a machine but there was a good selection of decent tea bags.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My daughter had a single and I had a double room for single occupancy .in the renovated section.This arrangement insured enough space and privacy for our week in Rome. The location in the heart of the historic district made it possible to walk almost everywhere. Many wonderful gelaterias and a wide selection of eating establishments were conveniently close. The Albergo was immaculate and well-run, although without any particular atmosphere or charm. Still it was good to escape to its quiet after the bustle and crowds of Rome. My room overlooked the street but was quiet as was my daughter's overlooking a terrace. Be aware that the shower is a tight squeeze. I am 5'8" , 140 pounds and managed. If you are taller or heavier be careful. The bed pillows took some getting used to, like sleeping on marble slabs. Right in keeping with what we saw in the church sarcophagi.You can use Wi-Fi for 10 euro for 24 hours over a 4 day period. In a week we spent 20 euro on Wi-FI. Breakfast before 9am meant competing with crowding at the buffet, but then Rome in October is extremely popular. A personal guide is highly recommended. We had Andrea Pollett (a.pollett@libero.it or AWT@andreapollett.com) for two afternoons, and were glad we did. He took us deep into the past in a scholarly and intriguing manner. Much more engaging than a guide book and a million times better than a group tour. Rome is expensive for dollar tourists but we found Albergo Santa Chiara a good value at 205 for a single and 250 euro for a double room,plus soggiorno tax.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I had a great experience at the Albergo Santa Chiara. I made all arrangements via e-mail, and it worked out perfectly. A driver was waiting at the airport for us, arranged by the hotel in advance, and in no time were in the beautiful, gleaming, spotless lobby. Our flight arrived earlier than planned, but they were able to get us in our room in short order, and by 10 we were out exploring the area. The Pantheon is literally around the corner. We walked absolutely everywhere during our three days in Rome...not a problem. While busy during the day, at night the area got so much quieter and enjoyable. Candlelit tables magically appear everywhere. We just wandered in the area near our hotel until we found a cafe or restaurant that looked good. We were never disappointed. One night we had wine and a meat/cheese appetizer at an enoteca a few yards from the Pantheon----stunning when lit at night. Another night we passed a narrow alley that had a few tables set. There were about 10 tables total and the food was amazing. The staff was as friendly and helpful as could be. Breakfast was good and plentiful. Not fancy, but they had really good coffee and yummy croissants. Ask for a cappuccino, they are delicious. Loved this hotel and would definitely stay here again. By the way, do NOT miss the Borghese Gallery, it was our favorite experience in Rome. Reservations are required, but easy to make over the phone, takes just a few minutes. We did take a taxi to the gallery, since our reservation was early, but we strolled back through the park and down the Spanish Steps. Wonderful day!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel for a one week winter break for my husband and self. It is very well placed in the block behind the Pantheon. We are both in our 60's and found no problem walking to the Vatican, Spanish Steps, the Colosseum etc. There are many nearby places to eat an evening meal. The area felt very safe with none of the graffitti and 'handbag sellers' found around the Ponte Sisto area. The hotel was very clean, the room modern, fridge large enough to store water bottles some beer and food. Wall-mounted TV, good hair dryer. Digital safe in the wardrobe, very useful. Each day the towels were changed as required and we had clean pillowcases but the sheets were not changed all week. We had a third floor room with a view over the Piazza della Minerva. The breakfast was all you could wish for - fruit, juice, many cereals, yogurts, a selection of meats and cheeses, eggs, spreads, toast, coffee, teas and more. All beautifully set out for self-service, although I do not eat wheat or dairy products I had no problems. (there were even Rice Cakes) The reception area is large with an area off with a bar and settees where you can sit to read the supplied newspapers. The staff were all very efficient and helpful, there was always someone who understood english. Problems? the lift was unusable one evening - the third floor was a long way up after a long day walking around. The room was too hot for our taste - the control had no effect, so we simply opened the window to cool down the temperature, (it was cold outside) The Rain - very heavy at times - fortunately we had good raincoats. Yes the hotel is expensive, but you get what you pay for, I throughly recommend it.</p></li>
