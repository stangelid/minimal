<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay was very satisfactory. The hotel is well situated. The service was good. The rooms are somewhat small and quite expensive considering the size. Food services are excellent. We stay at the hotel mainly because we like to shop at Granville Island.

The hotel is very good, with decent sized rooms, great prices and excellent service! I love the lounge and the micro brew beer! The area is amazing with lots of shopping, great food and beautiful views! And the best part is- it's dog friendly! My mutt loves Granville Island! Thanks again for a great Vacouver visit!</p></li>

Hop on a nearby ferry to explore downtown, the West End, Yaletown or Chinatown. Visit all the amenities on Granville island and enjoy a meal at the hotel restaurant Dockside - especially on the waterside plaza in the summer!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staying at the Grandville Island hotel always makes my stay in Vancouver a special experience. I have stayed here on business, with Family and with friends and no one has ever been anything but totally impressed. The staff, rooms and food are outstanding and the there's the location. This location is amazing- I mean you don't have to drive anywhere to get food, drink, entertainment and culture. Water Taxi's and walking paths are right there if you want to head out to English Bay or Yaletown. I love this property.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I really loved this hotel. The location is cool in that you're in the only hotel on the Island, everyone knows where to find it, and it's central in the city. The hotel itself is reasonably priced, has very open meeting rooms with doors directly outside. The rooms are VERY clean (very), and the bathrooms are quite luxurious. The one drawback is that it's not that well insulated, sound-wise. I could hear the seagulls in the morning, and if there's a party in the hotel, you might want to bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper.</p></li>

The food is excellent ( both room service and in the resto) and they have a micro brewery on site.

The hotel restaraunt was ok, not outstanding but pretty good. The bar was really nice and I spent a nice couple hours there on a sunny afternoon enjoying a slow pint. You can walk to everything on granville island and there is a lot to see and do there. We had been to granville before but this was the first time we stayed at the hotel. Its a much better way to see the island. No fuss about parking. walk everywhere and return to your room for a drink and a hot tub when you are done.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not a bad hotel. Room was quite small, with very limited closet space, especially for 2 adults and a child. Free hi-speed internet was very welcome. The restaurant is excellent, and good value if you take advantage of the $25 three-course special. The beer brewed on the premises was also very good. One of the drawbacks of staying on Granville Island is the parking - almost impossible at the weekend, even after paying the hotel $7 for a pass that allows you to park beyond the normal 3 hour limit. All in all, if I had to return to Vancouver I would think about staying here again.</p></li>

The two water taxis companies serving Granville Island make it very accessible to downtown as well. If you want to walk/cycle - it doesn't get better the the walking/cycling trails leading away from Granville Island. I had a room with a partial view and it was very nice. The staff were very friendly as well. I didn't have any meals at the hotel so can't comment on that. I didn't spend much time actually at the hotel so my interaction with staff was limited as well.</p></li>

A beautiful large modern style room with lots of windows. Great kind bed with very nice soft linens and fluffy towels. Best shower ...the bathroom was huge with an amazing huge ceiling shower head. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. The restaurant too was really great and prices were in line with good restaurants in Vancouver. Although the hotel has parking for a daily fee, it is best not to bring your car as the island is definitely best seen on foot and driving on the island is difficult as pedestrians are everywhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We live on the North Shore and decided to have a down town holiday. Granville Island Hotel was brilliantly located in the middle of False Creek activity. Hotel was friendly, staff helpful, room lovely, bathroom really lovely, restaurant and bar great food and drink and service. Took the little aquabus across to Yaletown and rode bikes along sea wall.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for 5 days at an educational "intensive". Granville Island itself is very interesting, although I didn't have enough time to really explore. Great public market, lots of artistic activity. We needed to be able to provide some of our own food, so asked to have the mini bar emptied so we could use the fridge, and for a microwave, although it wasn't a regular part of the room. Staff was very obliging and cheerfully looked after our needs. My rating would have been 5 stars, except the room was quite small for two people 5 days, and the only view was over a roof and hvac unit. The restaurant was a little bit pricey for our budget.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Granville Island Hotel on 25th May 2006. We had chosen it based on the reviews on the Trip advisor web site. We just wanted some where to stay for one night before we began our tour of Britsivh Columbia. It was OK for this purpose. Just somewhere to sleep. I cannot understand it's high rating on this site. It was very tight on space for 2 adults and 2 adolescents and a little past its prime. Granville Island market is a great place for breakfast, but I would suggest that if your stay is for more than one night, you choose another hotel. We stayed in 6 hotels in all and this was by no means the cheapest, but it was the least appealing.</p></li>

I requested a room with a view and a rain shower and a king bed and I recieved all my requests, I was very pleased. The room was beautiful, the staff were very pleasant and the food from the restiarant Downstairs was delicious. They had very fast room service as well. Highly enjoyed our stay and the next time we have the money to go out for a nice weekend again, we will definitely be going back here :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a wonderful hotel with really nice staff and is a beautiful place to go for a drink or to stay. We arrived after a 9 hour flight from London on our honeymoon and thanks to our bestman the hotel knew about this and upgraded us.Then later in the evening the booking for the penthouse was cancelled, and guy at the desk asked if we would like to move. This was more than considerate and made for a wonderful first night. Apart from the special treatment that we recieved we found all the people who worked there to be really nice and interested in having a conversation. This is a very well set up hotel. The views of South Downtown are amazing (see pics).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved everything about Granville Island. The location, the artistic vibe, the fantastic food (the market in our opinion is much better than Pike Place in Seattle that we visited earlier in the week) and this hotel. The hotel in a different location would have been nice, but the location really made it special for us. Within a 2 minute walk there are fantastic spots for breakfast, lunch and dinner and fun shopping and access to the sea wall. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful. They have a restaurant, and while we didn't eat there, it was packed and looked really good. The restaurant deck had a great view. I would definitely recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great hotel and obviously a favorite with discerning locals having events...they weren't really an obstruction to our having a great time, but did become something of a joke as both the hotel and adjoining park/marina/galleries are dripping with wedding parties. We had a great room at the end of the hall with a king size bed, and a connecting door to a smaller room with two doubles. The end room is great because even though it's small, 2 walls are window-sliders to balconies overlooking ritzy boats and water traffic. Restaurant was great. Bathrooms are super-luxorious. Beds are lush. We travelled with 4 kids and still had a terrific, romantic weekend!</p></li>

The daily parking charge is $12. . The V-shaped hotel has its restaurant and bar seating within the V, making for noisy evenings in your room. . The hotel restaurant merits only 3*, with slightly above average food (also expensive) . Their Microbrewery is much praised. I disagree: the beers are lightweight. However the hotel is very nice, and the staff very helpful. Being on Granville Island is a real treat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'm almost reluctant to write this review, because I don't want prices at this great little hotel to go up. Granville Island Hotel is located in one of the best spots in an increasingly bustling city of Vancouver. Its out of the way, but in the middle of everything. Close to the market, the Arts Club Theatre, funky shops and downtown. My 11 year old daughter marvelled at the Toy Store, loved the food fudge vendors and even the buskers tunes. The standard room was a good size, clean and attractive. We opened our window to a view of the creek. Parking was an extra charge, but cheaper than downtown, and unless you're staying in the burbs, parking is going to cost you. I'd highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">granville island is a community in itself. you could easily spend most of your time there since there are lots of restaurants and a fantastic public market featuring lots of food. you can set off on serious walks or just hang out and watch the local water scene. quiet at night without the often ugly street level scene you encounter at more glamorous high-rises (yes the high-rises can give you great views but coming out at street level you feel like you've walked into a seedy bus station environment). A design school campus brings a funky element to the scene as well as individual artist studios. Overall seems to be a part of life for Vancouver residents so you're not stuck looking at crowds of unattractive tourists.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Granville Island Hotel for a conference meeting. It is located ~30mins cab ride from Vancouver airport on Granville Island. The location is amazing, Granville Island is a tourist hotspot, filled with art galleries and a indoors farmers market which is a must see and great place for lunch. The hotel is located right on the water. Very helpful and polite staff, they will go the extra mile for you. The hotel is very modern, with the feel of a boutique 5 star hotel. Restaurant in the hotel, plus many on Granville Island to choose from. Hotel also has a sauna and hot tub for use. The rooms are very clean, equipped with large flat screen TV and complimentary internet. A good launching pad if you are staying in Vancouver.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Granville Island hotel concierge helped us get tickets on the trolley tour, and we are very glad we did. It was a fun, informative, and flexible way to view the entire city. We also sat on the balcony of our room to watch the boats go by and enjoy the view. The rooms were well appointed. We especially loved the modern shower with rainfall, massage, and regular options. The restaurant also has a terrific view and the people were very nice. The location of the hotel also makes it easy to have a stroll around Granville Island, but you'll need a taxi to get to the clubs and shopping in the city proper. If we have to pick something we missed, and it's hard to do, we would have loved a hot tub on premises. We will definitely return to Granville Island Hotel</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Granville Island Hotel was overall really nice. The room itself was clean, the bathroom was very modern, and the views of the water/harbor were very pretty. The hotel's bar and restaurant were both very nice, offered good food and beverages. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The only reason I did not give it 5 out of 5 stars is because of its location. Granville Island was a little too touristy for me. It features a children's carnival, which is great for families, but not very appealing to business travelers. There also is not a commuter train stop on Granville Island, so you have to pay for a taxi or water taxi if you don't have a rental car. All of that said, I would still stay here again, but would be prepared for needing cash for taxis.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed at the Granville Island Hotel and it was fabulous! We had been to Vancouver Island two times in the past and have always wanted to stay at this hotel but couldn't get in. This time I planned ahead and we had an amazing time both at the hotel and enjoying all that Granville Island has to offer! We arrived early and our room wasn't quite ready but the staff immediately took our luggage to a holding room and provided us with a place to change into cooler clothes since it was a beautiful sunny day. Once our room was ready, we found our luggage already waiting for us in our room! The entire staff could not have been more pleasant and accommodating and the food, beverages and waterfront setting were wonderful as well. Thank you so much...I can't wait to go back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for the simple reason of location. And Man! Was that a great reason to stay here. The hotel itself was average plus, but as I mentioned the location nails it. Seems the rooms were a bit limited when we stayed so the room wasn't as much as I had hoped. There was a large function going on when we got in 11:00 ish on a Sunday night. Really rocking and that's not a bad thing eh :) But chasing down something to eat this late on the island was hopeless. Understandable for the hour and it being a Sunday. Did check out the restaurant during regular business hours several times and the food, service and beer brewed on premisise was an all around thumbs up! The market is a must go too. I don't care where you've been in your travels. It's a really cool market. Hope this helps!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First, I need to mention how helpful the folks at the front desk were. They know their facility well and strive to make their guests comfortable. My feeling was that they would never make me feel as though any question I asked were silly. In addition, when my family and I arrived early, they gave us a parking pass well before check-in time. It's those kinds of perks which make people decide to return. My room - 316. Oh, my gosh. That view is killer, and with two decks with which to view it! I wish that there were a way to turn off the outside lights, however, so that I could leave the curtains open at night to catch the lights from the buildings across False Creek. I will totally ask for that room again. Go to the adjoining restaurant - Docksider - for at least one meal. Awesome food, service and view!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Granville Island Hotel because it was close to the Stanley Theatre and a $12 cab fare to downtown. The hotel staff were very good and accomodating, the hotel itself is good. The rooms are clean and comfortable, the bathrooms very nice (love the shower!). We had wished the room had a fridge that could be used rather than one stocked with liquor. Do people actually still use those liquor fridges?... The rooms are quite small, which was a little tight with two kids and my wife and me. The temperature control ( an old round dial type of thermostat) didnt work so we couldnt adjust the temperature, other then by opening a window. The hotel was reasonable value, and in a great location. We had breakfast each morning at Granville Island which is always pleasant (earlier in the day the better when its not busy.) All in all a good stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Myself and my husband stayed here September 6th and 7th. We were promptly greeted for check in by very polite staff. I had requested a view of the water and the room was lovely. The bed and bedding was amazingly comfortable and appeared to be very high quality. The front desk supervisor greeted us by name as we came and went during the two days which I was quite impressed by. The restaurant has a fabulous view of the harbour which we enjoyed both mornings for breakfast. The service in the restaurant was a bit snobbish and I didn't get the condiments I requested the second morning, however this is minor in my opinion. If we return to the area I would definitely stay here again. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel if you wish to be in the Granville Island area. Cab to the city centre was $13-14 dollars. Cabs are readily available streetside.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and my family of 3 (Myself, Wife & Son) loved staying on Granville Island. It was like a peaceful oasis in a major metropolitan area. We simply loved starting and finishing every day on Granville Island. We would eat breakfast in the Market take one of the super cute little ferries over to Vancouver, explore the city and then take a cab back for a peaceful dinner in one of the many very nice restaurants on the island. If that sounds like how you want to spend a few days in Vancouver then the Granville Island Inn is the hotel for you. For one it is the only hotel on the island and two it is a very nice hotel. The rooms are small but nice, the lobby is modern and inviting and the staff is friendly. This is not a five star hotel but you are not paying five star prices and as stated above the location is awesome. When we return to Vancouver we will be stating at the property again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently had an extremely bad stay at an American Sheraton hotel, and were a bit gunshy about staying in ANY hotel again...haha. But we were en route to Kelowna from Victoria and had some business to do in Vancouver which required a stay over. A local B&B actually recommended your hotel and we had a lovely one night stay with you. Staff were most obliging and friendly. Our evening snack on the patio was delicious, relaxing and we had a lovely server...again most helpful and obliging...and the view! Ach, beautiful!! We were initially worried as our room was adjacent to the patio and we feared lots of noise, but it was quiet after 10 pm, the beds were great and we both a great sleep, and really enjoyed visiting the market before we left for Kelowna. Now the traffic on the way to Kelowna was another thing altogether...we stayed too long and hit rush hour! But that's our fault! Thanks again!</p></li>

Easy access to downtown, Science Centre, English Bay, etc. via AquaBus, and that's only if you have time to do any of that after checking out all the great places on the Island. Also an easy walk to 4th Ave. which is great up towards Arbutus, Kits beach, and you can step right out the hotel door onto the SeaWall for a run around False Creek. That being said, my room was only okay. I think the bathroom was recently reno'd and it was great, but the rest of the room was pretty ho-hum, and even a little run-down/old looking. I expect more considering the price. The event I attended had a lunch and reception in the restaurant and the food was fantastic. I probably wouldn't eat there though if I was paying for it myself as the menu was pretty expensive and there are several great places to eat elsewhere on the Island.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you've never been to Granville Island in Vancouver, you should definitely stay at the Granville Island Hotel. Normally, you can only park for 3 hours on the island, which isn't nearly enough time to wander around and see everything, but the hotel offers free parking. The Hotel is easy to get to from the Airport, Check-in was smooth, and the staff was very helpful. Every day we would get up and walk the short walk to the "Public Market" and have our breakfast or lunch. It was delightful! The Dockside restaurant is also lovely. We ate there the night before the wedding, and were not disappointed. Great food and great service. My only complaint is that our small room was over top of where shipments came in, and so it was often loud with trucks backing up, and people making noise. Also, in this room there was no view, which for a prairie girl was a bit disappointing. All in all, though, a very lovely stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 3 nights. When we initially entered our room it became clear that animals had stayed in the room -- husband and son have bad animal allergies -- they moved us to another room. The rooms are incredibly small. They need to update the place, but since it is the only hotel on Granville Island I think they are in no rush! The location is excellent and they give you a parking permit to park on the island (normally there is a 3 hour maximum). We never had a problem parking the car even though the island gets very busy on the weekends. The hotel restaurant was fine, not great. The second room we were in had a view of the water which made it more bearable. The Staff was very friendly and helpful. There was a fire alarm at 11pm (had kids in bed!) and it was unclear as to whether we should evacuate. They told us they thought it was a false alarm...Granville Island is a great place to visit w/kids - lots to do and a fun water park.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here overnight 1 night for business travel. The place is a bit confusing to drive into at night if you're unfamiliar with the area, but my GPS showed the way. Check in was easy. The front desk clerk suggested paying $16 for parking permit "to be safe" in a 3 hour parking zone enforced between the hours of 9pm to 7am, even though I was outside those hours. I declined and had no problems. The hotel setting is very nice with water and dock views. The room was very nice, clean and new, a tad on the small side, but fine. High end bathroom fixtures, comfortable bed with premium linens, free wifi. My room was very quiet. Only room complaint was the old fashioned noisy A/C unit - noisy and musty smelling. I turned it off and opened the sliding glass door to get some cool air. Had breakfast at the restaurant. Service was fast, the food was very good and the dining room had nice water views. Overall, I really liked the place and would return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had an awesome experience. We arrived a little late on Xmas day after a troublesome time with the car rental company (Budget did not have a car for me despite having a valid reservation). The hotel staff was friendly and upgraded me to the penthouse. The room had outstanding views. My kids thought they were in heaven with such a large suite. We had our Xmas dinner at the hotel and even though it was a little pricey, we had a nice dinner. The desserts were outstanding as well as the service. The best part of the hotel is being able to walk to the Public Market where you can find everything you need to prepare a wonderful meal (like a picnic with wine, cheese, bread, fruits, meats, etc) or you could just eat at the many food stalls. We had a car, so we were able to drive to many places in Vancouver like Stanley Park, Canada Place, Chinatown, Robson Street, Yaletown, etc. My wife and I truly enjoyed our stay and we love the atmosphere of the public market.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very pleasant hotel and particularly helpful and accommodating staff. The room we stayed in had a superb view over the marina at the back of the hotel. The bed was huge and the room a good size. We has breakfast at the hotel twice. There are a variety of options at a reasonable price. The location, although not downtown, was still great. It's actually a good thing that we weren't in the centre. Granville Island itself has restuarants of its own, a wonderful public market and quaint boutiques. It was very easy to travel around Vancouver from here. A short seabus trip across to Hornby Street took us to downtown for $2.50pp. All the major sight-seeing bus tours stop just a couple of minutes walk away as does public transport. The staff were happy to advise us on whale whatching trips, transport options and tours. They went out of their way to call up on our behalf and accommodate us in any way possible. There is free internet access which is a great bonus. Highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We are a 40-something couple travelling with 3 small children. Since we'd heard that the rooms can vary in size and view, we requested (at booking) a larger room and a nice view, both of which were accommodated by the hotel. The highlight was the restaurant, which had the best food on the island and quite possibly in all of Vancouver's westside. Unbelievable. My husband tried a different beer each night that was micro-brewed at the hotel. He was very impressed and requested a tour of the brewery, which the brew-master provided for him. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The walls were thick and the hotel had a quiet but friendly feel to it. Our girls loved the decent-sized hot tube with the windowed ceiling that allowed us to watch the starts at night. The location was ideal and the staff were superb. What would have made this hotel a 5-star for us would have been if the concierge had been more knowledgeable, particularly with transit options for exploring attractions.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived from the UK tired and, hungry, and dirty, and found to our delight that we had been upgraded to a penthouse suite. The staff were very apologetic about the fire that had temporarily closed the restaurant, but when we saw our room, we forgot all about food. It was vast, with a dining room, 2 bathrooms - and a jacuzzi in the bedroom! We were so comfortable in the hotel that it was hard to leave it to join our cruise ship (where the bed was far less comfortable). The public market was amazing in the variety and quality of the food - nothing at all like the sad collection of vegetable stalls that you find at most UK town markets. The hotel staff were very helpful in getting us to and from the aquarium, giving change, arranging taxis. They really seemed to care about the guests. The hotel brought in free pastries and coffee every morning, while the restaurant was being refurbished. We ate them in the sunshine by the water, looking at the Vancouver skyline. It was pure bliss.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a fantastic site to walk around, have a bike ride, visit the ocean, go shopping, go on a small bot tour, its all available next to the Granville Island Hotel. I have stayed here before but my preferred room was not available. I accepted 211 but should have negotiated for a different room. It was exceptionally noisy. I rented a bike but no one offered to show me how to use the lock. After sort of figuring it out how it worked i started out for a ride to the beach. On returning i found the key went missing from the lock I had secured to the bike. Informed then at the desk on my return. Initially they were less than courteous about it but i said if there is a charge of course i would play however it might be helpful for future guests to be escorted to the bike and given a brief safety instruction prior to giving someone a key. they did agree. I stay at other expensive hotels similar to this and they do this service, they also do not charge for the bikes if you are a guest of the hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived on a rainy Thursday day to be greeted by a very friendly staff. We were told that we had been upgraded to a suite. It was a very nice room with a beautiful view of the waterfront. In one part of the room, we could lay on the sofa watching television while we watched the world passing by through the large window. In the other part of the room, we could sleep or just have breakfast in bed while watching the other television in the room. The Dockside Restaurant was very good. We enjoyed a good lunch. And then we wandered around the shops of Granville Island. I especially enjoyed the Public Market. I found the best gift for my friend at the Okanagan Wine Shop. It was a bottle of wine with a miniature tuxedo jacket around the bottle. Later that night, we went back to the Dockside restaurant for dinner. We shared a steak in a beautiful setting of a table of two with a good view of the waterfront and a candle on the table. Overall, it was a romantic Thursday night at the Granville Island Hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Granville Island is a great location to base a trip from if you are staying in Vancouver. The Hotel was remodeled for the 2010 Olympics. The service is good. The beds and Bathrooms are both quite nice. The parking lots can be have a bit of noise but is FAR better than other hotels I've stayed in while in Vancouver. If possible try to get a room overlooking the water. The rooms on the third floor (top floor) tend to be nicer than the others. For breakfast check out the market just close to the hotel on the island. If you want to visit downtown just take the water taxi or "aqua bus" these little boats are fun, not very expensive and the quickest way to gt there. If you are a jogger simply head to the seawall and head in either direction... personally I prefer heading west towards the beach. If you want to go to Stanley Park the hotel rents bikes and pedal your way along the sea wall. Nice way to see the park and bit more of Vancouver. Being on the sea wall makes it safe and impossible to get lost. WiFi was also pretty quick</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After studying tripadvisor for some time we decided to make the best of our single-night stay in Vancouver by booking the Granville Island Hotel and we were not let down. The hotel is located as close to the water as you can get without falling in. Its a bit old and some of the furnishings and fabrics in the room showed their age, but its clean and quiet and the mattress was comfortable. All the rooms have some view of the water and although they are small and expensive it is worth it. The valet will help you find a spot for your car and the hotel gives you the required window permit that will allow your car to remain parked for more than the 3 hours the law allows. Parking on Granville Island is hard but once you park you certainly do not need your car again on the Island and you can easily grab a jitney boat that will take across the water to downtown Vancouver in a matter of minutes. The restuarant in the hotel is quite nice and despite its "brewery" designation is much more of a full menu than you might expect. Enjoy!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A hotel with its own brewery, how can you go wrong? Seriously, we go to Vancouver BC at least once a year and have been staying at the Granville Island Hotel for the past four years. The top reason we continue to choose this hotel is its location. We love Granville Island and everything it has to offer--the botique shops, public market, restaurants, theaters, and its central location in Vancouver. We reserved a room with the internet special price of $135 CN through the hotel's web site. Our room was clean and comfortable with a king-size bed. The hotel's lobby was undergoing renovations at the time but it never created any issues with our stay. In fact, I'm anxious to see how it looks the next time we stay. We're the sort of travelers who aren't interested in luxury and a lot of amenities with our accommodations. We use hotels to sleep and shower when we're on vacation. We value location and a clean and comfortable place to stay. If you're that sort of traveler, too, this hotel is a great option for your trip to Vancouver.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I love the location of this hotel! Its perfect to be near the water and located in one of the greatest areas in Vancouver. I checked in no problem and they gave us a room they was sort of facing the water. Meaning you had to go out on to the balcony and look to your right to see water. The room also had a weird smell. I checked their website and discovered they allow pets, which explains the tile room in that room. I'm assuming the previous occupant was a negligent pet owner and allowed their pet to do their business everywhere in the room. We asked for another room right away and managed to get something that was equivalent to the one we had. I'm guessing that was fortunate since it was Easter and a conference was coming in a few days. The good stuff: the rooms are clean and tidy. The restaurant on the ground floor is excellent. The room service was great! Didn't try out the pool. Most of the staff was friendly. It was convienient to grab breakfast from the Granville Market and the restaurants in Granville are excellent. We went to the Pacific Culinary Institute and that was amazing!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Granville Island Hotel for one night in late September prior to embarking on a cruise. The hotel was well appointed, our room comfortable and decorated in a traditional style. The size was adequate for us -- as we do not spend a lot time in a hotel, preferring to see the city instead. There was a small balcony and we could see the water and boats both from our window and the balcony. The room was quiet and we did not notice any noise from "neighbors". The bath included a bidet. The staff at the hotel were very friendly, helpful and cheerful. When we checked out they gladly kept our luggage until we were ready to leave the "island". As it was misty and a bit rainy that day they offered us the use of an umbrella which made our walk around the area much more pleasant. We also noticed that the restaurant staff and bar staff went out of their way to be helpful and offer just a bit extra. One note for those seeking taxi's - I do not believe it is possible to just "hail" a taxi while walking about. The Hotel ordered one for us and it arrived well within the time frame given -- 5-10 minutes.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We last stayed here 4 years ago and really loved the location. It's near enough to the city yet has a different feel - probably because the Island is a working place, not just a tourist trap. The market itself is so interesting and the food is wonderful. It's also great to see the students at the Emily Carr Institute. The hotel is really nice and the staff are friendly and helpful. We had to change our itinerary beforehand, so could only have a standard room for the first night and then a king suite for the following 2 nights. The standard room was very good, on the ground floor overlooking the patio area, and we would have happily stayed there if the king suite had been unavailable. However, we really wanted a room on the 2nd floor with a view over False creek, so changed on night 2. Our only real disappontment was when we walked around Gastown, which really seems to have got shabby since our last visit. There are far more people begging and the whole area is in need of some upgrading. For old times sake, we even had lunch at the Old Spaghetti Factory, but the food wasn't very good, so we decided to give the city a miss and pootle around the Island instead .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for 4 nights in August 06 and was impressed from the 1st minute of my arrival. Having just come off a very long flight from Australia I arrived well before regular check in time but was shown to my room straight away. Very pretty outlook over the harbour. Good points: Very welcoming atmosphere Room was very clean & well appointed Room service was promt & food was great same as restaurant Best Mini bar selection of my whole trip lots of local treats Very close to the great Granville Island Markets (1-2 min walk) Very good service from all staff Close to Aquabus which takes you into downtown Vancouver (a bit of a hike uphill to get into town) Free internet access for guests there is one computer in lobby so you somtimes have to wait for another guest to finish but it is rare to find free access The Beer brewed on site was pretty good Disappointing points: Was not on the pick up list for day trips but it is very quick & cheap trip into Vancouver to meet up with a trip. The Big Bus hop onhop off goes fairly close to the hotel (5-7 min walk) Live Music played most nights from Restaurant which while very good when you have a full day and want to sleep it would go until about midnight.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel on the basis of the tripadvisor reviews and it exceeded expectations. Our room was fantastic, especially for the price paid. It was huge, comfortable ,clean, nicely decorated and with great views over the boats of False Creek. All staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly. Generally this hotel has excellent service, is fantastic value, the restaurant is good with great views, but the best thing is that it just has a lovely relaxed and friendly atmosphere. The location is just perfect. I was so glad that we hadn't booked one of the bigger, high rise downtown hotels. My family consists of myself, my husband and our 8 year old son.In total we were in Vancouver for about 6 days and we never needed to take a bus or taxi during our whole trip other than the Aquabus to/from Granville Island. That took us to downtown, Yaletown, the Science centre, the Space museum... and then we just walked. But it was great actually being based on Granville Island. The food market made me wish I was cooking and not eating out at restaurants! Also with the theatres, great restaurants , the artists studios/shops, the microbreweries etc it's a brilliant area . I would definately recommend the hotel and the area to anyone planning a trip to Vancouver.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One of my favourite weekend retreats. The hotel is located on Granville Island in the heart of Vancouver. Granville Island is a shoppers bazaar by day for gifts, clothing, groceries, baked goods, quick snacks, sophisticated dining, aboriginal art and more and also popular among locals and tourists alike. Being on the water, there is never a lack of things to do or see. At night there is live theatre and great dining both on the island as well as a short drive or cab ride away. The evenings are quiet and perfect for a good nights sleep. Living in the 'burbs' of Vancouver, my wife and I enjoy staying at the Granville Island Hotel as our home away from home. It allows us to enjoy the Vancouver night life without the drive back home in the early morning hours. We find the hotel rooms well appointed and comfortable; the staff friendly and accomodating. The dining room in the hotel is the Dockside Restaurant which offers a fine menu for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. On the weekend, we especially enjoy items on the brunch menu. We have on occasion had many out of town guests attend a celebration or reunion and have not hesitated to recommend the Granville Island Hotel for their stay in Vancouver. The Granville Island Hotel continues to be one of our favourites.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this hotel for the last 4 nights of our 2-week holiday and were not disappointed. The staff welcomed us with great warmth and throughout our stay were genuinely pleased to offer help and advice on topics such as buses (including whether it was better to walk or take the ferry). Our room was on the ground floor, and I was initially worried it might be noisy as it had a view of the waiter's water station for the outside patio, but in fact it was very quiet, and we could glimpse the water through the shrubs which preserved our privacy, as well as people-watching. We had a room with 2 double beds for my husband and myself and our two boys (12 and 6), and the space was comfortable (though not generous) for the 4 of us, even when returning to the room for some "down time". Granville Island itself is fascinating - I could spend a fortune in the market, and the Kids Market is good for clothes and shoes as well as toys. The Dockside Restaurant in the hotel is superb, and we ended up eating there twice for dinner. Didn't try the breakfast we we tended to buy things from the market and eat them outside. If you're staying over a weekend I recommend booking for dinner as it was packed on Saturday night and Sunday lunchtime. A relaxed and comfortable place for families or couples.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked the hotel on Hotels.ca for two days. The hotel is in a great location but needs some serious updating, sound proofing and desk staff needs an attitude check towards guests. The floors throughout are marble with an occasional scatter rug. Our room was adequate. Kind size bed, tv, marble floors small scatter rug on either side of the bed. We could hear chairs and people moving around in the adjoining room as if it was in our room mostly because of the echoing from the marble floors. The room was in a very quiet section of the property but the noise factor was a problem because of the large space in the threshold of the door and the rooms on either side. The elevator groaned when in use which was kind of scary.The pay per view movie was not working the first night, worked the second. We were charged $12 per day for parking and in-room water. The website's info said $8 per day for parking and complimentary in- room water. The desk staff would not look up on Hotels.ca the discrepancies we sited when checking out but they were very cheery and smiling the whole time while denying our information which was infuriating! In this day with gas prices so high and people not traveling as much, they seriously need a reality check or else this place will close down because of all the negative reviews.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This superb hotel on Granville Island is hard to beat. In a beautiful, quiet location, it has so much to offer. Overlooking a marina and with fine views over Vancouver it really is ideally situated. So apart from location, what else commended it to me? First, wonderful staff who were so attentive to my needs, treating and speaking with me with respect that is often hard to find in modern hotels. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Secondly, the room was well equipped, the decor tasteful and the bed was extremely comfortable. Thirdly, the restaurant was excellent. The staff were simply delightful and the food is hard to beat ..... anywhere! Being a only a few minutes walk to Granville Island Market and a variety of nice, small shops was a bonus. A short, inexpensive ferry ride to Downtown Vancouver makes it an ideal place to stay if you want to explore the main shops or get to some of the other major attractions. Buses also run from the entrance of Granville Island to Downtown. At the end of a tiring day, the hotel hot tub is the ideal place to unwind and ease those aching limbs. I didn't try the gym equipment. Staying at the Granville Island Hotel was a real highlight of my Canadian tour, and I was very sad to be leaving. I thoroughly recommend it on all fronts. Thank you for a wonderful, relaxing stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 2 nights in one of the penthouse suites facing downtown Vancouver. The room was beautiful and very spacious with amazing views of False Creek. The hotel is not far from the Aqua Bus, taxis, and the Granville Island Public Market making it easy to get around. Our room was very quiet and well appointed. The bedroom area is so sound proof that we couldn't hear each other talk in separate rooms. There are wrap-around balconies off every room with chairs and a table. We had in-room massages provided by the spa just down the road and there was plenty of space for side-by-side table setup. We ate at the restaurant for breakfast once and had room service as well. Both were good. After living in Vancouver for several years, then coming back to visit, we found this hotel gave us an entirely different perspective of the city - one that we fully appreciated! Our only slightly negative comment was that the large kitchen area had plenty of wine glasses, but nothing else - no cutlery, no plates, etc. so that when we bought food to bring back to the room, we had nothing to eat it with. However, a quick call down to the front desk had all that delivered within minutes. We mentioned this upon check-out and they seemed happy to add those items to the room in future. I would definitely come back to this hotel and bring my kids next time!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for one night on July 30th after reading all the good reviews of this hotel. I have to say I was disappointed with the hotel. The hotel is perfectly acceptable, but does not stand out. We stayed in room 319 which was of average size for the hotel. The room was the smallest we stayed in during our tour of western Canada, and it was a struggle to fit in a rollaway bed for my son. The rooms are fairly well equipped, and on the surface look good, however the fittings when you look closely at them are not top quality, and will not last. Parking is a problem, and you will probably need to use the valet parking available at the hotel which costs $7. I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult. You really are forced to use the ferry boats to get across the creek. This is an enjoyable way to reach the city, but gets expensive if there is a group of you as it costs $2.50 each way. Granville Island itself is very disappointing. Basically a food market and some specialist shops. The market may be unique in North America, but in the UK most towns and cities have a market at least as good. We also stayed at the Slyvia Hotel in the West end, next door to Stanley Park, and that was much better value, both in regard to location, and space.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Granville Island Hotel is a great little place to stay if you don't want the big city experience, and you like walking out your door to the marketplace, coffee shops, galleries and outdoor spaces that surround you on this interesting island. We often visit Vancouver to see family, and decided to stay someplace different. We love going to Granville Island, but never have enough time to explore all of the nooks and crannies of this interesting place. The hotel is showing some signs of age, but the truly wonderful restaurant, cheery staff, and easy access to the city make this a hotel that every Vancouver visitor should try at least once. It rained all four days that we were there in mid-July, which is fairly unusual for this time of year. As they say there "No worries", because you could duck in and out of the little shops and galleries without getting too wet, and when a real downpour came as we were dressed up and heading into the city, we were offered a huge umbrella by the staff, which we kept until check out. Please do try the restaurant. The food was superb, and the atmosphere is wonderful - right on the water. We heard from friends that it is really wonderful when you can sit outside. Also, there is a brewery on site, and some of the beers were great. Maybe do a taste test first. So, I would recommend this hotel for its unique location and friendly staff. The bed was quite comfortable, but the A/C a bit noisy. No worries....</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A wonderful weekend at the Granville Island Hotel!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On several occasions we have visited Granville Island, and on at least one occasion have eaten at the Granville Island Hotel. We had however never stayed at this hotel until this weekend. I bought my husband a "weekend getaway/theatre package" for Christmas, which included an executive suite at the Granville Island Hotel, dinner at the hotel, and tickets to a theatre production. We could not believe the view when we walked into our room. It was outstanding. We didn't even turn on either of the two TV's while there - we just sat and looked out the window at the ever changing scenery. It was very hard to leave. Most everything else about the hotel was great as well - the size of our room, the friendly staff, a great dinner and breakfast, again with outstanding views from the dining room. We only have two comments - we were planning on a "nightcap" when we got back from the theatre on a Saturday night at 10:30 - only to discover that both the dining room and the lounge were closed at this early hour. Not what we expected to find in Vancouver. Luckily we had our own wine, and raided the mini bar for some munchies. The only other comment is about the huge trees that are planted directly in front of the million dollar view. Fortunately the trees were not yet in bloom so we still had a great view, but that will be more limited in few weeks. While we love trees, it always amazing to us why they are not more strategically placed! Overall a great weekend experience, and we will definately be back.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent five nights at the Granville Island Hotel, selecting it based on reviews from this site, and we were delighted. The first night we were in a smaller room without a view, which was quite small, and upon request, they moved us the next morning to a larger room with a balcony and great view without any charges. We loved the brew pub as well. But the main high-light for us, as we are sick of being in our cars in Los Angeles, was the public transportation. We didn't want to rent a car, and this location was perfect. A cab from the airport cost around $18 US, and then the rest of the days we used the excellent public transportation system. The island itself is lovely to wander around, and each day we bought either breakfast or a picnic lunch at the market. We traveled to Gastown by bus, easily accessed at the entrance to the island, and we took a bus and then the waterbus to the suspension bridge. We actually walked home one night from the GM Center, a half-hour walk. There are plenty of paths to jog and walk around the water, and lots of choices for dinner and drinks. Very close by are two HUGE beachside public pools as well. We took a bus to Stanley Park, and then walked to the water ferry to come back to the island. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and accomodating, and we used the free internet and printer in the lobby to research the bus lines. The desk staff was also very knowledgable about getting around. The island is also super for kids with the kids market and a free water park.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I pored over hotels to choose one for our honeymoon. We finally settled on a penthouse suite here and absolutely could not have been more pleased. We LOVED this place! ALL of the staff we came into contact with were welcoming, friendly, and went above and beyond to be helpful. They drew us a map to the airport at 5am and even went so far as to help me arrange secret surprises for my husband's birthday and sneakily orchestrate them! In all the service we encountered even the smallest details were attended to. The location is FANTASTIC for anyone who wants to be close to downtown but not right in the middle of the busy traffic and challenging parking. The wonderful public market and numerous restaurants and shops are just a quick walk away, as are the ferries that take you to other parts of Vancouver. You can make a longer walk to Vanier Park and an even longer walk/easy drive to Kitsilano. Downtown is an easy drive. You can also easily walk, drive, or ferry to some of the extensive walking/biking pathways around the city. We paid $12 a day for the extended stay parking pass and never once had trouble finding a spot next to the hotel. I thought the penthouse was well worth the money for a romantic stay compared to the other hotels we considered. The balcony had impressive views and was private, the suite was huge and very comfortable. The pillows and bed were amazing; we slept better than ever! They put new fresh flowers in the room every few days. If we ever come back to Vancouver, we would not consider staying anywhere else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I just concluded our 4 day stay at this hotel and loved every minute of it.

If you're looking for a smaller (decent sized) hotel with a relaxed environment (not to mention romantic), and is a 3 minute drive (5 minute water taxi ride) from downtown Vancouver, then this IS the hotel for you. Granville Island is actually a little peninsula (more like a giant pier) with a very laid back feel to it, complete with a down-home fresh foods market, like something you would see in the movies. There are several shops and plenty of excellent places to eat FRESH seafood, including the Dockside Restaurant and pub (microbrew). The hotel is right on the water (harbor) with a direct view of the hi-rises of Vancouver. There is plenty of pathway to take a romantic walk around the island (on the water) and to observe water traffic. The hotel itself is pretty up-to-date (complete with Internet access) and the staff is very nice and extremely helpful. We stayed in an executive suite, which had a separate living room, and was facing the water and downtown Vancouver... an excellent view. If you're going to stay for more than one night, I would highly recommend spending the extra few bucks for the upgrade. I've stayed in all types, all ratings of hotels around the world and I rank Granville Island Hotel as one of my top picks due to the location and relaxed environment... especially for an adult getaway.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Wonderful, with a few small quibbles”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed a quick, one-night visit to Vancouver, and stayed at the Granville Island Hotel. To get there, we took the quick little ferry from downtown, and walked with our rolling suitcases to the hotel, conveniently located and yet away from any traffic. It's a calm, well-designed "boutique" hotel tucked just past the end of the road on Granville Island. Check-in was friendly and efficient, and our room, although small, was fine. Even though we had requested the basic "non-view" category, our little balcony had a view of the water across to downtown, and a bonus was the fireworks over Science World (after all, it was Halloween). My only quibbles are small. The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad "department store" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?). A tiny problem, but big when you are in a hurry: offer better hair dryers than the low-powered one provided. And the most annoying: the room lighting is poor, in particular the reading light. There actually isn't any; the bedside lamp is too dim to read by. My husband tried removing the shade from the lamp, which only helped a tiny bit. On November mornings, it's great to get the newspaper delivered to the door, but until the sun came up we had trouble reading it. Those small issues aside, this is a lovely hotel in a great area, close to the attractions of Vancouver yet far enough away to provide solace. We hope to be back soon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I made a list while staying there Good Points * Great location and really only hotel in the kitsilano area and only one on GI * Comfortable bed * Lots of drawer space in bathroom * Good selection in mini bar ie. Chips and salsa *The restaurant deck is very nice and modern and quite a gem....too bad about the service and the food. Bad Points * half renovated the common areas are nice, the bathrooms have no bath tubs but new bathrooms. The shower fixture although very smart looking are hard to use and are very sharp due to the sharp and clean lines of design. * Small rooms * We had a small balcony but had plastic furniture and latice on the floor (not nice) * The dresser, desk and minibar are still the old furniture (too many pieces and old and ugly) It did however have a flat screen tv which should not require a piece a furniture to hold it as it should be wall mounted. As I said the rooms are too small for all that furniture. * Lamp had burnt out light bulb...not a big deal but these things should be checked upon cleaning. *The art in the rooms are old and are of Delta, why not GI? You do have a art institute across the road. *The shampoo was in a ridiculous size bottle and if anyone figures out how to get it out of the bottle I would love to know. However the soap was a good and generous size. * The doors, wallpaper and carpets need to be redone. * The restaurant has a very limited and boring menu and the service is terrible. * Way over priced and not the price I had booked online Overall this is a good choice for the location and if it is within your budget, just don't expect too much.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Mostly the Location”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel primarily because of its location, value, and it is close to downtown. The biggest obivious attraction of this hotel is its location - smack dab in the middle of Granville Island, and therefore close to the restaurants, markets, shops, and galleries that are all nearby. Like, I mean, within a couple of city blocks. And on the water, the ships gliding by, the water taxis, the sailboats, the seagulls, and the smells of the sea, all at your doorstep. And the hotel is a $10 cab ride from downtown or you can take a water taxi to the edge of the downtown area. Otherwise, it is kind of a humble little hotel. Small personal feel to it. Very accomodating, offering the use of their umbrellas (take one!), pointing out attractions, giving you maps, friendly greetings every day. Friendly and informal. Attached to the hotel is a great little patio restaurant by the water's edge (when weather permits) and a bar/restaurant inside with a mico-brewery. The food is acceptable, but don't expect gourmet. But don't fret, you are in Vancouver, where a new restaurant is born every week. Easy to park your car right in the lot in front of the hotel or the hotel staff will even volunteer to park it for you. The rooms themselves are spacious, we had a king-size bed, with a little balcony that looked out towards downtown. Otherwise, the decor and furnishings are a little tired and dated. It is clean, just a little frumpy. Nothing a little renovation couldn't quickly take care of. Like the wonky shower head. So if the hotel itself is real important and you intend to spend alot of time in the room itself, I don't recommend this hotel to you. But if you spend very little time in the hotel, as we generally do, then it is just OK and sometimes even better than just OK when you look at the lights of downtown at night over the water.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is my second visit to Granville Island Hotel in eight years and both times have been exceptional; last time I didn’t know about tripadvisor though! I’ve been here for nine days and I couldn’t be happier. I looked at a few different rooms and they vary in size and view. They’re currently renovating all the bathrooms and the new look is beautiful; even nicer than the Hyatt Regency where I stayed a few days prior to this hotel. All the rooms have been remodeled with nice big screen TVs, very comfortable beds and nice décor. Even the bathrooms in the rooms where the bathrooms have not yet been remodeled are still very nice. I recommend room 326… vaulted ceiling with cedar beams, king bed, wet bar and a fantastic water view… at a standard room price. The service is fantastic… in nine days I’ve only encountered nice, friendly, helpful, courteous, attentive and caring employees. A special shout-out to Christine, AJ, Oleg Adam and Kim for their help. They go above and beyond and seem to really enjoy making sure the guests are happy. The housekeeping service is excellent; the room was spotless every day. At the hotel’s restaurant where I ate often, the service was attentive and friendly; they even went out of their way tonight to make a strawberry compote for the cheesecake because I didn’t want the cherry compote! They asked me if I wouldn’t mind waiting as they offered to make it from scratch… highly worth the wait. I also recommend the huevos rancheros for breakfast. The food is excellent and the view is amazing. Granville Island is an oasis inside a city. If you’re looking for an active nightlife then this isn’t the right fit. If you’re looking for a walk-able and relaxing spot then this couldn’t be better! I travel often, I stay in many nice hotels and I really can’t find any suggestions for improvement here. In Vancouver, I’ll only stay here from now on.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Five of last six Christmases at Granville Island Hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In 2004 my daughter was back East with her dad's family for Christmas and I just couldn't stomach the idea of spending another holiday with my then-significant other's nice but guarded family in an overheated home where conversation never goes deeper than discussion of recipes, jobs and weather. So I declared that I was taking the dog and going away for the holiday. My then-love was invited, of course, but he decided to stay home and fulfill his obligation to his family of origin. We had shared a home for over 6 years at this point, so the loyalty to family surprised me a bit but I got over it at this lovely get-away. I discovered the fantastic European-influenced, waterfront, dog-friendly Granville Island Hotel and have been back every year for Christmas Eve through Boxing Day ever since (with one exception.) I make my reservations in August, typically. I arrive early in the day on Christmas Eve to be sure to have plenty of time for the market and other fun shops on the island before they close for the holiday. It's such a wonderful experience! The staff has always been really great -- and I especially love their friendliness and sometimes cheeky humor (or maybe I love that they put up with mine.) I've stayed in a number of different rooms and though I have my favorite I have been quite comfortable in each and every one of them. The marble tile floors in the rooms make for easy management of the pet-friendly policy, so I don't mark this hotel down for that as some other reviewers have mentioned. I love having the restaurant (with their own brewery!) right on the property and have had several dinners there. Last year (2007) was the first time I tried the Christmas-morning brunch. What a treat!! It was amazing! They served everything from made-to-order Eggs Benedict to fruit and pastries to salmon and bacon and fresh-made waffles and... When the holiday routine takes it toll, take your break at the Granville. I'll see you dockside. -Elaine</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Excellent Value and Service!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">DATE: October 21, 2005; October 28-30, 2005 Initially stayed for one night at the Granville Island Hotel when we first arrived in Vancouver. Drove to Whistler and spent a week there. Returning to Vancouver we returned to the Granville Island Hotel for the remainder of our trip. We found this charming hotel to be more than we anticipated. The staff was consistently warm and friendly and above all very servicing. The rooms in the section away from the Front Desk by the banquet rooms seemed larger than those in the wing closer to the Front Desk. The bathrooms in the newer section had more counter space to place personal toiletries. That aside, the rooms were very clean and provided all the amenities needed to help make our stay quite comfortable. Hairdryers were provided along with lighted magnifying make-up mirrors (we found in the larger rooms). The mini bar was stocked sufficiently with a wide variety of refreshments and snacks. The Front Desk staff went out of their way to provide excellent directions along with helpful driving tips. The Dockside Restaurant has a beautiful view of the waterfront and the ambiance was warm and contemporary. The food and service were outstanding. What a great plus to have a class-act restaurant located within the hotel. Loved how this hotel is centrally located within Granville Island which made it convenient to walk to nearby art galleries, restaurants, shops and the famous Public Market. Driving to Yaletown, North Vancouver, Stanley Park and other surrounding attractions/destinations made it easy. The computer and printer located in the lobby for guests to use was very helpful. We used it mainly to obtain addresses and directions via Yahoo! or Google Map and simply printed the directions. Another plus was the complimentary high-speed internet access in all the rooms. Whenever we travel, my husband and I bring our laptop and check our emails daily. This also allowed us to research events and activities and various places to visit for the following day. We will DEFINITELY return to the Granville Island Hotel.</p></li>
