<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed here twice, and been very happy with it both times. It's nothing special, but it is very good for what it is. It's cheap, clean and in a good location. Most of the staff I've been in contact with have been friendly and helpful. I will probably stay here again, since a cheap and good hotel in London isn't easy to come by. Avoid the resturant though, the food is pretty bad.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Travelodge is basic but clean. not the most comfortable in the world, but the beds are big and the rooms are quiet. Great location and some of the best prices in London. This is definitely a no frills hotel though. No toiletries, and if you need a hairdryer you have to ask at reception and they lend it to you for half an hour only! So if it's comfort and accessories you're after i'd stay somewhere else.</p></li>

Breakfast is an all you can eat affair, so don't expect top quality, or choice,,,,, but it's not too bad! The location of the hotel is not good for sight seeing, but is fine if your on local business. The main let down (for me) was the 'no left luggage' policy, forcing me to lug my case to a conference.</p></li>

Hence why the bargain price .It was pretty new and very clean...tea and coffee in room. Flat screen TV and good shower....Recommend paying extra for the breakfast..£7.50 per head ...wonderful buffet 'eat all you like'...they has everything.. Convinient for Tube and pleasant staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed with our children in a family room on the 1st floor, we had no sleep the whole night, people were shouting, cars racing, horns going music on max. No double glazing or sound proofing at all we might as well have had the window open, my parents were at the front of the hotel and we were out the back and both rooms were the same for noise. We had tea, coffee and sugar sachets but no kettle to make a drink. The location is good but unless you are there for the clubs I would avoid at all cost</p></li>

Receptions is busy as well as bar and restaurant, but they do their best to help you and ...with a smile. Even food is ok if you decide to eat at the hotel. There is free internet in the lobby.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had a terrible night stay at London Central Moorgate. There was music blaring from somewhere until nearly 4am and being nearly 5 months pregnant I needed to get some sleep, which didn't happen. I was in room 216 and when I checked out I asked what the noise would have been and was informed the room was above a strip club. The receptionist was almost patronising in saying if I was not happy when I checked in I could have requested to be moved - the music was not playing at 3:30pm in the afternoon. I will NOT be staying here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Paid £59 in advance and wouldn't want to pay any more. Although new it is very basic. No telephone in room, no toiletries, plastic cups etc. Furniture very basic and functional. Although it was clean I certainly didn't feel like I wanted to spend any longer in the room than I had to. Originally given a room on the top floor which was noisy due to air con units on roof but was moved no problem. The staff were good. Not the best part of London but handy for the tube and buses and the city. Would have a look around before booking this place again but would do so if stuck.</p></li>

Whilst checking in saw another guest come down and ask for a towel as there was none in her room: on arrival in my room, there was not one there either, so it was back down to reception to get one. Location is excellent, just a few minutes walk from Old Street and Moorgate underground stations, and not much further to Liverpool Street station for main line trains. It pays to ask for a room at the end of a corridor, as sometimes there can be a bit of noise at weekends from other guests returning from one of the many clubs in the area.</p></li>

By definition, it's a no-frills arrangement but it was clean and comfortable with a nice bed and bathroom. The restaurant is decent enough and the bar is reasonably-priced. There are some nice restaurants nearby and it's very near to both Old Street and Moorgate tube stations, so the locations is excellent. The only real drawback was that the hair-dryer was difficult to get hold of, which was a real inconvenience to my girlfriend, but if you're prepared to bring your own, and of course, your own soap, shampoo etc., then it's not a bad place to stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Travelodge on City Road is fairly good hotel. Its centrally located and close to the Moorgate Tube Station which makes it convinient to get around London and its surrounds. The room amenities are comfortable and not overly fancy, but the rooms are clean and welcoming. There is a restaurant and bar downstairs which offers a decent menu and the buffet breakfast was wonderful. There aren't many bars or resturants in the immediate area, so its a good amenity to have if you're arriving rather late. The only real issue I had with this hotel was the extreme slowness of the elevators. There is a bank of three, but they take forever to show up.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this Travelodge for 4 nights in early March. The room was clean and spacious. The location was pretty good. BUT the noise level was AWFUL....we stayed in a family room on the 1st floor (room 149....I think). All 4 nights, people were outside our window smoking and talking until well passed 3am.....our room faced an alley in the back of the building. It was also the last room down the hall, as a result we could hear people next door walking up and down a metal staircase all night long. We talked to a girl at the front desk but she was not helpful. I would recommend a room in the upper stories and not at the end of the hallway and earplugs.....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Travelodge on City Road for 3 nights (Friday to Monday) in late October 2008. Travelodge was new, clean and what you would expect for the standard of the accommodation. The bar/cafe on site was fine. Breakfast £7.50 and kids 15 and under free with an adult. The location is not central in London but we new this and the underground is only a short walk. The only problem with the hotel is the noise. We faced City Road on the 3rd floor above the bus stop. The noise was irritating with the window closed and was unbearable when opened. If you intend staying in the summer beware as their is no air condition and you would need to sleep with the window open!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You can't expect too much can you, not for £85 a night in the City of London. Well actually I think you can, certainly more than this. It is the hotel equivalent of RyanAir. Everything is pared to the bone, everything of the cheapest quality. On the up side, it's clean and it's much better than being on the street. The shower worked, the bed seemed okay. But does a bed for the night HAVE to be quite so dispiriting as this? And for heavens sake, get some double glazing that actually keeps the sound down. The traffic outside keeps up pretty much all night long I'm afraid, and you'll hear every grinding gear and revving engine note. A miserable place. Stay here only if you have to.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked two nights for a good price and thats where the positives end. The room is standard travelodge a bit like a hospital room; cold, clinical and sparse. You wouldnt want to spend any time in it just ok to sleep in. The staff were aweful especially Rafal who 'conned' us out of £10 to check in 30 minutes early then checked everyone else in 15 minutes later. I complained to him but he didnt want to know and was aggressive. He also gave me other quests details on the back of a receipt using 'recycled' paper, so watch your details here. I have since complained to travelodge who were not interested and passed it onto his line manager but she has sided with him, suprise. One to forget.</p></li>

There's a bus stop outside - and it's easy to get to lots of other places by buses and underground within easy walking distance. My room was of good size and clean - though totally without character. Breakfast (book ahead online if you can: it's cheaper) is fine but time things carefully if you don't want queues. Dinner, too, is cheap and cheerful, cheaper and cheerfuller if you book beforehand online. I stayed in Central London for two nights, dinner bed and breakfast, one person, for about £85 in all.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked 2 family rooms for half term and we were pleased with the accommodation. Cheap, clean, friendly staff and as we were out in London all day it was just somewhere to sleep. The only downside was that we had to go down to reception to collect extra bedding towels pillows for the children as they weren't in the room even though the booking was for family rooms. We thought the breakfast seemed quite expensive at £7.50 so we went next door to EAT for tasty porridge and hot breakfast sandwiches!Very convenient for the underground - 2 stations only a short walk away. Our room over looked City Road and apart from a little traffic noise it was quiet enough and it didn't stop us sleeping.</p></li>

Hotel was extremely hot and the room was unbearable with the heat as no air con in rooms. Our room was at the back of the hotel and was very very noisy, there were lorries late into the night and early in the morning (6am of 3 mornings we were there) so made it hard to sleep. Staff could barely speak english in reception or restaurant. Breakfast was very busy and hard to get a table, when we did get a table they were always running out of things, glasses, bread, forks, bacon...to name a few. On the plus side it was only a 3-4 minute walk from tube station and there was a tesco express next door.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a new Travelodge and has all the facilities that you'd need for a stay in London with no frills. Staff very friendly and helpful and Bar / Restaurant, vending , machines in site. Despite other reviews regarding noise we found it fine even with 3 hen parties staying there. Quite quiet at night as the area's restaurants and bars serve mostly city workers but there was a good tube service 5 mins walk at Moorgate. Tesco is next door and Boots, Sainsburys and a variety of cafes and sandwich shops are close by. Rooms basic but very clean and tidy. Only slight drawback was lack of air conditioning or fan in room which was slightly uncomfortable with temperatures reaching 25 - 27C. Would certainly return.</p></li>

Clive also looked after a bag for me, which although not strictly company policy, showed compassion and reflected well on the Travelodge.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First impression was the spartan reception. The chap in the queue before me at the desk was complaining that his room had no toilet rolls, towels, tea or milk - oh dear! That said, checked in swiftly, room was spartan but perfectly comfortable. For a city hotel managed a very quiet night which was unexpected. The lifts were very hit and miss, you have to allow an extra five minutes to your journey!! I did ask to borrow a hairdryer and for a wake up call, to be told this service not available, and could I return the hairdryer in 45 minutes! So, just need to be prepared. Breakfast was ample and adequate and the staff were all pleasant. All in all, you get what you pay for. Suited the needs of the day and was comfortable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had booked with totalstay.com, and like the man who tried to check-in before me- there was no 'in house' method of finding our bookings- I had to wait 40 minutes (hint- offer me a free cup of tea- it's not difficult). I had booked and paid for bed and breakfast, but had to ask for a breakfast voucher. I wish I hadn't- was that really orange juice? Never ! Beans- cold. Toast?-warm (ish bread). I wasn't brave enoughto try the coffee. The bed was soft and spongy and generally not good. TV and digital radio with a choice of radio1/25 and talksport- how about radio 4 for the adults? Toilet seat held together by white gaffer tape. How crap is that? Buy a new one at a hardware shop! I've stayed here before, it'sa great location, but i won't be back in a hurry.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I last reviewed this in Nov 2007, I think this experience was a bit better. This suited us well. Reasonable prices for London (£80/night for room with breakfast for two), good enough buffet breakfast, close to Barbican centre and Liverpool St. Station. They gave us a room on the fifth floor facing the interior courtyard which was quiet enough for us. I opened the window a bit for more air but there is fan noise from outside. They do not hold luggage so bear in mind the extra £8.50 per item to store cases in Liverpool St. Station. They provide 512K wifi in the cafe, which suits fine for email or browsing for events on in London. If you want video conferencing or large email documents for work, you can pay for premium access in your room. That's a fair compromise.</p></li>

Most importantly, room was nice and spacious and clean and towels were changed daily. Didn't have the £8 breakfast, we went to the Wetherspoons on Old Sreet, a 3 minute walk away. Great transport links, Old Street and Moorgate tube stations are a two minute walk along the same road in opposite directions but we got the buses more, plenty use City road and the 205 from Euston stops right outside the hotel door. We bought the travelcards from the tube station for £6.60 which gave unlimted travel for the day...Tesco express a few doors up and a sainsbury local further up as well as subway and cafe nero less than a minute away. Would stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fairly new Travelodge, so the rooms were nice & clean. We found it to be a good location, near Old Street, Moorgate and Liverpool St stations, so very near the Tube if you needed it. At weekends the area is very quiet, so you won't find many shops open, but the hotel has its own bar and there are a couple of coffee shops and a Subway close by. We did find that the hotel bar ran out of basics such as red wine by early evening though! The area is quiet at night and we didn't get any hassle when walking to and from the tube stations. We would definitely stay here again as it is a lot cheaper than staying at a Travelodge more centrally located such as Covent Garden, yet it is still in the centre of London. You have to book online though - they refuse to accept people walking in off the street.</p></li>

The room was cold and the radiator did not serve its purpose even on max the room was never 'temperature comfortable'. The room also had the following faults; The security lock on the window was broken allowing the window to be fully opened not good if you have a minor. There was no glass in the peephole in the door therefore allowing anybody to place anything through the door via the hole. The water pressure in the shower was low and the water even on high was luke warm. The shower had 2 parts misplaced, easily water went on the floor. The faults were noted and given to the reception upon departure so hopefully they can fix things before the next customer checks in.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I think we paid about £35 for our double room at this hotel, which is fantastically cheap given the really good location. The hotel is very close to Old Street station and only slightly further from Moorgate station, so it's easy to get to everywhere. There's nothing special about this place, but it's very clean and modern. The mattress, duvet and pillows are a bit too thin really, but it's OK for one night. The hot water seemed to get switched off at night, which was a pain because we didn't get back from the show we went to see until midnight. On the plus side the room was pretty large and quiet, and the guy at the bar happily made us pizza even though it was well past the time they serve food until. All in all this is a very basic, no frills hotel in the centre of London for £35 and I was happy with that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is very near most points of interests in London. A 10 minute walk and you are in Liverpool Street Station which is the Central Line to Oxford CIrcus and trains to/from Stansted. It can be a longer commute from Heathrow and Gatwick, but if you are looking for rooms that are clean, big rooms, with a 24 hours bar and restaurant and infront of a bus stop, then this is the place. Tesco express is just 2 blocks, M & S is just around and corner and good restaurants within a 10 mile radius. What's more, you have your own bathroom instead of paying GBP 50 for a shared facilities. Rooms can accommodate up to 4 pax on the same price. Put your email in their maling list and you will get news on sales atleast 2 weeks before. The staff are good and helpful and lady at the bar was very friendly. I will definitely come back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at 2 travelodges in London and they both offered exactly as promised. The room was warm, (despite freezing temperatures outside) quiet, clean and more than adequate. We had 3 pillows and only one bath towel I asked at reception and was given extra and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Tesco, almost next door, was useful for our breakfast. The bus outside took us to Monument where we could easily get to most attractions. Our other travelodge was at Tower Bridge and we preferred the location there. I did find the area round City Road quiet when walking home after a show (11pm) and I was glad not to be on my own. As we got the rooms at a very special offer price of £12 we were delighted with our stay and I would be happy to stay there again and pay more. Don't expect luxuries in a travelodge, it is a budget hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is ideally centrally located with a bus stop just outside with frequent buses to all places frequently visited by tourists to London. There are 2 underground train stations conveniently located down the road in opposite directions.

All conveniences were available in the room including hair dryer, iron, wi-fi, TV, coffee and tea The hotel is very safe and secure. The staff were very courteous and the check in very quick. The breakfast was sumptuous but the menu was fixed through the week. The hotel is extreme value for money. Breakfast is free for children, and milk is available free of charge for children at any time. There are a few eateries with varied cuisine just next to the hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Standard travelodge offering good prices for London. There is a night club right next to the hotel, so if you are unlucky and a light sleeper you may have problems sleeping. I have stayed here twice this year. The first time was on a Sunday night for which I paid £20, I was out for most of the night, so no complaints apart from having to go down and request some towels. The second night I stayed on a Monday night for £80, and spent most of the evening in the room. I didn't enjoy this much as there were only six working tv channels, (no channel 5!). Spending a lot of time in one of these rooms, you do notice things like no pictures on the walls, and just how sparsely furnished these places are. I paid for breakfast on both stays, and whilst it is all you can eat, the quality of the food is quite poor, and I would recommend getting breakfast elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and my partner spent two nights here recently and weren't too impressed with the hotel, check in was fine using the touch screen facilities, and we were in our room 5 mins later. The room on the first floor(157) was clean and adequate. Our first night sleep wasn't too bad with the windows closed, although it did get a little hot and stuffy in the room, the second night we had the windows open and the noise from the traffic was extremely loud and disturbing. On top of this the mattress was like a sponge and really springy. As for the location we found it excellent, only 5 mins walk from Old Street and Moorgate tube station on the northern line and a bus stop directly outside, also next door to a tesco express. I would recommend this hotel for location only, and not because of comfort. We did not have breakfast or use the restaurant so cannot comment on these.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We paid £15 for the hotel, and found it great - just what we needed! The room was really modern and new. Had wifi and nice flat screen TV, nice big double bed (extra sheets, blankets and pillows in the cupboard - which were needed as the sheets and pillows were pretty thin!) The staff were friendly. Check-in was quick and easy. We had the buffet breakfast - good choice! There was plenty of great English breakfast food to choose, as well as a selection of the contential breakfast choice. The restaurant area was clean and new The location was good - as it was in the City, it was pretty much dead at night so there was no outside noice. But good transport links to get around Parking was a bit hint and miss - there was a local NCP but i wouldn't be paying there prices! Parked on the side road, and thankfully no ticket in the morning! Bargain price... for a good nights stay</p></li>

The hotel is easily missed unless your looking for it from the outside. it is a 5min walk to the tube station. There are a few restaurants around the hotel, i recommend the curry place accross the road they do a great chicken korma. the hotel has a bar and somewhere to eat as well as vending machines for drinks and snacks. there are also a few computers to access the internet at a cost but they were constantly busy the whole 3 days i spent there. The rooms are very basic, cream walls, desk, shelves, a very odd chair but it was very clean i must say. not a very good view out of the window unless u like looking at other people in their rooms and others looking at you.

The breakfast was plentiful and was being restocked with hot food every couple of minutes. The reception staff were helpful and courteous. Having stayed several times at the Park Plaza, County Hall I now know what a rip off their prices are! I will be going back as it is so near to Old Street and Moorgate underground stations, making it ideal to travel around London.

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is all all about budget prices in a great location and it lives up to expectations. The hotel is 5 mins walk from Moorgate tube and provides easy access to 'The City' financial district of London. In the immediate area is a Tesco Express supermarket, Starbucks and Subway as well as pubs and restaurants. The hotel itself is typical Travelodge - cheap, budget accommodation on a no frills basis. The rooms are basic, but clean and breakfast is a hot and cold buffet. My room was in the centre of the hotel overlooking the dining room, so I was not disturbed by London traffic. I had no need to interact with staff that much, so cannot really comment - but they seemed friendly and polite. The automated self check-in was surprisingly easy and very convenient given how busy the hotel is. So if you're prepared to put up with some of the clientele that can frequent a Travelodge, then this is a pretty good choice overall.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed in this travelodge many times, cause its very conveneient for me with work, if I can't be bothered to commute. Due to the bad weather, I stayed up in london and had paid £39 (in advance) for the room so can't complain at the price. It is one of the newest travelodges in London and it is nice and clean. If you stay on the 1st floor and your room is to the front, it can be very noisy as there are about 3 bus stops right outside the window, and you can hear everything. Some of the windows don't shut properly so it's hard to get ot sleep, and then you are woken up in the morning (early). There is a also a gentelemans bar next door so sometimes you can hear the music. You are better off with a room at the back of the hotel and 3rd floor or above. It is a good location for the "CITY". Liverpool street 10 mins walk, moorgate of City Road (3-4 minutes walk). This Travelodge isn't luxury but nice, clean & simple rooms.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at this hotel a few times now as it is in a very convenient location for my venue when I am travelling for business. The room was clean and quite spacious, being a corner room it was a bit of an odd shape, but had windows to the front and side. Being at the front of the building and on the second floor I was a bit worried about traffic noise, but I needn't have been as it didn't bother me at all. The temperature was ok, neither too warm or too cold. There was no bath, only a shower and the shower tray did not drain very well, leaving me standing up to my ankles in water and worried about flooding. When I returned to the bathroom an hour later the water was still draining, think the drains need a good clean. Out of three lifts, only two were working, so it took a while to leave in the morning as the lift was full by the time it got down to the 2nd floor. All in all, an ok, unmemorable stay, but good enough if you are just spending a night here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I first stayed there in June 08 and then booked another for July because I really liked the hotel the first time. It is a bit noisy, as there is clubs right outside the hotel but I could still sleep. It was a bit hot there since there is no aircondition in the room and there is a limit of how much you can open the window due to safety. Which in my opinion should be removed cos it was so hot. The staff was nice, the cleaning lady's were all polite and did their job. I asked if I could get more pillows and there was no problem. I even ordered food from downstairs quite few times and it was alright. I didn't really like the breakfast buffè tho, because to me, they couldnt offer much. But I had it included in my stay so I didnt loose any money on that. They also have internet downstairs (£1 for 10 min) which was nice to have. I think the location of the hotel is great, as there is stores, starbucks, restaurants, busses and the tube nearby. I would absolutely book there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose the Travelodge in City Road for three reasons: As it was a Travelodge, I generally felt I knew what to expect, it was very competitively priced and it was located close to where I needed to be in London. I was not disappointed on any count. The reception staff were friendly and helpful at all times. I had a large room on the fourth floor, on the back of the building with a clean bathroom, hot water and a comfortable bed with crisp clean sheets. The towels were lovely and soft, too. I have one regret: from reading previous reviews I meant to take my earplugs, but forgot...I wished I hadn't, as it was noisy at night. Not the hotel's fault - it has double glazing, but it's in the heart of the city and with the location comes the expected noise or sirens, traffic and life in general. The only negative to note is that I tried to check in early (12 o'clock) rather than after the stated 3pm time, and was told I'd had to pay an extra £10 to do this....I came back later on!</p></li>

The staff were bordering on the aggressive and refused to check us in to the three rooms until 3. As a "gesture of goodwill" they checked us into 1 room until the other 2 were ready. There was no activity in that hour on the remaining 2 rooms leaving me to believe they just didn't want to . THE CUSTOMER SERVICE AT THIS HOTEL IS APPALLING. The room contained 1 kettle, 1 towel, 2 cups a TV, bed , chair and nothing else. The corridor came alive at 4.00am and died down at 5.30am, you can't ring reception as there is no phone! Hairs in the shower tray. Yuck! Great location but please do not stay here , a youth hostel would be more accomodating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed a weekend in early July, arriving Friday afternoon and leaving Sunday morning. This travelodge is clean, not a bit shabby and the staff were all very helpful and friendly. It's well located and close to 2 tube stations. Our room was spotless with a shower, flat screen TV and very, very comfy bed and pillows. It was quiet, but we were at the inner (if you see what I mean) of the hotel rather than on the front. Plenty of pubs, bars and restaurants close by, and around a 10 minute walk to London Bridge. Long tube trip to Wembley (our reason for trip), but the very reasonable room rate made this worthwhile. One quibble - breakfast was not up to much, but is all you can eat, so worth it to fill up for the day! No fried eggs, though, and horrid, bland, rubbery scrambled ones. Sausages were not nice at all. Plenty of choice of cereal, fruit, youghurts and pastries. We'd certainly stay again for a trip to London as we didn't encounter any problems and the place is clean and well maintained, so good value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is quite a large Travelodge, on the edge of the City. Location is convenient, between two tube stations (Old Street and Moorgate), and with plenty of bars and restaurants close by. My room was on the inside, so no great view but it was quiet enough. It was quite basic but very clean, and everything in good condition. I had a disabled room, so the bathroom was HUGE. The corridors were very hot, but how much time do you spend in the corridor? My room was fine, and the windows opened. The bar/restaurant was very large for a Travelodge - there were plenty of people in there when I arrived, watching the England match. Breakfast was standard but good value for money if booked in advance. I didn't have much interaction with the staff as I only stayed for one night, but reception was efficient and friendly enough, and the restaurant staff also welcoming and polite. Travelodge is a basic, good value chain, especially if you get one of their deals - it's not the hotel experience of a lifetime, but it's a reasonable place to sleep!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First of all if you go to this hotel don't get the breakfast there for 7,5 pounds/person, because it is very expensive for what you get: standard english breakfast, with no cheese, no fruits, no ham, bad coffee, bad orange juice. If you arrive at certain hours, they put you to wait outside for 10-15 minutes although inside there are free tables. Anyway, the awful thing that happened was that my wife found a hair in her plate from the indian boy that cleaned the tables. We were so disgusted and we quit having breakfast there after 2 days. We got a room on 4th floor and all night we heard the hotel's air conditioners. On Saturday we heard the bass from the club nearby. The pillows were very soft and not so comfortable. The towels were smelling like dirty feet, as I think they boiled them. The door magnetic card didn't work every time we got to the hotel, so every time I had to go back to the reception being tired after my trips. We thought Ibis was lowest class, but it's a sure thing that we will never ever go to a Travelodge hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed at this hotel many times over the past 2 years and I have to say it is in a great location and great value (especially if you manage to get some of the discount rates). On this trip we paid £19 per room per night - £57 for three nights in the best city in the world. The rooms (with a couple of exceptions, usually at the end of the corridors) are spacious and clean though basic. It can be a bit noisy at certain times (there is a club at the back of the hotel) so be sure to ask for a quiet room on arrival. The staff are generally friendly but tend to be a little over worked as this is quite a sizable establishment. They are really only there to check you in - anything else you need to be self sufficient. Don’t use the bar for breakfast or other meals unless you really have too – there are much better places outside the front door. Excellent transport links are a short distance away - with Moorgate, Old Street and Liverpool Street stations all nearby. This is a no frills affair so don't book if you want hair dryers and trouser presses in the room!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">ADVANTAGES: Very cheap for a london hotel (we paid £79 a night room only for a family room). Comfortable, warm rooms with tv, tea tray and one of the best power showers I've ever had in a hotel/B&B. Excellent location, only a few minutes walk from Old Street, Moorgate and Liverpool Street Stations. There are plenty of restaurants and stores on the doorstep, although being the commercial district, some of the shops don't open on a weekend which wasn't really a problem for us. There was a restaurant and bar on the ground floor, and although didn't have breakfast at the hotel, it was only £7.50 for all-you-can-eat buffet breakfast. DISADVANTAGES: Very small basic rooms, but there were three of us and we knew in advance that we were getting what we paid for. Our room was above a bar or club which was slighly annoying but I daresay if you requested a quiet room they would do their best to assist you. This travelodge was excellent value for money, fantastic location. We weren't expecting the Ritz and it was a nice comfortable room to come back to after a day of sightseeing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As we was spending only one night in London we didnt wish to break the bank and plumbed for this hotel asit was near to the location we were visiting. The hotel is within walking distance of two tube stations one minutes from the main kings cross station. It was clean and tidy and looked like it had just been painted, our room situated at the rear of the hotel was clean and tidy with generla mod cons however there was two of us and only one towel which seems to be a common theme from previous comments. This was rectified by a quick trip to reception which also provided us with extra pillows which a wafer thin. The bed although comfy the mattress had seen some hammer and sagged in the middle and seemed to be cheap and nasty but clean. The breakfast was good and provided varying variety so no grumbles at all. The Harley did drive passed at about 7.30 which was a good alarm clock and would be street noise that would be around anywhere you stayed.

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked in for three nights for work reasons. On arrival (17.30) the queue for check in was huge, massive. The auto check ins were all broken. Following a 40 min wait for someone to process my reservation I was hummed at, treated badly and generally made to feel like I was not important enough to treat with some manners. Trying to get the pre-paid meal my company had paid for was horendous, loads of waiting around, faxing gnashing of teeth and generaly poor communication. When the meal did arrive it was ok. The room itself was nice, clean and large but seemed to be very stripped even for a Travelodge. The only thing worse than the staff and lack of service was the noise, constant traffic, what sounded like trains and other racket. I have stayed in far quieter hotels than this on motorway junctions. Other things wrong, card coded for 1 day and not 3 which lead to me once again queuing for ages, some were lifts "out of service", and a dirty towell. Plus points, the breakfast was ok and the location was good for what I was doing. Overall I would not use this hotel again or recommend it to anyone I liked.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've tried several different London Travelodges based simply on what was available when booking a £26 advance rate through their web site. This time it was City Road's turn. I had a family room on the first floor. This was one of my best Travelodge experiences. The room was large, clean, well-spaced - flat-screen telly is a plus as this too saves space. All the usual amenities (coffee/tea etc) in the room plus... a BAR of SOAP! Other TLs required you to purchase these from machines in the lobby. I quite liked the area - mostly new office blocks and banks, generally very clean, not much activity at night. Pret and a curry place within easy walking distance, also M&S for juice, sandwiches, lunchtime shopping. A few other convenience stores near Moorgate tube station as well (which I found to be more convenient than Old Street). Also there is a Southbound bus stand DIRECTLY OUTSIDE the hotel door, Northbound a short walk away - easy, direct connections to Liverpool Street station as well as King's Cross. Noise can happen anywhere when you least expect it - pack ear plugs no matter where you're planning to stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For no frills this place is in a great location – Old Street station at one end and Moorgate (with access to other underground lines other than the Northern Line) at the other. You get what you pay for – basic accommodation, tv and tea/coffee. If you want luxury go elsewhere and pay for it. We were hardly in the room and it was perfectly adequate for what we needed – a room to sleep in. Bed was comfortable, pillows nice, plenty of very hot water, a heater that could be turned off (I don’t like the heat) and a window that could be opened. We were on the road side of the hotel (our choice) but a word of warning, you can hear the traffic outside and at busy times it is constant. Breakfast is buffet style – we only had one as we went to My Old Dutch at High Street Kensington for pancakes (see other review) on the other morning. There is a bus stop right outside which serves Liverpool Street and Waterloo stations. There are also loads of coffee shops on City Road and a Tesco Metro and a Sainsburys to the right of the hotel going up to Old Street Station. All in all a good experience at this Travelodge and I would use again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have just returned from staying 3 nights at this travelodge on city road. Everything about my stay was good, the room was clean and warm the bathroom and shower area were spotless and they had a nice plasma tv in the room. The buffet Breakfast was quite good with a selection of 6 hot items,cereal,yogurts,bread and muffins as well as fruit juice and tea and coffee. Previous posters have mentioned the disco bar behind the hotel but we didnt hear anything from the bar and it was right opposite the room, i even wonder if it was open as i could see or hear nothing. The location is very good, we had 2 tube stations nearby,Moorgate to the left and Old Street to the right with the latter being only slightly closer. Both stations are on the northern line and we went up a few stations to Kings Cross which was dissected by 3 or 4 other lines meaning we could travel to all the tube stations in the tourist areas. We paid £96 for a double for 3 nights and £40 for 3 buffett breakfasts each which included %10 off for booking it online so for me it defo was a budget break which isnt always easy to find in London. Will stay here again for sure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Myself and 2 other 'people' stayed for 1 night only and what a treat it was. We checked in via a machine near the front desk but unfortunately it was too complicated for us to work out so had to queue at the reception and speak to a gorgeous young lady named 'Kinga' - she was not the one from Big Brother, wine bottle etc. We then went out for a couple of drinks and came back to find the room so hot that we were left with no option but to open a window and take all our clothes off. Fighting, spitting and a lack of hangers for our pants didn't dampen the mood though and we were quite pleased with the tv in the room to entertain ourselves. We only had 1 towel which was a bit disappointing but we took this out on the crockery. On the plus side we comfortably managed to fit 3 of us in the shower which was quite good for a bathroom which wasn't the biggest. There was a rather sour note the next morning however when one of our party was unfortunately left behind at the hotel as he was lying on the floor crying. He cried so much that there may be a bill to replace the wet carpet where he cried. Does anyone know if you're supposed to check out?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of November 2008. On arrival I asked for a room on the top floor (7th) and not only was this ok I was advised that the front of the building may be quieter as there is a nightclub round the back. The room was clean and even smelt nice. The bed was a bit too soft for my liking but that's a minor whinge. We weren't bothered by noise, being 7 floors up probably helped with that. The location was fine for us, we've stayed in other parts of London before and wanted somewhere different this time. We used Liverpool St. tube the most (10 minute walk away) for access to the Central line, but Moorgate and Old Street are probably closer. We didn't eat there so I can't comment on the dining. My only complaint is that Travelodge really scrimp on the essentials, like towels - 1 bath/shower towel and 1 hand towel between 2 of us, 1 small bar of soap and half a toilet roll upon arrival. This was not replaced the 2nd day and on the morning of the 3rd I had to ask reception for more, which was a bit embarrassing! The staff were pleasant and friendly and for a cheap London hotel the experience was a lot better than we were expecting. We would go there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Chose this place for a one night stay in London for a theatre break. Like always Travelodge is good value compared to similar rated hotels and you know what you can expect. It was a bit of a trek to get to on the tube. Once off the tube we managed to walk the wrong way down city road but eventually found it not too far down the road the other way. So a sign would be good. The area wasn't the nicest and the building advertised on the photos isn't the one you stay in. We managed to check in quickly as we were in a rush to get to the theatre. Our room was a good size and clean. We had a TV and tea making facilities and a nice sized bed. We had no view as the window looked onto another part of the building but that was no matter to us. The window was very large though so the room was nice and light. The bathroom was a good size too but the shower seemed like a hospital shower as it just had a basin and a curtain which was a bit offputting. We weren't bothered by anyone during our stay and couldn't hear any noise from other rooms, the corridor or the road. So we had a really good nights sleep. The blinds were good at keeping the light out for a lie in. Check out was easy as we just had to give in the key.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was in London for a few days for meetings, and chose this travelodge for its location. I intially was looking at Bank but it was already fully booked. The travelodge is equidistant from Moorgate and Old Street Underground stations and is fairly straightforward to find. Check in was quick, there was a queue when I arrived so I elected to use the self check in machines. It initially allocated me a room on the first floor, which given previous reviews and personal experience I asked to be changed before I even went to the room. The new allocated room on the sixth floor was spotlessly clean, had a bath (which I wasn't expecting) and was facing the road. I didn't get any noise except when opening the window there was traffic noise. The bed was however, very soft. I'm not a fan of soft beds but did sleep okay nonetheless. As with all travelodges, you pretty much know what to expect. I really only use them to sleep anyway so don't need all the other stuff that mainstream hotels provide. The breakfast was actually okay and fairly well organised. If you can get a reasonable rate online then give it a go. It's not in the West End and and the City area is practically deserted at weekends but you can get pretty much anywhere within 20 minutes.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel for a Saturday night - we had to book at short notice so didn't benefit from the cheapest rates however it was still very good value for money and much nicer than other hotels in central London with similar rates. The hotel is very conveniently located close to both Old Street and Moorgate underground stations. I had no problems with the self-service check-in kiosks which were quick and easy to use. The room itself was spartan but perfectly clean and surprisingly large. I was in room 446 and didn't notice any road noise. Returning to the hotel late at night (about 1am) I was surprised to see a couple of burly bouncers outside the front doors but didn't see any trouble at all either inside or outside the hotel. Breakfast was manically busy (we went down at 10am) but all of the food counters were kept fully stocked and the quality and choice was very good. All in all if you don't mind a (very) basic room and the location works for you then this is a decent hotel. One slight note of caution - one of our party had their car broken into at the underground NCP close to the hotel and there were several other cars with broken windows/windscreens as well so it might be better to walk a bit further and find a more secure car park.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I agree that if you book a Travelodge you should know what to expect, as per the title of my review it was basic, very basic, but it was clean. That would usually suit me, but this place has no soul. Endless corridors of rooms. White walls, white bedding, not a picture or any colour anywhere. The bed was fine. No soap in the bathroom. Room overlooked an office block. It was quiet tho, I understand rooms at the front have alot of traffic noise and deliveries to nearby shops start about 5am. Plan in advance if you want o dry your hair as you have to get a hairdryer from reception. There were tea and coffee facilities. Maybe the rooms are deliberately bland to make you spend time in the bar ! The bar area was OK, but not somewhere I would be able to relax. Breakfast selection was good, hot food looked OK tho I didn't have any, i just had cereal and toast, the tables weren't very clean, and the dining area had a grubby feel to it. I'd be more inclined to skip breakfast at the hotel @ £7.95, there are plenty of coffee bars, and shops to pick up breakfast from The staff I encountered were all friendly enough. It wasn't a bad stay, If you book early you might feel it's good value especially for London but for the price I paid I'm sure there is better in the area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at The Travelodge City Road four (4) weekends last autumn, in September, October, November and December. I had made all the reservations at the same time, because it was cheap and very close to a College I attend in the weekends. I just hated the hotel from the first to the last stay. The only thing positive I can say is that the rooms are large, and the beds pretty good. But that's all. The smell is just awful and scary, the noice i terrible. I woke up every night I slept there, of drunk people partying in the hallways/corridor, knocking at all the doors singing, puking, fighting and making so much noise. There were no phone at the room, and it was impossible to find any way to call the reception, and I never dared leaving my room in the night to ask the people working there to take action. The reception area is very dull and the staff doesn't seem like that they have a very comfortable job. The breakfast area is like a smelly industry hall, and the breakfast is horrible, but cheap. The last night of my last stay I found another person's worn nightgown in my bed :-( . There are one small pillow, no soap or shampoo, hairdryer or any such things at the rooms, but that is also said in the hotels descriptions so it should not be a surprise i you have read all the conditions before arriving.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The only compliant i have about this hotel is the service we recieved we were travelling down from glasgow in the overnight bus so booked early check in. The purpose of our trip was for the mj concert so when they plans changed we thought we may as well go and make a weekend of it. However our weekend got off to a bad start when arriving at the travelodge at five minutes to noon we were told our room wasnt ready to go take a seat and they would call us so we sat at the over priced bar and bought a drink while we waited. As you can imagine we were desprate to get to our rooms as we had been stuck in a bus overnight however no one came near us so i went back to reception twenty minutes later the man explained the rooms not ready if you could bare with us. Then a family come in and sit for five minutes some of their friends come in explain they got here at 11.30 and have checked in and had their showers. Then the man from reception comes and gets the family who have only been their for five minutes and ignores us and gives them their room keys. As you can imagine we went straight to the man at recepetion to see what was happening with our room and he says he didnt relise we were waiting. I had been at reception three times. Bad start to our weekend and no apoligises or an offer of giving our £10 early check in money back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Like other reviewers, I also booked a room here for 26 pounds a night. If you've ever stayed in London, you know what an incredible bargain this is! I stayed for five nights and had a great stay. I had a family room, which included a large double bed and a foldout sofa. The bed was very comfortable. The room was kept spotless and the tea and coffee supplies were re-stocked every day. My room was right above the lobby, so I did encounter a bit of coming-and-going noise, but I just left the TV on at night to drown it out. I tried the breakfast one morning. It included hot items, as well as cereal, yogurt, and fruit. It wasn't bad, but it was a bit dear at 7.50. If I'd paid the normal rate of 90-100 pounds, I would expect the breakfast to be included, but for 26, I can't complain! The Marks & Spencer down the road proved invaluable. I picked up sandwiches, snacks, and drinks there and kept them in the room to save a bit of money on eating. There are also a few coffee chains and pubs on the road, though otherwise, it's fairly quiet. The hotel is situated between Old Street and Moorgate tubes, so it's really handy to catch trains on either the Northern, Circle, District, or Hammersmith & City lines. Buses also stop right outside the hotel, and it's very easy to catch a cab on City Road. I would definitely stay here again. As long as you're not looking for anything fancy, this hotel is perfect!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Check in and reception were efficient and friendly, although was not asked if I wanted breakfast so had to be done via a separate transaction. Next morning the breakfast staff had no record of me paying for breakfast but luckily I had the receipt in my pocket to prove I had paid! The lift are and corridors were really hot and stuffy. The room I was allocated on the 4th floor was quite large with a window overlooking the central attrium of the building - a bit grim. This window that opened about 6 inches was the only source of ventilation in the room - which was quite warm! Decor can best be descibed as basic and functional.. The flat screen TV had the basic freeview channels but the picture quality was not that good.TV alarm function didn't seem to work so had to rely on the alarm on my mobile in the morning. Bathroom was small with just a shower. The towels were just hanging on a hook on the back of the bathroom door - I really wondered if they had in fact been changed! But they did smell fresh and clean. The shower in the morning stayed warm for about 2 minutes before going cold! Breakfast was OK with limited choice. Orange juice from the machine was only slightly better than orange squash. Hot buffet choice was limted to bacon, sausage, beans and scrambled egg. At 7:15am the breakfast room was not very busy, bit I saw signs that hinted you should be prepared for a wait later in the morning.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We paid £29 a night for a family room. Basic clean room, with crisp white sheets and a decent bathroom. No frills attached, but in reality we didn't need any. Staying in central London for this price is a real bargain. I would expect breakfast to be included had we paid the full rate, but at £29 who can complain? Extra pillows and a hairdryer were supplied on demand. We stayed with friends who were just as pleased as we were. Breakfast was at £6.75(including a 10% online discount) and included a cooked English and a continental breakfast. Acceptable fare to start the day. Never waited much to be seated. Having said this, our stay was not without the occasional glitch - that's why I knocked off a star. Our last day booking was the source of a mixup at the reception desk. Cleared only after 5 visits to our room - annoying. One of our friends' rooms was not ready for check in despite having paid the £10 early check in fee. Had to wait for almost an hour to have the key to this room. One last moan about Travelodge's website. We had originally booked the room for £26 a night. When Travelodge started offering the facility to check in early for £10, we decided to take the offer. However at this point we were charged an extra £3 a night for every room without pre-advice besides the £10 early check in fee. I wrote to Travelodge but after a month I'm still with no reply. Unfair, possibly illegal and leaves a bad taste. Otherwise, all in all, it was a pleasant stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed with my partner, booked in advance during a sale and got the room for £15 so clearly I thought it was excellent value for money. After reading the reviews I was worried about this hotel, however I was very pleased. The reception area was the biggest and brightest I'd seen, and I've stayed in a few of these Travelodges, they even had complimentary iced water in glasses. The receptionist was very polite and welcoming. Our room was on the fourth floor. I was very pleased to find we had been given a double room with shower and a bath. The room was large with a double bed settee under the window which was great to lounge on. The actual bed was very comfortable too. We had the buffet breakfast in the morning, excellent value, and a very spacious modern dining area. Lots of choices of food. The waitress who seated us was very pleasant as well. The only negative thing I can say, and I'd have to be forced at gun point to think of anything, is that the hotel was quite warm, especially in corridors by the lift, but again, how much time do you actually spend there? The traffic outside was quite noisey with the window open, but not too bad in the early hours while you are sleeping obviously. Also the location isn't that good because there's not much going on in the immediate area, but its only 5 mins walk to Old St tube, or you could walk to town as I did in The evening back to the hotel, took me half an hour. You'll need the exercise to burn off that breakfast.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay at the Travelodge City Road was for 10 nights in mid-April. As there were three adults we booked a family room which we found to be quite roomy with two in the double bed and the third on the pull out sofa. The room was very clean and beds were comfortable, if a little softer than I prefer. We were able to store our extra clothing on the shelves that are part of the closet (doorless) unit since there are no dressers. We were on the sixth floor facing City Road and were not bothered by any street noise. I had emailed in advance and requested a room in a quiet section of the hotel. The bath/shower was excellent with good water pressure. The only plumbing problem was that the loo needed to "rest" and couldn't be flushed two consecutive times. We did not try the breakfast buffet but did have coffee and muffins at the attached Coffee Republic and at EAT right next door. We had a few "in room picnics" with take away we got at the M&S two blocks away or from Liverpool station which was about a 10 minute walk. The bus service is great with a stop right outside the door for busses headed to Liverpool Station or toward St. Paul's. The northern bus stop is across the street and about a block north where you can catch busses to King's Cross or the #205 goes all the way to Paddington Station. While not in the most preferable area of London, I would stay again for the bargain rate we received. If you are looking for a clean hotel and can get the discounted rate, don't hesitate to book at the Travelodge City Road.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In february my son and I stayed in the London Lodge hotel, which was very pleasant. For this trip we needed a threebed-room because now my husband joined us.But they didn't seem to have familyrooms. After reading a lot on the TALF I decided to book a room at the TL City Road hotel. The rate was very low : 177 pounds for three nights in a family room with three beds, breakfast included. I booked through the travelodgewebsite a saver room well in advance. I didn't know what to expect. Then the reviews of TL City Road started to get worse! Oh, what have I done! When we left the underground (Moorgate) we saw the hotel. It looked very nice from the outside. It is about a 5 minutes walk to the hotel. The reception looked nice. Check in went very quickly. We got room 314 whick is facing City Road. When I looked out of the window I couldn't believe my eyes. I saw a castle! I posted a photo of the view from our window. It wasn't a castle though, but the headquartiers of the royal infantery. I have had worse views from a hotelwindow. The room was big with a double bed and a sleep-sofa. The room was spotless, as was the bathroom. There was a flatscreen tv and an electric kettle with coffee and tea. The beds and the sofabed were good. We had duvets. The room has double glazing, but you could hear some streetnoise, but it wasn't stressful. We slept very good. The breakfast room is also nice. They provided a full english breakfast and croissants, muffins, cereals. I would certainly stay here again! They provided much more than you would expect for this money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The most souless travelodge i've stayed in -furnishings are in pretty good condition but its all very bleak and institutional. We were given one bath towel and one hand towel between 2 -the cleaner was trying her best with very poor English skills but managed to get it sorted after some misunderstandings We had to ask specially for a do not disturb sign Bathroom spotless, clean sheets , only 3 pillows one room was a 'family room' which was a double bed plus a sort of couch thing - with one single bed under the other - my nearly 6ft teenager slept on one of the singles and said it was quite comfortable We had some keycard issues but at least we could get into the hotel as we had booked a separate room for our teenagers. There are plenty of food options on the street - Nero, EAT, pret a manger, a tesco mini supermarket and marks and spencers food hall and other places near by so we did not use the in-house restaurant. My family thought EAT's porridge was good value for money The Museum of London is close by [10-15mins walk] and definitely well worth a visit., My teenagers enjoyed it much more than the British museum. Tube stations and bus stops are close but we mostly used taxis as one of us has mobility issues - for 4 folk and a bit of forward planning we spent a bit less on taxis overall than we would have spent on travelcards for the tube/buses We were heading back to stansted for our flights so we used the Terravison coach from finsbury square -less than 5 mins walk. We got sale rooms so paid 32pounds per room per night-we would recommend or stay again at this hotel at the bargain rate but not at the full price</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Disappointing”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and my partner stayed for 3 nights at the London City Road Travelodge in June '08. Overall I would say I was disappointed with the stay for various reasons, which I will briefly outline below. We stayed on the first floor, and the noise at night was terrible. The website at the time of booking advised of the nightclub noise, which I will admit we heard none of, but failed to mention that it is on a major bus route (it now does mention this on the new website). The "double glazing" was awful, and after conducting a test, I can assure you that there was no noticeable difference in noise between the window being open and closed! Pretty poor for someone on such a main road, even if it is a budget hotel. The second disappointment was the attitude of one particular member of staff. I would like to start here by saying that all subsequent members of staff we dealt with were polite and courteous, however, the first impression we got was awful. We tried to check in early, but having not booked this, were were not surprised when there was nothing available. However, the attitude of the staff member was disgraceful - she basically told us to get out of the hotel and not come back until 3. When i asked if I could leave my luggage, I was told in no uncertain terms that I couldn't. Although i was annoyed at this, I understand it is Travelodge policy, but i did not need to be told this so rudely. The hotel was cheap, so I suppose in one way i shouldnt complain, but neither me nor my girlfriend got much sleep in 3 nights due to the traffic noise. All i would say is that if you are thinking of staying, try to get a room on one of the top floors, and possibly at the back of the hotel as well, maybe it's a bit quieter there!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me & my boyfriend stayed here for 1 night on 10th August, we had booked in advance and it cost us £32 - we had originally booked this for after a Michael Jackson concert, as it was non refundable we decided to go anyway. We have stayed in many travelodges and this hotel was the usual Travelodge standard, though I must say the staff were some of the most polite & helpful we have come across. The hotel has a very large bar and restaurant area which is also a Costa Coffee. We had a night cap and the prices of the alcohol were more than reasonable, in the bar area there are also 3 computers wired up like an internet cafe - £1 for 20mins browsing, which is a good idea in my opinion. Also 3 or 4 vending machines in the reception area. I would 100% agree with others, the corridors & lifts are absolutely ROASTING, its like being in a sauna and isnt very pleasant. The room itself was quite warm but the window did open. We were at the front of the hotel and the road is very nosey but with the window shut at night its fine. Great location, short walk from Moorgate station, again - would agree with others and suggest you avoid Old Street station as its not very nice. There are plenty of restaurants, cafes and a few shops and a Tesco exress right next door to the hotel. If you stay midweek you will find the area quite busy as its in one of the banking districts. Overall we had a pleasant stay and the location is convenient and cheap for central London, we headed down to the river by the TATE and had a lovely meal at "The Real Greek" - highly recommend. There is a NCP car park next to the hotel but its pricey and we say homeless people sleeping in the entrance (which is norm for London), so train is much easier and convenient.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel for two nights for a grand total of £70. When you pay that little to stay near enough to the centre of London - I don't think there's really any room for complaint!! I found the check in staff adequate. There was generally a wait in order to speak to someone, but any queries that I had were resolved quickly. We arrived not long after 12 and requested an early check in for £10. We were allocated a room quickly and sent on our way - great start. The room was fresh, bright and clean - and liked the fact that the tv had the freeview channels. As has been mentioned previously, City Road is extremely busy. If you are a light sleeper and/or partial to a moan, I would recommend requesting a room at the back of the hotel or rather dig deeper in your pockets and stay elsewhere. We were on the first floor looking out on City Road (so coudn't really have been any closer to street traffic unless we pitched a tent on the pavement) and I can honestly say that that the noise did not bother us one bit and we slept soundly both nights. Yes you can hear the traffic, and I heard a cheeky little ambulance siren at 11pm one night, but hello, you're in the centre of London. One thing I found odd was that on a Sunday, everything near the hotel is closed - even Marks and Spencer and local restaurants. It was like a ghost town but as it's the City district there is very little going on out of business hours. Overall, I would recommend this travelodge if you get a good deal like we did. You really can't - and shouldn't - complain considering how inexpensive it is. It's a little bit better than no frills accommodation with a comfy bed. Like someone said before, the worst part of the hotel was some of the other guests, and their attitudes...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got an extremely low price for the room, £12, in an advance sale offer from Travelodge. For this price you really don't expect much! We liked this Travelodge. It's a bit of a walk from Old Street station (along City Road) but there are two different bus lines from King's Cross railway station which stop more or less outside of the hotel, and we found this more convenient for travelling to KX with luggage then negotiating the Tube. The room was clean and surprisingly large with a television, kettle/tea/coffee, hangers for clothes... and that's about it! A confusion about the number of people staying in the room (2 of us, though the reservation only was for 1) meant we received an entire set of extra bedding. I'm still not sure why, but it was handy as it meant we had twice the number of pillows and towels. The pillows were quite thin, so the extra set was a bonus. The view from the window was, well, other rooms and the roof of the restaurant. There was little to no noise from outside when the window was closed. The price is room only, and extras such as toiletries (other than a bar of soap), internet access, early check in/out and luggage storage after checkout, which are typically included with the room rate in most hotels, have to be paid for. However, this is made very clear when booking so I can't really see why anyone can then complain about it on this website. We didn't eat at the hotel, though it has a fairly large bar/restaurant area and the prices on the menu were very reasonable. The surrounding area has a few restaurants, Tesco, Sainsbury, several bus lines stop very close to the hotel, and it's about a 5 minute walk to Old Street underground station. Overall on future trips to London we will definitely consider staying here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 4 nights at the Travelodge City Road. The hotel itself is located along City Road which is pretty busy street. It is pretty close to Old Street Station (take exit 4 and then it is less than 5 minutes walk) but it is also walkable from Liverpool Street Station (which may be more convenient depending on how one arrives. I like the location but if you wish to be very close to all the sights it is not perfect. We were however to a large extent after the nightlife of nearby Hoxton and Shoreditch and for that is a good location. We had a family room which is supposed to sleep 3 but there was actually room to sleep 4. The bed was comfortable however the foldout sofa was a bit too hard. The room had a TV with a few channels (a bit irritating that the channels were in a random order which meant a lot of zapping on the remote) and there was also a water kettle. From what I understood it was possible to borrow hair dryer and other stuff from the front desk. The room was clean and I was actually surprised that the changed towels and linen every day. One thing that I was expecting in the room was shower gel and shampoo but there was only soap but the bathroom had a bath tub. The front desk staff were not rude however they were not exactly friendly and helpful either. They were a bit difficult a bit given each of us our own key card to the room and they were not very knowledgeable about the area or London in general. The value is however great. We paid £19 per room and night and at it is pretty unbeatable at that price. Do not expect something special - it is a basic budget hotel but is clean and reasonably comfortable. Do try to get a room facing the back (away from City Road) as I heard a few other guests complaining about noise - we did however not hear anything.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for one night midweek on 7th May on a leisure break to London. The hotel has been open less than a year and as a result they seem to be offering lower room rates currently on their website than the other London Travelodges. We therefore got a pretty good deal. The hotel is in the heart of the City on the busy and noisy City Road. Check-In was okay and we had a room on the third floor on the City Road side of the building. The room was clean, spacious and modern with a flat screen tv, although being a budget hotel the room was fairly basic but absolutely fine for a short break. The bathroom was a good size and spotless and the shower was superb and powerful once we worked out the controls! If there is one drawback it is the noise from City Road, we opened the window as it was a hot day but had to immediately close it again as we could barely hear ourselves speak. Having said that the double glazing did a good job and reduced most of the outside noise. We got a fairly good nights sleep although were woken twice by police sirens racing by. The hotel is in a great location being about 5 minutes walk from Old Street tube station and a little further (in the other direction) to Moorgate tube. Being in the city there are a lot of office workers in the area and during the day (weekday) the area was heaving with lots of shops, bars and restaurants. We particularly liked Finsbury Circus which is just 5 minutes from the hotel and a great place to sit and watch the world go by. We didn't stay in the area in the evening but when we retutrned at about 11pm we did find that most of the local bars had closed mainly because the office workers had all gone home. Overall though we had an excellent stay and unless you are a light sleeper who can't tollerate backround traffic noise I would recommend a stay at this hotel.</p></li>
