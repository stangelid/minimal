<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is one of very few low priced hotels in downtown Chicago. The rooms are rather worn and the furniture is dated, but you get a fridge and a micro. Beds are fine. Internet worked great. My only real critisism is the noisy elevated Red line which runs just outside. Don't expect to get much sleep if you're a light sleeper. I wasn't that bothered though.</p></li>

The hotel did have a slight smell, but it is a old building and close to water, which is expected. Hotel is in walking distance to Grant Park and Sears Tower, which is what I wanted.

This is a cheap hotel, but you must prepared that you will be disturbed by the noise.</p></li>

I got scabies (not knowing) thinking I just had a temporary itch...It turned into a 5 month HORROR FEAST of itching. EXCRUCIATING. DON'T GO HERE. I AM SERIOUS.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay was truly awful. I was in Chicago for a job interview, and they didn't make my stay any less stressful. My bed was broken, I had to sleep at an angle all night. We got trapped in a broken elevator on my way to the interview! Talk about stress. The front desk man was very rude, and the room was about half the size of an SF studio apartment! Trust me, that is very tiny. Overall, I rate our experience the worst possible rating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location was good, a few blocks (walking) from Grant Park. Hotel and room was average. We stayed in a room with 2 double beds. The room was very small. Beds weren't that great. The shower sucked! No water pressure, so it took me 10 mins to rinse shampoo out of my hair. Parking is in a parking lot across the street from the hotel and is $28 per day. The price of the hotel was moderate for downtown Chicago, $154 per night with a AAA discount.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Went on a driving holiday to USA and Canada and we just booked hotels as we went along. When we arrived in Chicago we found it very difficult to get accommodation as there was a conference on. All we could get was the travelodge. It was the dearest hotel we had to pay for out of the whole trip and the worst one we stayed it. The room was tiny and there were 4 of us in it. Usually in America the rooms are huge but this was the smallest i have stayed in. The location was okay but i would not go back unless i was desperate.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading reviews, we were hesitant to stay here, but wanted something closer to the Lolla festival. I had three rooms reserved and all were very clean and comfortable. The location was excellent and we couldn't have asked for a better value. The rooms looked quite updated with newer carpet, furnishings, towels, etc. All hotel staff were courtious and friendly. If you are looking for value and comfort, this is the place. If you are looking for luxury and being pampered, you'll need to spend a lot more to get your butt powdered.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here during the Bluesfest and it more than fit our needs. We were able to take the train right from the O'Hare airport, then a 6$ cab fare to hotel. The staff were very friendly and gave us lots of information about the area. Thank you to Woody our friendly/funny maintence man. Bluesfest was a short walk away and the continental breakfast meant we didn't have to make coffee in the room. We did have a small fridge and coffee maker. The shower worked fine and the beds were comfortable for one(only doubles). Would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very friendly and helpful doorman and front desk. Room was more like a double room with two beds and two TVs. It had an area with a sink, microwave and frig. The room was clean and bathroom newly remodeled. The location was great, just a couple of blocks from Buckingham Fountain. When we arrived, the remote for one of the TVs didn't work. A call to the front desk and three minutes later, a couple of guys were there to fix the problem. The best thing was the charm of the old building. The worst thing was the elevators were a little slow, but not a big deal.</p></li>

I was skeptical when he told me how cheap he got a loop hotel for and I saw why the second I walked into the room. The location is great but that is it. The hotel was a total dump and VERY outdated. The room had a musty smell . Luckilly we were there for a party Saturday night and did tourist stuff during the day Saturday and I flew in Friday night late and left Sunday morning so I was only in the room long enough to sleep.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everybody in the hotel staff was very freindly. They let us get in our room early even though check-in time wasn't until 3pm. The room was larger and cleaner than the room we spent 3X more for in New York City. The location was great for sight seeing and close to the metro. There are plenty of places to eat all around the hotel. The only negative thing I could say about the hotel is the noise. I heard that the rooms in the back are the quietest, but we had one on the 11th floor in the front and you could hear the train all night. But with the price and the location, it was well worth it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here in January 2009, Booked at the last minute and was the best deal i could find in central Chicago. The hotel is really well placed, dated, but it is what it is. Rooms could be cleaner or more modern, but it was ok. Has a chinese restaurant connected to it downstairs which did decent food at decent prices. Well situated to the parks, art museum and shopping. Chicago is an expensive place to stay so saving a few pounds or dollars on a room can always help. If I was ever back in Chicago, if this is still the cheapest option I can find, then can't see why I wouldn't stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had major concerns based on other reviews; however, this hotel was the PERFECT location for participating in the Chicago Marathon with a start/finish at Grant Park. The cons: not updated, one computer in lobby didn't work, super slow elevators, didn't clean room until after 5PM on day two. The pros: comfortable king bed, spacious room (1023), refrigerator (perfect for gatorades and water), location, friendly/helpful staff, clean shower, affordable for the area. I would not stay here for a romantic vacation or business travel, but it was perfect for my needs as a participant in the Chicago Marathon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It is a dirty old hotel that does not care about the remodeling, the beds are almost a hammock, when we reached the room, the bathroom door had hung on a dirty towel from the previous host, One day the maid forgot one of the cleaning articles, donÂ´t put enough towels, do not change the sheets daily, the exterior windows has heavy soil, could make the effort to clean them once a year, metro rail noise not allowed you to rest as it passes half a block. The course has access to transmission lines, I did not know how safe it was at night. I do not recommend this hotel, the cost can find something better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is in easy walking distance to Grant Park and Soldier Field. If you prefer Taxis, they are numerous in front of the hotel. The red line is also only a couple of blocks away. The Hotel is older and could use some updating but then again it is a very good value if you just need a place to sleep. If you insist on luxury then this is not the place for you. The staff was very friendly and helpful throughout the stay, even when we requested a roll away bed for the last night so a friend could stay in our room. In general the entire Hotel could use a good cleaning but overall the stay was pleasant.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is certainly the most affordable hotel I've stayed in in Chicago. My room was small but clean. The neighborhood is a bit dodgy but no more so than most other urban settings in the US. The Thai restuarant was fabulous. The location iis two blocks from the CTA Redline and quite close to Grant Park. The L-train on State Street was a bit loud, but the constant hum of the air conditioner mitigated the noise. It didn't keep me awake. I was there for business but wouldn't hesitate to bring my family back for a leisure trip. I would file this hotel under the general heading of "You get what you pay for."</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel about thirty steps away from a fabulous neighborhood, where hotels are three times the price. So -- if you can get beyond the slightly rundown, mildly malodorous lobby, and if the incredibly slow elevators arrive before you totally lose your mind to bring you to your rooms, which may or may not be ready at check-in time...(ours wasn't...) You'll find yourself in an acceptable room at a pretty dumpy hotel next to a great neighborhood on the fringe of Grant Park. So plan your days accordingly, enjoy Chicago, and only come back to sleep.

No wonder, this place still had rooms available where else all other hotels were booked. That should have been a clue. Very bad hotel. Horrible rooms and service. The clock did not work. Asked front desk for a wakeup call in the morning for a very important meeting. Needless to say, the call never happened!! and they did not have a good explanation as to why. Don't waste your time. It you have no other option in the area, you're better off staying at a good place farther away and pay taxi fare to get where you want.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For the bad, the room had one bed and we were squeezed together. The rug had an iron burn on it. You have to request an iron and board. The parking lot across the street gives you a fixed rate for your stay where you can come and go, was about 140 dollars for 6 days. There are two places to eat in the hotel, one has sushi, which while not the freshest was great to just go down. Location was great, we could get most downtown places in minutes. Would I stay here again? For my vacations I want a clean room, no pests, and a good price, they delivered all of that and more. So yes, I would.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not that we were expecting elegance and pampering by choosing a Travelodge, but the place is a complete dump and in serious need of an upgrade. We chose it to save money, but it really wasn't worth it. My wife was afraid to sleep on the bed, and I'm fairly certain that there were several "professional services" being run out of adjacent rooms. Three things that the hotel does have going for it: the staff was courteous, there is a killer breakfast joint connected to it, and it's within walking distance of shops and restaurants. Regardless, I won't ever stay there again, and I certainly don't recommend it. Spend a few more bucks - it's worth it.</p></li>

It's inexpensive and located across the street from Grant Park, and within walking distance of The Chicago Museum of Art, The Field Museum and Shedd Aquarium. The Red Line Harrison Station is only two blocks away. Our first room was small and dusty. We were happily upgraded to a larger double kitchenette at no extra cost! It's not fancy, yet you do get just a bit more for your buck. The free WiFi , location just off Michigan Avenue, access to food stores, and public transportation, are major bonuses.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I planned a last minute girls weekend to Chicago this month and we decided to stay at the Travelodge. Although I do prefer more upscale hotels, I thought that our stay worked out great. We booked through Hotels.com. Our room was small with a modern bathroom. (No hairdryers in the room, but you can borrow one from the front desk.) The beds were comfortable and the hotel was not noisy. The carpet in the room looked old. The elevators were very slow during busy times. The front desk staff was friendly and gave good advice. The hotel is located within walking distance of the Art Institute, our main destination. it is also fairly close to the subway. I would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you're going to stay here, be realistic about what to expect. This is not a fancy hotel. It probably wasn't fancy when it first opened. The rooms are small, the decor is dated and the elevators are slow. The location, however, can't be beat and prices are very reasonable. The hotel is literally a block away from Millennium Park. The rooms are clean, and I felt safe walking around the area at night. With my AAA card, the rate was $100 per night, plus tax. The El stops just a couple of blocks away, which is handy. As with most places in Chicago, parking is expensive - I think I heard a rate of $20 per day. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I wanted to see Chicago and needed to be on a budget to afford everything else so we booked a week here. We had room 1235 (top story on end of building) so we didn't get a lot of noise all week. The staff at desk aren't very knowledgeable so just ask people on the street for advice/directions. Our room was pretty small but clean and we averaged $77/night including hotel tax. Try to get that anywhere in the loop!! Ice machines only on select floors (12th floor had one). Breakfast place downstairs was cheap for a quick starter meal. Bus stop on both east Congress and State street only blocks away as well as the underground portion of the "EL".

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location is good, but hotel has to be either renovated or closed. This was my first trip to US and this is the only hotel I visited, therefore I can compare the price/quality only with European hotels. Maybe that's a standard quality in US? If it is Ok for you to stay in a room, where everything is very old, you won't be able to sleep because of extreme noise around you (sometimes it was same as to sleep in a tractor). All the noise from the street you can perfectly hear, as window frames are old and bad insulated. I tried to spend as much time as possible outside the hotel and returned always tired to be able to fall asleep immediately. Don't repeat my mistake and pay a little bit more for other hotel</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this Travelodge, 65 E.Harrison, Chicago on October 4 & 5, I was supposed to stay one more night but had to leave and pay for another hotel. I was bitten and had swollen red patches on my arm (4-5 areas), my neck, my cheek. They were very itchy, large red blotches, the size of dimes. I had business meetings - what a nightmare. Now I am worried about going home and any bed bugs in my luggage/clothes. I notified the hotel management and front desk staff. They said they would check into it. A very old hotel, very old carpets and furnishings. This hotel is one of the cheapest and often included in Orbitz/Travelocity in a very cheap air+hotel package - but avoid it - please - don't suffer like I did.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I understand it is a very historic city that's why I love it, so old buildings can't be perfect. The location was good and so was the price. The room was not very clean, very cramped not big enough to comfortably accommodate a family of 4. One bed was pushed against the wall the other was maybe have 1-2 feet there with little room in between. The bathroom was poorly designed has a pedistool sink with next to no space for any toiletries. I don't base much of my vacation on my hotel because that's not why i'm there but it was just so hard to relax when you went into your room because it was just so cramped in there. Not sure if I would recommend to someone but if it's the only hotel you can afford at least it's a good location..</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Extremely good location for using the subway and buses, which allows us to go to all places that we wanted to see in Chicago. There's a Thai restaurant next to the hotel- food wasn't bad. Pizza hut, KFC, Subway and Dunkin Donuts are just round the corner. Other restaurants, CVS, grocery stores etc could be found nearby too. It's within walking distance to go to the parks and Michigan Ave. from the hotel. Free coffee/tea per person per day. BEST: online check-in and print boarding pass for free using their computer at the lobby (I'm impressed). Luggage storage upon checking-out: $1 per bag. Parking is not free. Taking the subway from hotel is the most convenient way esp. weekends when there are special events and some streets are closed.</p></li>

In Grant park you can walk to the North end to Millennium Park, in the Middle is the art museum and the far end the planetarium, history museum and finally Soldierâ€™s Field. We walked to the game in less than 15 minutes. There are affordable cab rides to the magnificent mile, Rush St., or the Sears tower. The rooms them self are nothing special but the staff at the desk were friendly and could make some good recommendations of where to go.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent the night at the Travelodge Downtown Chicago last night, and I have to say it was not at all worth the $80 I spent for it. It's convenience to downtown is, really, it's only plus. Once we got into our room, I realized we were right beside train tracks, which were loud. Also, the lights and air conditioner in our room didn't work. Only one outlet worked in the entire room, which had a deck light and the TV plugged into it. We sweated all night long, because it was so hot, the trains were loud, and the pillows were like the pillows you get at camp (plastic ones with a pillowcase). I woke up with my neck hurting, and having slept terribly. I would not recommend anyone stay here. Pay a few extra bucks and get a nice room somewhere elsewhere!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great location on a budget”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights and chose it due to it's central location and good rates compared to other hotels in the area. The location is brilliant, and as long as you don't expect too much from a budget hotel, it's fine. Our room was basic and a bit shabby, but clean. It was very noisy due to the L train right outside, I don't think you could stay for more than a few nights unless you can sleep through a lot of noise! The hotel seemed secure enough but I agree with other reviewers that I might not stay on my own as a female, just because there were often a few people around the outside of the hotel at night. I think if you're in a couple or a group it wouldn't be an issue. Overall, good value for money given how easy it is to get around the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We came in from the Chicago Suburbs for an activity in the city. The hotel was just fine for 4 of us. We appreciated the room safe. Our room was in the back by the alley, but inspite of reviews that this was a bad location, it was actually quiet and probably better than the side with the "L" going by all the time. A Panera is only a block north and west, so breakfast was easy to take care of. Subway is across the street for a quick lunch, and lots of more eating choices of all prices are within walking distance. Hotel a bit tired. The staff was nice. Room clean. We were on the third floor so walked up and down as the elevators were a bit slow in showing up. We did not use parking as we used public transportation in and out of the city. Overall I would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Average hotel at best. Grumpy reception on arriving. Noisy room, mainly from the air conditioner. Smallish rooms by US standards. Tired room and bathroom, but clean. No refridgerators, only ice machines on a few floors, none of which had ice on a hot night. Comical seeing all the guests wandering the floors with buckets searching in vain for a working one. When one finally was found the word got around and it was quickly emptied by guests from every floor! AA lost our bags, but returned them 24 hours later to the hotel, but the hotel kept insisting that they had not arrived. Finally found a helpful porter who checked the luggage area properly, just before we had to fly out again. Cafeteria served plain but OK food. Location was excellent though, for the foreshore parks.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Let me start with a couple of positive notes on this hotel. For the Chicago Loop location, it's relatively cheap. The red line subway and the buses are just 1 or 2 blocks away . The rooms are quite large and the view is nice. Now come the bad parts: The EL train tracks are across the street. The passing trains create considerable noise, and as they run from 05:00 AM to 01:00 AM, earplugs are a necessity for a good night's sleep. It's an old building. The doors jam and the locks are not in good condition. I had to jiggle the front and bathroom door to get them open and shut. Walking down the hallway one morning, we heard someone who got locked inside the room because the front door wouldn't open. All in all a reasonable choise, but if you like a room with a view, bring earplugs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The only good thing I can say about this hotel is that it was more or less clean. That's it. It is an old, rundown hotel that the owners don't feel they need to keep up because it's in such a good location. There is no sound deadening in the entire building. I heard babies crying, the ice machine dumping ice every 20 minutes, the pipes banging loudly (the steam heating), and the "L" running a block away. Our toilet wasn't working correctly and continuously flushed for 4 hours in the middle of the night. All that for $150/night (hotel and parking). Yes, it's in an expensive area of Chicago, but it still doesnâ€™t change the fact I felt like I was robbed. We were planning on staying two nights, and checked out after just one. I had never been to happy to sleep in my own bed the following night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay at the Travelodge Downtown Chicago was anything but pleasurable. The rooms were dark, musty, worn and extremely filthy. The carpet was dreadfully grimy and had suspicious droppings by the bed frame. The bed sheets and chairs were stained and unkempt. Noise from the radiator heater, train and road made it impossible to sleep. Hotel staff was rude and short. When asked to be assigned another room they simply sent the cleaning staff up with rubber gloves and a trash bag to remove the droppings off the floor and told us it would be fine. Upon leaving early to check into another hotel the front desk attendant told us there was no refund and we needed to stay and â€œtough it out,â€� while still refusing to give us a different room. Donâ€™t stay here-there are much better places for roughly the same price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a Travelodge not a full feature upmarket 5 star hotel.

Over a stay of a week the room rate varied from $85 to $110, a lot less than any other hotel in the area. Sure you could get a better hotel at this price if you want to stay miles from anywhere, but whatâ€™s the point in visiting a city if you stay way out in the suburbs.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this room on Travelocity and prepaid for my accommodation. Despite the fact that I had printed proof of the fact that I had paid in full, on checking out the clerk at the front desk demanded another payment. He was not interested in the proof of payment I produced and would not let us go without paying again. Because we had a flight to catch and there was a burly security guard standing threateningly next to us, I gave up arguing after a while and paid again. On returning home, I wrote the hotel an e-mail telling them of our experience and requesting a refund. Despite their promised of refunding me, this has not happened yet. Furthermore, the hotel is noisy, with people carousing in the corridor keeping us awake at night. A very unpleasant experience; I would not recommend this hotel at all.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for a week on vacation. This was a terrible hotel. The check in took forever because the counter person couldnt find my reservation, even when I gave him the reservation number. He couldnt type it in correctly. Then the elevatores were broke and could only use the freight evelevator. We were on the 12th floor so it took a while for the elevator to become available. The room itself was very dirty and smelly. There was an iron burn on the carpet. The ac unit didnt keep the room cool at all. I needed more towels in the room and called to the front desk for more, they told me they were out. I also need more toilet paper, I called for that 3 times and it never came. I finally had to take some out of the house keeping cart. I will never stay at this hotel again. The Congress right next door is a much better hotel and its the same price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are planning on staying on Michigan Avenue, this is a much better deal than the Hilton or the Congress. Although there is prestige in getting a Lake view, if you are here on business a hot shower and a clean bed are all you need. The Travelodge provides both for half the price of its next-door competitors. Each room has a minifridge, microwave, and coffeemaker. Most rooms have a separate sitting room/office area and bedroom area. There is free WiFi. This is what a business traveler needs. This hotel is NOT for tourists or children. If you are in Chicago on vacation, the loud El, the lack of a pool, and the homeless folks sitting next to the main door are likely to be off-putting. If you are here for work, it is ideal. Also, being less than 2 blocks from the El station is a little noisy, but extremely convenient for getting out to Midway or O'Hare.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Here's the main problems we encountered: first, our non-smoking room reeked of cigarette smoke. We think it was coming through the bathroom vent. Second, the tiny window was blocked mostly by the window A/C, and what was not was flithy. Thirdly, our young son dropped a CD on the floor and it rolled under the bed... when he pulled it out, it was covered with big gobs of dust. Very discusting. Finally, the lobby had no A/C when we were there (94 deg F). Room A/C was fine. All of the carpets were very old and stained, but that's tolerable. Our room was tiny (not like the pictures at all). The location is great. And, despite the other reviews, our experience with the staff was fine. If this really is the only place you can afford, then do it. But, I'd keep looking and see if you can find a special/better deal somewhere else. Chicago is a great city... if you can afford a few more bucks, it's money well spent.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel because my husband had a convention to go to downtown and this hotel had the most reasonable rates for the location. After reading the reviews, I was very nervous about staying there. However, we were very surprised. I am a light sleeper and I worried that the train noise some people had talked about would keep me up. I asked to be away from that side of the hotel and they put us far away from the noise and I never heard anything! Plus, we had the AC/fan on most of the time, so that probably helped with any noise we might have heard from people staying near us as well. The staff were very helpful and pleasant. At the end, they even loaded up our luggage for us and helped us to the car for no fee! We felt safe and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. The location was perfect for seeing many areas of downtown, the Magnificent Mile and the Museum campus. I would definitely stay here again!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is nothing special. It does have a great location though it's closer to the museum campus than Magnificent Mile. The walk wasn't too terrible but it was a good location. The hotel itself has two restraunts attached a sushi and then a hamburger place. Our room was very large and set up in the old style (the hotel was built in the 20's) The builing was older but that gave it some of its charm. The sink in our kitchenette didn't work and our t.v. only got 1 channel. But we were never in our room. The hotel staff was friendly and accomadating. For a trip to chicago where you'll never be in your room except to sleep this hotel accomodates the explorer. We weren't leaving until 3 in the afternoon and we had to check out at 11 but the hotel offered a bag check were you could check your bags in go out and about and come back for our stuff which was very convieniant. All in all the hotel offered the basic ammenities.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here mid April 2009 and got a very good rate through a 3rd party website. The Hotel looked to me like it was the first Travelodge ever made! The place is in desperate need of a refurbishment. The Room was fairly small but dirty and dark. The carpets were once red but now almost black with worn patches and stains. The bed had obviously had its fair share of sleepers and was in need of changing. The noise from the streets was so loud I was continuously waking up throughout the night. I do believe though that with a complete refit this hotel would be a nice place to stay. Itâ€™s within walking distance of Grant Park, The Navy Pier and the Sears Towers. In the lobby there is a great value breakfast bar / cafe which I believe is independently owned, which we went to every morning for breakfast sandwiches. I would only stay here if you are on a budget and need a hotel in which you just lay your head down for the night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here 1 night for "Taste of Chicago". The location was great for what we needed and the girl at the front counter was very nice. The rooms are small but we tend not to spend much time in the hotel when we travel to Chicago. Basically it's just a place to sleep and/or freshen up before going out again. A few complaints about our room (807) were that the A/C didn't work and the remote control for the TV didn't work either. We did have a problem with the family in the room next to ours. Not sure what time (12:30am or so) the slamming doors, screaming kids and parents yelling at the kids started but apparently we weren't the only ones being disturbed because security was called up to their room. If your looking for fairly cheap accomodations in good locations this and the Red Roof Inn are places we have stayed. They are nothing special but are close to everything. We have been to Chicago 5 times and 4 of those were overnight. You're in Chicago go out and have fun.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visited Chicago for two days on a backpacker's budget so was looking for something cheap but tidy and close to the city. The Travelodge delivered on all my requirements. Some reviews I'd read on this site complained about noise from the street and nearby L train. I had a room facing the main street and had no problems. Staff were friendly and provided local info on best attractions/bars/restaurants etc. For those travelling without a laptop there is a guest computer in the foyer that provides free internet access. The room was clean, bed freshly made and the shower hot - all I required from my base while I explored the city. There is a Dunkin' Donuts and Subway 2 min walk away, a restaurant in the foyer and plenty of food outlets nearby. The nearest subway station - Harrison (red line) is a block from the hotel (for travel to O'Hare airport travel one station to Jackson and transfer to the blue line train). The L Train is a three block walk and will get you around the inner city.</p></li>

Asked why, rudly told they do not do that anymore. Would have gone somewhere else that was 10 more a night if I had know that (if you have kids you understand why) The room was small, at first clean. There was a smell the first couple of days, didnt fiqure it out until the last day. My son found three rotten plums under a nightstand, told the checkout lady and she just said sorry. Only upside was that the evening/night workers were super nice (one of the gentlemen was very helpful and even went above what was his job,), day workers were rude and not very helpful. The Red line is just two blocks away and several fast food places one street away. One more thing to watch id when you check out I was nearly charged 100 dollars more, and when this was pointed and finally fixed person was very rude about this. Will not go back,because of misleading, and the cleaning issuse.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had to go to Chicago on a last minute business trip and got jammed with very little availability for the week I was visiting. I went ahead and selected this hotel knowing that it probably wasn't going to impress me and it didn't. The staff was helpful and courteous and they did the best with what they had. They upgraded me to a "king room" when I checked in, which was a nice gesture but didn't work out so well for the following reasons; 1. My room was literally right across from the elevator so it was a bit noisy 2. Adding to that my room faced the "L" train which you could hear as every train came by 3. The A/C seemed to struggle to keep the room cool enough and was also on the loud side. 4. Two of the four nights I stayed there the room key card didn't work so I had to go back down to the front desk and had them rekey they card, at least it worked 2 out of 4 times. A two star is probably accurate based on my experience. This hotel has seen better days and is somewhat worn out and tired.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here with a friend during a visit in December 2011. There's no doubt the hotel is well located, it's a short distance from Michigan Avenue, the main Chicago shopping street. When we arrived, we spent around 15 minutes just chatting to the chap on reception and the bell boy about various things, mainly sport! All the staff are very friendly and helpful, our room safe broke at one point and they couldn't do enough to help fix it straight away. However the standard of the rooms could be slightly better, they just look a little tired. The walls & furniture look like they need updating to keep up with the competition and the bathroom was freezing. There was no source of heat to it that we could find and the window just let the icy draught right in even when shut (it wouldn't open). So you had to be very quick when using the bathroom! I'd say if Travelodge spent a bit of money updating this hotel and making the bathrooms a bit more 'user friendly' it would be a 4 or 5 star rating for sure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Although I was not sure what to expect for the price, we found the TravelLodge a nice place to stay. Yes, it is older but it was clean and served our needs. The staff was friendly and well informed on the easy way to get to the sites. We did have to ask for a hair dryer and toothpaste at the desk and they gladly provided it. The 2 resturants connected to the lobby were good. One was Thai I believe and the other was a breakfast to dinner joint. It had a lot of choices to pick from on the menu. The hotel is close to a lot of major sites. The L that runs by is quite noisy but we didn't notice after we fell asleep. We would leave by 9:00am and not return untill 9-10PM, so as much time as we spent in the room, the price was right. We stayed 3 days, 2 nights and they held our baggage for us until our rooms were ready and until our train left which gave us extra time to roam the city without draging our bags around. The next time I am in Chicago, this will be the first place I would check out. The price is right.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Travelodge from June 2nd thru June 5th. We had rooms 715 & 718. We were pleasantly surprised. The rooms looked much better than the pictures from the internet. The rooms were large and had been recently renovated. We even had a microwave & mini-fridge, which we weren't expecting. The hotel is old but is in good shape. The staff was friendly and helpful. We were within 3 blocks of the El station and 2 blocks from the Subway station. We bought a multi day pass at the hostel nearby which was good on all public transits- bus, subway and El so we could get anywhere we wanted for mega-cheap. We felt safe on the public transits and had fun trying to figure out how to get there. The concierge recommended a nearby pub for dinner and gave us a 10% off coupon. It is called the Exchequer Pub and we loved the food. We bumped into Will Ferrell on our way to the pub- he is filming a new movie downtown 2 blocks from the hotel. That was cool too. We paid $81 for our rooms and would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Travelodge Downtown for a week in June 2006 incorporating the 4 day Blues Festival ( free and absolutely awesome for blus aficionados). The location is excellent, as buses and the EL( metro network) are within easy walking distance. The hotel itself is good value, but very basic. If you want a fabulous view of either the brilliant architecture or Lake Michigan, forget it. The hotel is old and the type of carpets make it difficult to keep clean. The hotel staff were very pleasant and helpful. The room had adequate space for two and was O.K. There were not many bars and restaurants in the vincinity, but it was 10 minutes walk to Jackson and Wabash and Adams and Wabash which have some late night eateries such as Millers Pub or the Exchequer. It was only 5 minutes walk from Buddy Guys Legends Club which has live music nightly for a $10-00 cover charge where the drinks are no more expensive than elsewhere. If you are on a budget and are happy with just having a functional place to rest , then I would recommend the Travelodge</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was afraid of our stay at the travelodge because I booked nonrefundably via hotwire and looked at the mostly negative reviews afterwards. We are very frequent Chicago travellers (and former residents) and thought: -the hotel was clean and the furniture/fixtures at least acceptable, except for the other bed -the service was good (we needed service twice, once for our child accidentally locking the safe, they came very prompt; the other time for an information at the reception for which the internet was needed, also good and speedy help). -the neighborhood is in a borderzone between Michigan Ave and a neighborhood that is in the process of gentrification. One can complain about that, but the huge Hilton is just around the corner, and the hotel borders the loop. -there are 2 restaurants, one a fast food greasy spoon which also is the (mediocre) breakfast place, the other one a Thai place. -the hotel is quite noisy due to the combination of the elevated train nearby and the outdated windows. If they fixed the windows but stayed otherwise the same, we would return, but right now, it's just too noisy (and we had, as per reception, a "quiet room" facing the back).</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've read some of the reviews and I must say that I'm astonished by some of the bad reviews. I did not deal with any rude staff members or bed bugs. In fact it was quite the opposite. The staff was more than helpful. They held our luggage, called a taxi for us and even let us get our room earlier than the allotted check in time. The room and fairly simple. It was more than adequate enough for two people. My only regret is not having a fridge. The room did come with an ice bucket and that is how we kept our beer cold. A lot of the reviews also seem to focus on the grandeur of the rooms. For the location this hotel is a super deal in Chicago. If you stay 2 nights you get 20% knocked off and 3 nights you get 30% knocked off. The red line subway is only a block away which makes all the touristy area's very user friendly. Shed's Aquarium, The John Hancock Building and several of other places are within in walking distance. If your a light sleeper you might want to bring some ear phones because at times you can hear the trains rolling by but overall this is a good place to stay. I mean how long are you really going to spend in your hotel anyway? Especially if the trip is for leisure purposes.</p></li>

<li>The red line subway is only a block away which makes all the touristy area's very user friendly.</br></br></li>
<li>Shed's Aquarium, The John Hancock Building and several of other places are within in walking distance.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband & I went to Chicago for Lollapalooza, from July 31 to August 4, 2008. Location was key, we wanted to be walking distance to most attractions. The hotel was maybe a 15 min walk to Grant Park, 10 min to Millennium Park. We took a taxi to Navy Pier & Shedd Aquarium, it was only $7 each. There is a Dunkin Donuts, KFC, Pizzahut, Subway... all at the corner of the hotel, very convenient. When we checked in, went up to our room, the key did not work, we kept trying & then a guy opened the door! We made our reservation (for a single double bed room) 2 months in advance, so were we really annoyed thinking they had double booked the room... but they upgraded us to a king bed room at no additional charge. The bed was comfortable, but the room & bathroom were so small. The water pressure was weak & no hot water a few times. The hotel was very old, not the nicest hotel I've stayed at, but we knew that going in... we found the photos posted here helpful & similar to our room. Overall, this hotel is very expensive for what you get ($139/night for a double bed room & $32/day to park our small SUV), but the location was great. Stay here if close location to Parks & shopping is what you're after!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Travelodge for two nights. The rooms were dark, worn and tired. Cramped space. Can't see out of the windows if you are short unless you stand on the bed. Worn carpet, blankets on bed looked like they had not been cleaned in a while. Cleaning staff did not come to our room, so beds were not made, sink and bathtub were not cleaned and toilet paper was not replaced (and we had three of us and were afraid we would run out). Location is OK - we were able to walk and/or take the Water Taxi to destinations, but there are other hotels closer to the action. As I only paid $71 a night for a special promotion, I can't complain about the price, but I guess you get what you pay for. We moved to another hotel for our third night there - located at Wacker and Wabash - and the room was large, clean and wonderful. That night cost us $200 and was well worth it. My advice is to look for deals, but also read the reviews and be prepared. A very low price might look attractive but you may be very unhappy once you get there. And for a bonus: When I got home and checked my bank statement, I found an additional charge for 1Â¢. Are you kidding me? Someone bothered to charge something for a penny? Next trip to Chicago will not find me staying there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our second stay at travelodge. This second time, we had a much nicer room with a city view. This hotel is for the budget minded because the carpeting is old and the furniture is dated, but the bathrooms are updated and well lit. I never felt the hotel was dirty, just worn. We've stayed at two of the hilton hotels in Chicago and though very pretty inside, I felt this location was better for us. I actually enjoyed the unpretentiousness of the hotel and attached restaurants and felt very much at home. I wish I could remember the name of the man who so helpful, helping us with our bicycles and luggage and warning us of the many marches going on when we took our bikes out. As for security, we left our door ajar one morning for only ten minutes before security was knocking to warn us. The mattresses during both visits were very comfortable. Though I'll admit the view of the alley on visit #1 was pretty dreary. I also like that we don't pay for swimming pools and excercise rooms we never use. I asked the maid for more coffee packets and she volunteered condiments? towels? anything else? We'llbe back, but if you're looking for the lap of luxury you will be dissapointed. By the way, the parking across the street is $28 night for cars, remember to have your pay stub validated. I believe this is a fair rate for Chicago.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I booked this hotel to see a concert at the Auditorium Theater. We were only staying for one night and we wanted to be downtown near the venue, but did not want to spend a fortune for one night. We chose this hotel because it is less than a block from the theater, and, as it turned out, we could see the theater from our room. This hotel is budget priced for a downtown hotel. It is a bit on the minimalist side with the basic ammenities needed to be comfortable. We had a nice corner room with windows facing two directions. The room was cool and comfortable. The bed was soft for my tastes, but quite acceptable. The bathroom was small but adequate. Several of the ice machines were broken when we stayed and it was a bit difficult to find ice at times. Also there are only a few vending machines with very limited selections, so if you have snacking or beverage needs you will probably have to venture outside the hotel. In short, we werent expecting a luxury hotel. We wanted basic accomodations at a good price for one night. The travelodge was perfect for this. Im not sure that I would stay at this hotel if I were on vacation for a week and planned to spend significant time in the room. However, for basic accomodations for short stay such as a business trip or a quick get away to see the sights in Chicago, this place is ideal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visited this hotel with 5 other girls (all rooming in a room for 4 people). Our friends from Chicago booked the hotel and when we went to get another room the hotel was booked, so we just brought along an extra air matress. The hotel is very old, you can tell by the carpets, windows and fixtures. Not in a dingy way at all but this hotel has obviously been around a long time. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The room was spacious with 2 double beds, a small kitchenette including a fridge, an okay sized bathroom and 2 closets. The beds were comfy and the hotel was clean. There is a great breakfast place attached to the hotel that is cheap and very good. The best part of this hotel is the proximity to everything you want to see and do in the windy city. We could walk to all the stores and the shopping district, all the toursity sites like the Sears tower, and it was a short taxi drive to all the clubs. We took a trolley and did a pub crawl and this was so much fun!! I would recommend this anyone that wants to see a little of Chicago's night life and have a great time on the trolley. All in all I would recommend this hotel. Although it is an older hotel you cant go wrong with the location. One more thing, parking is valet parking and is across the street, this is $20 per night. I dont think I saw anything much cheaper in downtown Chicago. And Chicago is definetly the windy city!! Great time!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I agree with other reviews that says it is loud. The train literally runs about 100 feet from the building. But I think that is mostly because the windows are REALLY old and you hear all the noise coming in from them. By "newly remodeled" they mean Paint Coat number 862 on the walls, poorly applied I might add. Talking to them on the phone is just about pointless. I called twice and both times seemed like I was just bothering them. In person they were much friendlier. The bellman was quite nice actually. Of course housekeeping was knocking on my door starting at 8am to clean the room, which was kind of annoying every half hour... I would not recommend this hotel if you have any allergies, especially to dust. My room really could have used a thorough cleaning, but it was livable for one night. I did not have any bed bug issues, so that was good. The bathroom smelled of stagnent water, which I believe was the shower curtain. The tub was REALLY deep. Had the tub been clean, I definately would have relaxed in a hot bath, but there was slight coat of scum on it, so I decided to NOT be a human scouring pad. But, I guess in comparison to other rates in the area, it was cheap. If you are looking for a hotel experience, this is definately not your place. If all you need is a bed to sleep in for a few hours and a hot shower, you should be fine. Just bring a pair of earlplugs unless you are a really sound sleeper.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had to attend a convention in Chicago and couldn't afford the conference hotel (Palmer House) and so booked rooms at the Travelodge. I was expecting the worst (I've stayed in some NASTY Travelodges before), but the location and price were excellent so I figured I'd take a chance. First of all, the front desk staff was so nice - I wanted to check in early so I could attend some meetings at the conference, and they didn't even blink (most hotels try to make you feel bad for not waiting until 3). The room was quite large, bright, clean and cheerful and the bed was really comfortable. There are two restaurants downstairs - the little diner was perfect for a quick breakfast or lunch (and surprisingly inexpensive) and the Thai place was fabulous. Every hotel staff member I spoke with was friendly and chatty (especially the maintenance guy - I needed help with the in-room safe and he took care of everything quickly!). My only complaint is that their cable menu is missing some obvious channels (Weather, Comedy Central), but no one should be watching TV when there's the whole city to explore. Speaking of exploration - the Art Institute is just up the block and the hotel is also a block from the shopping on Michigan and State Streets, so everything is really convenient. Altogether, the hotel is old and not nearly as nice as the Palmer House, but it was so inexpensive and much better than I expected. Would absolutely stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Don't be deceived by this hotel's affordable rates and great location. Our room was not cleaned very well--there was an imprint of an iron in the rug on our carpet. I've never seen anything like that. But wait--there's more! The hotel is infested with bed bugs! My brother and I stayed for one night in June, 2008, and left with 30+ bites on our bodies. We went to a doctor upon returning home and he diagnosed the bites as being from bed bugs. It was disgusting! I called the manager (Mr. Minas Gorguis) to complain. He even indicated that they'd had bed bugs one month prior to our stay. I demanded my money back for that night's stay, but he refused to do so. He actually had the audacity to invite us back to stay another night, but there was no chance that we were going to do that, since we did not want to take the chance and get bitten by more bed bugs!! This was absolutely by far the WORST hotel I have ever stayed at!!!!! DO NOT STAY HERE!!! I have traveled extensively, all over the world, and have stayed in many different hotels. I will NEVER stay at a Travelodge again, and most definitely WILL NOT stay at the Travelodge in Chicago. We complained to the Better Business Bureau, and are seriously considering pursuing litigation against Travelodge. Pay a little bit more, and stay at a nicer hotel in the area. I posted my review here because Mr. Gorguis has not assured us that they have taken the necessary precautions to ensure that this does not happen again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel while in town for Lollopalooza. For the purposes of this trip this hotel was fine. Convenience was very important since the concert was in grant park and this hotel was a mere 5 minute walk. We had an oversized room with two dbl beds, microwave, fridge, "minibar" area. Beds were comfortable, but certainly not anything special. Flimsy pillows. Small bath towels. Hotel is old and dated, but seemed well maintained for it's age. Bathroom was newly redone and very clean--just as seem in the photos on the website. I used to live in chicago the sound of the nearby train did not bother me, but we had earplugs just in case. There is a nice little restaurant downstairs with good, fast, inexpensive food (Chicago Carry-out). Service was very good--at check in and through out stay. My biggest complaine??? The elevators were sooooo slow. I know the hotel was sold out with festival goers, but the wait time for the elvators was painful. We were on the top floor and we could never get an elevator. In fact, when we were checking out we waited so long I called the front desk and asked for someone to come get us in the service elevator. They were kind enough to come get us--and we beat the full elevator that had stopped at our floor before we even called! In conclusion, you get what you pay for. The Travelodge is adequate if you need budget friendly accomodations (we paid $138/nt)in grant park area. However, I would not stay here if i was coming to chicago for a weekend that did not involve Lollapalooza.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ok, for anyone about to stay at this hotel you really need to lower your expectations. First this is not a 5 star hotel. Ok? This is at most a 2 star hotel but don't let that stop you from booking or staying here. I found the front desk folk to be quite nice. When we first went to check in our room wasn't ready. No biggie since it was about 11am and I wasn't expecting it to be ready. We dropped off our bags and came back a few hours later. Still the room wasn't ready and since it wasn't the lady upgraded us to a suite. Now if this happens to you don't get too excited. With the suite you get a fridge, a microwave and a sink along with a living room type deal. I will admit though that it was nice to have the extra space. I found the room upon checking in to be clean, the pillows to be slightly better then most 2 star hotels and from what the mister says the bed was comfy. For him to say the bed is comfy he is telling the truth since he has a lot of back issues. For me well a bed is a bed, I can sleep on almost anything. As for the location of the hotel well it is a bit of a distance to most anything but the location I would say is a safe one. There is a 24 hour Dunkin Doughnuts about a block away and the red line is a couple blocks away so that was nice. Now the question. Would I stay here again? Hmmm well maybe only if the Ohio House is full or I couldn't get a good rate at the Days Inn over in Lincoln Park. But I think my travels to Chicago are about over since in 6 months I will be moving out there and making the wonderful windy city my home :) I heart you Chitown!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Visited Chicago two years ago and had to come back. Stayed somewhere else last time. Got this room through the Priceline "Pick Your Price" bid. I didn't even know what I was getting until it was charged to my credit card. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. The location of the hotel is really great. Close to some major attractions, the subway, the bus, and downtown is a block away. They have two restaurants on site. One a Thai and Sushi place and the other one just does breakfast and lunch, American style. My wife and I ate at both restaurants during our three day stay. Both restaurants were reasonably priced and the food was very good. Our room had a kitchenette which was an unexpected surprise. The bathroom was huge! It was lacking on counter space to store stuff, but had a full length mirror and another closet. We had a safe in the closet to store valuables. It did need fresh batteries to get it to work. A call to the front desk and someone came and fixed it within 5 minutes. The maintenance man was also very knowledgeable about the city and told us which buses to take to get to certain attractions. His advice was spot on! The room itself was very large and had a couch, dresser, and a desk with a nice office chair. The only bad thing about the whole experience was the air conditioner was a bit undersized for the room. The temp in the room the first night was a bit high, but it got better the other two nights. The whole hotel could use a bit of a ventilation makeover as it wasn't just our room that was warm. All in all our experience at the Travelodge was very nice. I would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">245PM Checked In......was made to wait till 415 before I got a room. Was tired after an international flight, so was sleeping in the lobby on a chair with my luggage as a foot rest. The clerk Ken, was absolutely the worst customer service person I've ever come accross in my life. Not only was he extremely rude and cold, but believe it or not threatning as well. For example, I'd put my pen up, to sign in at check in.....he indicated 'Put that pen down sir, I'll tell you when it's time to sign', or something like that. Another guest was waiting with me, so when after 90 minutes we were called in to finally check-in , this person excitedly gesitculated at me to join him at check-in . Ken asked him if if I was with him, and when this guest said no, he was told to mind his own business. I could go on and on. The room was misereably small, and the coffee machine so old, that all the water accumulated in the filterr basket, and I nearly got scalded. The windows were old and and actually stuffed with sponge to keep the cold air out. The only saving grace was housekeeping, that I have to say. The hotel is near an Elevated Station, and there is constant noise of trains braking towards the station approach. Don't let the Michigan Avenue proximity fool you ; It is 'South Michigan', rather than North, and a very old, rundown area. The hotel reflects the same. I'd called head office, to lodge a complaint, but as expected it was all lip service,and no calls (around 5 of them) returned. If they say 'All complaints are taken seriously' it is an obvious lie. Calls to the general manager were not returned as well. Stay at you own peril.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was one of the worst hotel experiences of my life. I (mom) was in Chicago with my adult son and had booked a room with 2 double beds. Instead we got a room with a King bed and were told there were no other rooms available. When I asked for a cot, none of those were available either. When I asked to speak to the manager, he was also unavailable. After I became angry, the desk clerk gave my son another room and assured me that we would not be charged for it. He also assured me that they could change our room to one with 2 beds in the morning and that I could speak to the manager in the morning. The room my son got stunk of cigarettes, despite the fact that the hotel is advertised as being totally non-smoking, and when he turned on the air conditioner, it tripped a circuit and so he had no electrical power for the night. My room lacked many of the usual amenities found in a standard hotel room such as tissues and phone book. When I called the desk to get some, the "security" guy brought them up. In addition, I could not figure out how to work the TV even after talking to the desk, and AGAIN, they sent up the "security" guy to help me. He had to read his handwritten directions to figure out the TV. There were no directions in the room on how to use the TV. We decided to check out in the morning and find another hotel. When we checked out, I asked for the manager once again, but he was not on the premises and I was told he was not coming in that day. My advice is DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL. The hostel would probably be better and cheaper. The good news is that we found a great hotel for the second night we were in Chicago.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here with may aunt when we went to visit my brother in Cincinnati (cheaper to fly to Chicago and bus down to Cincy...go fig) in Sept of '10. Anyway we were visiting Chicago and picked this place for it's location to things and price. We got a good deal on a three night stay and I think I know why. This is an older building which seems to not have been updated for quite a while. The front desk was helpful in terms of addressing our concerns. Our first room was basic however it wreaked of cigarette smoke. Though the rooms are non-smoking it seems all the years of smoking are now embedded in the walls, ceiling, and carpet. We asked for another room which they did find for us. We got a slightly larger room with a kitchenette. The bathroom was nice and large since we got a handicap accessible room (this was good for my aunt). Though basic it was a nice step up from the first room. The room contained 2 full sized beds which were OK, nothing special about them. Though the room was large it was facing the street so it was noisy at night till about 1am or so. after that it was OK. The AC was old and noisy so it did help drown out some of the noise but of you don't want any noise this may not be the place for you. I wold say around a 2 star hotel and that incudes the location as a plus. It is situated between the happenings of Magnificent Mile and the large number of museums towards the southern end of town. There is also a Red Line stop a couple of blocks away for getting around. There are other hotels in the area which may be nicer and perhaps only slightly more so do our homework and compare for your intended travel dates and you could be in for a very pleasant stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Because the cost of this hotel was a fraction of other downtown Chicago hotels, it was not expecting the Ritz. I did, however, expect a functioning bathroom. We arrived in the wee hours of the morning and was not surprised that our room was very small and sparse but it was clean. We just feel into bed that night. In the morning, when I attempted to take a shower, the was not enough water pressure to even get wet and no hot water whatsoever. Fifteen minutes later the toilet broke. When it was flushed, it just kept flushing and flushing. We called the front desk and they sent someone immediately. He was able to fix the toilet after about twenty minutes. We were out all day and back in the room around 10;30 PM when the toilet broke again. This time when we tried to call the front desk, the phone was dead. This meant a trip down to the front desk. They sent another man who able to fix the toilet again but he was unable to do anything about the phone. At this point, we were offered an upgrade to a 'suite'. Each of you reading this has their idea of what constitues a suite. The room they gave us mets none of them. It was just a bigger room with the same tired furniture. The was pressure was much improved but hot water was still hard to come by. I am not telling you not to stay at this hotel. It is very resonably priced and has a great location-steps off Michigan Avenue. I am telling you that there is a reason it is so much less that the neighboring hotels. You get what you pay for. The staff is doing the best it can with what it has to work with and they did respond to our complaints immediately. If you are willing to put up with some discomfort to save money, this will work for you.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Myself & 3 friends all in our mid 30's stayed at the Travelodge October 14th-17th. We arrived early & the bell man was more than happy to hold our bags while we explored the great city of Chicago & waited for check-in. Normal check-in is @ 3pm, but we were able to get in our room by 2pm. There is a bank of 3 elevators, but 2 were down. However the one that was working was quite quick, and we never had to wait more than a minute or two. When we opened the door we were surprised at how small the room was. But we decided that all we were doing was sleeping & showering there...so as long as the place was clean we had no complaints. I had heard that there was an issue with "bed bugs" so I inspected the bed, before placing anything on it. I was happy to see that the mattress & box spring looked fairly new, sheets were clean & fresh, and even under the bed was spotless! The bathroom was quite small, but clean, and everything worked well...little more water pressure would have been nice. The rest of the room could use some updating, paint on the walls, change the artwork & curtains, etc. But that's all esthetics. If you're looking for somewhere to use as a home base, to simply sleep & shower...this location was great. We had no issue with street noise or train traffic. As an added bonus there is Wi-Fi in the hotel & a digital safe in the closet all at no charge. The staff at the front desk was always helpful with restaurant suggestions. Don't go next door to the cafe. Head south to Wabash & 11th, check out Eleven Diner! FANTASTIC!!! We ate breakfast there every day. Overall, if you're planning on being out & exploring the city and simply using the room to sleep & shower...this is a great place to stay. Be sure to check out the Shedd Aquarium & the Science & Industry Museum!</p></li>

<li>But that's <span style="background-color:#f032e6" title="p=0.836">all</span> <span style="background-color:#f032e6" title="p=0.836">esthetics</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>If you're looking for somewhere to use as a home base, to simply sleep & shower...this <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.999">location</span> was <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.999">great</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>We had <span style="background-color:#A00000" title="p=0.994">no issue</span> with street noise or <span style="background-color:#A00000" title="p=0.994">train traffic</span>.</li>
<li>We had no <span style="background-color:#A00000" title="p=0.999">issue with</span> <span style="background-color:#A00000" title="p=0.999">street noise</span> or train traffic.</br></br></li>
<li>As an added bonus there is Wi-Fi in the hotel & a digital safe in the closet all at no charge.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1" title="p=0.999">staff</span> at the front desk was <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1" title="p=0.999">always helpful</span> with restaurant suggestions.</li>

<li>Don't go next door to the cafe.</br></br></li>
<li>Head south to Wabash & 11th, check out Eleven Diner!</br></br></li>
<li>FANTASTIC!!!</br></br></li>
<li>We ate breakfast there every day.</br></br></li>
<li>Overall, if you're planning on being out & exploring the city and simply using the room to sleep & shower...this is a <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.998">great</span> <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.998">place</span> to stay.</br></br></li>
<li>Be sure to check out the Shedd Aquarium & the Science & Industry Museum!</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I feel sorry for those in charge of running this hotel. The location is very good, but can't so much more than that on the PROs side of things. Plenty of CONs: - price: seems reasonable, but for what you get/hassle it is actually too much. e.g. $180 for a room with two double-beds (on a booked-solid conference weekend across the city) - condition: The place is old and falling apart, literally. Not only furniture and decor, but basics. In our first room, when I turned on the sinks hot water some brown sludge came up, momentarily. The blinds were ripped and had holes. Both my friend and I had incessant trouble with the magnetic keys opening out room door. (Staff said don't store them close to a cellphone or iPod is would demagnetize them.... ya, right!). The final straw in that room was that the door would simply not lock when leaving! We requested a room change at that point. (We were no frills travelling but there are basic essentials that must be met!) - infrastructure: in the "new" or second room, there was low water pressure and hardly hot water. The same room key problem remained with that roomlock too, however, at least it locked. The elevator was VERY slow. - service: given the above we requested a reduction in room price. They were resistant, although I am quite sure that these issues and complaints repeat with every second visitor. Eventually we got 25% off (they originally suggested 10%). As mentioned, I do feel sorry for the staff. With a building like this, you are in a losing battle. It needs a complete overhaul. So, they cannot be happy service providers when they know that most inquiries are probably going to actually be complaints. - location is very good. BUT, watch where your room is located. If on the west side of the building the L-line will be going past you and it can be quite loud.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Surprizingly good hotel by European standards.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">That would be Eastern European standards. Let's be honest; this is a discount hotel not the Marriott. I was in Chicago for 5 days to do a job and I was expecting a real dump. I stay in discount hotels in small towns across the county for $20 to $30. Being in the center of a large city, prices were about double. But you won't find anything noticeably cheaper than the Travel Lodge unless you stay at the hostel about a block away. It was easy walking distance to the subway red line, even for an old man with moderate gout. Hell, I could throw a snowball that far in my day. The neighborhood felt safe to me with many elderly folks and college aged girls walking around alone even after 10:00 pm. It was 5 or 10 minutes to the center of Chicago where Michigan Ave crosses the Wacker river. Fast food was convenient with Dunkin Donuts, Subway, KFC, Pizza hut across the street and many more expensive eateries and watering holes in the neighborhood. The staff was courteous and helpful. Not many people were there and it was quiet. No mammalian, insect, avian, or fungal pests were observed. The sheets were clean, the room stayed warm in winter time, the electricity worked, the toilets flushed, hot water came out of the shower. Several clean towels along with small samples of soap, shampoo and lotion along with paper, pens, a phone book and a Bible were provided. The phone worked for calls coming ina nd I did not make any calls. I did not use the safe, coffee machine, TV, or iron. The place was dated and had been partially remodeled a few times giving it sort of an avande gros or tacky look depending on your tastes. A combination of the Thai restaraunt on the first flooor, strong cleaning chemicals and nearby Lake Michigan gave the hotel a rather unusual odor, but not unpleasant to me. The train lines being so close were audible at times, reminding me of the quaintness of being in the big city.</p></li>
