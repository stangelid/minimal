<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel was nice and clean, yet, the surrounding area offers nothing. No decent restaurants, no night live, not even a bagel shop. Downtown Dallas shuts down at 4:00pm, you would have to drive good 30-45 minutes to go somewhere for dinner. Ghost town after 4pm. As for the hotel, they charge $7.50 for a bottle of water.... A 1/2 cup of fruits cost $17.95 WiFi is $24.99</p></li>

Close to the West End, which was good for us because we went to the basketball, the JFK museum and the Butcher Shop Steakhouse, all of which were located there. Fantastic restaurant in the hotel, with exceptional service and great food. No free wi-fi in room, and business centre computers were slow but otherwise nothing bad to report.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Room had everything you could want for the price. It's not 5 star and does not pretend to be so if you are looking for that look elsewhere and pay more. Staff are very friendly and the food is good. Starbucks attached to hotel. The pool area is fantastic and gets plenty of sun. The pool very large and is 9 feet deep at one end. Pool area could just do with some cleaning attention (There are cigarette butts scattered around). Will definitely be staying again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel has been here for years - nice bar, long term staff, nice helpful. This time back after 5 years, it really looked dated. The rooms are sizeable and reasonably appointed. Unfortunately for most of the first day of our meeting at the hotel, the air conditioning did not work. June, Dallas, 100+ degrees, not good. It took an age to get the air conditioning person in to fix - rumored to have been in Cancun for the weekend. This ok but its no longer a luxury hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I attended a conference at this hotel last month. Although there were hundreds of participants, the front desk staff was calm and cool. As a frequent traveler, I appreciate that. Rooms were well kept and all amenities were stocked. Our room was much larger than I expected. The only thing that I don't like is that the valet is an extra $24/day. It should be half that, or at least discounted based on the number of nights one stays. I will certainly return - my car may not.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we got a great deal through Hotwire for Texas/ou weekend. the hotel is in a great location-only a few blocks from West End and Victory Park. The lobby was very nice with a relaxing atmosphere in the bar area. we didn't use the pool, but we had a great view of it from our room and it looked nice. The bed was one of the best i have ever slept in. The only downside was parking was $21. that is a bit steep in my opinion. I would stay there again if i needed a downtown hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent VIP service upon check in. Love the President's Club benefits. But the room was below the Fairmont's standards from my perspective. Which is based on staying in several in the US and Canada. I went into it expecting too much, but brand expectations can do that. A few specifics, furnishings worn, messy grout, curtains worn and carpet spots. The hotel was channeling the 1990s. Early 1990s. Still, I'd recommend the hotel, but only based on location. PS. Free internet with membership in the Prez club. It's free to join.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved staying at the Fairmont. One thing though, be sure to have backup cash after checkout. The minibar in the room is super pricey. On top of that WiFi is not free. It's 13.00 for 24 hours. Most cheaper chained hotels have free WiFi and with the price of the rooms, WiFi SHOULD be included. On their website, it's listed as being available but they do not tell you it's free. The Pyramid bar and restaurant in the hotel is not very good for the price. I would recommend this hotel if money was not an option. Otherwise, look elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed at the Fairmont Dallas for a conference. Overall, the stay was pleasant and everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful. One pleasant surprise was that the banquet food was better than I had expected. The rooms could use some updating but the bed was comfortable and the room was very well cleaned. My (insignificant) complaint was that it was very difficult to reach anyone at the front desk on the overnight shift on Saturday night. I had to walk downstairs at 2AM to have my question resolved. Other than that, I enjoyed my stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Fairmont is a fine hotel in downtown Dallas. Keep in mind that even thought you're in the so-called arts district, good restaurants are hard to come by and the hotel's Starbuck's has limited hours so nighttime repasts are a bit of a challenge. You can have nice bar food in the overly-lit hotel bar (the staff here is the hotel's weak link, with a somewhat attitudinal bar staff) The rooms are clean and comfortable (how I wish the windows would open, however!), ther terrace pool is clean and large and the staff is friendly and helpful. Overall, a fine stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is my third Fairmont and certainly the best so far. Like all Fairmont hotels (as far as I can tell) the bathroom was surprisingly small; however, the bedroom was huge, especially for the miserly $279/nt that I paid for it. The rooms are as dully conservative as you would expect for a business hotel of this type, but they are at least tasteful and up-to-date, not to mention immaculately maintained. The hotel's restaurants and bars are very pleasant and the staff are efficient and charming. There is nothing extraordinary about this hotel, but it is a pleasant place to spend a night or two.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got a great rate for this hotel from Hotwire. All around, a very nice hotel. The lobby and bar area were very fancy and recently upgraded. The room itself was pretty regular, and didn't seem to be nearly as nice as the lobby would let on...but it was still a very nice room. But, it was clean, comfortable, and had a great view. Parking was a little steep at $24 per day, but it was valet service, and I'm not sure we could have found anything cheaper. Location was good, but not much within walking distance. All around, no complaints, and I would definitely consider staying here again when I'm in Dallas.</p></li>

The M-Line is a free trolley service. I used it almost everyday to go to uptown. The service at the hotel was great. The only thing that I didn't really like about the hotel was its fancy restaurant.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had a very nice 4 day stay. The hotel is older and if you look closely you'll notice a few nicks and scratches around, but generally nice facilities. Everyone was very nice - front desk, reception, concierge, valet, housekeeping, bar. I was very impressed with the consistently friendly service. Oh, one complaint was the low-flow showerhead. Yuck. But what do I know, maybe Dallas is having a drought. The aquarium was an easy walk (2 or 3 blocks) and was great. The West End neighborhood was also an easy walk and had lots of restaurant options (lot of steakhouses, no surprise, but some other options too). Would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent a couple of days here for a conference (which was held at the hotel). It's a nice place, probably a little older than some, but it seems to have been renovated over time to keep pretty high standards. The room was nice, pretty large, with a good work area/desk. Room service was kind of pricey, but the food was good. I ate at the bar a couple of times (the restaurant is really expensive) and a couple of items were outstanding (pork tacos and the cheese plate).

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiance and I just returned from a weekend get-a-way to the Fairmont in Dallas, TX. We were in Dallas to see the King Tut exhibit, which was amazing! The Fairmont is just two blocks from the Dallas Art Museum so it was easy access to get there. We had planned to stay two nights, but unfortunately, I became very ill and we decided to check out early. We checked out at 4 pm on Saturday and we were not charged for that night at all!! The staff was awesome and completely helpful. The rooms were beautiful and very comfortable. This was an EXTREMELY nice hotel but we booked via Travel Zoo and got an amazing rate! I can not recommend The Fairmont more!!</p></li>

Was given wrong room one bed for five people and they would not move us. Grease from the door hinges got all over one of the dresses and had to get nasty with the manager before they would dry clean it. When needing to go out to pick up odds and ends the staff had no clue as to how to get anywhere. The pool is located on the roof top which my kids liked but it stayed dirty all the time.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at The Fairmont for the first time and would highly recommend it. It is a great location if you are going to a NHL game;close enough to walk. We booked on-line and stayed in a large suite for a very good rate. It is a pet friendly hotel and so were able to take our cat with us. The room was very nice and the room service was excellent for breakfast - we didn't have any other meals at the hotel. The location of the bar is unusual in that it is right off of the foyer and so you are not afforded any privacy. The bar food was so-so. What makes this a place that we look forward to going back to was the service. The staff know what they are doing and how to treat their guests.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here this past weekend. Booked through Fairmont's website a couple of months earlier and got a really great weekend deal by prepaying (cost was less than many suburban hotels/motels). The room was a double queen, which was huge with a living room area, big desk, floor to ceiling windows and a walk-in closet. The beds were very comfortable with lots of comfortable pillows. The lobby lounge was nicely busy and our waiter really knew his drinks. The Italian eggs benedict in the Pyramid dining room was incredible....fresh dill and basil...incredibly tasty. As per Fairmont's corporate policy, we were provided with free valet parking since we were driving a hybrid....a $24 a day saving.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent the weekend in Dallas at the Fairmont with our kids. It is a good hotel for the price (which is pricey). They do not have an indoor pool which we had hoped by the outdoor pool was open and heated. We got in (despite the February chill) and thankfully it decent weather but chilly! Wish they had a hot tub on the terrace so you could get in and warm up. We had a good experience with the service, our room was clean and comfortable (but two double beds were small - wish they were queens). The hotel was really busy with multiple groups/events including a ton of cheerleaders - but we never had an issue with noise in our room. The lobby was a bit crazy at some points but we had a great weekend.</p></li>

That said, the bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was clean with all the fixtures working as advertised. All the meals I had on property were in a group setting. The quality of the food was good. One thing that this Fairmont does well is service. Wherever I went and whatever I needed, the hotel staff were eager to please. It is clear outstanding service is an objective the hotel management strives to deliver. It was too pervasive to be the result of individual initiative.</p></li>

Great breakfast area although slightly standard fare to be had - nice at night to be able to go for a pre-dinner drink there with a tv and a selection of beers, wine etc. Honour bar in operation which was a great touch. Friendly and efficient staff. Bar downstairs a pretty typical hotel bar - stopped serving fairly early though after we had been promised a late license. Room a good size and well laid out. Nespresso coffee machine and Ihome docs for music was a nice touch. Pool area a bit dated and service out there almost non-existent - I had to find a phone on two occasions (in 3 days) to call to ask for someone to stop by. Nice staff though for the most part.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was very nice! It had one of the most comfortable beds I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping in. The only problem with this hotel was the waiting staff at the lounge, which I was basically forced to eat at due to lack of restaurants in the area. Every single time I ate at the restaurant, the wait staff did not get my order right. The people at the front desk were not really on top of things either. As we were to have a special group rate for our business conference. When we checked in they didn't even know what we were talking about. It was a lovely hotel but don't expect anyone who works there to know anything and order the simplest food that couldn't be screw up. Although they did screw up a hamburger and fries....</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just attended a conference at this hotel. Hotel room is nothing special for the price and could use some updating, and the bathroom is on the small side, but most important, the bed is very, very comfortable. Towels are nice and fluffy, and the drapes block sunlight/outside light nicely. Pyramid restaurant is quite expensive for the few bites of food served but what there was,was excellent. Extremely tender steak! Just tiny... especially considering it's Texas! The main conference rooms were convenient to the sub-conference rooms, and all were convenient to the hotel rooms. Elevators were fast with virtually no waiting. I would likely not choose to stay here for a personal retreat, but would certainly return for a business conference.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was 40 degrees in Dallas and my room at the Fairmont did not have working thermostat. No matter how high I put the temperature it continued to blow cool air. I phoned front desk, they said they would send an engineer but two more phone calls and two hours later - nearly 11:00 pm, no one had come. By then me and family were in bed clothes and ready to retire for the night. I spoke witho nsite manager and he did offer to move us to another rooim, but it was very late, we had unpacked and settled in the room, so I declined due to the incoonvenience. Also, the TV did not have two of the channels shown available. I was disappointed at this high star hotel for not being up to standard and not offering to comp my room for at least one night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for a business meeting with a large group of colleagues. The rooms were clean and the bed and furniture were comfortable. I had a nice view of the city from the 18th floor. The meeting rooms were spacious and the food was good and had many healthy choices, which is unusual for a big meeting such as this. The hotel bar was nice and the bartenders were friendly and quick. I also enjoyed having a Starbucks in the lobby, which also featured friendly people. My only complaint was that unless in a public area, there was a charge for WiFi. Fortunately, by asking nicely the front desk clerk happily took the charges off my bill.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was in the South Tower, and as a Fairmont Premier member I should have been in one of their nicer rooms. Maybe the North Tower is nicer? The furnishings, carpet, drapes etc. were dated. The bathroom was small. The bathrobes were stiff and scratchy rather than soft and fluffy. My heating unit made noise the first night, but I was able to get it fixed the next day. I guess they're trying to be hip - they played rock with electric guitars at breakfast, which is not what I want to wake up to on a Sunday morning before I've had any coffee. On the plus side, it was a very short walk to the Dallas Museum of Art. There were a lot of staff around trying to be attentive. The bed had nice linens and was very comfortable. The price was quite reasonable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Fairmont Dallas is a great hotel, and for $149/night, a decent value. I highly recommend it to anyone staying in Dallas. Facilities: The lobby is upscale and never too crowded. They have a nice pool & gym, as well as an upscale restaurant. A starbucks opened the day I checked out. Rooms: Very comfortable beds and nice bathroom with ample space. They even had a walk-in closet. My only complaint is that the rooms could be bigger. It was a tight squeeze with 2 beds in it. Food: I ate at a few catered events and it was very good compared to most other hotel food I have had in the past. Service: Was great!! Everyone there was super helpful, room service was a breeze. I even had a small problem with the bill and it was corrected quickly with no questions asked.</p></li>

For those aussies that love value, good service, and the most comfortable sleep, this is the place. It is in the ' arts' district, so don't expect retail outlets in the vicinty, however a $20 cab ride will get you to ' Northpark' shopping centre, where every brand imaginable, plus Macys, neiman Marcus etc are at your disposal. All in all a great experience, and we look forward to our next stay in Dallas. Aussie hotels, lift your game!! This is the benchmark all hotels should aspire to.</p></li>

They had found her bag, but BIG SURPRISE - her camera, cash and Nintendo magically disappeared. Hotel was nice enough to forward what was left to Waldorf Astoria New York - thank you. The explanation was ordinary (including - staff are screened and checked blah, blah, blah). The fact is you have a theif working for you - and unless you install airport style xrays on your staffs baggage and person when leaving the hotel - don't kid yourself that it didn't happen - and I hope for future guests you have implemented some changes, because clearly whatever you are doing doesn't work.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a classic 4-star downtown hotel. The public areas are beautiful. The location is great for business or downtown sightseeing. It is close to Uptown and highways as well. Parking is expensive, but options other than valet are available esp. on the weekends. I had a non-Gold level suite. It was large but laid out differently from the pictures on the website. The bedroom was huge and the parlor area was smaller than pictured. The bathroom was very small but had high quality finishes. There was a huge walk-in closet. The mattress and bedding were fantastic. The decor is classic and high quality. It is not trendy, but I don't agree with others who say it is "dated" either. We had lots of privacy and quiet. We didn't interact much with the staff, but when we did, we found them polite and helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed in several Fairmont properties across Canada, USA and were not surprised to find the Fairmont Dallas to be anything but your typical Fairmont deal. The building was ideally located in the arts district of Dallas. In easy walking distance from the rail system, Historic sites and the American Airlines Centre. The room was comfortable with plenty of storage space, we are used to a power shower and found the shower lacking, however the hotel is "green" so we did save water. Staff at the hotel were excellent. We arrived late having missed our connection from Atlanta and just wanted to go to bed. We have a smooth check in considering the place was alive with wedding parties. The breakfast buffet at $21 was okay, and you could order basically what you wanted. A good hotel in a prime location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am from Dallas and have been to all of the nicer hotels downtown for business... Was recently at the fairmont for a 3 day regional sales meeting. The food was poor, okay to say the least. The valet service and check in were below average, slow and unprepared. Also, items were stolen out of the room that they claimed to be unresponsible for. If I left it in the room, and then it was gone, they didn't take responsibility for their staffs actions at all. Very poor service and accommodations for the level this hotel is perceived to be at. Cool banquet rooms but I will be disappointed if our company holds another meeting of this magnitude there. We all missed the Westin Hotel very much, but they couldn't accommodate the number of people we had attending. Sadly to say neither could the fairmont. Will never stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent stay in this hotel, we booked something that was a bit above average price so expected a decent hotel, and we were pleasantly suprised by the standard of the Fairmont. great customer service, lovely rooms, friendly staff. Also nice swimming pool and pool service. i got the feeling this predominantlly a hotel for businness men/women but there were also a fair amount of friend/families/couples there too. location very good, your in downtown dallas pretty much. only downer was the wifi wasnt free,but thats a minor and theres a free internet room in the lobby, unlimited internet if needed. The breakfast was perfectly cooked and the bar was nice to have a drink in the lobby. obviously there are cheaper options in dallas downtown but for the slight extra you seriouslly cant go wrong with this hotel, was worth paying the extra 30 or 40 bucks</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We previously stayed in the lovely Magnolia Dallas for the Turkey Trot, and it matched the Fairmont's special Trot price. This year, the Magnolia won't do that (even though we're long-time guests...but that's the next review I'm writing). So we contacted the Fairmont. Who first quoted a rate which was $30 higher than the special Trot rate they offer on the Trot website. Then agreed that OK, maybe they DID have a lower rate, after we showed them the Fairmont promo on the Trot page. When we expressed regret for the length of the call (keep in mind - it was THEIR ignorance of their own pricing that dragged things out), the rep said "Indeed I do have other customers to help." Well, OK, then consider yourself free to go help them. Because we won't be staying at the Fairmont. Now or ever. Rude. And either disingenous or uninformed about major event pricing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">By far one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. Not sure where to begin because everything was superb. Great location within walking distance of many places. Right around the corner is the fantastic restaurant Stephan Pyles. JFK Museum just a 10-minute walk, as is the entire Historic District with many other restaurants. The staff here goes out of their way to welcome you and greet you every day, from Front Desk people to Housekeeping, etc. The rooms are spotless and well appointed. The beds are so comfortable you might not want to get up in the morning! The hotel bar and restaurant, Pyramid, has great food for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Or if you'd rather like something light there is a Starbucks off the lobby to get a coffee and pastry in the morning. I honestly cannot think of anything that was negative. I would not stay anywhere else in Dallas.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for a Saturday night in June. Had a suite on the 15th floor (Galveston Suite). Enormous room, 4 phones, 2 flat-screen TV sets, sofa & loveseat, full-size dining table, walk-in closet, marble bathroom. Staff was very helpful and efficient. Only glitch was valet parking when I was leaving Saturday night to meet friends at a restaurant. Called ahead from my room, 20 minutes before I was to leave, and it still took an additional 20 minutes of waiting in the heat before my car finally arrived; was late to the event as a result. Probably just a one-time thing; other times when I used this service they were very quick. The pool was wonderful, and pool-side dining was excellent. Also had room-service breakfast which was very elegant, delicious, and delivered promptly with style. The king-size bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Would love to return and stay again when I'm in Dallas.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Fairmont is an elegant hotel with friendly and helpful, staff. The rooms are spacious and have extremely comfortable beds. There is a very nice terrace with swimming pool, shady seating areas and a herb garden - this was the highlight of the hotel for me - the perfect place to relax. The hotel is situated in the Downtown area of Dallas and is convenient for the Dart train and the McKinney Trolley - making visiting different areas of the city easy. The historic area and arts district are in easy walking distance - including the JFK museum which is well worth a visit. The hotel breakfast was quite expensive but the YMCA round the corner did a good burrito, freshly squeezed juice and delicious yoghurt smoothies. There is also a Starbucks on the corner of the hotel. There are few shops and cafes nearby because of the nature of the business area and this was the only slight downside to our stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall, we were very pleased with our recent stay at the Dallas Fairmont, located in downtown Dallas. The hotel is very clean, and our room was spacious with floor to ceiling windows (room 1910). The pool was good, but not spectacular; it could use a little modernization. I was very impressed with the level of service. The staff, from the valet to the concierge, were all extremely friendly and helpful. I appreciated that they even remembered my name and greeted me on arrival and departure. We ordered room service for twice and were very impressed both times. I emailed Phillip, one of the concierges, prior to our arrival with some questions and his responses were helpful and efficient. Keep in mind that the area around the hotel is pretty dead on weekends. We struggled finding a place within walking distance to have breakfast. We don't travel to Dallas very often, but we would definitely stay at the Fairmont again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very good hotel in Downtown Dallas”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed here a couple of times on business. From the moment you arrive, the staff are excellent, especially the room service staff. The hotel is big, but comfortable. It is close to most downtown locations, so you can walk from the hotel to where you need to be, but I'd feel uncomfortable walking to/from the hotel late at night. I have to point out that the room service is excellent, especially for a hotel in this part of the country. They have surprisingly healthy options on the menu, which are really tasty. As I mentioned before, the room service staff is really top notch. The rooms are what you'd expect from a Fairmont, though avoid the ones by the swimming pool during the summer where there are often kids out late at night. Cleanliness is a major factor for me, and this hotel was very clean and well-kept. Unless you or your company wants to pay for the Ritz Carlton, this is the only hotel to stay at in Downtown Dallas.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice upscale hotel very close to the museum district - I'd give it 3 & a half stars if I could. I was in Dallas to see the Caravaggio show at the Kimbell Museum in Fort Worth but we also went to the Dallas Museum of Art, Crow Collection of Asian art & Nasher Sculpture Museum, all of which were easy walking distance from the Fairmont. I asked the concierge how to get to the Kimbell on public transportation & he sent me a few blocks away to the bus station - apparently no one had ever asked such a thing before in Texas's car culture. (It was relatively easy to do, although the trains & buses do NOT run on Sundays!!) The room was very nice & the gym was fine, but for the price we paid breakfast & wifi would have been nice. The neighborhood is not that great - kind of deserted & seedy on weekends. We ate dinner in the bar both nights as there were no local restaurants that looked vegetarian-friendly - tasty food & cocktails, not too pricey.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just came back from a 2 night stay at Fairmont. We got a good deal on the Fairmont Gold level room, and absolutely loved it. I would not stay without the Gold level because you get such great amenities in the lounge. We had breakfast (hot and cold), snacks, and desserts available every night. Loved the cappucino machine!! The people were all so very nice and provided everything we asked for with no problems, even allowing for late check out to let us enjoy the aquarium on the last day. It turned out that we needed a late check out because our daughter got "pooped on" standing below a bird at the aquarium, and needed a shower after we got back. Thank you for that! The only slight complaint that I had was the there was a stain on the carpet in the room, and it was obvious to see, which took away from the luxury feel. Other than that, I loved the slippers, potpouri in the closet, umbrella (just in case), robes, thick towels, rain shower, and the nice smelling lotion!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Fairmont for about a week while in town for a business conference. When we pulled up, all the valets were very helpful and pleasant. The front desk was so-so, felt as if they were indifferent. Walking into the room, I was slightly disappointed with the television size and room decor, mini bar fridge was not working, smelt as if something had died in it.. Bathroom size was average, but the amenities were gross. Shampoo, Conditioner, Lotion smelt awful, and felt like watered down products that didnt work to clean, but were there for decoration only. As I was staying there, I noticed most of the other guest were at least 45 or older, so there wasn't noise issues, but just felt like I was in an expensive assisted living facility. Most positive experience was room service staff. I order a min of 1-2 per day, and staff on phone as well as delivery staff were very kind, and had great personalities. As for my overall experience, it was just a little above average... I Would stay there if I had to, but just wondering if I could find a more contemporary hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very comfortable rooms and amenities at the Fairmont. The location is central to restaurants and businesses in the downtown Dallas area. Most restaurants are in walking distance (about .25 to .5 miles away) which can also be reached by cable cars that run on St. Paul. Internet access is also provided for free to club members (which is free). Restaurant and bar food and drinks were okay and we did not find it worth the price. We encountered a couple of issues with service. Our first issue was with the Bar. It took over 15 minutes before anyone came to take our order, then our server disappeared and it took us another 15 minutes to track down someone who was willing to help us. So we didn't have the opportunity to order additional drinks or food. Also, we noticed several inefficiencies with the valet service. Although it didn't impact me directly, I noticed that their disorganization caused significant back-ups in the valet and drive through area for the hotel which is already small to begin with. Be prepared to wait a while if you are looking to pull through during peak times.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay at the Fairmont was almost perfect. The staff were the most courteous and helpful of any hotel at which we've stayed. The concierge gave great recommendations on dining and things to do in the area and check in and out was smooth and easy. The room (a standard room with two queen beds) was much larger than rooms at comparably priced hotels and we really enjoyed a relaxing time. Two reasons prohibit me from giving this hotel 5 stars. (I won't even mention the $21 a night parking. I realize that this is the case pretty much anywhere, but it's highway robbery. At least the valet service was excellent and efficient). First of all - why charge for high speed internet when you're already getting $120 for the room (not counting parking)? That seems a bit greedy and unnecesary. Secondly, they charged me for a local phone call! It only amounted to fifty cents, but still. In a hotel this nice and service oriented you would think that internet and local calls should be included. Overall though - this was a great stay, we fully intend to return, and heartily recommend the Fairmont to anyone.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Bathrooms a little out-dated.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Fairmont Hotel - Dallas for a sales meeting with my company. The hotel room itself was very cozy and a nice size. The bed was comfortable and the TV was a nice flatscreen. The one thing that seemed strange in this nice hotel room was the crummy bathroom. After waking up feeling like a mature adult, I ventured into the bathroom and had a time warp into my college days. The toilet looked like something that belonged in a public bathroom and the shower head reminded me of dorm showers - you need to block your skin so as not to get seared by the spray! Maybe I'm being picky but when you walk into a room where to unlock the door all you need to do is wave your key in front of the lock you would expect the bathroom to be a little more 'up to date'. All of that being said, the room service was prompt and tasty. The meeting rooms were very nice and the hotel was very accomodating for our extremely large group. Everything was in either walking distance or a short cab-ride away. One quick tip - become a member of the Fairmount President's Club to get free internet access while at the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for one night, 11 years to the day of our wedding. I tried to get the same room. They did their best to accomodate us, but there was en error on my part on the room number (not the name of the suite), and we ended up on the opposite side. They were very nice and tried, but our room was already booked. Awwwww. This hotel is very nice for an older hotel and is very close to major attractions in the heart of downtown. Walking distance to the arts district, close to West End and American Airlines Center/Victory Park, etc. The rooms while being older are nicely appointed. The suites have small bathrooms! The Terrace Level pool and herb garden is a nice touch. A (relatively) calm haven in the busy city. Be advised that it is close to a highway, so you may hear traffic noises, sirens from a fire station a couple blocks away, etc. The lobby areas are nice and the Pyramid Grill was nice the last time we were there a few years ago. Valet service was prompt and courteous. All in all, it was a good stay and nice to be back there after all those years. Maybe we will return and try again for the 15 or 20 year!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I found the Fairmont to be a little long in the tooth. The lobby was cool but the upper floor hallways were hot and the room was about 78 degrees even though the thermostat was set on 70 when I entered. When I got to my room the first time, the key wasn't programmed so I had to return to the front desk once again. Forgot my hairspray so I thought I'd pick one up at the gift shop - $10.00 for a $.99 can of Aquanet! The room never cooled down and there was no fan in the room. Made for a long, hot night. The staff were friendly and very service oriented but within the first fifteen minutes, I had to tip the Head Valet, the Bell Boy and since I was not allowed to go to my car that was parked in the garage to get my laptop, I had to ask someone to get it and there went another tip. The restaurant was very overpriced, a breast of chicken with a 1/4c of lentils = $20 plus tax plus tip. Should have ordered a salad via room service as there really weren't a whole lot of options close by that I could see. The best part about this hotel is that it was a block and half away from my early morning appointment, other than that - not impressed.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ok the good list: Valet/concierge and room service customer service was outstanding! Location was ok, not much shopping in close proximity, bars/clubs are a $7 to $10 dollar cab ride one way. The room rate was a fair price. Yep thats the whole good list. Ok the bad list: I was not informed when I made res that there was a gay/lesbian convention goin on at the hotel, I have nothing against that but when your having a girls weekend away its not ideal! They took the lounge chairs and towels off the pool deck around 11 am to make way for the gay/lesbian party that was going on later which I could hear from my 17th floor room well into the night. The pool was bitter cold, there is no hot tub and half of the day the pool area is in the shade. Nobody came to take food or drink order poolside. When i found somebody and asked for towels and water they acted as if I was a bother. The room had no microwave or useable frige only a very expensive mini bar. The bathroom was extremely small, there are no balconies, the lounge bartenders were RUDE AS HECK! I dont see this being a four star hotel, just 4 star prices! I would not recommend this hotel nor will i ever stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Second buisness trip to Fairmont Dallas in 3 weeks, both stays were bad. First stay room OK but awakened by engineering pounding on something in the hallway at 7am! complaints to front desk did no good. Also Valet parking was terrible took about 45 minutes to get my car after calling 20 minutes ahead! Come on people some of us have to get to work! Current trip I am in 4th room to finally get something marginally acceptable. First room had bad mildew stench, set my allergies off just opening the door, actually just getting off the elevator. the whole south 4th floor smells bad. Second room had a big wad of tissue like a spitball stuck to the wall by the bathroom, yellow water in the toilet and lots of missing towels. The third room had unbelievably a huge cigarette burn, ON THE BATHTUB! There were actually many burn and melt marks in the tub! Nice! My request to get a manager to come to my room and look at the tub were ignored but the front desk took me on a tour of available rooms to find clean one. Some luxury hotel. I stay in hotels usually 230 to 260 nights a year, I have rarely seen hotels in such run down condition. Maybe I have been lucky for the last 20 years.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Fairmont is a nice historic hotel in the arts district of Dallas. I had a 2 queen bed room which was comfortable and not crowded. There was a separate area near the entrance to the room where the desk was to work with your laptop. The TV is Hi Def with most all of the channels in Hi def. The shower has a fully adjustable head so it can be adjusted for height. Tall or short people will have no problems with the shower. HVAC was quiet and worked well. The bar adjacent to the lobby is nice with 2 TVs on sports channels most of the time. The menu is limited if you want to eat their. Mostly burgers and sandwiches with a few salads. For a better meal the Pyramid restaurant next to the bar offers a high end dining experience but it is pricey. The food and service at Pyramid is great. There is a Starbucks located in the hotel if you want a less expensive breakfast or lunch. Internet works well but was over $15/day. I tried to wander around the hotel but there is not much around. The 2 restaurants I tried to go to were closed (it was a Sunday) plus there are a lot of Urban Outdoorsmen wandering around so I decided to stay close at the hotel for the remainder of my time here.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I will caveat this post with: I am a Fairmont platinum member. I stay in a Fairmont very regularly. But I have never stayed in this particular one before. The parking is all valet - a great convenience, unless you have to unpack your car, which has to be done in front of everyone in the lobby. Check-in was easy and nice, and they are great about allowing dogs. The hotel, room, bathroom was very...tired. I just think this Fairmont is in need of a facelift. We stayed in a suite, which was large, but it just had an "old" feeling to it. They really need to do an upgrade to this hotel and restore it to its previous grandeur. I remember coming to brunch here as a kid, and it being the nicest hotel around. It's still nice, but not the immaculate, to-the-nines Fairmont that I am used to staying in all the time (DC). We did have some issues with their service (they made me chase down people in the lobby and then the bar to get a corkscrew), but the manager rectified the situation upon checkout and was very professional about the issue. It did not color our stay at all, given the response from the staff. Overall, decent if you can get a good rate, but I wouldn't pay full freight for this property. Stay at the new W in Dallas instead!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I booked this hotel for the downtown Dallas location, which turned out to be great... Most other hotels in the area are either much more expensive (the W) or slightly lower end.... Just a note, the West End district (bars, restaurants and shops) is within walking distance, but the Greenville section (tons of bars and clubs, if that's your scene) is not - which is what we were told by the lobby bartender. Cabride to Greenville is approx. 15 minutes, as opposed to 5. Also, if you want to enjoy a nice breakfast outside the hotel, you have almost zero options (we ended up walking the McKinney Avenue "free trolley" route - the trolley never showed - to an area where we stumbled upon a French creperie (not my idea of a great breakfast, but it worked). Dealy Plaza and the American Airlines Center are also within walking distance. Above all, we were suprised by the quality of the hotel for the price we paid. For the same $115 a night we would have spent on a lower caliber chain hotel on the east coast (where we are from), we got a higher class hotel, king room, all the amenities you can ask for - perfect for a weekend getaway. maybe it's the southwest economy? either way, i'd recommend the fairmont to leisure and business travelers (also seems close to alot of downtown corportations).</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I went to the Fairmont for a conference and was very satisfied. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful from the second I arrived. There was not a hotel shuttle from the DFW airport and the front desk recommended an express shuttle that I never saw at the airport. Plan on taking a cab or driving to the hotel. The room was a decent size and it was clean. It had almost all of the amenities I needed including an iron, a hairdryer and a sizable desk. The desk chair left something to be desired and the extra charge for an internet connection seems odd at a conference hotel. I ordered room service for breakfast the first morning and it hit the spot. Even the healthy breakfast had generous portions although it should for the price. The conference food was also quite good for such large scale service. The view from the 4th floor was nonexistent, so request a higher floor if that is important to you. There was a bit of noise from the hall outside and housekeeping is persistant, so use that Do Not Disturb sign! The 4th floor terrace and swimming pool are a lovely spot to get some fresh air although it wasn't quite swimming weather. The best part of this hotel was the bed. Do not lay down if you are not planning on falling asleep immediately! I never sleep well, even at home. If there was a way to smuggle that bed home I would have done it!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Good: (1) Very pleasant and professional staff. From check in to check out - the bar, the restaurant, the valet, the housekeepers, etc - all are great. (2) The bar in the lobby is nice. The food is affordable and good. Careful what you ask for from the beer menu - they had none of the bottles listed on the menu that I asked for - and I asked for four different brews. (3) The room was spotless and cleaned well everyday. It is a bit annoying that I was out of my room from 8am to noon on most days and found my room not cleaned until after that often. Still, the housekeeping staff does a great job and I was impressed with their attention to detail. (4) Location is great. Easy walk to west end - many good places to eat - the art museum, the aquarium, other hotels, etc. Valet is expensive but only half what you'd pay in most East coast cities, so it is all relative. (5) Other guests all seem to be happy - evidence to me that they are enjoying their stay. The Not as Good: (1) The hotel is older - so while it is nice, it lacks some modern flair. The rooms are dated...again nice, with flat panel HD's, but the bathroom tub in my rooms struggled to drain. The air conditioning simply could not keep up with the 100+ degree sun beating on the windows all day. It was well into the evening until the room cooled off. Id recommend this hotel to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just got back to Boston from Dallas today and as tired as I am, I wanted to write this review. I am VERY picky person when it comes to cleanliness and safety and The Fairmont is a pretty nice hotel, the room I was in (King bed) was a good size fairly update and there was a few dumb things like the pool being drained and re-tiled, flat panel tv was nice, and the room was clean- except I have to be honest, they do need to vacuum around the bed frame legs... anyhow I always wear slippers, but, it was clean, the bed had failry crisp white down feather pillows and blankets, in another review someone complained about the throw at the end of the bed being dirty, I think its the fabric that makes it appear that way...crushed velvet type of fabric. Anyhow, I went to the Hyatt at Reunion Blvd, where my colleagues where staying and it was nasty- the rooms were old and dated, and a street person was roaming the lobby asking for money! The Fairmont is really safe, they dont even allow pizza delivery people up to the rooms, you have to come down to get it. The bellman is an older man and the valet guy as well, both are really helpful and awesome! Checking in was a breeze, but make sure you check your itemized bill, they accidently charged me for 1 day of parking @ $21.00- I called the desk and it was taken care of before I checked out... Check out was so simple, no waiting at all.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am a very fussy hotel guest but the hotel was near perfect. I originally booked a one bed suite, as I am a member of their presidents club they have my preferences stored, within a couple of days of booking they contacted me to advise that all of their one bedroom suites connected to another room which I hate and is on my list of preferences they offered me several options non of which costing any more. I took the Gold floor option, a very nice room very modern ( which isnt my taste but very comfortable ) and a great view over Dallas. I explained to the manager of the gold floors what I wanted to do and within minutes of telling her she came back with maps and directions to the sites and attractions, even where the nearest drug store was because I had a headache !!

Upon checking out the doorman asked me where I was travelling to when I said dallas love field airport he offered one of their sedan cars and he said that the cost was only two dollars more than a regular cab what a nice way to travel to the airport. My only slight let down was on my second night I thought that I would go down to the bar for a martini bet everywhere was full to bursting and very very noisy this is because the hotel has a lot of conference business, but that said i cannot reccomend this hotel more !!!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Comparable To The Marriott”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">They think of themselves as a Ritz or Four Seasons, but they are really a Marriott equivalent. The concierge can arrange champagne, but if you're hoping they will add you to any private club lists, forget it. Perfect location - located a few blocks from the McKinney Streetcar (St. Paul N of Ross) , which you can take to Perry's, Sambuca, the Ritz, Theater Three, West Village and the bars along McKinney. The Fairmont is a short cab ride from the Arts District (Wyly Theater, Winspear Opera House, Dallas Museum of Art, Nasher Sculpture Center and the AT&T Performing Arts Center. If you are older, a cab to Reunion Tower, Nieman Marcus, Iron Cactus, the Adolpho and the PM Lounge beneath the Joule Hotel are options. If you're 20-something, Zouk's, American Airlines Center and the Hotel W are not far away, not to mention RJ's Mexican Restaurant in the West End. The DART rail is 4.5 blocks south. This is a family-friendly hotel. I recommend the junior suite. Rates were very reasonable ($119 a night). Disappointed that we didn't have an iPOD stand and that refrigerators were extra. The pool was nice. They don't have a spa, so I recommend going to the Hilton Anatole for that. They don't have indoor tennis, so go to the Irving Four Seasons. The outdoor whirlpool needs to be a lot bigger and it would be nice if there were a water fall or something. The view is awesome. If you want a great hotel for your money, this is the place.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Customer Service is bar none!!!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked a room for my husband & I for Valentine's. Before our visit I arranged with Phillip in the concierge dept an in room massage for my husband and I. He was also very helpful with other information. We arrived and were treated like royalty! Very helpful staff & friendly! The hotel is aged a little but the customer service makes up for it hands down!! The bed was very comfortable & the liens soft. Room was very clean. The only issue I had was that the massage therapist named Sarah tried to cheat me on my 90 min massage but Phillip not only adjusted the different between the 60 massage I received but also took off the amount of the tip that I gave her plus more!!! He was one of the best concierge's I have ever had the privilege to work with. Everyone really cared to listen to me and made me feel very important. So the only suggestion I would recommend is that if you get an in room massage which is pricey but sooooo worth it, is to make sure the therapist can come up shortly before your schedule time and reenforce the time amount with the therapist. Check the time before & after. If they cheat you then take it up with them at that time. Also don't pay them directly charge it to your room so if you do have an issue with them the hotel can address it. Again I can not stress how great the customer service was, everyone from James at the bar which made the best mudslides I've ever had to the valet guys which had my car johnny on the spot to Phillip....I can't wait until we can go back!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed for 2 nights over the weekend. It is a beautiful hotel and well polished, inside and out. I opted for the standard king, was on the 10th floor. The view was of downtown Dallas and it was beautiful. Our room was clean, the furniture was updated and even the night stand tables had granite tops. The entry into the hotel is also clean, and the service fantastic. Parking is available for 24 per night and all taxes, fees included unlike some of the other hotels. The valet available any time and the only complaint is that they do take about 15 mins to get your car. We were there the weekend they had an event and they said they had over 400 cars and for that reason they messed up pulling up my car. Because elf this our table at bolsa almost got given away. I had to ask to speak w the manager and after telling them we were waiting for 25 mins they told me they didn't know where my car was. They offered and paid for the cab. However that screwed up the rest of the nights plans as we were going to a show after dinner and I had to come back to hotel after dinner to get car. We missed the show. So just remember if they Have an event, you may have to wait for 30 mins for valet to bring your car. The neighborhood is near the arts district but nothing immediately next to it for bars/ nightlife. Walk about 6 blocks and it will get you to downtown Dallas where there are more bars. We did not get to use the pool or the exercise facilties. We were still happy for the rate we got and we will be back.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having read some previous reviews, we stayed on a newly remodeled Gold floor. Our rate was $139 and we also belong to the Fairmont President's Club. The rooms are well appointed and updated in a neutral tones. We had a corner king room with excellent views in two directions. The food presentations in the club lounge are excellent and second only to the Ritz in quality. The club rooms at other hotels nearby are nowhere near the quality of the Fairmont. The restaurant Pyramid is very well reviewed in the Dallas Press and currently running a four course $40 prix fixe menu to celebrate the Fairmont 40th Anniversary. It's a wonderful offer. The Fairmont has an excellent and quite large gym along with a large outdoor pool. Given their normal rates, it pays to do a little shopping online for specials which are easily had in this economy. We enjoyed the rooms, our incredible bath robes, free internet, soft down pillows etc. It's all a lovely experience. There is twice daily maid service and with one phone call we had anything we requested without waiting any longer than 5 minutes. Very impressive. We were surprised by how quickly the valets had the car each time we called, even with the hotel being quite full and handling three weddings that we counted. Don't worry about the previous people who seemed to have numerous complaints for one wrong or the other, we did not experience anything close to these experiences and again, I would do a little a shopping online and definitely book a Gold level floor it is well worth the extra amount you'll pay.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Mixed bag: Lovely Room but...”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A long review but trying to be fair as I am normally a big fan of this chain. Went to Dallas for a special art exhibit & just to play tourist & the Fairmont was within 2 blocks of Fine Art museum & had a great rate offer for a suite. Perfect! Then I read the TA reviews and got nervous, but as first night was at another hotel, thought I'd keep the suite for major portion of stay & look it over day before checking in. Did & everything looked great. Upon check-in, suite I was shown was lovely but was advised that the new Gold floor was open and would I like to upgrade. Looked at that suite - wow, stunning! Took the beautiful new suite. Really outstanding decor and club floor was great for breakfast & nightly appetizers. OK, so for the negative: room A/C did not work very well entire stay; if it had been summer, oh boy, room would have been unbearable. Gold floors were still undergoing final "tweaking" so there were minor to major inconveniences: no elevator one day-hiked down 3 flights to lower floor; hot, scalding water in bathroom sink one morning (yikes!) and sadly, not very knowledge staff in Gold Lounge (although they did refer us to main concierge for help.) Response to all our daily issues/problems was polite, quick & fixed as much as possible, but some things, just weren't fixable. So, while room was great & hotel is lovely, not sure I'd stay again just because, heat, A/C, water are pretty basic requirements & having inconsistent basic necessities really cuts back on quality of stay. Too bad because the Gold floor is a real addition to hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 nights and had booked a smoking room yeah i know how bad it is but well we were on holidays and the option was there. I found the check in staff quiet abrupt, she growled that firstly she did'nt think they took travellers cheques and that she did'nt have a smoking room because they were busy, fair enough but i had gone to the trouble of phoning to enquire about both issuses and was told neither was a problem. The receptionist stomped around because i had a few traveller cheques to sign and then gave me a key and i had to ask her what floor, i found her attitude a bit crap and i was after an 11 hour flight with stopover and delays. The room was nice but small and the bed was small for a kingsize but squash in and it was comfy. We had a corner room so maybe avoid this type. The bathroom was small but spotless with nice selection of toilitries and towels. Concierge desk was a breath of fresh air very polite and helpful. The hotel itself is lovely a bit of old fashioned glamour in a handy location quiet close to Dealey Plaza and there is tourist office also near Dealey Plaza which was convient . Breakfast outside the hotel is mission impossible,however if you walk towards Dealey Plaza there is a carpark on open ground and on it in a corner is a strange almost invisible little blue and white hut which was fab...looks aren't everything as you stand outside,my husband has a serious food allergy so we can't just eat anywhere. For restaurants there are a few nice ones just 4/5 minutes stroll from the hotel and they are lovely.Not a lot to do downtown at the weekends its a bit deserted. Overall we had a good time ,hotel is nice and well kept</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Wonderful Upscale Hotel - Centrally Located”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here on business. The rooms were spacious, clean, beautifully decorated...a wonderful room. Pillowtop mattress was comforatble and the pillows were nice, although the sheets were no very soft. The bathtub was on the shallow side for those interested in a long hot soak...ok, but not great. There was only one available plug in the desk area, a common problem. And the internet was not free - also a problem in my mind. The only other issue, is one that haunts every hotel on the market these days, which is the presence of LED lights which light up the room at night. The placement of these LEDs (smoke detectors only - no clock or thermostat LEDs here) wasn't that bad. But I was woken from a deep sleep and opened my eyes to stare into one. I have been in hotels where this is a major problem - just a minor one here. The location was very nice. A short walk to alot of restaurants and the art museum. Even though you are surrounded by office buildings, there is a lot of architecturally interesting things to see. For example there is a water park next door unlike anything I've ever seen in an office building city scape, and a nice little zen-like park right across the street where the sun streamed in late in the afternoon. It was March and warm in Dallas, and I came from cold and snowy PA, so getting to sit out and soak up a little sun was a nice thing. The breakfast buffet and meals from the menu were very good. And I had a banquet-style lunch at the conference I attended which a nicer banquet meal than I've ever had anywhere. The AA stadium and opera house are a short drive. If you want the perfect downtown hotel experience, this would be it for my money.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great hotel but don't leave store your bags with them”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed 5 nights, part business part pleasure. The hotel service, food, and conference facilities were great although there were some problems with keeping both the hotel rooms and conference rooms chilled enough. Since this is in the middle of a huge heat wave I would not blame the hotel. My problems came later, when I checked out and left my bags in storage. The operation seemed to be somewhat disorganized and against my better judgement I left without ensuring that my storage tickets were attached to my bags. Upon return my luggage could not be found. What ensued was 30 minutes of "deer in headlights" looks from hotel staff, including concierge, with very little explanation as to what was being done and what to expects if my bags could not be found. All I was told was that if my bags were found they would be shipped to me at no charge. Nobody said they were sorry for the inconvenience, gave me their name, business card, phone number so that I could follow up, etc. Throughout I had the feeling that everyone just wished I would go away. When I mentioned that I missed my airport shuttle I was told that I should just take the next one. When a woman from security took pity on me and put me in the cab she got evil looks from concierge as if she was doing something totally unacceptable. The good news was that just as I was about to leave for the airport without my bags, the shuttle driver returning from the airport arrived with the missing luggage. Apparently the hotel gave my bags to another hotel guest and loaded them on the airport shuttle. It was not until the guest arrived at the airport s/he realized that it was the wrong luggage. Hope the hotel shipped it to them at no charge.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice hotel, horrid valet service”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is not the type of hotel that my husband and I typically choose. We were in Dallas for a family thing and decided to stay here since other family members were there. Nice place - but locked, crazy expensive, mini-fridge sort of place. Pros: Very friendly staff, clean rooms, every call we made (fan request, wake-up calls, etc) they were super friendly and accommodating. The coffee in the room was quite tasty - Newman's Own. Very comfortable beds (could have used a firmer pillow - but that is personal preference). Both nights we grabbed drinks at the bar the staff were very nice (even though they were out of a lot and the upholstery in the bar is in the most dire need of cleaning). Cons: When we checked in we asked for a good Mexican restaurant and we were directed to El Fenix. Turns out it is a local chain - and it is horrible. We did not ask for any other recommendations after that. The wait for your car at valet is RIDICULOUS (and there is no street parking for quick in-and-out trips). Yesterday, we went down at 10:40am and waited for 30 minutes for our car. We were told that we could call ahead of time, so the next day we did. Called down at 11ish to say we would like our car ready in 20 minutes. Went down, and they claimed they never got the call! Proceeded to wait 20 minutes for the car. Biggest annoyance to my husband was, rather than apologizing for the wait - the drivers just looked immediately to your hand. I am a generous tipper - but not when someone expects a tip regardless of service. People can smoke right outside the front doors - this results in the lobby smelling like an old cigar. Also, those of us waiting up to 30 minutes for our car get to hang out in a smokey area. Thanks Dallas.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at the Fairmont three times in the past three months. Once I got a kind of tired room in the south tower. The second time I got a club level room in the north tower (verrry nice). The third time I got what looked like an updated room in the south tower. Things I like: the first and third rooms; the club lounge food, drink , and kind hostesses; the fact the bellmen and front desk staff remembered me on my third visit; the lobby was a comfortable place to wait to meet people or just to hang out and read; room service got my food to me quickly, and it was tasty and hot; the mini-bar is well-stocked; the bed and bedding were very comfortable and nice quality-feeling; bathroom is good-sized and the towels are above-average; the wireless was easy to access; nice TVs; the bartenders were super-nice, one even made me a glass of lemonade from scratch (it was outstanding!). Things that were misses. The "business center" is incredibly over-priced ($30 to receive a small UPS box that held two binders, and then the shipping people took forever to bring it, finally the cashier in the business center went to get it). I think the restaurant menu could be a little broader, and that the breakfast buffet is ok, but could have more variety and be presented more attractively; after 10 pm or so, if you call room service, you get the hotel operator, who then has room service personnel call you back. My room had some sort of ventilation thing that I couldn't control, so there was quite a bit of white noise; it didn't bother me, but light sleepers probably would not like it. On balance, I think this hotel has a lot of good qualities, and I was very comfortable staying here, especially when I had the nicer rooms. The first visit was a little underwhelming.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great location but rooms need some TLC”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location of the hotel was great, right next to the trolley which we used a lot and within walking distance of many sites. Upon check-in we were charged an additional $50/night for a 'just-in-case' deposit...I've stayed at numerous other Fairmont properties and never had to provide an additional deposit, so keep that in mind when you are checking-in, but the front desk assured us that the $300 would be reversed from our credit card within a few weeks...thanks guys. When we got to our room, we noticed that the bathtub had what appeared to be blood/coffee/? splattered all over it! We were given another room but this didn't leave us with a good feeling. The room was a nice size and had a great view but things like the wallpaper peeling off, baseboards being full of dust and no fan in the bathroom causing a mold-like smell to be unleashed whenever you showered left a lot to be desired. The first night I had problems with my key. I went to the front desk to get it reset which, apparently they did, but it still didn't work. I went back down again to get a new card but instead was given a lesson on how to work a hotel swipe card and was told that security had to let me into my room and to go up to my room and wait by the door for them. After waiting a while, security finally came to let me in. They said that my card was faulty and needed to get a new card from front desk...this is what I wanted in the first place!!! Also has trouble with the tv...it wouldn't turn on. After a call to front desk and another lesson from them, this time on how to turn on a television the finally sent up their 'engineer' who dicovered that the cables had been unplugged from the back of the tv. The bell staff and concierge desk were the best part of the hotel...extremely helpful and knowledgable!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had never stayed at this hotel before but chose to stay there after receiving a special offer via e-mail. Our charge was $99/night incluing valet parking. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the most friendly staff and had an easy check in. The motel itself is centrally located to downtown and is convenient to many attractions including Stephen Pyles restaurant, the World Aquarium, The Museum of Art, Fair Park and nearby access to Interstate 45 which connects easily to the rest of Dallas. The room was clean, spacious with very nice accomodations and comfortable bed. The motel is absolutely gorgeous, with a focus on modern art for their lobby area and the pool area is breathtaking in the evening with all the lit up skyscrapers as your view. Lounge area is open to the lobby and has lots of activity without it being packed full of rowdy drunks. It was actually the first time I enjoyed the lounge at a hotel. The service was prompt, friendly and warm in all areas of the motel (including lounge). Just beware...since this is a beautiful motel numerous weddings and celebrations take place there. I am sure the reason we received such a discount is because there were five weddings and two graduation celebrations scheduled during our visit. However, the motel in general is very quiet on the room floors and the only inconvenience we experienced was at valet parking (they were very busy!). But patience and kindness goes along way and, eventually, service is provided by a very friendly staff. Or better yet, schedule your arrival/departure to accomodate. So before you stay, check on the scheduled events and get a discount if you can...paying less goes a long way in making a person more accomodating. In the end, I can't wait to go back...I've stayed at a lot of nice motels but the service at this one stands out and makes me want to return. This place actually has their customer in mind!</p></li>
