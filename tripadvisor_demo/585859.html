The room was big, great bathroom.The room faced the road so there was traffic noise. The only drawback was that there is no restuarant so no matter how tired you are you have to go out to eat. The hotel staff are all very friendly and helpful and speak excellent English. Staying in such a nice hotel added to our enjoyment of such a beautiful city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is right across from the Vatican and close to several great restaurants. The rooms are small (as in all Rome hotels) but nice. Very good breakfast. Hotel can book a car to and from airport - although it will be quite expensive if you have a very early flight. You might want to keep this in mind as you make your flight reservations. Otherwise, use the early car. It is worth the extra that it will cost.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Right beside the entrance to the Vatican Museum and only a short walk to St Peters. We were given a huge room with a fabulous bathroom (large bath). The staff were pleasant and helpful. They arranged a tour of the museum which bypassed the enormous queue. Breakfast was good. There were no evening meals but the reception staff recommended very good restaurants close by. We were about 15 mins by metro from the city centre.</p></li>

It can be a bit noisy, I dont thinks the rooms are sound proofed and the hallways are not carpeted. The breakfast is good, and there was a good selection. This is a nice city hotel.</p></li>

Everything was spotless and clean. Reception was always friendly and helpful with advice. Hotel is located directly across from the Vatican Museum, making it convenient to all Vatican tours. Metro is nearby, but we used taxis to get around. Furthest trip was an 8euro ride to the Colloseum. Alimandi offers a free airport shuttle as well. No surprises at this hotel, pure pleasure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was great from start to finish! I arranged the hotel to pick us up at the airport, which only costs 10 euros a person! The driver was there just after you clear customs, with a sign with our name. The staff was great, they allowed us to check in very early, which was great because we flew all night. Also, the staff was very helpful with any questions we had. The breakfast was the best hotel breakfast I've had in Europe. To top it off, the location was great! I would recommend to pre-pay and save yourself some money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I were guests at the Hotel Alimandi for two weeks in January 2006. We have stayed in many hotels, bed and breakfasts, etc. Hotel Alimandi out-performs all of them. The front desk staff are professional, yet personal and helpful. They converse in your native language, whatever it may be. They are helpful in suggesting places to eat, shop, visit. The full breakfast each morning is way above average. We felt like we were home and were treated as family while we were there. It will definitely be our hotel of choice when we return to Rome!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Alimandi during my stay in Rome in February. As far as location, it is steps from the vatican and the sistine chapel. It is also extremely clean and the staff there speaks English and is very 'Sympatico". I especially liked the chef at breakfast, Fernando.. who is friendly and accomodating. I loved this hotel and would stay there again. Because I have family in umbria, I have stayed in Italy at least 30 times, and this is the best hotel in Rome for the money. OH.. and the breakfast was excellent!!! Eggs, toast, bacon ... we skipped lunch because we ate so much.</p></li>

Our room was in a terrific location next to the Vatican! The room was first class and the sheets were glorious on a very comfortable mattress. The staff was friendly and helpful and went the extra mile to please my wife and I. The roof top terrace was perfect for sipping a cappicino(excellent) and planning our days. The breakfast buffet was amazing! Recommended restaurants were delicious and not over priced! If your not happy staying here you won't be happy in heaven! We will be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful Hotel! We hated to leave! Everyone who works there is an absolute treasure, from the desk to the restaurant. Rooms are nice and clean --- bathrooms huge. So nice. Everyone so very helpful --- arranged tickets for us to a public audience with the Pope, gave us invaluable tips on sightseeing, restaurants, etc., etc. Really made our trip special. They even took care of our luggage (we were a group of six, so there was a lot!) all day and made all the arrangements for a limo to get us to the airport. My husband was ready to move in permanently! Great location, great food, great staff --- you cannot go wrong here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Alimandi Vaticano in May for 2 nights. We wanted a hotel that was close to the Vatican Museum. This hotel was across the street from the enterance of the museum. The street that the hotel is on is quite busy and noisy, however with the sound proof windows through out the hotel, we heard nothing. Our room was small as expected for Europe, there was lots of closet and drawer space. The bathroom was modern, large and extremly clean. The free buffet breakfast was hugh and delicious, althought they did have a few items that were a little strange for breakfast, ie chicken wings. The staff were warm, friendly and helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very nice rooms, nonsmoking, comfortable beds, all the modern conveniences. Best breakfast boufet with many choices for all travelers. There are rooftop terraces available to relax after a hard day's touring. Restaurants, gelato, bars and cafes all nearby. The Vatican Museum (reportedly the second largest museum in the world) is across the street. Rome is at the doorstep for easy exploration by foot, taxi, bus and metro. The desk personnel were very helpful and provided convenient transfers to and from the airport for us for a minimal fee. Be sure to walk the backstreets with real Romans and enjoy the little shops just a block or so away.</p></li>

They made our trip to Italy a very memorable experience. We were treated with personal attention and care. I encourage anyone traveling to Rome to stay with this family run business. The breakfast was a great way to start our day of walking and seeing the sites. With map in hand and instructions from Sarah or Germano we were on our way! Our rooms were exceptionally clean and quiet. I would request a room off the street. It is more quiet. We also stayed at hotels in Venice and Florence which were 5 stars and Hotel Alimandi Vaticano was the BEST!!</p></li>

The staff are very efficient and friendly and cannot do enough to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. The rooms are spacious and spotless and everything you need for your stay is provided for not only the usual soaps and shampoos but toothbrushes, shaving sets, shoe cleaners and even slippers.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staff are very friendly and helpful. Good sized and very clean room for our family four. Breakfast is good quality and good selection of food. In good weather, roof terrace offers great views of the Vatican. Bar area is more "B&B" style - the front desk staff runs back to the bar to prepare the drinks. Warm, friendly service and you can take your drink to the room or roof terrace. Location is quiet and it's good for the Vatican (and worked well for our family), but not ideal if you want to be in the center of the prime sights of Rome. We booked the hotel's car service for our trip to the airport. Service was prompt, friendly and the car was very clean.</p></li>

Very clean rooms and helpfull staff, marvelous breakfast buffet, a treatment for the day. You can order a shuttle service from the airport to the hotel. It is adviseble to do so instead of taking the subway and train. One feature that amazed us was a cityplan that was given to us whenever you had a question of a specific site by the hotel frontoffice. A splendid location to start a citytrip and explore the ancient sites of Rome. Just opposit the entrance of the Vatican museum. You can see the queues of people waiting there.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I called the hotel from our cell phone while getting lost driving around Rome. They literally stayed on the phone and guided us to the front door.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This Hotel is Excellent. Rome was the last leg of a 2 week trip and we stayed here our last two nights. The front desk people are very helpful... We drove in with a rental car and they arranged to have the rental car company come and pick up the car so we wouldn't waste the time dropping it off ourselves. The hotel is right across the street from the vatican museum so it is in a very good location. The subway is about 5-6 block away (10 minute walk). The room itself is very nice. It had a little balcony, was very clean and had a nice bathroom. Unlike a lot of hotel where the AC is a wall unit, this hotel has central air. The hotel also has a free shuttle to the airport which is really nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I cannot understand why this hotel was No.1 on Trip Advisor for so long! The location isnt the best, OK it is opposite the Vatican but what about the other sites in Rome? The hotel itself was OK, we were greeted with coffee and cake and our room was available at 11am. However, the reception area was being redecorated which meant that you could not go through to the bar during the day. Also the room was so warm that it made it uncomfortable and you couldnt open the window due to the traffic noise, it was like sitting in the middle of the M25! If I was to visit Rome again I would stay somewhere near the Spanish Steps as it has more of a buzzy atmosphere with places to eat and drink and of course shop.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is the place to stay in Rome if you want a quiet, elegant place to come back to at the end of the day. The staff are friendly and helpful but never pushy. The rooms are elegant, simple, comfortable. There is no hard sell, no excess of amenities as in very fancy places. Breakfast is delicious. You will be accross the street from the vatican museum. St. Peters is 10 minutes away. The underground is a few blocks away. Accross nearby bridges are neighborhoods musums and churches where you find everything you want. No its not a "grand hotel" - they give you what you need, when you need it. There is no excess of services you may not use. When we return to Rome, here is where we will be staying. Its home.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a family of four, we found the quad room we had to be large and comfortable. Even though located on a busy street, the hotel has sound-proofed windows. We found the accomodations to be up to the 4-star rating--beautiful bathrooms, comfortable beds, good air conditioning. The breakfast was delicious and ample, as other reviewers have commented. The staff was wonderful and willing to help with whatever we needed. We took the shuttle to the airport, which is a rare benefit for Rome hotels. We enjoyed staying in the Vatican area, but it isn't close to many of the Rome sites. The metro is about four blocks away, and taxis were more convenient to some parts of town. Overall, a great visit and would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a 3 night break at the Alimandi Hotel in Rome. Stayed in a family room which included two comfortable large king beds and a stylish bathroom (good shower). The breakfast buffet was good but more continental style with scrambled eggs! Both reception and restaurant staff were pleasant and helpful. The location is great but at a price because the traffic noise is horrific. The children slept through it but I never slept a wink on the first night. I asked for another room but they all suffer from the same problem. I invested in a pair of good quality ear plugs the following day and managed to sleep thereafter. Great time of year to visit Rome and will definitely return one day, but maybe to another hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I just returned from our second straight Christmas in Rome, and we would highly recommend the Hotel Alimandi Vaticano. It's centrally located to the Vatican and St. Peter's Square and was full of fellow American tourists. The rooms are clean, and the hearty breakfast was a nice bonus. Most of all, the staff was helpful. In particular, Nico was very knowledgeable about Rome, gave us excellent recommendations for dinner and helped us better understand the Italian culture. He also helped prevent one of the cabbies from ripping us off for an extra 20 euros on the taxi ride from Termini station to the hotel! Overall, a solid hotel that we would recommend to Americans traveling to the Eternal City. MJ Rockville, MD</p></li>

We enjoyed a delightful breakfast each morning. Our room was very clean with a large bathroom. We had an issue with the air conditioning and contacted the front desk. They quickly adjusted the temp. from the front desk and it cooled down very quickly. So, if you stay here, understand that they control the temp by computer, not the thermastat in the room. They helped us follow up on lost luggage, it arrived the next day. By their reaction, this is not uncommon on the Italia airline we used. We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend this hotel. Wish I could say the same for our hotel in Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We did much of research on Rome hotels for our group of 15 's three-night stay before a cruise, and settled on the Alimandi 4-star for its price, location, free airport transportation, and its already-great reviews here. It's always difficult to make the choice for others, but everyone in our group had very complimentary things to say about the Alimandi, its rooms, its friendly and helpful staff, its wonderful breakfast, and its rooftop views. We especially enjoyed the nice bathroom amenities and the pleasant and relaxing atmosphere. Yet you're only a short walk away from the hustle & bustle of Rome. Easy to get to metro and buses (about a 5-minute walk) and literally a stone's throw from Vatican Museum entrance. Heartily recommended!!</p></li>

Everything was handled smoothly. From the time of our arrival everything was great. The hotel was very modern with the latest amenities. They even had an ICE MACHINE! Unheard of in hotels in Italy. The staff was professional and extremely helpful. The location was obviously close to the Vatican, but also close to all other sites by walking. Buses & Metro were close to hotel and easy to navigate. Breakfast was the best we had on our trip thru Italy. They also had complimentary shuttle to the airport for departures. It ran on-time and was very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again, when we return to Italy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at both the hotel and the "Bed and Breakfast". The bed and breakfast rooms were a little roomier than the hotel, but both were excellent rooms. Very clean and well kept. A breakfast is included and is a very good meal. The staff are very friendly and helpful. There is a great patio on top of the hotel that has a great view of the Vatican, a nice way to end the day with a glass of great Italian wine. Just about everything is walking distance and/or easy to get to via the subway. We ended up here based on a Rick Steve's recommendation from his book after a rental apartment reservation turned out to be really bad. We spent more on the hotel than we would have on the apartment, but the location and excellent accommodations and breakfast was well worth the price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Alimandi Vaticano is opposite the entrance to the Vatican Museam and the Sistine Chapel. It's away from the hustle and bustle of the main tourist areas. At night it is nice and quiet. The hotel is small (smaller than I thought it would be ) but it is extremely clean. The staff are extraordinarily pleasant. The rooms are very modern and luxurious. The bathroom was gorgeous in the room I stayed in - marble floors, lots of mirrors, lovely shower and lots of 'extras' e.g. free toothpaste, toothbrushes, aftershave etc. The breakfast was amazing. There were sausages and bacon on the buffet. There were loads of lovely cakes as well. The staff running the kitchen were lovely also. I will definitely be staying here again. It was a very pleasant place to stay and not too dear either.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the hotel Alimandi Vaticano for 1 night precruise and wish we could have stayed longer. I found the staff to be very helpful and freindly, from answering all my emails, to the free shuttle from the airport to the hotel, to storing our luggage while we were taking a tours. The rooms were clean and quiet. The bathroom was large and modern. We stayed in a quad room ( 2 queen beds) which is hard to find in Rome. The only thing that didn't seem to work was the tv, but we didn't have time to watch it anyway. The breakfast buffet was great (my husband can eat alot). The location for us was great across form the Vatican museums. It was an easy cab ride to the Colliseum the next day. We also roamed around piazza Navonna that one night. We would definately come back to stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Alimandi Vaticano for a long week-end in early July. We had a family room (2 adults + 2 children). Room was clean, nice bathroom and 2 large double beds. Hotel location is great for the Vatican and at first we thought it a bit far out from the city centre. However after spending a couple of nights in the city centre trying to find nice restaurants we actually preferred the location around the hotel. Taxi to the centre costs about 7 Euros but subway is very close to the hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good. Overall an excellent choice of hotel. We were very happy with it. Queues for the Vatican were enormous and people started queuing before 7am (it didn't open to non-groups until 11am!) but you are right opposite the museum entrance. Very handy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was very nice, although I think it was a little overpriced for the combination of location and quality of rooms. If you are only visiting the Vatican while in Rome, this is the place for you, however. The door to the Museum can be seen from the door of this hotel. Otherwise, it is much too far out of the way to enjoy the city easily. You have to spend too much time going back and forth on metros, or in my case when I had to take a taxi back to the hotel, a fortune in taxis. We were here 3 days at the beginning of our trip and were scheduled to be here the last day, but when I saw how far out of the way it was, I changed the booking for the last day. In the hotel's defense, it was probably my fault for not researching the location better - someone recommended it and booked it for me.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a weekend in Rome staying at the Alimandi and have to say this surpassed all expectations from the friendliness and service of the hotel staff to the charm and excitement of Rome itself. The hotel is right on the doorstep of the Vatican so location was great. We walked pretty much to every notable attraction Rome has to offer and never once felt threatened and the friendliness of the locals and cafe/resturant staff was great..they didnt seem to be able to do enough for you. A recommended place to eat is in the Novana square called La Dolce Vita.. Spaghetti Carbonara to die for! A great place for people watching, portrait painting and a meeting place for locals and tourists alike to just eat, drink and let the time slip by. Fantastic stay and we will definately be going back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of four stayed here in early June 2011, and couldn't have been happier. The room (a family quad, really just a larger room with two very sizable beds) was fine, the air conditioning worked well, and there was plenty of hot water with good water pressure. We felt the hotel was set apart by its cleanliness and very solid, substantial construction and decor. Marle and wood are everywhere, and the hotel was easily as clean and well-maintained as any we have encountered on many trips to Germany. The shuttle service to and from FCO is indispensable: right on time, and comfortable. Of course, the location for visiting the Vatican can't be beat. We weren't wild about the breakfast, but that is just personal taste. The staff in the breakfast room were wonderful. Will definitely stay there on future trips to Rome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel is across the street from the Vatican museum, but it is a busy street with lots of traffic and noise. Check in was seamless. We paid the bill at check in, including a 10 euro per person transfer to the airport (as this was our last hotel before heading home after 18 days and 7 hotels throughout Italy). The room had 2 double beds-plenty big for a party of 3. There was a large bathroom with a tub/shower. There was a very cute welcome package with bathrobes, slippers and your typical assortment of toiletries. The 1/2 shower door made a mess of water in the bathrooom. There was a mini-bar, ample closet space and safe (although it was technically moveable) There was an excellent buffet breakfast. We didn't know about the terrace bar and computer room. Another guest told us after the fact- they didn't mention it at check in.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Alimandi was great !!! The location was right on the wall of the Vatican and close to the underground transit... which could go anywhere if needed....so we saw alot ! Our window with view looked on the Vatican Museum entrance. The complimentry breakfast was beautifully presented, linin table clothes, warming trays & refigeration cases, all you could eat and plenty of variety. The staff was the best !!!! Maria at the Front Desk was always there and happy to help .... she had good advice & directions for sites to see, restuarants and even telephoned for our Museum reservations. They have a shuttle to the airport & right on time. We enjoyed many complimentary perks , which they included. My husband, myself and our grown Son were most pleased in every way and HIGHLY recommend Hotel Alimandi.... Thank You !!! Lisa of Huntington Beach California</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and daughter stayed overnight before traveling to Florence to drop my daughter off for a semester abroad at SACI; an art school. This is the 3rd time our family has stayed at the Alimandi and wife and daughter rec'd the same outstanding service as before. We truly appreciate your hospitality and the attention to detail in helping us make the most of our travel needs. The extra care and help you provided us in making travel reservations in April when the we come as a family to pick up our daughter when her semester has been completed also meant so very much to us. We have told our friends and colleagues about this wonderful hotel in Rome, and will continue to recommend you in the future. Thank you so very much for all that everyone does to make us feel at home. Our best wishes to all of you on the staff. We look forward to seeing you again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My daughter and I stayed at the Hotel Alimandi Vaticano for 6 nights at the outset of our recent visit to Italy. The hotel is located literally right across the street from the entrance to the Vatican Museum - couldn't be better ! Many of the "must-see" places are within walking distance, such as the Trevi Foundation, Piazza Navonna, the Spanish Steps, Campo de Fiore, Trastevere, etc. The Metro station is close by as is the bus service to places further afield. The hotel itself is clean, comfortable and serves the most splendid breakfasts I have ever eaten in Europe! Our room was located away from the street, facing an inner courtyard, and so was very quiet at night; it was comfortable and well-equipped. The staff were pleasant, not overly helpful but within the limits of acceptability. The best part about the hotel is its location with respect to the Vatican.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Is this the number one hotel n Rome? The answer is definitley not. The Good 1) The hotel is spotlessly clean 2) The staff are friendly 3) The bathroom goodies are great The Bad 1) The hotel must be on one of the nosiest steets in Rome - light sleepers avoid 2) The family room was very small, room for two double beds and not much else 3) The hotel was exceptionally warm and the air conditioning didn't seem to work 4) The breakfast is bizarre - last time we stayed in Rome we had fresh mozerella, parma ham, crossiants and breads - this was an odd concotion of lasagne, chocolate cake, fried prawns, etc. The Ugly 1) The hotel must be on one of the dirtiest streets in Rome, both of my children managed to stand in dog dirt just outside the hotel and the pavements are littered with rubbish.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Well we just got back from our vacation in Rome. I chose Hotel Alimandi soley based on the reviews from trip advisor. I didnt like the choices the travel agent gave. I have to say the place is very nice and I would stay there again!! The staff was great, they were very nice and helpful. We booked all our tours when we got to the hotel through the tour company they had...Vasotours. It was a good company and we packed in alot of sightseeing in 6 days. They had hotel pick up and the all day tours included a 3 course lunch at a restaurant, which we thought was impressive. Overall it was a great experience, the beds are so comfortable. We had a triple room; 3 ladies. There was big enough room for all our things. The bathroom was beautiful and big!! We were impressed. The roof top patio is very nice. I'm glad we chose this hotel and would do it again if we had the chance of going back!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of 4 (two adults and 2 kids age 8 and 15) have had nothing but a superlative experience with the hotel and its very warm and personable staff. The owner's family started out by renting single rooms to students and it has evolved into an outstanding family run hotel. The room and bathroom ware immaculately cleaned and during the (very) hot Rome afternoon, it was a great relief returning to our room. Although it is near a busy area, we did not hear any ouside noise as some had mentioned. The location is excellent; accross the street from the Vatican Museums. Also 10 min. walk to St Peter; 5 min. walk to Metro and to ATM. (Must walk and stroll and take in life at Via Cola di Rienzo, 10 min. walk from Hotel). Alimandi Vaticano: Nothing but praise. Caloggero sei grande!!! Sicily was truly beautiful; we went to Syracuse, Taormina, Enna (what a view) and Piazza Armerina. Alla Prossima.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our first trip to Rome Italy and were concerned about our lack of speaking the Italian language and concerned about what we were going to get for accommodations since we had never booked a hotel room on line let alone in a foreign country. The accommodations of this hotel, especially the service provided by the desk clerk Nico far exceeded our expectations even if this were a 5 star venue. The room was immaculate and ready for us before normal check in time allowing us to catch a short nap (jet lagged) before our first tour. The location of the hotel was also perfect for our tour of the Vatican the next day. Nico also did a great job of recommending restaurants and securing the services of Gregori who provided us with excellent limousine service to our cruise ship. This was a great start to our vacation and this is where we will stay when we return to Rome for additional sightseeing.</p></li>

The rooms are very quiet and immaculately clean. The front-desk staff is friendly and very helpful with suggestions for restaurants and things to do. Breakfast fare is outstanding with eggs and bacon (perfectly cooked), pastries, cheeses, cereals, fruits, yogurts and cappuccinos. The staff will provide gluten-free options upon request. We stayed at this hotel in the Fall of 2006 and loved it then. At that time, the Alimandi Vaticano was one of the top-rated hotels on Trip Advisor. The hotel was just as good this time, and we will be sure to stay there again on our next trip to Rome. Based on our very positive experience, we do not understand why this excellent hotel has fallen in Trip Advisor's ratings. For us, this hotel remained an outstanding choice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A wonderful hotel with pleasant and helpful staff at hand. Pecfectly positioned for the Vatican. Top tip - Book a guided tour of the Vatican and relax in the restaurant, enjoying the superb buffett breakfast as the queues form outside. Then walk around the corner and then straight into the Vatican with a tour guide - perfect. The Hotel provides a shuttle service to and from the airport - again, well worth the 10 euros person. It all makes for a hassle free arrival to Rome. Once the Vatican has been explored, the Metro has 2 stops, both less than a mile away. This will take you into the heart of Rome and the other splendid sights on offer. Final Top Tip - visit the Old Bridge Ice Cream shop opposite the Vatican wall and about half a mile from the hotel, towards the Castel St D' Angelo [ Not the one immediately next to the Hotel - rip off ]. Enormous ice creams for just 2 euros and a popular meeting place for all.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice Little Hotel Near the Vatican”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here for three nights for our Italian Honeymoon. It was a nice little resonably priced hotel if you are looking to stay somewhere near the Vatican. However, it is not really conveniently located near the Metro, which will take you into ancient Rome. The rooms were pretty small (average size of rooms in Italy) however the bathroom was VERY small. We had a minor problem with our sink leaking, but the hotel fixed it right away and apoligized several times! The breakfast buffet was huge, and probably one of the best we had while we were in Italy. The hotel staff was also very nice and actually saved us some money because we were suppose to be in two different rooms during our stay, however he put it is just one which happened to be cheaper then the other one. I would definitly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a quite little place that is not near all the major attractions in ancient Rome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a very lovely hotel. The staff were helpful, friendly and pleasant. The rooms were beautiful with spacious bathrooms. The mattresses were very comfortable which made for a well needed good nights sleep! The hotel also arranged tours for us, and one of the tours to the Bourghese Gallery got cancelled. Nico went out of his way to arrange another tour for us at the Gallery on the same day but with a personal guide since no groups were available..... the personal guide was no additional expense for us! The Vatican is directly across the street from the hotel, so you can eat your breakfast (which was our favorite meal of the day) while watching the long lines form. The breakfast there was awesome, the best of anywhere we have traveled. Everything fresh, hot and lots of it.....the cappuccino was wonderful! The young woman that takes care of the dining room guests was extremely pleasant and efficient. This is a great hotel that I would definitely stay at again!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our 3rd trip to Rome and we were recommended to the Alimandi by the family we went with, who had stayed there last year. It was an absolutely fabulous hotel, and the staff could not possibly have been more helpful. It totally justified the 4 star rating as it was spotless throughout,, beautifullydecorated, excellent family room and bath room with all the trimmings. Fully air conditioned and the breakfast choice was extensive with the hot plate option varied slightly each day. The shuttle bus service to / from Fiumicono was an excellent added facility.We spent a couple of evenings on the 4th floor open terrace overlooking the walls / entrance to the Vatican museum - about 50 yards across the road so you can easily be at front of the queue for the Cistine Chapel if you set an alarm call. We have nothing but praise for this establishment and a couple of our friends are going next month on our strong recommendation. The Smiths, - Mum ,Dad and 2 x 16 year olds</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for three nights on the back of a recommendation from a friend. The hotel itself was good in that we had very good service from the front desk and the room was clean and comfortable. However to stay here, you have to commit to either 25 minutes walk to/from the old town or catching a subway each time to get in and out of the old town. Now Rome is a place where you want to walk around a lot to be fair, but we would have preferred walking new routes. Personally and because we went in the heat of August, I would have preferred staying somewhere more central where you can nip back to the hotel and go for a siesta so that you can continue to party at night or even just to freshen up before dinner. Also, the roof terrace is unused and has not atmosphere (no bar service). Room is comfortable but doesnt welcome you with that warm fuzzy feeling. Don't be fooled by the air-con control in the room as the air-con is controlled from the front desk! But really, it's not bad, just not great.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I arrived at the hotel with my mother on Sunday 15th October, what can i say except fabulous hotel as for the staff they all were fantastic, Aldo,Savio,Enrico,Irene and Anduena, so if they read this please please i want to say a BIG THANK YOU for all your kindness and so very helpful :o) my mother is already planning a return trip for 2007. The room was great and so clean. Near all the major local attractions. I have read some negative reviews on this hotel and all i can say is that i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Rome. My mother is 63yrs and mobility problems so i researched all hotels close to the Vatican and i could not have chosen a better hotel. Breakfast was wonderful and set us up for the day. All the staff go above and beyond giving advise on what restaurants to go to, local transport etc..Rome surpassed all our expectations and weather gorgeous. So if any of the staff read this a big thanks from jane in room 205 and her mother and hope to be back again in 2007.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 4 nights while in Rome and were in the B and B part of the hotel with a mini-apartment. We were thrilled to have a washer so we didn't have to hand wash laundry! There was also a fridge, a countertop oven, and 2 burners, as well as a thing to quickly make hot water. It was nice to have the extra amenities after 2 weeks on the road. Being near to the Vatican, things were a bit busy in the morning but very quiet in the evening. It was easy to make our pre-booked ticket time in the morning since we were right across the street from the entrance to the museum. One of the young women at the desk (didn't learn her name) who was on duty in the morning and early afternoon was especially helpful. When we would ask how to get somewhere via metro or bus, she would tell us the best way to get there. It was nice to have someone help us get around! We got to have breakfast in the main hotel, and it was very good. There was a huge selection of food and the pastries were particularly good.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Hotel Alimendi Vaticano for four nights on our recent trip to Rome. After reading all the great reviews on Trip Advisor, I was pretty excited. The hotel did not live up to my expectations. It is located on a very busy street across from the Vatican Museums. The traffic could be heard clearly from our room. In addition to the that, the floors in the hallway are made of marble and every morning we were wakened not only by the traffic, but also the clicking of the maid's heels and other traveler's suitcases parading up and down the hallway. SUPER annoying. Breakfast was average. Bathrooms were tiny. No turn-down service. The one and only thing we were really impressed with was Nico, the front desk manager. He was so helpful and knowledgeable. I blew a fuse in our room, and he fixed it in less than 5 minutes even though he was the only one working at the time. He fixed a botched reservation for us, gave us tips on where to eat, and just went above and beyond the call of duty to make our stay more enjoyable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel in Rome for a day before and after our cruise based on reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. The location is perfect for anyone wishing to see the Vatican Museum and St. Peter's. It is literally steps away from the entrance to the Vatican Museum. The staff were exceptional. They were friendly and efficient. The shuttle service we had to and from the airport as well as the shuttle service to/from the pier in Civitavecchia was not only flawless but also a terrific value The driver was always on time. As we walked out of the terminal at the end of our cruise our driver was right there waiting for us which we truly appreciated. Our room was great with a modern bright bathroom. The breakfast was terrific with a lot of choices. The day we were leaving for home we had to leave for the airport before breakfast was being served but they provided us with coffee and some breakfast snacks. Compliments and appreciation to the staff at the Alimandi Vaticano for providing us with a wonderful experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for three nights, our first visit to Rome. The room, 305, had two large double beds, flat screen TV with Sky and DVD player and mini-bar. Mini bar prices very reasonable, for example, 1Euro for a fruit juice. Bathroom had efficient modern shower and large bath. Everything worked. Room was very clean. We also had a private roof terrace with table and chairs where we could sit out and have coffee in the morning, overlooking the vatican wall and entrance to the vatican museum. Coffee is a room service option as there is no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, but cost is very reasonable. The young lady on the reception was very helpful in suggesting restaurants and on Sunday went out of her way to find us a special restaurant, that was open, for a birthday celebration. Will go back to Rome and will go back to this hotel. It's location is west of the city and our routine was to get a cab or bus to the furthest most site and meander back past other places of interest on our way back. The only downer was the rain.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great stay at this hotel. Took at 45 euro taxi from the Ciampino airport directly here although public transport is cheaper with 3 of us and luggage we were happy enough. Location is wonderful across from Vatican and with decent restaurants near which were recommended by the ever helpful staff. Bus stop is just across the road for buses into the city, also metro station 10 mins walk then 10 mins direct to Spanish Steps. Always remember to establish price for taxis or that the meter will be running prior to taking a journey. 10 mins walk and a great cheap lunch dinner options is this place http://www.linsalataricca.it The hotel breakfast was superb, the room we stayed in fantastic, and so clean. As others have said, the roof terrace is a great place to relax after hussle and bussle of Rome and drinks prices at 3 euros a beer and 1 euro a soft drink are remarkable. If you want a 4 star slightly out of the hectic centre, but still in Rome and with all the benefits of public transport and the Vatican being next door, this is for you.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Most comfortable beds in Italy”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my second trip to Italy, traveling with my husband and sister in law. After 2 weeks of traveling and staying in some very nice hotels throughout Italy, we spent our last 2 nights here before returning to the U.S. What a welcome relief! Although we had stayed at nice and highly rated hotels during our 2 weeks, every hotel we had stayed at seemed to have old, thin, saggy, and terribly uncomfortable mattresses. When we finally arrived at Hotel Alimandi Vaticano, we were elated to find firm, comfortable beds with lovely linens. The rooms were spacious, the bathrooms modern and attractive, the television was flat panel. Robes and slippers were provided. The breakfast buffet had the largest selection I have seen in any Italian hotel to date. The food was excellent. The windows of the breakfast area look directly across the street to the entrance to the Vatican Museums. A great location if you want to get in line before all the tour groups arrive in the morning. While this hotel was expensive, it was worth the good nights sleep and ammenities that were comparable to some better American hotels.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This really is a fantastic hotel, in a great location, for a very fair price. We booked a standard room - perfect for our budget, and a superior double (for cousins) which really was a stunning room with spacious balcony overlooking the Vatican museum entrance. Both rooms were en-suite, modern and clean and came with well stocked mini-bar! Staff were extremely friendly and helpful, and guests would do well to heed their advice on the best times to visit the museum opposite. Also take their advice on where to eat, Piacere Molise for simple yet outstanding pasta without the tourist price tag. Breakfast was surprisingly good - something for everyone from fresh fruit and pastries to traditional bacon and eggs with the unusual addition of chicken wings or spring rolls also available?! Not to mention cereal, toast, juices, sacher torte, brownies and fresh coffee or tea. Whilst not close to other sights, transport is easy and it is good for 'real' shopping as it's less than 5 mins walk to via Cola di Rienzo. A great hotel, great location, and great value for travellers looking for a clean & comfortable place to rest and recover from the wonder of Rome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Alimandi Vaticano 7 nights to be near the Vatican. It is right across the street from the Vatican Museum. Our room on the 3rd floor was very quiet and the windows opened to the inner courtyard of the apartment building next door. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet cannot be beat. There is a rooftop terrace on the 4th floor with a good view of the Vatican and Roman rooftops. There were 2 general access terraces on the 3rd floor if you want to sit outside. The terraces are the only place smoking is allowed, but there were no smokers during our visit. You can get the 23 or 492 bus into the city center down the hill from the hotel on via Leone IV. It is a little farther to walk to restaurants, about a 15 minute walk to Borgo Pio (many restaurants). There are also some local restaurants closer on via Leone IV. It is about 5 blocks north to the covered food market on Andrea Dorea and one can get a taxi across the street, which we did to visit Galleria Borghese. Their shuttle to the airport was very reasonable and on time. It was a good choice if you want to see the Vatican completely. We did St. Peter's twice, the Vatican Museum and my husband did the Scavi and the Dome tour.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Alimandi Vaticano for 3 nights in August. I must say, it was absolutely perfect! A definite 4 star hotel. Everything is new and in pristine condition. There were four of us (including 2 teenagers). We had a quadruple room which had 2 queen size beds. The room was just beautiful, and the bathroom was really nice....lots of marble everywhere! They were very accomodating.....called us taxi's when needed, made restaurant reservations, gave us directions, advice. Very, very nice! It's literally right next to the vatican museum. It's a little ways away from the center of all the attractions though, but after spending a day down there with all the crowds and tourists, it was nice to get back to the Alimandi where it was quiet. Once the vatican closes, it literally becomes almost like a "ghost town" around that area. It was a little eery feeling at first, but the area is very safe, and we came to like the quiet after a day of touring. Great gelato places just down the steps and around the back streets of the hotel. Unless you want to be right in the center of things with all the crazy, busy, touristy stuff going on, I would highly recommend this hotel....it was just perfect! I would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I stayed at the Hotel Alimandi in October. Since my husband and I had stayed there last year, there was no question where we were going to stay this year. The hotel is wonderful. The rooms are modern and large for Europe. The suites have their own balcony, but the roof top balcony is a welcome retreat after a day of sight seeing. The views are amazing. They offer a great breakfast that is geared more toward the American style. So, they have a varied selection of food. The location is in a perfect spot, right across the street from the Vatican Museums. I love being close to St. Peters Square because it is so beautiful in the evening. Also, in the evening, everything seems to wind down on this side of the Tiber. There are two grocery stores around the corner from the hotel (they are located on the same street as the other Hotel Alimandi ). And, the Cipro Metro stop is close by so it is easy to get any where you want to go. What makes this hotel stand out from the others is the level of service from the staff, generally all family members. From the moment you walk in, you feel very comfortable. Plus, the shuttle to and from the airport is fantastic. Just make sure to notify the front desk in advance if you need a pick up or drop off. I can't wait to go back!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found the Alimandi and its updscale sister property, the Alimandi Vaticano, through Rick Steves' Rome travel guide. We needed a hotel, fast, near Rome Children's Hospital, where our son was being treated. We spent a night in the 4-star Vaticano, loved it, then found out we'd be staying a while and happened on a large and very comfortable B&B type apartment in the same building, owned by the Alimandi family. It was wonderful, came with all hotel amenities, including the spectacular breakfasts, cheap or free wi-fi/internet access, shuttle service and kind, warm, friendly and helpful service from the family members (one of the owners even made soup for our son, who hated the hospital food). I cannot speak highly enough about these properties and the truly gracious and warm Alimandi family. We didn't stay in the three-star, but it looked very nice, and the rooftop breakfast lounge was a treat given our son's illness, and the guy who ran the breakfast spot was an absolute gem. Our son turned out to have lymphoma, so we stayed almost a month, but he has since been treated back home in New York and his prognosis is excellent. We plan a celebratory stay back at the Alimandi next summer. We consider the owners friends, if not family. And the apartment may be the best deal in Rome!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading all the Rome Hotel reviews I decided that Rome was not a place to cheap out on a hotel and settled on this property based on the reviews here, for our four-night stay. This hotel is spotless and beautifully designed and everything in the room worked well. The air conditioner was powerful but quiet. They have rubber gaskets around the door which mitigates but does not eliminate that annoying door-slamming noise you hear from near-by rooms in all hotels. We were at the back of the hotel and it was very quiet overall. The minibar prices - for once - were reasonable and we did not bother looking for water and soft drinks outside the hotel. The room was on the compact side for 2 of us but we did not find this an issue since it was so comfortable otherwise. The breakfast buffet was excellent and catered to several national tastes. The hotel's restaurant recommendations also proved to be excellent and we worked through the menu at La Rustichella, a short walk into the local neighbourhood. We were not able to use the free airport shuttle service on arrival since the last pickup is at 2 PM and we arrived later. But it was good going back and the saving on the taxi fare is an offset to this hotel's high rate. The staff was efficient and helpful. The people here know how to run a hotel and it will be our first choice if we have a chance to visit Rome again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were impressed with the great customer service of the concierge/front desk personnel of the Hotel especially Irene. We checked in at 11pm due to flight delays and all the restaurants within close walking distance from the hotel were closed already so Irene helped us order a pizza and got it delivered to our room. The next day she went out of her way and helped us book a 3 hr chauffeur driven guided minivan tour of the main sites of Rome. it was a Sunday and a public holiday so a few places she called were already booked but she found someone who could do it also at a time we preferred.Mauro spoke excellent English and was not just a mere chauffeur but excellent tourguide as well. The buffet breakfast at the hotel was great, we could see the queues forming for the Vatican Museum outside. We booked a quad family for the 4 of us and it was spacious even with 2 big double beds in the room and ceiling high enough that we didnt feel cramped in. Room was clean and bathroom modern and spacious. Our one complain was the air-conditioning couldnt be better regulated and we were too cold ! We booked a 3 hour tour of the Vatican Museum which included St Paul's Basilica with Presto Tours and the meeting point of the tour was conveniently right next to the Alimandi hotel so the 8.30am start wasnt a problem at all. Thanks again to Irene, she gave a great personal touch to the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed 2 nights at Hotel Alimandi (3 star) in mid-May. We loved this hotel and will definitely stay there again if we get back to Rome. The location is great, just across the street from the Vatican, and yet within walking distance to the Roman Forum, Collosseum, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, etc. The staff at the hotel couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. We were given written directions for walking around Rome, advice about local restaurants, and extra help on the day we checked out. Our ride provided by USO to Ciampino Airport was very late in arriving to pick us up, and the staff tried several ways to find a phone number to reach them for us, just to find that the USO office had closed for the day. We were assured that if our ride did not arrive, they would get us to the airport themselves, even though it wasn't the airport they provide transportation to and from. Our room was very nice, large, clean and quiet. We had asked for and received a room with a view of the Vatican. Another plus is their internet service -- extremely cheap! But the best part of all is the delicious buffet breakfast served on the roof-top. Francesco is a gem, so friendly and helpful, bringing fresh from the oven hot sweet breads to our table, making special coffees, taking care that everything is just so. We highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There are two Hotel Alimadi so make sure you are looking at the right one. We stayed at the Vaticano which was right across from the wall and entrance to the Vatican Museum. It was a great location and a wonderful hotel. The hotel was super clean and the beds comfortable. The hotel has internet access for a fee, but if you walk around the corner to their sister hotel ( a block away) you can acess the internet for free. The Gym is also in the other hotel if you are interested in working off some of the pasta!! The rooms were a little noisy because Rome doesn't seem to sleep. The locals stay out until 3 am, so you hear all the cars and scooters zipping by at all hours. I think you may have this problem anywhere you stay in Rome however. The hotel was super convienent to everything and the hotel was great about calling you taxi's whenever you needed it. The breakfast in the morning was full with plenty to choose from. Some stuff was a little strange (they had jalepeno poppers one morning) but for the most part, it was good. They have an omelet station but that was only open one day we were there. Overall, it was a decent breakfast that filled us up. This is a great hotel and the staff was very helpful. Irene is wonderful and she is there best and most informative staff member to work with. I would highly reccomend this hotel and when we come back to Rome, we will be certainly staying here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed at the Alimandi in Rome twice. The first time we experience a great level of service. The staff are friendly, the rooms very clean and spacious and it is located just opposite the Vatican Museum entrance. The buffet breakfast is really impressive and genuinely has so much choice of good quality food that it is bewildering but in a nice way! We have always ran ahead and they negotiate a room price and will also pick you up from Fumicino. The second time we stayed the staff really came into their own. I was pickpocketted in the subway and lost money and my driving license. Because of the latter, we were unable to hire a car to continue the rest of our holiday to Umbria. In passing, we told the hotel staff and they could not do enough to assist us. They arranged telephone calls, sent faxes and e-mails etc. However, way beyond the call of duty, the owner of the hotel used some connections with a local car hire company to help us overcome the problem of no license and persuaded them to give me a car using the temporary cover document I had been sent from the UKDVLA (may own petitioning of all the firms just got a plain 'no way'). All was saved and thanks to this guy's basic concern and kindness. So, not only a great place and location but run by the type of people you hope you will meet in an emergency!! If you are looking for a place in Rome, look no further. its a great place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Alimandi at the begining of our vacation because of its location to the Vatican. We had no idea how close we really were until we looked out our window and actually saw the people lining up to get into the Vatican museum. There were 4 of us traveling, 2 adults 2 teenagers and the room worked out perfect. The room was clean and the bathroom was nice. We had internet and it worked perfect. The best part of the hotel I would have to say is the staff and the breakfast. The egg tart the chef made one day was to die for, but the selection of food was perfect especially with 2 picky teenagers. I arranged ahead of time to have the hotel pick us up at the airport since we were arriving after 7pm and their guy was there with a sign as soon as we walked out of baggage claim. He got the car within minutes and we were off to the hotel. Again on the way back to the airport we did the same and they were prompt and took us back with no issues at all. That right there made our trip that much nicer. The girl at the desk (I wish I could remember her name) told us a walking path to the Spanish Steps and Trevi Fountain that gave us a chance to really see Rome. It was a long way, but we would have never seen what we did if we jumped on the train. All in all we had a great experience and would 100% recommend this hotel to those looking and if we have the chance to return we will definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went on a 5 night stay , and loved every minute of it. The hotel is really great for exploring all the major sites nearby, coloseum, vatican ,trevi fountain, spanish steps all about 10 to 20 minute walks. I researched hotels Through on line booking system RoomsAccomodation.com for hours before choosing this one and got a huge rate discount compared to calling the hotel directly. We spent five days here with 100% satisfaction of every individual, service, and product at this hotel. We have very high expectations of service and we all have been impressed with this staff. The concierge made dinner reservations for us and recommendations for sight seeing ( Carrani Tours ). We only used the metro once, to get to the San Giovanni. Apart from that we walked everywhere, to and from all the sights. January is a great time to go in Rome - the weather is sunny although there were lots of people it didn't feel too crowded. I can't imagine what the Vatican must be like in summer though! The area around the hotel is safe. In fact all Rome feels very safe, apart perhaps from the area immediately next to the Termini Station late at night, which still is not all that bad. Two final notes: 1st: Rome is a woderful place and upon leaving we were really hoping we would be able to return there on day soon. 2nd: For our transport from and to the airport we were very happy to have booked by RoomsAccomodation, punctual, talkative and pleasant.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First off, not quite sure why this hotel is ranked so high. Location is ok, service is not very good. However, very comfortable, nice amenities. Overall, I would imagine there are much better places to stay in Rome (p.s., Hotel Farnese is NOT one of them). Here are my thoughts: 1. Location: (B/B-) The location is not great. Close to the Vatican/St.Peter's - nothing else. For everything else (Coloseum, Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, Piazza Navonna, etc.) you need to taxi/subway/bus it home. I'm a New Yorker and didn't even think about walking to any of these sights - way too far. And keep in mind, while there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel - its only one of many bus lines. The next closest bus stop is a 10 minute walk away (as is the closest subway stop). 2. Comfort: (A-/B+) Hotel is very comfortable. Beds and toiletries are first rate. Breakfast was also very good (hot dogs, bacon, coffee of choice, pastries). 3. Service: (C) Pretty bad, from checkin to checkout. Whenever my wife and I asked for directions, recommendations, misc. info - the staff seemed hesitant to help. Service with a frown - literally. On one night, I asked for restaurant recommendations in a certain area (near Spanish Steps) and the staffer just told me, "I don't know any, good food everywhere in Rome just go somewhere where you see lot of people and pretty good." Wow, thanks. They were very helpful with changing a reservation for the Vatican Museum, however.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Perfect weekend”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel for a romantic weekend away on the strength of the ranking and recommendations on Tripadvisor and was not disappointed. We stayed in a larger room on the second floor (room 203). The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I had a problem getting money from the ATMs there (some banks ask for a 6 digit pin) and the female member of staff took on my problem as if it were her own. While the hotel is located on a busy road (Viale Vaticano) directly opposite the Vatican Museums, the shutters and the windows prevent the sound from being too intrusive. Unfortunately, the Vatican Museums were not open on the Saturday we visited (one of only 2 Saturdays they are closed in the year) but Rome is not lacking in other delights! The hotel is 5 minutes from St Peters Basillica and 15 minutes walk from the central part of Rome (Centro Storico). You can catch the Metro (3 minutes walk) or the number 81 bus (same distance) there if walking is not your thing. The hotel does not offer lunch or evening meals and I found their breakfast adequate. I could see why people have complaints about the hot food there as the food looked a little tepid but is is absolutely fine for cerials, cold meats. toast etc. The chocolate cake was unexpected and the fact that it was nearly all gone the next day was even more unexpected. Who eats chocolate cake for breakfast!? In summary, I don't think we could have enjoyed our stay in Rome more, thanks partly to the Alimandi Hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent four nights at the hotel and enjoyed the entire trip. We thought the hotel was excellent and the staff at the front desk was some of the best we have experienced anywhere. We would quickly stay here again on future trips. We had no problems with the reservation (although I would include the airport transfer in the reservation on future trips). We arrived before the noted check-in time and the staff graciously offered a room early. The room was spacious with a large bathroom. It contained all the modern conveniences that we expected and everything worked properly. Although located on a busy street, we had no problems with the outside noise at night. The location is more convenient for the Vatican than for some of the other tourist sites, but the transportation (Metro, bus, and taxi) was very convenient and allowed us to travel the entire city easily. The breakfast was above average with different cooked foods every day, plenty of fruit and cheese, many cereal and pastry choices, juices and different types of coffee. For a small hotel, we were very pleased. Also, the bar and roof garden were good places to reminisce about the day's activities. The staff at the front desk was able to handle all our requests -- from the best local places to eat, to how to obtain the desired tours, to how to travel to other locations in Italy. If they had free time, they were also willing to sit down and discuss Italian and American cultures or current events. This was a very nice, small hotel that catered to its clients!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent 3 nights at the Hotel Alimandi Vaticano in Rome earlier this month and would definitely stay there again, particularly if my focus were again on St. Peter's and the Vatican. The staff were all efficient and gracious. I am especially appreciative of how they handled my airport shuttle booking. I had arranged (via e-mail) for a 10:00AM airport shuttle pick-up, based on my flight's scheduled arrival time from New York -- figured I'd have at least an hour's wait, but didn't want to book an earlier shuttle and then miss it. Turns out that my flight arrived almost an hour early -- I called the hotel as soon as I cleared Customs, and they told me that the driver was outside, already waiting for me. They'd been monitoring my flight and sent the shuttle out early -- a much-appreciated kindness, especially on a cold and rainy day. My room was large, even by US standards -- two queen beds with plenty of room leftover, plus two large armoires and a patio overlooking the entrance to the Vatican Museums. The bathroom was also above-average in size, with all new fixtures kept spotlessly clean. Breakfast included a huge array of baked goods, an ample selection of eggs and meats, plus cereal and yogurts, tended to by attentive but low-key staff in a large and cheery breakfast room fronting the Museum entrance. Only one small negative -- the ice machine was on the same floor, two doors away from my room, and it was occasionally loud enough to interrupt this jet-lagged traveler's sleep. Suggest that it be relocated or enclosed. Otherwise, my stay at the Alimandi was just about perfect.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Vaticano.. Booked 3 nights here based on the good reviews found on tripadvisor. Really enjoyed the stay at what I suppose is a reasonable rate given that it is Rome and is at the Vatican! I found the location great .. easy to find especially having just arrived from the airport or making your way around.. well the Vatican is a fairly hard landmark to miss! Was also very useful in terms of getting hop on hop off bus around the other sites of Rome given the Vatican stop was beside the hotel. The room was clean and spacious... loved the marble floors... good en suite, shower, beds etc. The staff were very helpful and always friendly and the breakfast in a nice room and just the thing to set you up for the day. The room had also probably the first reasonably priced minibar I have encountered in a big city... bout the same price as normal. . euro for coke, water etc... and we did polish off a few bottles of beer, wine, champagne etc. which also cost no more than the bar. On the down side the room had no airconditioning... or rather id did but it was broken. This wouldnt be a problem only for the heating being on full blast all night requiring us to leave the window open all night.. which brings me onto another point... this is a very noisy street.. and I mean veeeeeerrrrry noisy! The rattling of cars, scooters, mopeds, horns, beeping etc. going past the hotel was very loud, no chance of a sleep in anyway! There are a number of good restaurants close by, couple of bars, nice walks around the Vatican... Might not be the best place for those looking for nightlife though! Over all we had a great stay.. would recommend!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just had a long weekend in Rome and can't praise enough the hotel and its staff. It is out of the centre and you must know this when you book, however if it was more central it would have cost us a lot more money (4 adults - 840 Euros for three nights). The hotel is very clean and towels are changed every day - not something that happens everywhere particularly in the USA. The breakfast buffet has enough choice to give you a good start on the day and the staff are very efficient at getting your coffee etc. We had a quad room with two large and comfortable double beds, it was clean and cool with good sound proofing and black out curtains. There is free wi fi in the lobby if you need it. The bar is open 24 hours and this made for a nice end to each evening with a rooftop drink. The prices are very reasonable as is the minibar. Central Rome is about a 30 minute stroll and the hop on hop off bus is only 10 minutes away and as the bus and metro are only a few steps away the location is perfect. There is a good choice of local restaurants and again as they are just out of the centre are very reasonably priced. Howeve we found that eating out in Rome is not expensive. The staff are very helpful and happy to give advice on what to do and how to do it. We would advise booking any tours (Vatican, Colleseum etc) with a "jump the line element" in them as the queues are very long. Another tip we picked up is to use your own water bottle and fill it from one of the many water fountains all over the city especially if you are visitng in the summer. We hope to return to Rome very soon and will definitely stay at the Alamandi Vaticano and can recommend it without hesitation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After extensive research, my partner and I booked into the Alimandi in vaticano for a 5 days trip in april 2007. If you have already spent many hours looking for somewhere good to stay then stop looking - you need to stay here. We've used RoomsAccomodation to book our stay and had no problems at all. Through them we got a fabulous discount on our Rome hotel (so much so that we were worried that there was a mistake and we'd be laughed out of the hotel on arrival!) but when it came to checking out of the hotel the ridiculously low RoomsAccomodation price was indeed the one we paid. You don't have to part with a single penny up front, and the cancellation terms are fabulous too. I wouldn't hesitate to use them again. So, what about the alimandi? it is hard to write a review that will do justice to it Comfort ? Tops; Beautiful old building in more than pristine order. Suites lovely with real individual identity. Location? Great; close to the vatican city inside the rione borgo. We love to walk but subway 80yds. Price? Whatever you pay for this is a bargain. I have mourned sant’ anna since it passed, but finding alimandi makes it all worthwhile. The truth is, it is like staying with your favourite aunt who happens to live in a beautiful property, in where it is happening now in rome. She is your favourite aunt because not only does she know how to look after you, she is cool enough to let you have all the space you want. The bed was the most comfortable I have slept in for ages. All sheets and towels changed daily. I would not hesitate to recommend the alimandi to anyone. The entire staff, from doormen to conceirge to maid staff were nothing but impeccably mannered and generous with their help. so...thanks to RoomsAccomodation.com and hotel Alimandi staff</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I booked 3 nights at the Hotel Alimandi Vaticano based on the great reviews on Tripadvisor. We were delighted with pretty much everything about our stay there. The staff speak excellent english and they could not have been more welcoming, or more efficient and helpful towards us. They were happy to recommend good restaurants in the area and on the morning we checked out, they asked what time our flight was - on hearing that it wasn't until that evening, they said we were welcome to leave our luggage at the hotel until later, if we wanted to spend a few more hours sightseeing before we left Italy. The room we stayed in was exactly as described on the hotel's website. Elegant decor, nice cool marble floor, very big bed with a firm mattress, reasonably priced mini bar and working air conditioning. The bathroom wasn't huge but it was modern, well equipped and spotlessly clean. We were suprised by how quiet and peaceful the hotel was, considering it's right in the centre of Rome and on quite a busy street. But we didn't hear very much street noise or traffic at all from our room and it was very easy to sleep at night. Breakfast was served downstairs in the dining room. It's self service (buffet) apart from coffee, which is waitress service. The coffee wasn't the greatest - a bit weak and watery - but the food was nice enough, nothing fancy just simple but very well cooked basic things like eggs, sauted potatoes, sausages and grilled vegetables, etc. They also had fresh pastries and croissants, which were very nice too. The rooms don't have ironing facilities but you can use an iron and ironing board belonging to the hotel, if you go down to the basement with your things. We did this on the first evening and while it wasn't ideal, it wasn't a big problem either. As the hotel's right in the middle of town, practically next door to the Vatican, it's perfectly located for sightseeing.</p></li>
