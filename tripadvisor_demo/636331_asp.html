Ten minutes on the train from the airport and you're there and only $6 for two people. The hotel is just outside the station and the tram runs at the other side of the hotel. 15 minutes takes you into central for $5 for two people.</p></li>

The toilet should have a door though as I would like to protect my partner from certain smells and sounds. Good location for train back to airport and its quiet. Thanks qbic.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location.. zuid station is in next station after schiphol railway station. The hotel is easy to find. Just ask to the reception of WTC. The bed is ok. The staff is great. The only things bother me is the bathroom. It's in the bedroom (literally!!). No door that separate the bedroom and the bathroom. The smell of your poo will spread to all over bedroom. Less hygienic. Kindly consider it! Overall is ok.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The rooms are modern and typical presenting you a mixture of just what you would need in a new setting. Rooms are spacious, clean, whereas the facilities itself are limited. Use th hotel as you like, bt staff and food is available around the clock. The idea that you can adjust the atmosphere did not work well; I only had blue lights available. Good train connections to the airport. Fair connections to city centre.</p></li>

There is no wardrobe and the only storage space offered is a coat stand with four coat hangers on!? And yes the bathroom does not have a door but for me this wasnt a problem.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Easy transport to/from Schiphol and Amsterdam town. Nice quiet business area to stay in with nice coffee shops in local vicinity. Right next door to Amsterdam Zuid station. Tram #5 (from behind WTC) or #51 (from inside the station) to Amsterdam Central. Make use of the mini cards at the hotel to save a little money around the attractions. Ask the staff if you need information because they were fantastic and so helpful.</p></li>

Very challenging to use the bathroom, no rack nor hanger for ur stuffs, not even a place to hang your used towels. Also, due to the design, u can easily flood the whole bathroom!</p></li>

Though I did miss a shelf in the bathroom and a bit more frequent cleaning under the beds...but this won't put me off staying there next time! Staff were helpful and very friendly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Thought at first that this may be a bit weird but it was great. easy to get to from airport and 10minute metro ride into centre of Amsterdam. Big comfortable beds. Big television. Compact living. No airs and graces. No wardrobes drawers etc. but a great concept. Very clever idea. If you want luxury hotel attributes then pay the high prices in the centre of Amsterdam. if you want clean basic accomodation with a easy to use transport system just out of town this is perfect. Would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perhaps it's modern day big city culture, but when I'm in a hotel, 8000 km from home, I like to be treated friendly, not feeling unconfortable when asking question, I am away from home, I don't know my environment and , perhaps of this I do ask dumn questions, but does this have to result in an arrogant reaction? Besides this the room was ok, but the shower was dirty, not enough hot water and to small for people over 1.80 (bending in the morning is not a strong point of you get a certain age). Paul</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">2 words: centralized climatization. They couldn't turn off the air-con, so we ended up with a small appliance to keep us warm while the air-con was still on! To compound it, the mattresses were so bad (looked to me like wool filled or something, back from last century) that I ended up with a contracture in the neck, so I had to stop my sight-seeing. Also, the breakfast was very expensive. Just in front of the hotel, in the WTC plaza, there is a couple of places to have better food and half the price.</p></li>

I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would recomment it to other travellers. I would stay there again. Room equipted with t.v. not sure if wifi was working.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Qbic is the first stop on the train from Schipol airport. Gent on reception was very pleasant and helpful. Check in was 3pm and he allowed us to check in before 12pm which was great. Hotel was good value for money and clean (compared to what you would have got in the city for your money). Tram 5 stopped just behind the hotel and took approx 25 mins to get into centre but least you got to see the sights on the way. Metro 51 took around 10 mins but you didn't see as much. I have no complaints re this hotel and would stay here again and would recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">room is nice, spacious with 2 big safes. Continental breakfast is good. Free internet access. Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Very convenient with 12mins away from Sciphol airport by train and 15mins from central station with metro that runs until midnight. Just buy a 1, 2 , or 3 days all transport pass which cost as little as 7,50e, 11,50e and 15,50e if you don't plan to visit many museums. Highly recommend to go for a day trip that visit marken, volendam (sourvenirs, food are much better here compared to Ams) , windmill, clog factory, cheese factory.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I really liked the hotel, the room was very cool and it was clean. The price for Amsterdam was very good for what you got, a lot of other places in Amsterdam are more money for a lot less. That being said, it was far from the main parts of town, and although it was close to the metro, the location was still a major drawback. The other thing was that we were one of the unlucky people to got a room without a window, which made it feel like a cave at times, and hard to dress for the day. Overall I would stay here again but not without looking at other places first.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved the Qbic, is was a little far from the city center, but did have a tram stop right outside the hotel, making it a quick trip, and a train station for easy access to Schipol airport. I loved the bed, it's extremely comfortable, which is rare in Amsterdam, and the room was very quiet because of the location. The bathroom was nice, but it was not private at all...That was really the only downside. We stayed for one night, so it wasn't a big deal, but i see how it could create a problem. Overall this was a very nice hotel and i would definetly stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Comfy room in terms of size, layout and the bed, i just don't like the bathroom design, as there is no door, easy to catch cold after shower. Extremely conventient location, 5 mins train to the airport, 1 min walk to the train station, 2 mins walk to the tram back to the city center and what other hotel can be more convenient then this. Its located inside a commercial zone, which i found it more save and quite in compare to those hotels located at the city center, too many drunk man passing by. I will definitely staying in Qbic again if the price is still this reasonable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, right on the tram line, easy access to city center for tourists. Free internet in the lobby is nice. Large beds, comfortable, and lots of sunshine through big windows. Quirks: no front desk or consistent staff presence, no door on the shower/bathroom, no phone or clock in the room, and bed/TV setup that makes it difficult to watch comfortably. The colored lights above the beds are great fun, but don't work reliably. It seems like the place was thrown together quickly. And a note: use discretion with who you bring along -- we had photos of condoms on the wall of our room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I LOVED this hotel! It is so new, clean and funky. The rooms are great, so different to normal hotel rooms. Lovely big, comfy bed and a powerful shower. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed for two nights, and you probably couldn't stay for much longer than that, due to lack of storage space, but great for a little city break. The hotel is located between the airport and the centre, and it takes about 10-15 mins to get to each. I booked a couple of months in advance, so got the room for a very good price, and I feel that I got more than I paid for. Will definitely be going back again.</p></li>

The hotel's super easy to find (just take a metro, tram, or train to Station Zuid -- it couldn't be easier). The room were actually very large compared to other European rooms I've stayed in, and the lobby/entrance area is awesome. My favorite part of the whole hotel were the vending machines in the lobby, which stock everything from beer to candy to toiletries. There's also a free computer to listen to in the lobby. The only downside is the doorless bathroom. It's a little weird, but everything else was so nice that it made up for that one flaw.</p></li>

For the price that we paid, even though we are on budget, we expect the room to be make up! If there is no room service, we would rather check in a hostel rather than a hotel. We just bear with the hotel because of the convenient location. The redeeming features (that I do not give one star) was because of this one very helpful staff who answers our questions about Amsterdam.</p></li>

We stayed at Qbic Hotel, and we were very pleased with our stay there. The staff was very friendly when we arrived, and helped us with directions. The hotel was very close to both metro and tram. It took around 15 minutes to get to the centre with the tram. We also had a small store and restaurants close. The rooms had a cool touch with the cubic bed and bathroom. Some people can probably find it quite weird that the bathroom has no door. It was nice living a little bit outside the centre and weâ€™re very pleased with our stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The only big drawback for us was that there is no way to close the bathroom. You really have to know your partner, because you will hear everything going on there as its just a couple of meters away. Upon arrival the bathroom was clean, but not as shiny as you would like your bathroom in a hotel to be. My girlfriend missed having a hairdryer available there. I would say the hotel is a good place to stay for couples below 40-45. Good service, nice hotel, good prices and quick and easy travel to all the places you wanna see while visiting Amsterdam. Can totally recommend the hotel if you are fine with having no bathroom door.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel very very OK, also for business. You can actually get some work done here, the rooms have desk space and an internet connection. Don't hesitate if you're planning to visit RAI, Amsterdam's exhibition & congress centre. It's nearby. For the lowest rates, book early, they use "yield management" just like the low cost airlines do. To go to the city centre, take the tram in front of the building. It's fast and costs way less than parking space or a taxi. Parking fees inside WTC, where Qbic is situated, are outrageous (75 euros for 24 hours) and there are no alternatives nearby. As a Qbic guest, you pay 29,50 euros / 24 hours, remember to ask for your Qbic parking card before leaving.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at Qbic for four nights and the hotel quality and service is excellent, one tip for travellers who like to party beyond midnight though . . . this isn't for you. It's a little out of town and the last tram is at 12:15am, a taxi from the centre cost me nearly 30Euros after missing the last tram. If your trip is just for sightseeing this is a great hotel with most of the big sights directly on the no 5 tram line into the centre. One train stop from the airport, it has both train and tram stops right outside the building. Security is good as you are in the World Trade Centre building and the hotel rooms are spacious and very comfortable if a little quirky in design. I'd certainly stay again.</p></li>

Hotel was fab though, all very open and the room was great not much storage for clothes I think 2 coat hangers, but the bed was very comfy with flat screen tv, although the glare from the window behind meant we couldnt see it! The bathroom was great situated in the middle of the room, so if your with someone whom you rather didnt see you in the shower or on the loo, this is a no no for you. Otherwise great transport links close by. Not so good for getting into at night, we nearly got locked out and had no idea how to get in/reach security.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First off, it's esasy to get to. From Schiphol just get the train to Amsterdam and get off at Station Zuid. Its them a 2 minute walk if that to the hotel, which is in the WTC. The train fair was â‚¬3,10 one way whereas the cab was â‚¬35,00. It's about a a 15/20 minute tram ride (line number 5 just outside the WTC door) to the Central Station and 10 minutes from the art galleries The room feels spacious and the modern design has the wow factor. The sofa and the bed were really comfortable and had a great nights sleep. The shower was great but the bathroom 'pod' has neither a door nor a towell rack which isn't so great. The staff were dead friendly and the self service kiosks were ok and there's a microwave.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from a 4 day stay at the hotel. Very handy for the RAI and only a 10 minute walk through Beatrix Park to get to the back of the Beach at the exhibition centre. Super handy for the Metro or Rail Link should you want to arrive from Schipol or go to Centraal Station. If you want to eat close there is a Wagamama's 2 minutes away Rooms are slightly quirky, but very stylish and comfortable. My only wish would be for a better desk/chair to work from. Slight wifi hiccup on the first day but that seemed to fix itself. The staff could not have been more helpful, they were always willing to give advice, book taxis etc. Value for money is a tricky one as all Amsterdam hotels put their prices up when there is a big exhibition on.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Last minute booking, Amsterdam hotels is expensive, so to get this qbic hotel is great. Ok it's not central but there's tram and tram just by the hotel. With the same price probably you'd get a dirty old and not nice accommodation in central Amsterdam. So this hotel is very good value. It's modern, cool led lights (unfortunately ours just stay in 1 colour but didn't bother us as we're in the hotel just to sleep). Other thing is the toilet is open, so there's no privacy when one of us using it, eventhough you're couple you'd still need a privacy to seat on the wc. I can see this hotel used a lot by business people (1 in a room) as the location is in the business district, World Trade Centre. Apart from that everything is fine. Cool hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was the WORST hotel we have ever stayed at! Our room did not have a window (couple that with the lack of normal-colored lights), the sheets had bread crumbs on them and we found an open condom wrapper by the bed. The worst part of it all is that there is no reception or ANYONE to complain to about all these disgusting things. So basically, we had no choice but to sleep in a dark room with used sheets. I have never felt more depressed by a hotel in my life. I got thirsty at around 11 o'clock and there were no open stores nearby (not even the convenience store in the subway station), so I was forced to buy a tiny 250ml water bottle from the hotel vending machine for the 'reasonable' price of 3 euros (~4.50). If I could give this hotel a minus, I would. it's not even worthy of one star.</p></li>

I stayed here because it was near the Zuid station and the university where I had business. Some things would annoy me if I had to stay longer than one night - there were only two or three clothes hangers, there was nowhere to put a toiletries bag in the bathroom except on the floor, there was nowhere to put the soap down in the shower, there was no hairdryer and almost no bathroom stuff. I can imagine the lack of a door on the bathroom might be inconvenient if you weren't alone. Another thing that could be remedied is how cold and concretey the lift area is. It's not a 'homely' hotel at all. The walls were a bit thin too. Breakfast was adequate. Privacy is an issue if you have a room facing the internal courtyard.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at Qbic 3-4 times for business, and it is consistently excellent. The WiFi is the best I've seen, and I travel for work all the time. The bed is clearly something they invested in, and the staff are friendly and helpful. There are no hidden charges, and it's pretty inexpensive overall. I like the fact that this is well designed for business travelers like me; outlets are plentiful, and lighting is good. There isn't any dresser or extra furniture, but that works for me since I live out of my suitcase anyway. My only minor requests would be for somewhat more comfortable chairs at the desk and a little more room in the bathroom to put toiletries. Otherwise, this is excellent, and the location mere steps away from Amsterdam Zuid station makes commuting stress-free. I can be in my room, leave and catch the train to Schipol two minutes later without breaking a sweat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Putting aside the fact that the staff were nice and helpful the rooms are without doubt the most tasteless, artless and unhip rooms I have ever had this miss-fortune to be booked into. Everything from the hideous open-plan toilet to the adolescent lighting made me want to find the "entrepreneurs" who thought up this nightmare and have them boiled in oil. The towels where thin. On a three night stay my room was made up once. It was impossible to open the curtains as the street (at a slightly higher level) was almost in your room. I have seen films about English prison cells which made favourable comparison with these rooms. I am well aware that young travellers need cheap and cheerful hotel rooms and that their idea of essentials may be different from an old git like me. However, this is just nasty and takes advantage of their naivety in this area, as the other revues attest.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Tons of issues, this place has problems. Bad 1) No outside signage of any kind, its in a mall hidden away nicely. 2) You have to be buzzed in after the mall closes, what a hasle. 3) No thermostat in the room and windows don't open. 4) No towel holders in the bathroom 5) No soap dish for the shower. 6) No bathroom door, not cool if you are staying with someone. 7) No shower curtain or door, water got everywhere including on the toliet paper. 8) No bathroom fan!! So you steam up the room 9) I requested 2 beds and got them, but they don't come a part! So my buddy had to sleep on the funky couch. 10) I am almost 6 feet tall and the bed boxed me in, I slept diagionally so my feet could fit. Not good to tall people! Good 1) Price 2) Location, just take the 5 into Central Station BAM in the red light disctrict! 3) Free WiFI and computers in the lobby, 1 Mac, 1 PC. Nice! 4) Free snacks 5) Nice staff and very helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">While the staff were friendly, there were quite intrusive. We had knocks on our door at 4.14am when we were sleeping with the tv on to see if we were smoking in the room and then a knock first thing in the morning for the same reason when we didn't smoke in the room once. While there was nothing wrong with the hotel, apart from the fact that the bed isn't that comfortable, and the hotel is incredibly difficult to find, having stayed in the nearvy CitizenM last year, I could only recommend that you pay the extra 50â‚¬ and stay in CitizenM. Having thought I was being a savvy traveller by going for the cheaper yet similar hotel, I have learned that the quality of room and service you get for an extra 50â‚¬ is well worth the extra little bit of money. Quite a freaky hotel (the corridors are creepy at night-time once you've had a drink or two), and quite uncomfortable. Would honestly recommend CitizenM and not Qbic.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Service: Staff very friendly and helpfull. Free internet access at the reception area. Using magnetic stripe cards to gain access in the building, in the floor and in the room, provides extra security. Room: A small warm basic room with great lighting. The only disadvantage was the WC laking a door (it can be managed!! one web serfing free of charge at the reception area and the other using the WC). Moreover, you can not open the windows but we spent only a few hours at the hotel, mainly for a night sleep. Thus we didn't mind this flaw. We did mind though that the double bed was not actually "double". It was 2 twin beds and a matress above them that made it a double bed. Location: Based at the WTC, is a little bit far from the city center (I regard Dam Square as City Center). It takes about 25 minutes by tram. But we used a bike and we enjoyed the route (cycling is very easy in Amsterdam cyclists are highly respected).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Qbic Hotel for 4 days in September and the first reason why I chose is about its value. Rewies were good but when we saw the hotel location, room hygiene and decoration, I was like â€œThis hotel absolutely deserves more stars!â€�. We didn't encounter anything bad about hotel or stuff during accommodation. Location is awesome! if you don't like loudy places, this hotel is very suitable for you. Also, it is very closed to the City Center... Nearest station (Zuid Station) is only 1 min and central is 10 min. Rooms were very decorative, modern and enjoyable. Bed and pillows were confortable. Bathroom was clean and colorfull too. There was no door for bathroom but it isn't in the public eye =) Stuff were helpfull, kind and also easy to communicate in English. Maybe breakfast value seems expensive but endeed it is normal when it is compared outside cafes' breakfasts.. In a sentence, I can highly recommend this Hotel.</p></li>

It doesn't have a wardrobe or drawers which could be a bit weird however it is very clean, has a big side to put things on and has a coat stand which they give you hangers for, for things which cannot stay in the suitcase. It has a tv, the bed is huge, the shower is amazing and we didn't have any problems with hot water. We also had a massive window in the room which was nice. It was near the city centre, only 5/6 stops away on the metro which was quick and cheap if you buy a 24 hr / 48 hr pass. The metro station was under 2 min walk away, The staff were really friendly also and made an effort to help you find your way in the city. Take a hairdryer as this isn't provided. Basically we would go back again and would definately recommend to friends,</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel with clean, stylish, cozy rooms and friendly staff. This is a very modern hotel with elevators and stairs. It's located at the WTC complex by the Amsterdam Zuid(south) station so it's convenient to get to from the Airport. Could be a little trickier from the #5 tram line; just make sure you print out the directions. After that, it depends where you need to go. It's a bit far to walk into the center from here but the 5 tram takes you right to most of the popular tourist destinations. You'd be fine on bikes as well. It's not a terribly Dutch place so if you want a more authentic hotel (in a 200 year old building with steep stairs, single pane glass and no elevator but closer to the center), look elsewhere but if you want a really nice place to stay for not much money, this is your place. My only minor complain was that the room was a bit cold and I found no way to adjust the thermostat but under the covers I slept fine.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is great if you are on a budget. We stayed here for 3 nights and were very pleased with how cheap we managed to get the hotel. The rooms are interesting and the lighting is fun, the only two real criticisms are the openplan/open door bathroom which can at times be a bit irritating if you require privacy! I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless you are pretty close to your travelling companion! Also, cleaning of the room was a bit hit and miss and it would have been nice to have the room properly cleaned and the bed properly made at least once during our stay. The staff are friendly and helpful and the hotel is convenient for the airport and WTC. The tram ride to the centre is not too bad and with an IAmsterdamCard all tram travel is included which kept costs down. The distance can also work in Qbic's favour because it is nice to escape from the centre after a busy day sightseeing. All in all a great value for money hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The service here was incredibly helpful. It seemed the concept behind this concept hotel was simplicity, and in fact nearly everything in the lobby was self service. But there seemed to always be someone there working as well and all the employees we encountered were perfectly competent and very helpful. And the location was better than it seems to be - subway and busses within 20yards of the hotel connect easily to downtown Amsterdam within about 15 or 20minutes of travel. Which is good though because there seemed to be pretty much nothing around near the hotel. The one big drawback i can imagine a lot of people having (aside from not actually being downtown in the center) is the bathroom area of each room is not closed off from the rest of the room at all. The toilet is in your bathroom. Wasn't a big deal with me as i was traveling with a physical intimate date, but with just friends this would have really sucked. The free wifi internet was very helpful too:-)</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A decent hotel, if not excellent. I used it as a low cost business hotel - it's built into one of the World Trade Centre buildings on the lower floors. It's easy to get to, it's a 2 min walk from Zuid train station which is 7 mins from Schipol airport. The rooms are somewhat odd, not sure I'd want to share one with someone else due to the pod structure which means there is no door/side wall on the bathroom area. This is probably fine if you're not a prudish Brit. The bathroom styling is funky, if impractical - no shelves anywhere to put things on for instance. The bed however was comfy, TV picked up UK programmes, free wifi, lots of weird lighting combinations. Not much of a view - open the curtains and could see people at their desks in the WTC. Make sure you're dressed, :-) Breakfast was ok, a small selection of ham, cheese and bread along with cereal. All you need if not expecting luxury. Summary: Decent enough hotel for the money, just don't expect excellence.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had looked at reviews and pictures prior to booking so we knew exactly what we should expect...and we were not disappointed. The hotel is in the WTC and easily accessible via the tram system - there is a stop that drops you off right in front of the WTC. Our room was great - green lights and yes, the bathroom that everyone was talking about but we thought it was just fine. We loved the bed with the lights and the TV built into the wall right above the bed - plus the bed was probably one of our softest and most comfortable throughout our Europe stay. The room was large, too, especially for Europe. When we arrived, we could not use the computerized check-in or out as we had booked through travelocity instead of QBIC directly however within seconds, an employee (always very friendly and helpful) was there to help us. Breakfast was 10 Euros and was good as well. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel especially if you are looking for something different and are open to new experiences!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The standard of cleaning in the room was appalling as you will see from the photo - I doubt the underside of the bed has ever been cleaned - there were balls of dust behind the kickboard. The mirror, television, lamps, side of bed and skirting boards were also covered in dust so thick it could be written in. As a respite from the room, my partner and I decided to buy some tea and watch TV in the lobby. The host /concierge complained that he had been watching the football and asked us to switch back to the channel he preferred. At breakfast, he and a colleague had a very loud conversation, practically shouting across the room. His female colleague was so rude to two female guests I almost intervened. The location, room and design and cost are great but staff and cleaning leave a great deal to be desired. I'm use d to' a hotel being run for the convenience of the guests - not the staff as it appeared to be at Qbic. I've rated below but actually if the staff and cleaning were improved the rooms could rate as Very Good or Excellent</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Conveniently located next to Amsterdam Zuid station, which is perfect if you arrive into Amsterdam via train. It is practically like 2 minutes walking distance from the station, and Amsterdam's good transport system guarantees easy access to anywhere into town. The room is a bit dark though, there is no bright / white light option, and the washroom is totally exposed to the room (no partition walls). Not the best option for 2 occupants who are not on naked-terms basis. The exposed toilet also meant that smell or poor toilet hygiene might be a potential problem. Was really impressed with the service. When i mentioned to the counter that i could not find the thermostat, she explained that the rooms are centrally heated, but nonetheless, when i returned back to the hotel at night, i found a fan heater provided on the table. Very thoughtful. On a separate occasion, i saw her helping another tourist couple finding accommodation at other hotels and all. Top marks for the staff for me. Free wireless provided was a plus, spacious rooms, a good stay indeed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a cool place. 5 minutes by train from amsterdam schiphol, so great when you are flying out from amsterdam, which we were. also good for a weekend in amsterdam, if you can manage the tram, metros and train. Only a 30 minute walk from downtown amsterdam. It is in amsterdam zuid, WTC, which is a very nice area. It is like a village on it's own, with great restaurants and shop. The walk from there into the towncentre is great, you can't get a better area in amsterdam. Make sure you've got a good map. You can also take the tram 25, which will take you to leidseplein and so on. The rooms are great, and so cheap, I paid 40 euro for a double. They are spacious, hastens bed (!!), great shower and a lcd tv. The hallways are a bit peculiar, looks like a bamboo forest and it smells like skunk, at first I thought there were some people smoking some, but after a while I realised, that it was some sort of airfreshner; the dutch are a bit quirky.... great sense of humor. Breakfast was okay, very relaxing area. Overall a great place to stay, will go again for sure!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Qbic as part of a flight/hotel package deal. We specifically chose Qbic because it was closer to town than many of the other hotels on offer with the package. Qbic rooms are very unique and very comfortable. We had a lovely time during our stay of three nights and would highly recommend it. Our room was VERY comfortable, and due to the unique layout/design - the rooms are actually quite spacious despite its label as a pod hotel. The fact that there is not staff everywhere made this for a very private and quiet trip. (only usually one staff around if you need them, otherwise they come and bring fresh towels and soap each day). Also love the fact that there is a (free) safe in the room.... Bathroom is cool, best shower heads ever (they're huge!) and the beds are VERY comfortable. This is a great stay at a great price, privacy, security, comfort and location (far enough away from town to be quiet - 10 mins on tram to city centre and tram stops right outside hotel) and close enough to not feel like you are miles from everything. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</p></li>

Looks great. Functioned well. The bed was comfortable! The bathroom was clean and functional. The lighting effects were cool. The room wasn't cramped; so I had room to do some exercises. Location: easy to get to from the Schiphol airport by train and easy to get to Amsterdam Centraal by tram. It's not in a neighbourhood so it's a cold corporate area. But, you can jump on the transit to go somewhere for dinner, sightseeing, entertainment, etc. It was nice to leave behind the hustle n bustle of the central area of Amsterdam, but not have to go very far away to get to Qbic. Staff at the Qbic were friendly, warm, and helpful. They all didn't dress in a uniform, but looked great. I liked how the staff were allowed to dressed as they wished, but still look really good. I had no problems with communicating with them in English. I arrived at the hotel at about 9am and was able to put my luggage in a make-do luggage room without any problems.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Every now and then you stay somewhere that you know you will remember, somewhere that stands out from the all too common standard of most mid range hotels. But when you are paying a budget price, for a mid range place you are curious, if not suspicious. Qbic is a concept, it is like nothing I have ever experienced before in terms of a hotel, in many ways it tries to break the mould of a bog standard normality and succeeds. Check in was a breeze, the staff were extremely friendly, it bore the welcoming of a guesthouse, the comfort of home and the feel of a Marriott that has been kitted out by some rich boy with a love for gadgets and lights. For me it epitomised Amsterdam and the Netherlands, the lessaiz faire attitude, the modern way to do things and the belief in something that is not normal, but great nonetheless. The only downside is that this hotel is out of town and really there isnâ€™t a great deal to do. It is only twenty minutes, but if this hotel was in the centre it would have got five stars from me. Take nothing away from the hotel though, this is one place that promises â€“ and delivers.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for 2 nights (I actually have an appt here but needed some peace and quiet and a good internet connection for work) Initially was a little apprehensive due to some of the reviews and the fact that itÂ´s inside the WTC, but having spent 2 peaceful, warm (yes the rooms may be cold sometimes but you can get a heater from the very helpful staff that warms it up really quick) nights I have to say I am impressed. (and I dont impress easily) My old first choice for a hotel here was the Arena but since theyÂ´ve refurbed their prices have doubled so this is now my first choice. Pros: Brilliant , helpful friendly staff (which in AMS is rare as hens teeth) Fantastically comfortable bed and duvet. Funky lighting and design. Location is superb as you have station zuid right outside along with Burger King, Albert Hein and several bars, restaurants. Cons: Got woken at 3am by the shower coming on, blew the main fuse in room twice and the broke the door entry system, but then the staff fixed all this with no fuss whatsoever, so not really a con. Would I use this place again, most def. am booking in for next week :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel, spread over different floors in the Amsterdam world trade centre was a comfortable experience. The rooms different than most hotels, sort of "modules" with bed and shower buildt together. no door to the toilet took some getting used to :-) but is no problem except if you wind while going :-). The bed was perfect and comfortable - amongst the best hotel beds we've had anywhere. because they're built in, they dont move if you,re a wild sleeper! Light and decor in the room is...well different...but you can create your own mood with the lighting. The staff is exceptionally helpful, patient and friendly! But be aware of the no smoking in the rooms policy in the Netherlands! It is right next to the train station, but it is better to use the tram or bus (other side of the WTC) to centre. Direct trains to Schiphol though. On the square there is a small supermarket and even a takeaway restaurant. In the reception of the hotel they serve a reasonable breakfast (10 euro) and they have a coffee machine and vending machine for soft drinks, beer and chocolate. Very practical if you need drink or snacks at odd hours!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at QBic with my boyfriend in April. The overwhelming memory I have is that we seemed to be the only people staying there!? I don't necessarily mean there is a reason for this as the overall stay was adequate and the features of the room (like the bed etc) were unique and I enjoyed having them there. Few qualms: -Room was a bit shabby (few wires hanging out) , but I am a student and I have stayed in FAR worse and it just pedantic to rattle on about such things. Most importantly the bathroom & sheets were immaculate. -There was no safe place to store my luggage as I had an evening flight but had to vacate my room, but again, not a reason not to stay here. -However, I would NOT stay here with someone I was not close to, as the bathroom did not have a door! Haha. Perhaps other rooms have this option... I have seen people complaining about the price, this hotel is very cheap for what you get. Sure it is fairly far away from the centre of town, but you are in Amsterdam! It has a brilliant and fairly cheap transport system which means you can save a few pennies for..other stuff. Staff were very very friendly and helpful aswell!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Qbic hotel is right next to the exit of the railway station Amsterdam Zuid. It is not located in the city center, near the important museums, etc. but the public transport (tramway) in Amsterdam is excellent and takes you in no time where you want to go. The Qbic hotel advertises as a do-it-yourself hotel, where you can check in yourself, buy a drink and snacks in a vending machine, but when I entered a friendly girl welcomed me and even gave me no chance to check in myself. The room was bigger than expected. My room in the hotel where I stay in my holidays on Mallorca is smaller, although I have to stay there 1 or 2 weeks. The hotel is part of the big and busy WTC, but are however very quiet and the comfortable big bed ensures good night rest. As mentioned before, there are no drawers, but for a short stay I find this is not necessary. There is a big clothes hanger to put your clothes on. Also said by other contributors: the showerhead should be a little higher. This is defenately a good hotel. Prices vary according to availability, so if you look out, you can sleep here reasonably cheap. I hope that more Qbic hotels come in different cities in Europe soon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I needed a place to stay in order to be at an early meeting the next day. This hotel is located inside the Amsterdam WTC, which is a business district. This means it's not exactly a bubbly location at night, but brilliant if you have to connect to a train or subway (both 1 minute away), or the airport (7 minutes away). The room was larger than I expected, and looked pretty much like the pictures. A 'bed and bathroom' combination thing with funky lighting and flatscreen. two bar stools and a lounger. Not much else, but I didn't need more. The room could have been cleaned a bit better, although it did not bother me too much. The usable surface was clean, and the sheets and towels were absolutely spotless. Due to the design bed, there are some edges and corners collecting dust, the overall impression would be even better if more attention would be paid there. Pro: fantastic location for business district, public transport and airport for a great price. Funky room with super bed Quite nice lobby for reading a book or having breakfast Free (fast) wifi Con: location quite deserted at night Room a bit empty, not very suitable for romantic get-aways Room was a bit dusty</p></li>

Its not far from the city centre but it may seem far if you travel by tram as the tram stops at every corner so the journey seems longer! The hotel itself to look at is really nice and funky and very clean and artsy. To check in is easy and although we needed assistance, someone was there to help and he was always available during the time we were there, if he was needed. We didnt get a window room so we never knew what the weather was like outside nor what time of day it was. Its a good thing my boyfriend had a watch! The TV is situated in a stupid place as u cant really see it due to the glare, they need to bring it down a bit as its too high. The bathroom. Well, if you are not comfortable with going to the toilet in front of your partner, then dont stay here as its an open plan bathroom. Also, if either of you were to do a smelly number 2, it would stink out the whole room. Luckily we didnt experience this but it is a possibility if someone's poos dont smell nice! You cant smoke in the hotel which is something I wasnt initially told but it didnt really matter. Overall it is a nice hotel, but I wasnt overly impressed and would stay somewhere closer to town next time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First impression: To access the hotel is incredibly hard. It's hidden inside the WTC building, security checks are througout the entire building. The service is not very friendly and you have to do everything yourself (check-in and faq). Underneath it's modern look and lavish interior decoration i's a cold, rough hotel. The rooms: No heating, no remote controls, no doors in the bathroom, low lighting, no phones, no drinking cups, no phones (i know we already had that but it's really annoying cause there is no cell phone service either and no public phone and no wake up calls), no alarmclock,. We asked if there is a restaurant near but they said no. Turned out there was lots of places at the trainstation. Besides that we were left a message by our friends but the guy forgot our roomnumber so we didn't get it.. Besides all of the above, it's an ok hotel for a business person that travels alone and only for 1 night (the bathroom floors will stay wet after showering). If you are traveling with 2 people be aware that they can hear, smell and enjoy all the sounds while you are on the toilet. Good luck! btw, we did get a free glass of orange juice for all the problems mentioned above (and it was good too!)</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Qbic hotel with my boyfriend for 2 nights and we really enjoyed it. It certainly is a unique and funky concept-the staff that work there are super friendly and were very helpful with recommendations on restaurants and transportation. The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the tram, bus, rail and metro so it is really well connected even if it is not in the central area of town (we got a 48hour travel card for 11.50 euro each which was perfect for us). Breakfast was simple but adequate with croissants, pastries, fruit, cereal, rolls, yoghurts and the best was the chocolate sprinkle!! The lack of window in the room (window was frosted over with blinds) wasn't too much of an issue for us although I don't know if I could stay there much longer than a few nights (we were out and about heaps anyway so didn't spend much time in the room). My only negative comment was the noise we experienced on the Monday morning-our room was next to a carpark and loading dock so at 7am we were woken by this and then we could also hear office workers walking around in the area which is joined to the hotel (WTC) so we did not get as good a sleep as we would have liked on our second night but the first night (Saturday night) was fine.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is in a really good location-there is the metro at one side of it and tram and bus stops at the other so getting to the centre is no problem at all which is great! The staff were nice and friendly, we arrived too early for check in but the woman who was there allowed us to check in early as she had some rooms available which was very nice after a long morning! Only complaint about the service is that there wasn't any room service. I thought they hadn't even been in the room but my partner pointed out we had fresh towels and new toiletries which was all very nice but they could have made the bed!! The lights in our room didn't work which wasn't the end of the world as I liked the purple but still not what we thought we were getting. I also found the rooms to be quite stuffy and incubated and was glad to get out and get some fresh air when I woke up each morning. They have well stocked vending machines in the 'living area' downstairs which is good as there are no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms. There are also a few restaurants around and a shop as well as a burger king and shop in the train station just outside. All in all, we enjoyed our stay here-the rooms were nicely decorated and with a few tweaks it could be amazing!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 2 nights at Qbic Amsterdam. It is a chic, boutique hotel, slightly overhyped if you ask me. Location wise, it is accessible via Metro Line 51 and Tram Line 5. Precise instructions were given to us prior to arrival hence there was no problem locating the hotel. Qbic is located away from the action in Amsterdam, about 20 mins ride to Centraal Station, Dam, Museum area. OK if you don't mind a bit of travel. By the way, there is no supermarket, eateries near the Qbic hotel although these are available via vending machines in the lobby. The room is nice but not worth paying the premium. Big bed flat pillows. Noticed that a thick layer of dirt has accumulated underneath the bed, not obvious due to the green and red lights inside the room. There is no door concealing the bathroom and shower area, if you don't mind the lack of privacy. I did noticed the inconsistency of service in Qbic, I got free hot water on my 1st night but had to pay euro 1.50 on my 2nd night. I would much appreciate if the reception staff had been more friendly and helpful. Overall, OK experience. Nothing to be excited about. I probably will give Qbic a miss on my next visit to Amsterdam. Choose something near town if you want to be close to the attractions in Amsterdam.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I stayed for three nights from the 21-24 August. The hotel was brilliant, the reception area was modern and well decorated with a free to use computer as well as vending machines selling snacks and drinks. The staff were very helpful and let us borrow plates and cutlery for food we had bought. We arrived about half an hour before the 3pm check-in time but they let us check-in early. The hotel is easy to reach from the airport, about a ten minute train ride to Amsterdam Zuid station which is opposite the hotel. It was about 15 minutes to Centraal Station on the number 5 tram which stops about a 2 minute walk from the hotel, which was very handy. The room itself was well lit from a large window, well decorated and clean. Our towels were changed every day and the bed was made every day too. There were a few scratches on the walls and the metal wall/'casing' of the bed was ever so slightly in need of a wash, but the bed itself as well as the bathroom and other surfaces were all clean. The shower(s) was hot and powerful. The lack of bathroom door was not an issue, there are toilets located on every floor. Overall, a brilliant hotel which I would mainly recommend to couples and friends travelling together. Thank you Qbic for a great stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Qbic hotel was a good hotel. The price was affordable, it was clean and in a great location. The hotel is really close to the subway station and the tram. It is about a a 10 minute ride to the centre and the tram comes often and runs pretty late. There is a Albert Heign grocery store right beside the hotel, they sell a lot of ready made sandwiches, pasta, fruit etc. The hotel has a microwave so you can purchase foods and warm them up. The hotel is located in the World Trade Centre building, the interior is professional and cozy. On the weekend the hotel is quiet. The rooms are spacious the internet worked okay. They also have a free computer downstairs for public use. The TV had few American channels. The neighborhood is cozy and great for walking. I felt safe at this hotel. It is in walking distance to Citizen M. Citizen M seems to be a bit better but they tend to also be a bit pricier. The only thing we didn't like was the bed, we found it to be too low and uncomfortable, the bathroom does not have a door and the water tends to clog up when you are taking a shower. There are plenty of washrooms outside of the room that you can use if you are uncomfortable with the no door thing. The colour lighting is cool you can also get clear lighting if you want as well.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Interesting, fun hotel in great location, two minutes from train / metro station and just round the corner from tram stop, from which trams go to museum district and main train station. I stayed here to see a show at the Amsterdam Arena, as there is a metro train directly from the station, and felt fairly safe walking the short distance from the train station to the hotel alone late at night. Friendly staff, who speak English. Rooms really quirky and different from the norm - corridor outside my room had green lighting and actual room, when entering, had red lighting (although you can change this), making it feel a little like a theme park. There was no window so when the lights were turned off it was pitch black, which allowed me a great night's sleep! Turning on the lights in the morning, having the soft, different coloured lights working through their sequence was a gentle way to wake up too. Room quite minimalistic, with just a bench table and a couple of stools at the end of your bed (and the TV above), so was not really sure where you're supposed to put things but was not staying long so was not a problem. You step up into the bathroom so it kindof feels like you are on a stage. As stated by others, the bathroom has no door, which is a little strange but fine if you're in the room alone!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in this hotel from May 10th to May 12th. The first thing you need to know about Qbic is: It was suppose to be a flat apartment and it was converted to a design hotel. So the room is not the usual you expect from a hotel room. But this is not a bad thing at all. The room is clear and the bed is very comfortable. Nice shower. The staff is great. But I felt the room a bit could. Would be nice control the room temperature but the room has no temperature control. The hotel is a bit far away from Amsterdam downtown and there is not much options to eat or drink near the hotel, besides the ones that share the same building and they close early. They have vending machines on the lobby but the things are a little bit pricey. So bring your take away when you are coming back from downtown. They have breakfast for a fee but I not tried it. If you just want a cup of coffee they have a machine where you can grab for EUR 1,50. The coffee is very good besides the fact it is made on a vending machine. It was a nice surprise. Little bit more about location: The hotel is in the WTC Amsterdam Building and steps away from Zuid station. In 30 minutes tops you are in the Amsterdam Centraal Station so I dont think the location is an issue also Amsterdam has excellent transport system so you always can come back to hotel even late night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After endless searching for a decent hotel in Amsterdam due to my picky boyfriend I chose qbic because of the positive views it's received and wasn't disappointed at all! The hotel is really modern, nice self service reception an the rooms were a decent size, even the corridors were nice! I'm an art student so I really liked they lay out of the room as it's not like anything ive seen before! The bathroom doesn't have a door but it didn't bother us one bit, the shower was nice and powerful and thats all i really care about. The hotel is a bit out of the way but for the price and standard you really can't complain as you wouldnt find anything Half as decent in the city, the location surrounding the hotel is great. There's a tram, bus, metro and train station which all take you to the centre (all located on the doorstep) and a little supermarket in the square too! The only critism I have is the window situation, fair enough there's no window (I got over that as soon a I saw the creative stencil sprays) but serrrrriously you have to do something about that air con! We got so hot everynight, you would find a decent air con in any 3* hotel abroad so I don't understand why this hasn't been improved especially as there's no window, But aside from that I would happily go back to this hotel within a heartbeat, I really enjoyed my stay</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel on a business trip because I needed to catch a train early in the morning and this is next to the South/WTC railway station in Amsterdam, and because its design looked interesting. Unfortunately, this is one of these cases where pictures are misleading and inadequate. There are a few positive points too (and I'll name them at the bottom), but they are negligible in the perspective of the negatives. 1. This was my first hotel room without a window 2. Airconditioning could not be regulated within the room (without a window, that's crucial). The room temperature was probably around 25C, way too high for sleeping. 3. The walls of the room are too thin and the sound insulation of the door is inadequate. (My neighbor probably set his alarm wrong, so I woke up at 4AM. At 5 AM his friend from another room knocked on the door and I was awake again. At that moment I decided to get up myself and catch my train evenearlier than I had planned). 4. The lighting is spacy, but colored lights (you can pick your color) all the time got me a bit crazy 5. The materials are sensitive and the room had been worn down pretty fast. The positive sides then: 1. The bed is good 2. The shower is very nice Overall, unless you like a hot room, cannot stand the daylight and sleep like a rock, I recommend you not to stay in Qbic WTC Amsterdam</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On the whole I really enjoyed this hotel, it is located right next to Zuid station (walking distance) and the rooms are reasonably sized. The mood lighting is amazing and so is the breakfast bar that you have in the rooms too. On the whole the hotel was goo, but the following points really brought down the hotel experience: 1 - Firstly, Every morning... Well around 11am when taking a shower, (all three days, the shower was cold). 2 - You, cant control your room temperature of your room?!?!? It was a cold room and due to the heating being 'centrally located' it was totally controlled by staff - which made it awkward to go to reception to constantly ask for more heat!? 3 - Me and my partner stayed in one room, yet the beds were to single beds that sank in the middle due to loose support, this meant that we kept being pushed to the middle of the bed, quite annoying after a busy day around town. I think when going to Amsterdam again I would choose the CitizenM hotel for a much better experience - the rooms were clean and suitable, its just these points really brought it down. The breakfast didn't look all that great for 11 Euros but that's an opinion. There are no hair dryers or kettles in rooms, which can also be a pain. Its also easy to get into the centre of Amsterdam by the Number 5 tram, with a taxi costing around 17-20 Euro's. Next time I will choose Citizen M Hotel (a few minutes walk away).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is really cute, I loved the design of the WTC area, the inside living spaces and room. I had some problems with the toilet door which doesn't exist.. but this is part of the "Qbic" fun! Also there's no hairdryer and you cannot rent it from the reception either. The location is not in the centre but the metro is very frequent and connects you to the central station in 15 mins. Actually I thought it was better not to stay downtown as Amsterdam can be very noisy and somewhat dangerous at night. The only inconvenient I had was with the parking: the Hotel website doesn't say that parking in the WTC is not included and that it costs 3,60 euros per hour (external) or 75 euros per day (internal)! I was arriving there on Friday evening and I knew that the WTC was closed over weekends, so I assumed that the external parking was free as well. But when I called the reception to have a confirmation, they told me that the parking (internal or external) had to be paid for also on weekends and offered me to park inside with a special discount for "only" 29 euros/day. I was clever enough not to follow their suggestion and I found an external parking lot with a meter: I just had to pay for one hour (3,60 euros) and could stay until the next Monday morning. Conclusion: the Qbic offer to park for 29 euros is convenient on weekdays, but they should not make you pay also on weekends when the external parking is free!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Amazing!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place was absolutely amazing - very clean, fun. The location was perfect for us - not in the center of everything but a quick tram ride to town. (The tram was just downstairs, out the door and to the left ... easy to get to.) The room was not traditional, the "cubic" set up is not for those who prefer the run-of-the-mill Holiday Inn kind of hotel. The bathroom had no door, and there was only a half-panel of frosted glass between you and the rest of the bathroom, but it wasn't a problem for us. (Could be a problem if someone opens the room door - they'll get a peek, but that didn't happen). Easy access to the internet in the lobby, good variety of channels on the TV, the water in the bathroom was always hot, the towels clean and the room outfitted with many IKEA-brand items. (Which I love!) The staff was VERY friendly and willing to point you in the direction of whatever kind of activity you're going for while in town. There was a breakfast available, but we didn't partake, but a nice grab-and-go (translation: vending machines) section. The price (2 Euro!) for a can of soda was disconcerting, but the room was so cheap, I didn't mind. WARNING: This hotel is located in the World Trade Center - DO NOT PARK IN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER!! We made that mistake for our three-night trip when I failed to notice the parking was 75 EURO A DAY! Ye-ouch. The car's stay was pretty much twice the cost of our room each night. Lesson learned! Last words - I'd book again here in a heartbeat.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A decent priced, trendy and cool hotel, not in the city centre, but right next to metro, tram and nightbus stops”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a cool hotel for with small but nice and comfortable rooms. It is not a hotel with rooms to spend any longer time in, but good for sleeping. (Altough the "double bed" is actually two beds with a thinner mattres over, so the "crack" in between was quite noticable, but it didn't bother us though) The room can feel a bit like a cellar (especially since the windows are covered and just shows the inside of a parking house) But the design of the room with the nice light effects work better without windows. The staff was very friendly and helpfull, but the breakfast was a dissapointment, when paying 10â‚¬ you could except something more, this was just the basics. For example there was only cheese to put on the bread, no vegtables or meat. The shower was nice, but the bathroom not having any door needed some getting used to.. Also the bathroom lacked a hairdryer and shelves to put stuff on, and when showering the drain could not quite keep up witjh the water so some water escaped the shower cubicle and went to the hotell floor, which is not so good I guess.. The light is cool but a bit inconvinient for longer stays. It took about twenty minutes to go to and from the city centre with the public transportation, and I thought it worked really well. A metro, tram and nighbuss stops maybe 100 m from the hotel at station zuid, so very convinient. Also if traveling by train it is possible to go get off/on directly at station zuid instead of going to the central train station. (Depending on which train you travel with I guess) Overall a very good stay tough</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After much anticipation to stay here, my boyfriend and I were greatly disappointed. The front desk assistant was very nice; however, he advised of a few warnings that caught my attention. As my initial reservation failed to include my mobile number, he requested that I enter the information. This was no problem - it was the fact that my number would be needed to alert me of any temperature changes and/or leaks in my room. What?! I wanted to leave at this point, but I decided not to be too hasty. I was most displeased with the bathroom flooring and shower area. With its cheap construction and dingy appearance, it gave off a vibe that was less than sanitary. Had I stayed long enough to bathe, shower shoes would have been a necessity. The bed was also satisfactory; however, even when a room's decor falls short, a luxurious bed changes everything. With a room located at the ground level, we found no choice but to keep our curtains drawn. I'm a big fan of natural light, or even artificial light when all other options fail. This room offered none of the above. It had such a sad, depressing feel to it that it literally changed my state of mind. And despite the fact that the cost was non-refundable, and regardless of the fact that I totally couldn't afford to waste the money, my boyfriend and I checked out an hour later. CitizenM has been our hotel of choice for all our Amsterdam visits, and after our visit to the Qbic will remain as such. Despite the neon lighting and quirky interior design, the Qbic Hotel strives to compete with citizenM but falls short at every level.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend booked this hotel as a Birthday present for me. A long weekend in Amsterdam. From looking on the Website and on TripAdvisor i was very excited about the modern, funky rooms and wasn't disappointed when we finally got there. The room was a good size and the LED lights around the bed were just as good as it had looked online. Was initially a bit worried about the lack of door on the bathroom but i'll repeat what others have said in their reviews. It doesn't detract from the stay at all, the entrance is a different end to the bedroom area so it's not like you're lying in bed looking into the toilet. You get used to it pretty quickly! :) Plenty of plug sockets which is always good, Wonderful powerful shower, lots of towels (we stayed for 3 nights and had a fresh one every day) The staff in reception were very helpful. The location was perfect, a 5-10 minute train from Schipol airport gets you to the train station by the hotel, hotel is a 2 minute walk from the train station and to get into town the Trams go every 10 minutes or so and take about 20minutes to get to Central Station (However we got off at the Museum and walked the rest of the way into town because there was lovely things along the way) When we went all the canals were frozen over, everybody was ice-skating along them. The one negative about the hotel is that our room got very hot, the windows don't open and we didn't have any air con controls but that was about it. Overall, i would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in Amsterdam, great loacation, good rooms, clean, modern and a very decent price.</p></li>

<li>Was initially a bit worried about the lack of door on the bathroom but i'll repeat what others have said in their reviews.</br></br></li>
<li>It doesn't detract from the stay at all, the entrance is a different end to the bedroom area so it's not like you're lying in bed looking into the toilet.</br></br></li>
<li>You get used to it pretty quickly!</br></br></li>
<li>:) Plenty of <span style="background-color:#f032e6">plug</span> sockets which is always good, Wonderful powerful shower, lots of towels (we stayed for 3 nights and had a fresh one every day) The staff in reception were very helpful.</li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed at Qbic on a very rainy autumn weekend. Gladly we found out that there was a direct train connection from the airport to the Zuid station in Amsterdam. Safed us some valuable money for the rest of our city trip. A taxi ride in Amsterdam can, I believe, be very expensive while the train costs you about 3,5 euro. We were amazed by the big wtc building being so empty, we had to buzz ourselves in. Thought the hotel advertises as being a self service hotel, check in and check out using food machines, there was a very welcoming staff member who told us to ring him whenever we got stuck. The check in actually went easily. Once int the room we were amazed by the space and the furniture.. the Qubi. Looked realy cool and when we asked the staff member to change the lights he set all kinds of cool colours for us. The hotel itself is very easily reached by public transport and there are even night busses pendeling from midnight till early morning, again savinf you money. After a wild night of going out in Amsterdam it was great to stay in a nice and relaxed neighbourhood, away from the big and loud city, just 15 minutes away. We only wisehd we could have stayed in our bed longer since check out is 11.00 am. The only negative thing about hte room is that the toilet is open and that means not eating too much onions and beans, haha. Or just be very liberal with your partner, there are toilets a couple of seconds away from the rooms anyway. For the price, location and concept we will definetely look for Qbic again when we visit Amsterdam. Although the weather could have been better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiancee and I stayed at Qbic for two nights in early february. FACILITIES The room is great! bigger than most 3-5* hotel rooms we have stayed in and definately different... The lighting is good, with a constant blue colour, or groovy disco alternation between other colours. Reception was pretty good, with free internet, vending machines, books, seating area, and usually someone there to ask. LOCATION 10 minutes from Schiphol, and about the same from the city centre by tram. As part of WTC complex, it has excellent links, with a station for metro, tram, train or bus links. We bought a 3 day GVB ticket (Tram, Metro, Bus) for 14.50. Once there, Amsterdam is easily walkable, with attractions to suit all tastes. DOWNSIDES We stayed from Saturday - Monday, and over the entire weekend the WTC building was completely deserted (I mean, like a ghost town!!). This meant buzzing in to the building every time, and again at some automatic doors once inside. It doesn't sound like much hassle, but becomes rather annoying after the 3rd time! Checkout is at 11:00 so naturally we wanted somewhere to leave our luggage while we spent our final day in Amsterdam. The duty manager told us to leave it in the foyer as there are no lockers big enough to hold suitcases. This was fine with us as he assured us he'd be there all day - he was not there when we returned and the next duty manager seemed surprised when we pointed them out to him! It would be nice to have known they were safe in a locked room and not just left unattended in reception. All over, I give this hotel 4 stars for its cool interiors, great value and convenient location - it's only downside is its slightly annoying access during the weekend/lack of storage.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed hear in July of last year for first holiday. In booking the hotel we follwed the advice of reading reviews of trip advisor and other similar websites and never found any negative, just everyone stating it was a modern, funky hotel, so we went for it. On arriving staff were very friendly, cannot remember the mans name but is was mostly a male on all the time and he was very friendly and helpful, could not fault him. Helped us out with finding best attractions, tram tickets etc.Hotel first off is decieving on websites and is actually alot smaller in reception and room in real life, but this would not have been a problem to us. We were given our room and found it hilarious with changing lights, no shower or toilet door and were generally happy and amused.Problems were, our window looked into the buildings waste disposal and collection yard, not the most pleasing sight so we kept this closed which left room very dark. At 5ish in morning on 1-2 occasions, people started working in this yard with heavey machinary, making us and meaning we were unable to sleep. Another night i heard banging like a release of pressure from the toilet, it kept hapening so my boyfriend went and looked anf i had seemed the toilet had backfired as there was water all over bathroom floor and toilet. Again, another night, an alarm went off in hotel which continued for about an hour, seemed like a fire alarm, with a siren and then a message in a fe different languages, like attention, attention, please leave the building. So, overall we didn't get much sleep. We didn't want to complain at recpetion as the man in charge had been so helpful and this was not his fault. Also, despite this, we had a fantastic holiday. We took the view we were only in the room at night and not to let it ruin our experience but would definatly not reccomend this hotel for anyone else unless they were garunteed no to get the room with the view of the industrial yard!!</p></li>
