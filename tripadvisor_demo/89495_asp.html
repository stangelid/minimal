<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We really enjoyed our stay and being right on the ocean was awesome. Plus having an indoor and outdoor pool was great. The kids would leave the beach and go to the pool until they closed. Room service was excellent. Anytime we called and needed any thing they were right there. If I could say anything negative it would be the bathrooms are very small.</p></li>

The decor throughout the hotel is hideous; the carpets are wet and smelly, and the walls need a fresh coat of paint. Benefits from a beachside bar and restaurant but the outdoor pool is overcrowded to the max. The water was literally green due to the abundance of urine.</p></li>

The hotel is close to the beach; the staff had great recommendations on where to eat; the pool was nice; the seafood buffet was OK - we would not recommend it; the magic show was cheesy.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It is not a bad place to stay. It is not really an ocean view at all but you did see from room. Lots of things to do with kids or without. The room was clean when we arrived but not much after that. The tub started to back up, not enough towels or floor mat for tub. The only thing we did notice was the beds were made and trash out. For us it was missing the little details BUT was not a bad place to stay. I would stay again. Staff was nice.</p></li>

The staff was very accommodating (even letting us check out a bit later that the policy states so that with the dogs still in the room we could eat at a restaurant that didn't open up until eleven on check out day). Ordered room service late night Sunday into Monday and it was delicious and promptly served. Looking forward to returning there next Columbus Day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great hotel, located on a private beach and very family friendly. There is a heated indoor and outdoor pool, outside deck with live music, and it is very clean. We love this resort and have stayed here several times. There are no ocean front rooms though and balconies are standing-balconies but all of the rooms have a side ocean view. Great for the price, very quiet! Caution - water pressure and pillows in the rooms make you wish for home.</p></li>

The private beach was a HUGE PLUS, you are able to take drinks from their tiki bar out onto the beach with you and enjoy them there, unlike most of OC.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The trip was an overall success. I once again had a great time at the Clarion Resort Fontainbleau Hotel. My only disappointment was last year my room had a fold out couch. Fortunately this visit, two who were excpected to go, were not able to go, and we had more than enough room. I had reserved for six, which would have meant two in each bed. However, only four were able to travel this trip. I probably would have had to ask for another room if all in our party were there.</p></li>

All ocean view rooms with your own private beach(drink and food service on the beach as well. It is about 10 min away from the start of the board walk...

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Room was nice, great food and live music nightly was awesome. The food was so good, we did not even visit any of the outside restaurants after we arrived. The live band was also terrific, enjoyed sitting in the tropical like patio and listening to them. The only draw back was the small outdoor pool. We wondered if the next door hotel visitors were also using it. Also, saving chairs by placing a towel on it should not be allowed. Noted towels on lounge chairs for at least over 2 hours with no one using them. Thanks for a great time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel last year, but since I am just now figureing out how to post reviews I decided I should, because for this hotel it was great!. The rooms were nice and comfortable the staff was kind and understanding and the view was great. We woke up in the early morning looking out to see dolphins swimming not far off in the ocean. Amazing!!! The only flaw is the hotel is a bit of a drive from the main boardwalk/jolly rogers park area, but well worth the extra distance. I would definately stay here again and recommend it fully.</p></li>

We loved the buffet in the morning and really enjoyed the pool bar and outdoor deck in the afternoon. A big bonus was the waiter service to the beach! We were told this is one of the only hotels that offer this in OC! It was like being at an Island Resort but right here in MD! We even enjoyed a frozen drink while sitting in the sand- awesome!

The accommodations were clean, updated and comfortable. The pools were awesome for the kids! Only complaint was that the beaches were so crowded! But that's to be expected on the 4th of July holiday! We enjoyed the fact that everything was in the hotel. They have bars, a grill, a restaurant....everything to make it a true vacation. We didn't have to drive around unless we felt like it! We could just stay, hang out and enjoy the amenities.</p></li>

My only gripe this time was that we stayed on the same floor with the dogs. There wasn't a problem with the noise but I have a keen sense of smell and not sure if our room carpet was cleaned well enough seeing that we probably stayed in a room previously with a dog owner. Other than that, i would recommend this hotel; but to stay on a high level floor. The pool, restaurant, side-bar, and the convenience of the beach is awesome. I will most likely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We really enjoyed the location directly on the beach - an immediate hit with the kids. The new outdoor pool was an added plus even though it's pretty small. Loved the live afternoon band. The food at the outdoor grill was plentiful and tasty. Some drawbacks were the cramped parking area, tiny dog park, the unfriendly front desk staff, and the excessive room rate. The rooms (beds, furnishings, bathrooms) have not been updated in many, many years and it shows very well. Was appalled that they wanted to charge me to use the fitness center. We'd return only because we can bring our 4-legged family member.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Never having been to Ocean City I didn't know exactly what to expect, but was very happy. The hotel is right on the beach with easy beach access. Beach was clean and not overly crowded. Beach bar was great and very convenient. Pool was a bit small, but with the beach it was not a big problem. Hotel restaurant was a good value, especially for breakfast. Location on the north side of town was away from the boardwalk, but everything was a short drive away. Was a little concerned about the hotel being pet friendly since I don't particularly like dogs, but it was not a problem. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Parking was an issue on Saturday early evening due to customers for the lounge parking in the parking spaces at the hotel. Permits are given for hotel guests but not for guests of the lounge. Having to park across the street which was a six lane highway to have to cross on foot was very much an inconvenience to your hotel guest. Lounge customers should be the ones parking across the street as they didn't require parking permits at the hotel. If they (lounge customers) aren't required to have parking permits what was the purpose of having a parking permit in the first place for your hotel guests? The room was very clean and fresh!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 3 night in late August with a two adjoined rooms to fit out big family. The hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly. I was a bit disappointed that the rooms did not face the ocean but we did know that ahead of time. The beach was very nice and clean, food was delicious~we loved the happy hour specials. Drinks were very good as well! The kids loved the pool and swam in it from morning to night. The bands were pretty good that were played in the evening. Loved the location as well, w many different places to go to!! We also experienced our first earthquake while having lunch at Secrets! Would definitely come back again.</p></li>

We usually stay 2 weeks while in OCMD and we visit their seafood buffet at least 3 times while on vacation! You CANNOT beat the quality of their food. Is it more expensive? YES....but, I was taught, you only get what you pay for! We are heading back down in a few weeks and after we unpack......that is our FIRST stop......The wait staff is polite and attentive. The Lady who oversees the dining room is a DOLL...she inspects every chaffer dish that comes out of that kitchen for quality! You can't find people like that anymore!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Get past the fact that you are in Ocean City (and all of its glorious cheeziness), get past the outdated lobby, and the Clarion is not a bad place to spend a long weekend. Our room was large and much nicer than the exterior or lobby of the hotel hinted at. We had a little balcony with a view of the ocean, and a micro-fridge. The bathroom was tiny and outdated. We liked the fact that the property was located on the beach, and that it had a pool. The hotel is located a few miles from the OC Boardwalk, if this is an issue to you (it was not for us). I can't speak to the price, as we got a discounted conference rate. My husband, toddler son, and I had a nice stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The main reason for my family wanting to stay at this hotel was because they accomodated pets. However, we did not expect the hotel to smell like a kennel. Upon exiting the elevator on our floor, the hallway smelled like urine. When we entered our room, it also had a very bad odor. We had to have our room changed because the smell was so bad. We complained several times about the smell and someone would come and do something, but then the next day the smell would return. While on the elevator, when the doors opened we overheard another guest say, "this floor stinks". I think the hotel needs to have a stronger cleaning policy especially when you accomodate pets.</p></li>

However, finding a used bar of soap on the shelf in the shower made me wonder if the tub was cleaned before we checked into the room. In addition, the back of the bathroom door in our room could have used some Spray 409 cleaner because it was really dirty looking. The beds and linens were clean and fresh and the room temperature was easilly contolled. We slept very well and very comfortable.

Our check in was quickly accomplished. The room was more than adequate with a nice view of both the ocean and the bay. Bathroom was clean and stocked with the necessities. Bed was comfortable. We went to the sports bar in the afternoon for a quick drink where the bartender was friendly and quick. In the evening after the party we went up to the club where a live band was playing and sat at the bar there. The prices were a bit steep for our drinks but we were told that was because the band was playing. All in all there were no issues with our stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family has gone to the Clarion since way back when it was the Sheraton. Unfortunately it could use some renovation. The pool area really needs to be redone, it is in need of painting, new tables and chairs, and the pool water is always slimey (sand and lotion). I would never swim in it, although the kids dont seem to mind. They are also lacking enough seating at the pool area. On the upside the pool bar makes some slammin' banana daquiris. The rooms have been redone and they are nice. The prices are quite high and I think we will look for somewhere else next year with a nicer pool (kids love swimming), a balcony where you can actually sit outside, at a more reasonable price.</p></li>

We had a small wedding cake that we purchased and they took it back and decorated it with strawberries and whip cream. The waitress took pictures of us. We never asked them to do anything for us, they just took over. We rewarded them by coming back the next day. BTW -when in OC, try their food.

The balconies are tiny, however, and triangular shaped with standing room for two at best.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is not as bad as some of the very low end beach motels, but it's not the quality I would expect from the Clarion brand. The furnishings and bed linens are dated and worn. The hotel really needs to update the rooms. This is definitely not a resort hotel as the name implies. Oceanview is a sliver of cement that can hold 1 person and actually faces the side of the hotel next door. The fitness center was small & uncomfortable and had a wet, musty feel. The hotel is further away from attractions than some nicer properties. You can do much better in this price range. It does have nice meeting facilities if you are with a business group, but I would not want to attend the meeting if this was my choice for accommodations.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have been visiting the Fountainebleau for 3 years and we've watched it slowly go downhill. This year our room was not clean. We unfolded the sleeper sofa and the sheets were quite dirty with dead bugs etc in them. We called housekeeping and it seemed as though we were bothing them and they just dropped off the sheets and did not put them on for us. The worst part was the hallway on our floor. It smelled like a litterbox and the floor was COVERED in trash. We called numerous times to have the hallway cleaned and no one ever did. The outdoor pool is perfect for our kids and the great location to the beach is fantastic. The outdoor grill makes very good food, a little overpriced though. We are not sure if we'd go back for our 4th year in a row.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was here for two nights Sept 6 & 7, 2012. Everything was fairly nice. When I arrived in the room there was a small part of what appeared to be a cigar under the coffee table (non-smoking room). It was cleaned up by housekeeping on their regular daily cleaning. Additionally ... only... in the morning, each morning... there were small, writing pen plunger sized, dark bugs in the bathroom... only in the bathroom (from what I could tell). They were NOT bed bugs. they ran fast, but I killed 7 the first morning and 8 the second morning. I found none late morning or after; only early morning. They seemed to come from the dropped ceiling in the bathroom and from under the commode. Keep everything zipped up when you stay here. Would be a 4 star had there been no bugs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a returning guest of the past several years, We have to say we were a bit disappointed in our stay this time. We noted several small, but still notable, changes in service since our last viist. Although our room was cleaned everyday the soaps, shampoos, and shower caps were NEVER replenished during our 4 night stay. Upon waking on our first morning we found that we didn't have caffeinated coffee and I had to go out to the service personnel in the hall and ask for it. The food was still fantastic, but when we ordered our longtime favorite items the prortions were not as generous as in the past. The hallways were not as clean as in past stays. We still love the Clarion OC, but have to say that for the cost per night we may have to reconsider other accomodations in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Travelled with my family and small dog. Booked a non-smoking room, but on arrival was given a smoking rm. Front desk was very accomodating and placed us in another room, I almost wished she hadn't. She gave us a handicapped accessible room, that had a terrible stench. I had to purchase several plug-in air fresheners to make the stench less noticable. Someone had left food in the refrigerator, that housekeeping did not remove, plus the refrigerator was dirty. The area designated for pets was small, but much appreciated. The waste removal bags were a plus. The breakfast buffet was just ok, although the omelet prepared "made to order" was very delicious. The big plus was the hotel's location on the beach. Parking was tight, but manageable. I would try another hotel when travelling to Ocean CIty again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Clarion for a conference. While the conference rate was better than I could get online or with my AAA card, it was still very expensive for a mid week rate in off-season O.C. I knew it helped the organization to stay here or else I would have looked elsewhere. Due to the higher prices, I was surprised that the rooms were getting worn down. It's evident that the hotel takes a beating during the tourist season. On the positive side, the room was huge and included a table and a couch. Due to the direction of the tower, even though our room was closer to the street than beach, our small balcony had a nice view of the ocean. The bathroom was small but did have a shelf for toiletries so they wouldn't get wet from the sink. Overall, my stay was fine for the conference, but I'd look elsewhere for a vacation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There’s a lot to like about this hotel. It’s right on the beach and the pool is nice. We rarely dine at a hotel’s restaurant(s), as one can usually find better food at better prices at places that aren’t attached to a hotel. Had to make an exception here - the pub and the bar & grill had great food at reasonable prices. The live entertainment was actually pretty good. However, their main restaurant (Horizons) was prohibitively expensive for a family of 5. The room was also a little tight for a family with 3 younger teens, and getting 2 rooms is far too expensive in season. They don't have the option of slightly larger rooms/suites for larger families. So, smaller families might find the rooms more comfortable than we did. We’d consider going back, but not until one or more kids is grown and not coming along on vacation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently spent a 3 day weekend here, and are happy with our hotel choice. We loved the convenience to the beach, the food and drink service while on the beach, and the live music and bar on the deck. The room was fine. Maybe not spectacular, but nice enough. We didn't come here to spend a lot of time in the room anyway. The staff was courteous and attentive for the most part. Like many others, my major complaint with this hotel is the elevator service. It's absolutely awful, and can really be a source of frustration. Waiting 5+ minutes for an elevator only to have it arrive and be jam packed is ridiculous. We tried taking the stairs down once, only to be turned around by the "emergency exit only" signs on the door and a warning that an alarm will sound if the door is opened. Overall though, we had a good weekend staying here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The staff at the desk was quite rude. Our room key did not work correctly, even after being reprogramed several times. There are only three elevators and no service elevator, so not only does it take a long time to get an elevator, then half the time your sharing it with a laundry cart or dirty dishes. We were not informed that a hold would be put on our account for 30% more than our charges for "inncedentals" tying up money we could have used on our vacation. Housekeeping knocked on the door way too early each day, and then if we told them to come back in a little while, they would not come back until late in the afternoon. The basket of condiments for the coffee was not replenished, and when my husband went to get cream and sugar and the desk he was treated very poorly. I have never stayed in a more poorly operated hotel, we won't be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have not stayed here for nearly 15 years. Now with three children between 11yrs and 4 yrs old, we decided they needed to see the ocean. We arrived on saturday around noon and we were provided with a parking permit and told to enjoy full use of the facilities until our room was cleaned. They even cleaned the room 1.5 hours early. Extra pillows were no problem. Our room was at the end of the hallway nearest the ocean and was cleaned very early and was nice and quiet. I knew of the small balconies from previous stays, but with everything to do, this is not an issue. The indoor and outdoor pools were a blessing for the children, as hurricane bill made for a rough beach for the kids. They enjoyed the ocean, but it did wear them out. Thank you Clarion, we are already planning our stay for next year. I hope I can get the same room, as it was a perfect fit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Clarion this past weekend. I enjoyed the experience very much. Everything you need is right in the hotel or near the hotel. I mean you walk downstairs and you have your own private beach. Plus the staff serves you drinks right on the beach. I thought the serve was great. Also the buffet was very good too. After being out for the night, we headed back to the hotel and went to the bar and that was packed too. It was a lot of fun with people of all different ages. I plan on going back to this hotel sometime this summer. This time I will be bringing my pet because they allow animals there. I had a good experience at the Clarion and would recommend it to everyone. There was also always staff around ready to help out. I liked that a lot. I knew if I had an questions I could get them answered. The only thing I didn't like was the balcony. I thought it should of been a little bigger.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was the first time we ever brought our pet on vacation, We were expecting the worst but were VERY pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the room considering it was a pet room. The room and hotel were very clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. We ordered room service and maid service and they were there in an instant. The local band playing by the ouside bar surrounded by beautiful palm trees and flowers made you feel like you were in the carribbean. The bar service on the beach was a bonus! We also enjoyed our buffet breakfast and crab leg dinner buffet. For the price we thought the hotel was well worth the stay, even though we stayed just for the weekend in July, they still honored a AAA discount. Plenty of outside sitting so you can enjoy the beach view and a drink. Small area for the kids to play on a slide and an on-site clean area to walk your dog. I would definitely go back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The "Pet Freindly" floor is the 5th floor - we had a view of the ocean - but you really had to crane your neck.The room itself was nice but dark since the light is coming from the side The resturant had excellent food and had a discount that made it worth being there during the week. The staff was very friendly.he bartender was nice however: I don't think we would stay there again - while the elevator was quick - walking down a long hallway - getting on the elevator - then walking around to the north side of the building to the pet relief area was a bit of a hassle. Also be aware that the "pet form" you sign says that while they prefer you NOT leave your pet in the room - if you do - and your pet is "yappy" they will call you back to your room to deal with it - if it persists - you will be asked to leave. Our dog is quiet so that wasn't an issue - but if you KNOW your dog is barky - I wouldn't want the concern.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just got back from the Clarion for a Labor Day getaway. We were there 6 weeks ago for a family vacation. Again what a fantastic time we had. A big thank you to the staff from Lenny's Grill. You are always attentive and great to talk to. Chuck the manager always cheerfull. The pet room as always was nice and clean. The buffet was great. A big thank you to Donna in reservations for helping us out. To the people who have sent a review in about his hotel. The hotel site states "standing balcony". The balcony is standing, however the desk chair will fit on the balcony. The staff at the front desk is friendly and helpful. The buffet not only has crab legs and shrimp, but oysters and clams plus other seafood dishes. There is no false advertising about the outdoor pool. The fountain in the shallow end was removed for safety purposes. Added to the pool were lifts for the handicap. Looking forward to next years trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed at this hotel for a conference. I've been told they have the only conference rooms in the area. They did a nice job with catering and the meeting room was comfortable. They have a workout facility available, which is nice. There is a cardio room and also a weight room, accessible with your room key and open until 10PM. The location is nice - you can walk right out the back of the property onto the beach. The room was pretty clean, although dated. The air conditioning unit was pretty loud. They provide a small coffee maker and refrigerator, which is convenient, and there was a small table in the room so you could work when you needed to. There is a grocery store within a block or two, as well. They have a business center with two computers available for your use (also a plus). The front desk staff was friendly and helpful, and all other staff I interacted with were very pleasant. All in all it isn't a bad hotel, but it could use some updating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel fit the bill for what we were looking for - a clean reasonably appointed hotel wiht a location right on the beach for a reasonable price. The rooms were spacious and increadibly quiet - there was a baby in the room next to ours and we never heard him/her once inside of our room. The staff at the hotel was reasonably pleasant. Things that could be better at the hotel: they need a dedicated service elevator - the elevator situation was slow enough already without precious space being occupied by rolling bins of linens, food, trash, etc; they need more bell carts - its ridiculous that a hotel this size only has 3 carts available for guests (they keep a few aside for bell boys). Another negative is the balcony - there is barely enough room for 2 adults to stand on it at the same time so forget about sitting out there and enjoying the beach view (remember this is beach view not ocean front). Inspite of certain shortfalls, I would definitely consider staying here again next summer.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed with our dog at this hotel in 8/07. The front desk personnel were helpful and friendly. However, our room (for which we paid over $300) was filthy - there was dirt on the floor and old food in the microwave. There was also a strong stench of mold which emanated from the A/C unit. We called housekeeping twice and eventually the room was cleaned satisfactorily and the A/C unit was serviced by maintenance. The balcony was tiny and , since the rooms were on the side of the building, provided only a distant and limited view of the beach. The outside of the hotel was also filthy, with cigarette butts everywhere. The pet area did not have any poop bags. The problem was that the housekeeping staff largely consisted of college students from foreign countries who did not appear to be adequately trained and/or were not fluent in English! On a more positive note, the room service was good and the seafood buffet was very good and reasonably priced. The hotel definitely needs to be renovated. The room rates are excessive.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family stayed at the Clarion in Aug 2005. Arrived at hotel around 3:00PM, was told no rooms are ready, but was offered a room on the pet floor. We declined. Another front-desk person said that you just cannot check-in until 4:00PM. I was not told about the hard 4:00PM check-in policy when reservation was made. Room was adequate, 2 double beds with a pull-out sofa, decently decorated, everything worked. Had buffet dinner at Horizons restaurant one night and for a buffet, food was pretty good. Shortcomings; Basically no balcony, you could stand but not fit chairs, in fact there are no balcony chairs. Indoor pool only, not many chairs around the pool, and for the size of the hotel, pool is small. No sundeck either. Slow maid service. On one day maid came by at 3:45PM, told her to just forget it for today. On other days room was never attended to before 2:30. Parking was alittle tight on one side of the hotel. Used stairs to and from 11th floor on a few occasions as elevators were slow. Overall not sure if I would go back.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have a condo two doors down from the Clarion and we always go for the Friday night seafood buffet. We have been going to the Clarion for about 8 years and love the atmosphere. The staff are what you expect to find in a small southern town. They are friendly and very helpful. The buffet is sumptuous and we linger until the band starts at 9:00. This is the only place in town where you get live, calm, old school music that you can actually dance to. They have a good size dance floor and the tables are nicely spaced. The Sunday breakfast buffet is also very nice. The pool area is small but comfortable and they have an ocean-side bar and patio below. If you want to be near the boardwalk then this is not the hotel for you, but if you want a comfortable, old-school hotel on the beach, then this is the right place. Oh... there is also a strip mall and theaters across the street. I can't vouch for the rooms, but price of the food are reasonablefor a resort town, food is good, and the service is good..... what more could you ask for.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family had an unexpected trip to Ocean City Maryland. We stop into thish otel with the hopes of finding a room at the last minute. We choose this hotel because we hear many good things about the Clarion Brand. The room we stayed in had mold on the ceiling and Dog poop stains on the carpet. We didn't know the hotel allowed pets. We first figured that out because of the smell in the hall way. We called around to other hotels but could not find any open rooms. We were stuck. We had no choice but to stay in this dirty room. At check out I told the CS rep who checked us out. She wrote on a scrap piece of paper mold on ceiling, gross stains on carpet. That left my family with the impression that our complaint was only good enough for a scrap piece of paper. We were very diappointment. We will never stay at a clarion. We plan on telling friends and family about our experience. We only stayed one night and moved onto the Dunes Manor Hotel. Which was great. Don't remember the room number, Tried to forget as much about this hotel as possible, We were on the third floor.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From check in to check out it was such a pleasurable experience. The staff was amazing and friendly. While waiting to check in we decided to scope the outside bar out and we meet Joe the bartender. He was fun and was informative of where to go and where not to go. It was nice considering me and my friends were newbie’s to the city of Ocean City. After check in we headed to our room, which was CLEAN and SPACIOUS for us 4 girls. Although the only downer was the size of the balcony. No space to just sit and take in the sounds and sights of the beach. Housekeeping was fast and courteous to our needs when we called. It was nice to just sit around and hang at the hotel. Food was good, it met our hunger needs. Beach and pools were clean and was pretty awesome that the staff would bring us drinks :) We loved that! Overall I highly recommend this resort to ANY groups coming to ocean city. It was family, friends and pet friendly. I will definitely be back with more friends!! Thanks for such a great experience. Keep up the fantastic work and keep hiring those friendly folks!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just spent Friday-Sunday at the Clarion and had a wonderful time. We got a great deal on expedia which set things off right. We arrived early expecting to have to kill time before check in but our room was ready to go at 1:30 p.m. The room was clean and well appointed and the ac was turned down so it was nice and cold when we arrived. We had a great time at the beach bar on friday night (Lenny's) getting lunch served to us on the beach, and enjoying the quick room service. The front desk staff was very helpful and our stay was great, we will stay again. Drawbacks - the elevators were a little slow but nothing dramatic, on our way out we had 3 pass us before we decided to get on and go up then down or it might have taken longer. The pools were crowded with kids, but of course they would be. The vending machines were on every other floor and not accepting dollars so my husband went to 2 floors before heading to the front desk for change. As to others concerns with the dogs, we had no problems, heard no dogs and smelled no dogs. Thanks for a great weekend!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">To be honest this was the worst experience ever, without even getting to enjoy my stay I arrived on the forth @ midnight although knowing in hotel language that ment the midnight of the third, I had previously called to confirm my check in with the desk that afternoon and stated that I would be arriving very early from a long and stressfull meeting and would there be a early check in fee. I was told there would be no problem to come anyway. When I arrived @ the front desk I was excited to spend some quality time with my partner only to find out my room was not going to be ready untill 3 pm. When I asked if I could get a room untill my own was ready the hotel wanted to charge me an extra 30 dollars than what I had paid previously over hotwaire and would not match it. I was treated very poorly by the staff and by some woman wearing a shroud of dead animals on her back claiming to be the owner of the hotel. I was so aggrivated by the service I just decided to get back into my car and go home. This hotel will never get serivce EVER from my company or myself, friends or family.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “An Above-Average Hotel in Ocean City on the Beach”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel offers many ammenities that qualifies for as a resort hotel. It is a mid-scale hotel and seems to deliver at that level. The location on the beach is very convenient. The hotel also offers two pools, outdoor bar and grill, and indoor restraurants. The staff were always helpful and friendly (a rarity for the mid-Atlantic). I thought the house keeping staff also did their job well and seemed pleasant. It seemed to me that there was good management and happy staff. This translated into a good stay. As far as areas that would be "nice to haves" in improvement: I think the rooms could be updated. It is probably time for an update although I point out that everything was clean and in working order. I thought the beach grill was a bit expensive for the quanity/quality, but I do realize the convenience price. Location--not much within a 2-3 blocks north or south that would be convenient to run out. You are car dependent to access the rest of OC. Overall, I think it was a good mid-scale hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for the mid-scale price and services resort.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “pet-friendly, nice staff, but rooms were dirty and mattress awful”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went down to OC for the last week in April with our dog. The good: the location..right on the beach, the staff was friendly, and they allow pets. The bad: our room was old, dingy, and pretty much everything was stained. The carpet had brown stains all over it as did the sofa and the two upholstered chairs. Yuck. I was afraid to sit. The bathroom had some stains, too, and in obvious need of some upkeep. The mattress was terrible. It was extremely saggy and slipped around the bed. We didn't even bother to open up the sofa bed. Also, the hotel advertises a workout room---it costs something like $4 a day and was pretty lame. Finally, this came in at over $130 for one night (with my AAA discount) in April. Definitely not worth the price. FYI, our pet-friendly room was on the 5th floor. Overall, the hotel itself is nice, liked the indoor pool, loved the location. BUT the pet-friendly room was disgusting and uncomfortable. We'd planned to stay for two nights, but cut it back to one. Would think long and hard about coming again and the only reason I'd consider it is because it is one of the few places that accepts pets.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have already recommended this hotel to several of my friends and aquaintences. The staff at the hotel were exceptional. When I first arrived for our little holiday getaway, we were not real happy with the room. It was overlooking the roof and parking lot and you really couldn't see much of the ocean. It was very disappointing to my wife and I thought we were in for a very long weekend. My wife went to the front desk and asked about changing rooms for a better view and the manager said that it would be no problem. She showed my wife a new room, room 509 and it was 100 times better then what we were just in. The manager asked sincerely if the room would be okay and we, in unison, said a very satisfied "yes!". The stay only got better, we had our small puppies with us and they loved the dog park, it was easy access to the beach and the restaurant staff as well as the wonderful Christmas Buffet made this trip a new traditional place to go. I want to thank all of your staff and cooks, tremendous! My wife weighs just over a hundred pounds but because of the great food, ate more than I have ever seen her eat. Bravo and we will see you next year!!!!!!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Seventh Year and Counting.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed at the Clarion for the last seven years ( since discovering OC ). We wouldn't want to stay anywhere else. The rooms are functional and just what we need.They have a small refrigerator and microwave. Wish the balcony was bigger. After looking at some of the other reviews, I agree that some of the prices are a bit high but it is a very nice place to stay. The breakfast buffet is great but the weekend price is a bit much. The breakfast chef, Geoff Houck, does a very nice job. We stay one week a year and believe it or not he remembers what I like to order. This year he even started making it before I went up to place the order ( this was on our first morning there ). The staff is very nice and helpful. It's nice to be able to go to the beach then go up to the pool and have lunch from Lenny's brought to you. This was the first year I caught a little attitude from one of the staff at Lenny's. Please keep in mind that they work twelve hour days and six or seven days a week during the season. It's hard to be "up beat" all of the time. Still, the first time in seven years isn't bad. We do recommend the place and we are planning to stay there next year.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading many reviews about this hotel, I decided to see for myself. First, the staff was extremely friendly, polite and attentive. The dining experience for dinner is terrific. The wine menu easily one of the best on the east coast. I try not to compare one hotel to another, give that a beach location would not be comparable to say - Las Vegas. This being said, the hotel itself showed significant signs of wear and tear relative to its years. Ceiling spots, cracked tile, ventilation were not what I would say well maintained. These are things that can be fixed if one were to put the effort in. Beach view is at an angle, vice a straight oceanfront as in VA Beach. Noise is a major factor here. Both nights sleep was interrupted repeatedly and for long periods due to neighboring vacationers acting as if it's their own home. Slamming doors, screams and general talking/breathing/rattling/banging are very easily heard (and rather interesting for an eight year old). I would suggest that families be given a floor that is away from the boisterous clientele on spring break. Then everyone will be happy and less enlightened. Yes, the front desk was notified. Action taken - not that I was aware of.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Was a little hesitant after reading some not so good reviews, but was able to get an EXCELLENT rate thru Expedia and we took a chance. Loved it. No wait for the elevators, clean room, comfortable bed, coffee, paper and all the little amenities. Yes, it's a distance from the boardwalk, but we knew that in advance and the private beach more than made up for that. You could DRINK on the beach or stroll up to the bar which was right there. Even the bands weren't bad. The place wasn't over run with animals or kids, but at a few points I DID feel like I was in the movie "Cocoon". But I'd much rather watch some classy elderly people have a good time, than put up with a bunch of loud college students anyway. If you're in the mood for raucous (and who isn't occasionally), the bus stop for the drunk bus is right out front. The balcony IS small, but you can see the bay and the ocean just fine from there or even from inside the room. We've stayed at the Carousel before, but I thought it was way overpriced. We paid so much more for a room there where our view was of nothing but an air conditioning unit. I loved the Clarion and my bf agreed it's the best place we've stayed yet in the 10 yrs we've been going down to OC. It wasn't perfection, but it was more than adequate and very nice and we'll be back next year.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Wine and Cheese Basket?”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hello, As usual your hotel, entertainment, and general atmosphere is perfect. I love visiting your hotel throughout the year. My husband and I truly enjoy getting away from the regular routine of the daily grind to go eat, have a drink, and dance. Your place is just wonderful. I am only disappointed in the "Wine and Cheese Basket" that you offer for your guests. One of the first times I came to your hotel, years ago, I had the Wine and Cheese Basket ordered for my room. It was already in the room waiting for us, filled with a variety of crackers, and individually packaged cheese singles. It also came with two small bottles of wine and glasses. It was definately worthy of the classic Wine and Cheese Basket title. This last time I ordered the Wine and Cheese Basket and was extremely disappointed. The wine was the only thing that was good. All the crackers looked like they came out of a vending machine, peanuts too. If I had known that the basket had changed from the orginial I would never have paid for the basket. Such a high price to pay for vending machine crackers. However, I really love coming to your hotel.... really do. This will not interfere with me enjoying many, many more evenings at your Clarion. I will just never order the Wine and Cheese Basket again. Thank you for listening. Christy Ransom</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Vacation At The Beach”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Clarion Resort Fontainebleau quite my accident for a spur of the moment trip to Ocean City, MD. At first I was a little disappointed that this was where we ended up as every other hotel was sold out or astronomically priced. It turned out that we really had a nice time there and glad we were away from the southend where the boardwalk is. At first when we arrived at the hotel we thought it could have been cleaner, but after experiencing being chased off the beach due to a major thunderstorm I realized that there is no way to control the amount of sand that is dragged into the hotel. The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable and the staff really nice. We were on the ninth floor and had views of both the bay and ocean, which was great, even during a thunderstorm. The balcony was tiny, but that was better than nothing. The hotel has an outdoor “tiki” bar and around 4pm each day there was a band playing music. This was really fun and if we didn’t want to stay we just went to our room and opened the door to hear the music. We also had lunch on the beach from one of their restaurants Lenny’s Beach Bar and Grille. It was probably one of the best crab cake sandwiches I have had in a long time. We had a great time in Ocean City and would definitely return to the Clarion Resort.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I went on a drive to OC for the day. We ended up staying the weekend mostly because of this hotel. SO CLEAN! The fresh paint smell (not a very heavy smell) was an indication of new renovations. Our room was on the 15th floor with a BEAUTIFUL view of the bay and the ocean. The front desk ladies were so helpful on where to shop and what was open! We took advantage of all of their amenities also. We went swimming in the heated indoor pool, which by the way has a bar along side. We worked out, we went to the jacuzzi and eucalyptus spa many times. We had to go nowhere. Everything we needed was at our finger tips. The dinner buffet was EXCELLENT! It was all you can eat seafood and prime rib...YUM! The entertainment was OK...we think they were a new band just getting started......BUT, what we thought was the most special of all were the small bottles of lotion, shampoo and conditioner...YES it seems trivial BUT for us it was wonderful because this being an impromptu vacation we hardly had anything packed and it was nice to see at least this hotel didn't try to cut corners and not have these items available and they didn't charge us extra like so many hotels are doing now....Oh and one more thing the bed was soft and soooo comfortable...just what we needed after the long drive we had. ONCE AGAIN...THANKS CLARION!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our first trip to Ocean City and were a little disappointed with our hotel. We booked through Priceline so we got a great price of $159 per night for a Monday - Wednesday and I am glad that we got that rate because the hotel wasn't worth much more. We checked in and got our room, the first room, because it wasn't cleaned. They checked us into a room that wasn't serviced. Instead of having room service come up and clean it while we watched, just uncomfortable for everyone, we switched rooms. Our first room although not clean had a view of the ocean and a couch and a flat screen TV. Our second room, which appeared clean, didn't have a couch,had a squat 1980's television, and a view of a roof. We did find cherry stems all over the floor, in one of the beds, and a plastic cup stuffed between the bed and the night stand. It was pretty gross. The 3 elevators were always packed with people. The indoor pool was swarming with kids. The stairs to the beach were steep and I thought a little dangerous. They definitely weren't good for the older guests. The spa and gym were surprisingly packed with equipment and clean though. The entertainment and bar staff seemed nice enough as well as the kids that ran drinks and food to the pool and beach. The hotel is conveniently located though and there was plenty of parking. Bring your own beach towels! You have to take the ones from the pool area and they are not great. The hotel needs a makeover, it appears dingy, dirty, and unkept. I won't be returning to this hotel in the future.</p></li>

Our room was ready even though we arrived over an hour before check-in starts. The lobby is small but attractive and the staff efficient. We were really thrilled to find a 10th floor room with both Bay and ocean views from the sofa in the room and the tiny balcony off our room. The weather was sunny and very warm, so we did enjoy the balcony a bit. The very clean room had two doubles a sofabed , a microwave, fridge with freezer. The beds had an under pad that kept bunching up and unfortunately gave us trouble sleeping. I would recommend the management try to fix that with a fitted under pad. The hair drier was great in the bathroom as was the sunlamp for after shower warmth. There is a tub and shower and plenty of nice fresh towels to use. Housekeeping did a fine job and maintenance came immediately to open our locked safe and fix the key entry to our door when asked. There are two restaurants in the hotel that look fine but we ate all of our meals out this time. The pub menu seemed well priced and we would not hesitate to try it next time. The best thing about our stay, however, was the heated indoor pool which we used for hours both days. We were also given free entry to the spa facilities which are unbelievable: Loads of exercise equipment; a great steam room; a sauna; eucalyptus room, and huge clean powerful and HOT hot tub!! We enjoyed it all and look forward to returning.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were a little skeptical about visiting Ocean City for the first time with all three of our kids. I had never stayed in a Clarion before either. We very pleasantly surprised when we first arrived at the hotel. The parking was ample, the lobby was just beautiful and each an every time we passed an employee, we were greeted with a smile and greeting. I was very impressed. The pools were kept very clean with a generous supply of clean pool towels. Lenny's restaurant on the beach was great. Typical bar food, but with awesome service and great for lunch when you can't get the kids out of the pool or off the beach. The "All you can eat" dinner was, well, blah, and pricey, so unless you can eat a lot, I would not recommend it. The rooms were spotless although the bath tubs could use a little updating. And if you needed any service, they were extremely fast and willing to help you. The beach was SPOTLESS! And it was private, so that made it a little nicer. Some things to remember...bring beach towels; they don't allow pool towels to be brought to the beach. Bring a beach chair. Rentals are available and were very reasonable at $5.00 per day or $20 for a week. They also rent umbrellas. The beach bar and grill will deliver your food or drinks to your spot on the beach as well!! They offered free body-boarding lessons for people of all ages! There were some activities for the little kids as well. The magic show was free and we were very impressed! All in all, we had a wonderful time and are seriously considering this tto become an annual trip for our family!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very Good Hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 5 days at the Clarion after Hurricane Irene passed with wife and 2 teenage children. Also stayed here in 2005, and at that time thought the hotel was just average. After this recent stay our opinion of the Clarion is extremely favorable. Upon check-in front desk staff was much more friendly. Housekeeping service was improved. I was asked on 2 occasions if enough towels were in our room and the room was attended to by 12:00PM each day. Common areas such as hallways, pools, fitness center and spa seemed cleaner. On a few occasions, I saw employees polishing the luggage carts. Our room was on the 15th floor and had 2 beds along with a pull-out sofa bed. Rooms are not fancy but still decently decorated and well maintained. A coffee maker, microwave, refrigerator, and hair dryer are included. Next time I will ask if larger rooms or suites are available. Room is adequate size but we could have used some extra space now that my children are both teenagers. Equipment in fitness center worked and all machines seemed in good condition. A fairly large sauna and steam room is included along with showers and towels. Having the outdoor pool now is a plus. Had dinner 2 evenings in Breakers Pub and food was good and reasonably priced. Buffet breakfast in Horizons Restaurant was thoroughly enjoyed. This is the type of hotel that you can basically park your car, check-in, and not move your car until checking out. The Clarion is located by 101st street so it is not near the boardwalk, but we like the less crowded location. I live in central NJ, near beaches, but enjoy Ocean City, MD very much, and the Clarion will now be our only choice when we visit.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Our 4th year at the Clarion!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Still our "home away from home" and still love the place! People are so friendly, and even remember you! I find that pretty special since they see THOUSANDS of people coming and going! "LILA" or "LYLA" remembers us from THREE years ago, and has the sweetest and friendliest demeanor of anyone at the Clarion, though, like I said, ALL were helpful and friendly as usual! They FINALLY got 37" flat screen tvs, too! Not that we sit and watch tv, but with two kids, it's just nice to have a tv like that for those rainy days! Still very clean, room smelled good, and we were on the PET FLOOR (we bring our family cat)! Seemed like newer curtains too. Love the beds, and the down-alternative comforters...and all the pillows! There are TWO types! One with REAL down, and the others with an alternative. Pretty cool. My ONLY "complaint" this year, I guess, would be that our phones were broken, and while they DID get them somewhat repaired in a short amount of time...they still didn't work correctly the entire stay. No big deal really! I asked if they could give us ANY sort of tiny "compensation" for that inconvenience, and they said they'd talk to the mgr....but when check-out came, there was no discount or anything to help "make up" for the phone issues. Oh well. I just felt that even a couple free DRINK vouchers would suffice, but nada! Room should have a working phone, so maybe they'll consider compensating people in however small a way, in the near future? STILL LOVE YOU CLARION, OC! We'll be back next year and hopefully longer, too! I highly recommend this place, as I did for the past four years. Hope they never go "downhill" and keep up the great work and friendly staff! Thank you! Justin</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not very satisfied with the experience as a whole and would probably opt to stay at another hotel. We've been going to OC for many years and have stayed at other hotels before. Trying to broaden our horizons did not pay off this time. We were surprised to find no in-house movies to select from, which for our family is usually a way to wind down after a long day of activities. Parking near the hotel was limited, causing us to have to park across the street on several occasions and play "Frogger" back to the hotel. We tried a Horizons Breakfast (after all they are "famous" for it) and were completely disgusted. They had two omelet lines but only one chef cooking for everyone. The line was about 20-25 minutes long before you could get an omelet or a waffle. Usually you can make your own at other hotels. When told they should open up the second line, the Chef stated there was another Chef but he didn't know where he was.?? No manager?? We left our room at 8:00 am one day, came back at 3:00 pm and found our room had not been attended to yet. Naturally after being there to shower for 5 minutes, houskeeping knocked on our day. The evening front desk personell show no professionalism and act like they are either tired of the vacation period or have had no training in hotel management. For the mney, I think there is better value somewhere else. Water pressure was so low the shower head couldn't be used fully on any options. The beds were small and the mattresses were hard. We did like the large in-room safe. The hotel is even built facing the wrong way. It's as if they had a small piece of property to fit the hotel on and placed it sideways. The elevators took a very long time. It was nice walking out the back of the hotel to the beach.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here in October 2007 on a golf trip. We had a tremendously good experience. Twelve men, all coming from different directions and checking in at different times, and we were happy. In fact, we're returning next year. Prior to coming here I read the reviews on this site and some of them caused some concern. However it didn't stop me from coming because all our plans were made. My experience was very good. We ended up staying at the hotel each evening rather than go elsewhere to eat. Their restaurant, sports bar and buffet was more than I expected and met all our requirements for quality and taste of food as well as atmosphere for hosting a dozen golfers on a trip. Check in was normal except for the small confusions that one would expect with twelve different guys checking in at different times and looking for their roomie. Rooms were clean and comfortable and the employees were excellent. Parking right in front of the hotel is sparse for the size of the hotel but there is plenty right across the street. This wasn't a problem for us when we were there as the summer season was past and we didn't have any bumper to bumper traffic to navigate if we missed a slot right in front. One of our guys arrived from the south pulling a boat and he had no problems with space for it across the street. The animals were not a problem and weren't a factor in our stay even though we saw many of them. This is because they were on other floors and all the owners seemed to be sensitive to other people and handled the dogs accordingly. I concluded that the concerns that were raised on this site by others were fostered by the summer season when Ocean City is innundated with people. Then I believe it's more of a problem meeting everyone's expectations.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When we were looking for a hotel to stay in Ocean City for this summer we typically turn to Choice Hotels. We found this hotel's price at $199 a night for midweek during the month of July. This a very good price. It was nonrefundable, however. Some of the other reviews I have read mention a problem with finding a spot to park but I did not find this to be a problem. They have a lot in front of the hotel as well as another lot across Coastal Highway. The check in process was very smooth. We were able to check in three hours early which is a good bonus. Every room in the hotel is on the side so you have to turn your head to see the ocean. The room had a small balcony (as advertised) that is for standing only. The room was well furnished with two double beds and a sofa with a pullout bed. The room was very well cleaned and it seemed like the carpet had been recently replaced. Our toilet was quite loud and leaked sometimes. The shower was your typical hotel shower with tub. A complaint of mine with the design of the hotel is the number of elevators at the hotel. For a 16 floor building they only have three elevators. I've stayed at other hotels before in OC and some feature four elevators plus another elevator for service only. On the terrace level (second floor) there is a restaurant and bar which i did not visit. There is a pool inside and outside with a bar located near each. The outdoor pool features poolside food delivery. My one complaint is that the back steps on the hotel that lead to the beach are old wooden steps and I on a couple occasions and I almost fell on them because of their poor design. The staff at this hotel is outstanding. Every time you went past the bellman at the door he greeted you and sometimes had a conversation with you. The housekeeping and front desk staff were also friendly. Overall, I do want to stay in this hotel again.</p></li>
