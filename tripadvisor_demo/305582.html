<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Rooms were very nice, staff was extra friendly and helpful. The hotel is situated in the epicenter of gay Barcelona but you don't feel anything as extreme as West Hollywood around Santa Monica & Robertson at all. I could recommend the Axel to gay men but definitely not to a family. We'd go back for sure.</p></li>

The staff were helpful, friendly and very attractive as well. A nice rooftop pool, jaccuzzi, sauna and steam room and gym as well as a bar. Walking distance to everything you could want. Nightlife, metro, Ramblas. I wouldn't stay anywhere else when I return to Barcelona.</p></li>

It was not the weather for the roof jacuzzi and pool but this hotel has the best location for the gay traveller to explore and shop!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location within the Gay district of Barcelono makes the Axel a good choice. From the facilities to staff you won't be disappointed. Very clean and the staff are a credit to the establishment, offering sound advice on good eateries and places to visit. The WiFi could do with upgrading, very slow in the room, there are 2 terminals available on the 1st floor for those all important online flight check-ins though!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After the renovation/expansion works hotel got bigger, staff is still efficient, 4 elevators still working, the only thing i hated was a tiny and narrow swimming pool on the roof terrace. The terrace (sun deck) itself is nice, plus there are two bars there (open to public every evening of a weekend). They were continuing some minor improvement works - so it was noisy sometimes. Definitely worth 110 EUR/nigh, but not 170 :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed there for 3 nights. The hotel is in a nice quiet area near all the gay bars and clubs. The hotel was extremely expensive for what you go, over €200 per night. Reception were indifferent to us as guests, we did not enjoy the interaction with Staff. Also breakfast was very expensive at €30 for 2. They also charge for WiFi access @ €7 per day. You could do a LOT better for what we payed for e.g. Hotel 1898. We would not stay there again.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Service was lovely, decor very gay, contemporary and chic. No free wireless internet and no bahtub, which i desperately needed after several days of unjust abuse at the hands of the spanish authorities. Staff at lounge bar was very friendly. Despite the nightclub style athmosphere at the ground level, the room was very quiet. Location is ideal. Rooms on the smaller side. Price is well worthit but when i wanted to rebook for August, their rates were exorbitant and we decided against it. Overall i loved it.</p></li>

Every visit I use the spa and get a "Back to Serenity" treatment, just the thing you need! Also great gym facility. You don't have to leave the hotel because it offers everything you need. Location is perfect, everything is closeby, very central in Barcelona. The total atmosphere is friendly and inspiring. I advise everyone to stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Well located hotel and easy to get to on bus from Airport with short walk up Aribau from Universitat. Easy walk to the Arena clubs. Gym was fine and breakfast good. However room was a bit "over funky" - steps down to bed and open wire racks for clothes. Was surprised that we were not offered any info on gay venues or gay map of Barcelona on arrival (we found these ourselves at a cafe). When we asked the staff what movies were showing in English that week, they were stumped, even when I suggested a couple of websites for them to check for me. May be it is better in summer as we were there early January.</p></li>

Staff where helpful though they are busy, it is a popular hotel, but having said that they run very efficiently for a large busy hotel. The day staff are more friendly and helpful than the night staff. The rooms were clean and well equipped, the bathrooms clean and well stocked, nice towels. The hotel is centrally located. The roof top bar and pool excellent. The drinks a bit pricey but when on holiday in such a great place OK to splurge. I sued the gym and pool and spa, all we good. I would go back again an recommend this hotel.</p></li>

A little far away from Barcelonneta beach, by walk, subway is better for this place. The hotel is clean, friendly, and quiet. The roof top is very good, but too small, because it success. The rooms are nice, large, and lightening. The staff is particulary friendly, particulary the receptionist called Ricardo. Only one bad points: the dressing in the room are not really esthetical ( open dressing, clothes are on view) and functionnal. The clim is too cold.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Axel Hotel The rooms are very basic as we expected but we were a little surprised at the finish most obviously in the bathroom with chunks of grouting missing and dirty tiles. There is a nice pool deck on the roof with a bar serving drinks and light snacks which is very handy if you don't fancy visiting the beach. The breakfast was good and the staff helpful and efficient. Very mixed selection of guests certainly evidence of their 'heterofriendly' tag line. Wireless in the public areas but in the rooms was next to useless - something that definitely needs fixing! Nice hotel in a good location but I think I would opt for an upgraded room if I were to stay again.</p></li>

It is near the gay bars and has a good coffee shop across the street. The staff is amazingly pleasant and helpful. The rooms are comfortable and modern. There is free bottled water on every floor that was always stocked. The bar downstairs is good for a drink while waiting or a night cap. We didn't try the restaurant, but it looked ok. The rooftop pool and hot tub are small, but a perfect place to relax. The rooftop bar was closed for the summer. Great hotel for the value, would definitely go back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staff was mostly friendly/ welcoming. Decor was probably cutting edge when the place first opened over 10 years ago, but now beginning to look a bit dated (the "golden" wallpaper?), even tacky (the picture of the shirtless men on the room safe?), or cheap (banal Ikea-type desks)... But the most surprising -and frustrating- was that the WiFi connection was completely unreliable, and when it did work it was painfully slow. And I happened to be in one of the rooms closest to where the signal was supposed to be coming from! Elevators were also not coordinated and very slow. In 2012, in a major city, and in a somewhat upscale (i.e. not cheap) hotel --come on!! Get your act together, tios.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 5 days days at the Axel Barcelona hotel. We found out very quickly a few things: First, the location is absolutly great, near Gracia and Rambla and in the heart of the gay area. Second, 3 of the 5 days we spent there were drilling and banging noise just above our heads. Third, the staff wasn't always pleasent, especially after we got angry about the answers we recieve after complaining about the noise. Fourth, in 4 of the 5 days staying there, there were towels missing in the room, from no towels to only one large one. This in no service for the money taken for staying in the hotel. BTW, breakfast is far too much expensive. Better eat on your own in the cute small caffe around.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was really really impressed with our stay in the Axel. The rooms and public area's have a real WOW factor and clearly alot of thaught went into the planning of the hotel. The staff were all really friendly and willing to advise on where the good clubs ect were and what times they got busey at. The hotel has an Axel card that gets you into some places for free which was a bonus. We got the room at a very good rate. There was a Halloween Party on in the main bar the night we stayed which was good fun. It did suprise me how many non-gay guests there were. When I visit BCN again I would defo stay at the Axel again And if I was in BA or Berlin I would also be happy to stay at Axel in those cities too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for four nights because the hotel is in a good location and I was promised that this stay I would have a room at the front instead of the back. Upon check in, it was agreed that I would have a room at the front but I was offered to upgrade for 20€ per night which I did. However, the room was more or less identical to the room I had before. Not only this, but it does not have tea/coffee making facilities and the wireless internet connection is hit or miss. My room was not made up on the last night and the shower smelt damp. Lastly, nobody told me that the room isn't very well soundproofed and you can hear traffic all day and night. I feel ripped off and I will not be staying here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked the Axel Hotel via Expedia at the last minute and got a great deal at about $100 per night for a single room. When I arrived at the hotel the front desk staff was so nice and upgrade me to a deluxe double with the outside view of the city. I was surprised at how modern the decor was since the building looked old from the outside. The room was comfortable. The only complaint is for the closet which is a set of metal shelves open to the room so you can't hide any of your personal stuff from view. The great thing is free bottle water from the fridge in the hallway. I wish all hotels do this. The pool and spa area on the roof was nice. However they should have people to keep it tidy at all hours.</p></li>

It's about 15 mins walk to La Rambla. It was exceptionally clean and staff were pleasant. We had a flght issue but couldn't stay a further to nights at this hotel which we were really disapppointed about however staff were really helpful allowing us to stay on longer than necessary to use teir wi-fi and obtained prices of other hotels around them. Breakfast was more than adequate - the fruit amazing and the bar qute lively at the weekend. The fact that it is advertised as a gay hotel really didn't make any difference to us and wasn't in your face when you were there. Would totally recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great value, cool-hip-room- big shower -cool amenities-loved the view. Early check in wasn't a problem. Service was really good. I witnessed the front desk guy Wim speak Spanish, French, English and German to 4 consecutive guests in line. Really helpful on recommendations, directions. Best piece of advice in navigating around the area is Barcelona is on a hill. I just remember to "walk up" when I got lost. The hours of their restaurant- and many businesses in Spain for that matter was kind of confusing. Some closed during Siesta, some opened late- some never opened. Oh- the Fitness Center was fantastic- it was a real He Man Gym- not some tired old treadmill in the corner. and get this..it was open to MIDNIGHT!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I booked the Axel thinking it would be fun to stay in a stylish gay hotel. To be fair - it is. The place looks good, it's clean, modern and the room size fine for Barcelona. The problem is the atmosphere. It's like a party to which you haven't been invited. We headed up to the roof-top pool area for early evening cocktails and there was a gaggle of local boys prancing around. I suspect they are brought in with free drinks to provide some 'eye-candy' but the result is, well, a little but queeny with lots of people who seem to know one another dominating the small space. Some may think, 'sounds great' and I respect that. Really, we both questioned our sense: why go to an exclusively gay hotel - it's Barcelona!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at Hotel Axel in November. We stayed in two other hotels in Barcelona, and this was by far our favorite. Staff was very helpful in pointing out attractions and also recommending great restaurants in the neighborhood. Gym is small, but has everything you'd need. Library has free Internet access. The restaurant in Hotel Axel was excellent. We dined there our last evening in Spain and were shocked at the culinary delights. Try it for more than breakfast. We did not feel out of place as heterosexuals in a "gay" hotel. Patrons were nice, staff was helpful, and the location is convenient. The rooftop bar and pool were off season when we were there, but I bet it's a fantastic time. Enjoy this modern hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I did a lot of searching around online to find a place to stay for a few days while we were in Barcelona. The hotel is adorable. The person at the front desk was super helpful, very nice, The rooms are a good size, much bigger than what I generally expect when I'm in Europe. The location is great, super close to everything, we pretty much walked around the city from the hotel. We had breakfast included in our room rate which was helpful. Typical hotel breakfast, bacon, toast, fruit, coffee, all really good. The one thing I did that I normally don't do is I bought one of the packages for tours in the city. We had both a bus ticket on one of the tour buses and a discount museum pass. This saved us a ton of money. Highly recommend.</p></li>

THe nice thing about the hotel was it was gay oriented. They did have internet in the room for a fee, but there are 2 computers on floor 1, that you can use, without a charge. I highly recommend this, as it is only a few blocks from the Metro Universtatd (spelling). the metro can get you to anywhere in the city and to the sites.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at Axel Hotel several times and find it to be such a great place to stay in Barcelona. The location is close to gay bars and clubs, although it is also within walking distance to shops and places of interest. The hotel is always clean and comfortable, the rooms are very tastefully decorated. Restaurant on the premises is first class, for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The rooftop pool and bar is a good place to socialise with fellow guests. Perhaps one of the best features of the Axel are the staff who are always so helpful in dealing with any queries or advising places to visit. Overall I rate this hotel very highly and would have no hesitation in recommending to friends or relatives. I look forward to staying there again in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 7 nights from the 6th to 12th September. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. The room we had faced the inside corridor and while there was no view we did have a very quiet room allowing us to sleep peacefully every night. The rooms are tastefully decorated although the modern touches sometimes lacked practicality. For instance, nowhere to put your soap and shampoo in the shower, the telephone located under the headboard and easy to knock over in your sleep, a very small bar of soap to be shared. But these are minor annoyances. The roof top bar and lounge area was wonderful. After a long day of visiting the city it was great to come back and enjoy and drink and soak up the roof top view. We would go back to the Axel in a hearbeat!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Axel is very nice hotel and is centrally located near the heart of Barcelona. La Ramblas (shopping and tourist district) is within walking distance and the subway/metro is two blocks away. It's a gay hotel that advertises as "heterofriendly." The staff were friendly and attentive. Rooms are spacious and the decor leans toward modern and sleek. Downside is that the hotel is quite expensive. Though, if you book during a sale or off season, it's easier on the wallet. The hotel is near most of the gay bars/clubs. Most of the visitors are on the roof deck pool/bar. The drinks are terribly expensive at the pool! 13 euro for a mojito (you can drink for 3.50 euro down the block). I would recommend the hotel and stay there again. I stayed for five nights.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Let me start by saying that we had a very plesant stay at the Axel Barcelona. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful and everyone we spoke with spoke english. We stayed at the hotel twice on our trip so we got to experience two different rooms. Both rooms were spotless and nicely decorated. My only irritation and it was a big one!!! The wireless signal in both the rooms was very poor and at most times we could not connest at all. This is very frustrating as we relied on the wifi to plan our daytrips. I eventually resorted to buying a local data card for Spain. There is a computer on the 1st floor for guests to use, but prefer not to have to leave my room and sit aove the reception. Ther website clearly stated that there was wifi available........</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Let me start by letting everyone know this is NOT a gay hotel. It is a gay friendly hotel. Next, if you are interested in a nice relaxing spa keep your shorts on because the spa is co-ed. Also, the jacuzzi is not heated. They of course do not mention any of this in their marketing. Next, don't look up in the locker room or you'll see black mold growing everywhere. At check-in everyone was very friendly and then when some issues arose their was no nicety and no accommodation. Instead of working to correct any issue a manager has to get involved, only problem there is never a manager on duty. Whomever thinks this is a good hotel for the price really needs to get out more. There are so many great hotels in Barcelona this is the last place you should select.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overly priced for what it is (i.e. just an average hotel) and even more so when you are charged 300 € / night, for a more than average room but with such a bad Internet connection, which "worked" barely 10% of the time during our stay (the quotation marks around worked are self-explanatory, since it then worked more slowly than a 3G connection). Not a single four star hotel in the world would dare to impose only cold water in their rooms. Why aren't they at The Axel hotel ashamed to provide such a bad Internet connection? This is totally shameful and unacceptable. PS: when I complained about at the checking out, I could read on the cashier's face that I was probably the 10,000th to complain. How many more complaints and lost clients do you need to fix that???</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just spent 5 nights at the Hotel Axel in their Junior Suite (rm 612) and it was excellent. The bed is comfortable and the bath area was well supplied. The best part of the suite is the sunroom/terrace. A great respite from the heat of the barcelona. great location to nearby bars and the front desk staff (Vim and Andre) were excellent and helpful. The rooftop deck is a great place to relax after running around the city. Note - one drawback of this room 612 is that it is next to the service door to a staircase. I let the staff know that the door slams everytime a staff member used it - so hopefully they'll fix it. Also one cleaning staffer seemed to not understand that hanging the "Privacy Please" sign on the door actually means - don't bother. Isolated incident I hope.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After a few days in Sitges we went to Barcelona and stayed at this hotel....Such a great trendy place. Firstly...The roof top bar (slightly pricey, but you are in Barcelona) was great. Great views over Barcelona and plenty of loungers with pool and jacuzzi Secondly...The rooms were good. We stayed in a room that overlooked the front of the hotel. Very clean, comfy and had everything in there that we needed. Lastly...The location of the hotel was pretty much central from everything you would want to do (and if its not then it not far away from the transport links for those things that are further out of the city) Would highly recommend this hotel...As long as you dont mind the odd guy on the roof top bar walking around in his speedos........But i dont suppose many would :-)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location and design are very good. Cleaning could do a lot better. The suitcase we stored under the bed came out all dirty and full of dust. Apparently cleaning does not include under the bed in this hotel. There was also mould in the shower which we dont really find acceptable for this class of hotel. Window glass was dirty also. Heating did not work and we never got the room any warmer than 17°C which was rather cold in the evenings. We reported it to reception every day and they had somebody look at it but it did not get fixed during our 4 day stay. Lovely spa area downstairs, but overhere also some cleaning issues. Not a bad hotel, but they should get cleaning and service better organised. I'd like to go back if they get that sorted out, but as it was now it's not up to standard.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A sophisticated gay traveler expects a higher level of service and accommodation than this "heterofriendly" boutique hotel provides. Overall, I commend the owner for filling a niche market and my experience was acceptable. However, the "smoke-free" room reeked of smoke and there was no staff to circulate through the hotel at night to pick up leftover glasses on the roof terrace or from room service. The roof terrace is a terrific amenity yet, inexplicably, there was very limited bar service and the lighting was horrific. Though they advertise "free wifi"--it is available only in the lobby with the purchase of a cocktail. You must pay an additional 6 euro for wifi in your room. Free wifi should be included! With a little more attention to detail, it could be a terrific gay boutique hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel should be great but clearly the managment is not interested in providing amazing guest experience. The free WiFI that they speak about hardly works in the rooms. I arrived after 2pm for checkin and was told that I would have to wait for a room. I booked a King sized bed and was told no room was available with a king until 2 hours from then. I ended taking a room next to the elevator with 2 twins pushed together and a view of a wall (they call it a garden because their is some fake grass). The staff is very nice and works with what they are given. But clearly the management has sold out for 100% booking only and not concerned weather you come back. When leaving a guy from Austrailia at 6pm was to his reservation made last July- was there but the hotel had no rooms- they are oversold..... crazy....</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I found the hotel easy to locate after being dropped off at the main square from the Aerobus. The reception checked me in quite early in the day without any issues, and upgraded my room upon arrival which was a nice surprise. The room was nicer than expected, with a small balcony and a nice view of the streets below. Yes there was construction noise, but I was so tired from my over night flight from the states, I fell asleep without any problems and never had a problem napping during the day. The bed was fantastically comfortable. The restroom was adequately large, and the shower fantastic! I found the location to be excellent for seeing sights of the city. I never tried the hotel bar or restaurant, but did see them busy at times during my 5 nights at this hotel. Overall a great experience at Axel Hotel, and would recommend to anyone.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is the first hotel we give a five star for everything. The hotel has very modern rooms, nice and helpful staff at central desk and great facilities around (great spa in cellar (EUR 7 pppd), good working free wi-fi in the room, minibar, a shower even better than at home, great roof terrace with wonderful views). We didn't try breakfast though, because their are so many places in town where you can eat. We got a cheap last minute rate voor 5 nights, so we can't complain about the price either. Staff really helped us around in town and we felt very welcome everyday. We have read some bad comments here on tripadvisor, so were curious what to expect, but we can only say: first class, full marks! The gay "design" is visible but not annoying for any moment, our guess is at least half the hotel was filled with straight people. As it should be.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've been staying at the Axel Hotel for several years, and this was the first time I returned since the recent renovation. They've done a beautiful job updating the rooms, expanding the rooftop terrace and enlarging the restaurant. The staff is always pleasant, friendly and helpful. Breakfast is plentiful and delicious. Don't miss Shimai on Thursday nights - the show is lots of fun and they are hilarious - even if you don't speak a word of Catalan! The new wellness center is state of the art with the latest equipment, and the aquatic center with jacuzzis, sauna and steam room is a great way to relax and unwind after a long day of work or sightseeing. They've also added an outdoor bar on street level that is a great place to have a drink before continuing on to the other local bars. The scene in the neighborhood is always lively and animated.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in this hotel after our gay cruise ended in Barcelona. The location was great but the service was disappointing. We waited for almost an hour in line for checking in. They should have predicted the arrival of this gay cruise and reinforced the check in desk personnel and room cleaning. Our room had a really bad bed, a few small towels, and a tiny soap bar, among other poor amenities. I could have lived with this, but worst of all, it had dirty floors and corners. Breakfast was expensive (more than 15 Euros) and poorly served - I should have gone to the Starbucks 2 blocks away :-) The free wireless connection was terrible. To be fair, I want to mention 2 nice treats: the day of our arrival they set up a small welcome brunch in their bar, and a really effective luggage room to leave suitcases before the check in - but these were just for the day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was an incredible place to have stayed while visiting Barcelona. The staff were always extraordinarily helpful, especially going easily between my broken Spanish and their command of at least three languages. The room was well-appointed, with a nice shower and Ikea-style wireframe shelving that made for some unusual storage spaces. The bed was very comfortable, although there is no comforter. As for location, it's hard to beat: this property is near the best bars, some amazing restaurants, and a few short blocks from La Rambla, Plaza Catalunya, Casa Battlo, and La Pedrera... possibly even the Font Magica and Plaza Espanya if you're willing to go for a 15-minute stroll. The only downside here: The wifi connection is slower-than-slow. It was painful. There are two computers on the Floor 1 for goes use, but it makes any computer use in your room a chore at best.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you go to Barcelona, stay at Axel. The staff are ABSOLUTELY amazing. From the front desk to each of the bars and everyone in between, the service and the attention were as good as it gets. Our room had amazing sunlight, ample space, super-comfortable bed/bath/shower, and great views and enabled us both to sleep like babies. The location cannot be beat. I felt more like a guest in someone's home than a tourist at a hotel. In addition to the impressive staff, the hotel itself was stunning and so very comfortable. The pool was great, the restaurant service (and entertainment) was top-notch, and everything was within steps of the front door. Considering the actual accomodation, the staff and the location, there is no other place to stay in Barcelona as far as I am concerned. I'll return for another visit ASAP. THANK YOU AXEL HOTEL for such a great experience in Barcelona!!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice atmosphere, but phone got stolen in room”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel has an excellent location in a very nice area. Rooms where quite average regarding their decoration and furniture. They where clean, but housekeeping forgot to refill soap and shampoo sometimes. The same with the minibar. The only time they refilled it was after our first night. ( out of five nights ) Wifi in room was terrible but it worked fine in the lobby. The other guests was very nice and friendly and the rooftop pool and bar where excellent. The only problem, and that is a very big one, is that my girlfriends iPhone 4 got stolen from the room! I have never ever had anything like that happening to me during my around 2000 nights at different hotels worldwide. The phone was stolen when housekeeping had opened the door. I made a complaint and tried to get in contact with their manager but he has neglected to call me back. Of course this reflects my over all rating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">IMy partner and I stayed at the Axel a couple of years ago. We chose a superior room and the size and design was very good, although the materials used seemed to be on the cheap side to me. What really got to me was the arrogance of the staff. We arrived mid afternoon, only to be told our room would not be ready for another 45 minutes, a good 90 mins after the check in time they state. This would have been ok if they had at least extended an apology. However, all the staff seemed to do was swish around looking stylish and treating the guests as an irritation. Another irritation was that the breakfast was way too expensive about 13€ a head I think, there is a small café round the corner where we had the same breakfast for about 8€ for the two of us. Overall, stylish looking with a great rooftop pool, (gets a bit sleazy at night, if you like that sort of thing) although overall finishing feels cheap and tired.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We telephone to confirm our room and arrived to be told it would not be ready as one of the cleaners was ill. We were told to come back in an hour. I had an appointment and wanted to have a quick shower, yet an hour later it was not ready, another 5 minutes which turned into 30! We had the first floor rooms, but were unable to sleep as the reception acted as an echo chamber which seemed to amplify the music and entering of guests into the reception. Needless to say, we were both tired, but could not sleep in as breakfast and the builders had started. We asked to move rooms and they were not surprised *we had been told that the first floor was quiet*. They obliged and the remainder of the holiday there went well allowing for the normal gay surcharge on drinks. The steam room, sauna and Jacuzzi were good and the room was spotless and clean. The free water bottles were a nice touch. On balance a reasonable hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Axel hotel this past May after the renovation. There have been some that have diminished the hotel's service quality which has led me to conclude that the hotel is over rated. The tiles in the bathroom on the 6th floor were apparently not part of the renovation and we so badly chipped that they should have been replaced. The major complaint was the service. The Catalan speaking staff talk on the phone incessantly and will do their best to avoid making eye contact with you keeping you waiting for several minutes at the front desk and at the gym. There were a couple instances at the gym where I didn't bother waiting past a few minutes and they came into the gym screaming for my hotel card even though I visited the gym the day before and the same staff member verified my call the day before. I stayed at this hotel several times over the past few years and was deeply disappointed that the service attitude has gone from friendly boutique hotel to arrogant at times.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location: quite central, easily accessible from the main train stations or metro, and walking distance to most of the tourist attractions. Several nice eateries nearby Room: nice with all the essentials. Interesting Facebook like concept for the guests but didn't try it, but like the idea. Facilities: roof top terrace and gym - very nice. The spa was nice too Breakfast - not included in ours, didn't try them. Probably cheaper to get breakfast at Cafes around the hotel. Hotel was asking for €16 pp for breakfast or €12 if we booked in advanced for 5 nights. Cons: no proper lobby area to sit down apart from two enormous chairs at the entrance.

We chose to upgrade to premium room - in retrospective, we should have checked the "normal" room first before accepting the offer - but it's only €40 extra. We had lovely time in Barcelona</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Enjoyed my 2 night stay and regret why I didn't stay the other nights. I highly advise to take the rooms facing the street. That extra bucks make a big difference of how you feel about your whole trip. Breakfast Buffet for 12Euro was good and they serve it pretty late. that helps a lot if you plan to party the night before and getting up late. the gym was much better than many other hotel gym and some locals who happend to look very good also work out there. It was much better than the pictures. The wifi worked for me on the 6th floor . it was not always perfect qality but was reasonable. I didnot find the decoration and painting sleezy. there are soem photography of shirtless man but nothing gross. I can say 30 percent of clients were young straight couples and they were enjoying their stay. I highly advise this hotel because of location, value for price. keeping in mind that it is a boutique hotel. There was a sky bar which is closed for December but I am sure it is great for summer time. The only negative was massage which was very very average in the best.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First, I agree with Jet-Setter-SF completely. My partner and I stayed for 4 nights over Easter weekend. Greatest part of it all: the staff. While it would be complimentary to say they were responsive, it goes beyond that. They actually initiated contact and it was always pleasant even though our Catalan and Spanish was non-existent. And none of them is hard to look at either. Breakfast was ample and dinner was well-presented. Because the hallways are tiled rather than carpeted, they are dynamic and noisy. The gym is very small and minimaly equipped but arrangements are available with Holmes Place. Being about a 20 minute walk from La Rambla and wholly walkable to a number of gay venues makes a great location and we never waited more than a few minutes to catch a taxi right outside even though it was a holiday weekend. We will definitely stay here the next time but opt for a regular, street-facing room rather than the deluxe room with the stained glass balcony. Oh, and will prefer the separate bath more than the stylish one. The most comfortable hotel bed ever - bar one.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Was staying at Axel for 1 night in July. The hotel was recommended to me by friend who stayed there before and was planing to stay later in august. But he cancelled his reservation after he knew. I will try to be brief. There was a torn towel in my room. I noticed it late evening and complaind at check out next day. The guy at reception told me something like "sometimes it happens". I asked to invite the general mananger. The manager came and didn't bother to apologize. The message and the delievery were gross. What he told me is that in his opinion I MADE THE HOLES ON TOWEL TO GET THE DISCOUNT (!!!!). That was offensive. He went on saying that i left the room in terrible condition and stainded the bathroom with blood - he showed the pics on his iPhone.That wasn't blood guy - twas red clay hairwash. The conclusion is - the torn towel in 4 star hotel is a disgrace. But even more disgrace is when the general manager offends the clients instead of bringing apologies. Overall - the hotel is ok but needs some refubrishment and iprovement in service. Luxury is not the word to describe it.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Together with my partner we spent 6 days in the Axel Hotel seduced by the hotel's web page and some gay magazines advertisements. The best of the hotel is a location, in the very middle of gay Barcelona. But there is no gay hotel any more - the majority of the guest, they were hetero-couples, even some of them seemed to be surprised by the presence of some of the gay couples on breakfast. We had the premium room, and it was quite comfortable. But the housekeeping service - I would say - should be improved. Every day they used to forgot about something- fresh towels, bath towels, cosmetics, paper tissue, toilet papper, etc. Beware internet Wi-FI quality! The Wi-Fi network is very slow, and configured so badly that I can't use my Mac at all, and my partner Mac internet was very slow. The hotel's staff tried to convinced me that "must be something wrong" with my computer, but it worked perfectly with other wi-fi networks in Barcelona. I spent a lot of time fighting with the hotel wi-fi cut off from network for 6 days! So, to be honest, that is 3/4* hotel, not for gays not for business travelers as well</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Axel Hotel Barcelona has definitely lost what used to be a hip and friendly edge. The hotel has begun a transformation which makes it less “hetero-friendly” and more “gay-friendly”. While the staff and many patrons are gay, it is obvious the hotel is trying to become less so. The fluctuating room rates however, reflect their desire to snag as many gay dollars as possible, with truly exorbitant rates around gay specific happenings. Unfortunately, the rate paid does not reflect either the quality or comfort of the hotel. Their mild redo is little more than a fresh coat of paint, and the general lack of quality service make for a rather poor lodging choice. The location is great, however and within walking distance to many popular spots in town. The rooftop bar has a great view, but is sadly overshadowed by the down right rude staff that serve there. High drink prices and a disdainful attitude do not go well. The W Barcelona has prices just as high, but friendly and courteous staff. Overall, we will not stay at the Axel again, and I would not feel comfortable recommending this hotel as a lodging choice, whether gay or straight.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is very good value for money , i stayed in a few hotel's in Barcelona( mainly 5 star) and compared this hotel has very competetive rates , considering the hotel is of a high standard . The rooms are very nice , you can see in the shower from the bed , so don't stay with someone you would'nt want to see you naked . This is a hotel to stay in if you want the other person TO see you naked . My room had a lovely view of the Barcelona's streets and chairs in the windows of the room which i loved . The Jacuzzi on the roof is lush and the view is great , very romantic! Staff where lovely , however drink/food serving times .....were'nt open a lot in the day , however i did so in late season , so this could be why . At first when you arrive you may feel you're out of the way a little, i soon discovered how close to everything i was , i went for a wander and in 15 minutes found myself wandering into Las ramblas(and i was walking in heels ) Axel is in the gay district , which i found buzzing and friendly in the evening times, great stay for couple/friends The area is very authenic Catalan , good cultural experience , i would actually prefer to stay in this area than Las Ramblas.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for 5 nights in June. I have been traveling for 8 months and this was the worst experience I have had so far. The staff were excellent, however the general manager is an utter disgrace. Maybe the problem is higher up but to lack of staff at the hotel is wrong. We ordered some drinks and had to wait over 40 min in the boiling heat as the poor bar tender was doing room service and attending to the bar. We ordered a hamburger which was raw and tasted horrible. When I went to complain it was a huge issue to speak to the manager or preferred just to swan around in a cream suit than deal with the issues. Sorry you are not working at this hotel to just look pretty you have to WORK. I was the accused of lying about the food, which went down like a done of bricks. When I mentioned how long the drinks took he srugged and said oh we only have one staff. Well let me give you some advice mr horrible general manager, take your cream suit off and do some work for a change. Overall I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The bar manager Angelo is amazing and made up for the horrific experience, but next time in Barcelona I'd only go to axel for a drink. The axel in Berlin kills Barcelona in every way.....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was very excited about my stay here, and truthfully, there were things that we liked about this hotel. BUT BEWARE!!!! When using the online booking system, I did not notice that there was a tab for the number of people. NOWHERE in the pricing page does it indicate that the price is significantly different when two people are staying in the room (and it's not as though 2 people to a room is an unusual state of affairs.) I was staying with my partner, and upon check-in, the desk informed us that instead of 190 euros for the room we would be charged 240 euros. I found this to be an outrageous practice, but of course, who wants to arrive in a foreign city and start looking for a new hotel? What did we get for 240 euros? An adequate room with no view whatsoever (the "patio view" is another deception: the patio is a concrete pad at the bottom of the light court, and not a patio at all), and decent, but not overwhelming, amenities. In fairness, I will say that the rooftop pool and gym are very nice, albeit not as well kept as they could be. All in all, I would say that this is a 3 star hotel charging 5 star rates. It is a shame that gay travellers looking for a gay-oriented property can't find something of better value in Barcelona.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Don't stay in this Hotel, unless you love incredibly loud music in the foyer, ridiculous 'red light' even in the lift first thing in the morning, degrading naked body photos for every deco u can think of : from computer screens to tv and/or room deco, etc shoved down your throat WHEREVER you look! If you think, that being 'gay' merely means a life-style of picking up casual sex-partners, and cruising for that, than this is the place for you. But if, like me, you think that this is a RIDICULOUS, misleading and utterly degrading portrayal of same-sex partnership, which only defers from 'heteros' by being attracted to partners of the same gender and - in fact - have a very normal and stable relationship, long term. And thus, if your real reason to come to Barcelona is to enjoy the SITES, such as Gaudi, the amazing Picasso Museum, the Pueblo Espanya, and many other lovely things, like the really nice food, than stay at any hotel which will treat you with QUIET, restrained respect which you/i/all of us fully deserve! Not mentioning that they will charge you for the wi-fi, with the full knowledge that it DOES not actually work in the hotel !!!! Day-time robbery! Find another Hotel, I say, there is such an enormous choice in Barcelona….</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Always better to go for the superior rooms which look out in two directions and perhaps a higher floor though we don't notice traffic noise. Do ask if you want a bath as most rooms have showers. The rooms are spotless, perfectly maintained and minimalist but with all mod-cons / TV internet access, loverly robes, slippers and bathroom goodies. beds so wide you could swim across and linen (and pillows) we like so much we're thinking of asking for a tip where to get the same. The Axel often does deals - if you get on their mailing list you can get great packages with a big discount including on the great buffet breakfast. On this visit, the hotel was about to close to extend into the building next door and to refurbish the rooftop spa - pool, gym,hot-tub, wet and dry sauna - and bar area. When they re-open with quite a lot more rooms we are expecting to find the place busier, yet still with time to be welcoming. We've been coming for years. We never stay anywhere else in Barcelona - it's our ideal base, from the airport, and to all the places we like to go. We've never done a review on Trip Advisor before, but we often read them and use them to guide us as to where to stay. It seems only fair we make an effort to leave this genuine review in thanks as we have found a great place to stay.</p></li>

Guests are greeted by blaring dance music in the reception area which is quite disconcerting when you are arriving after a long trip and are tired. A lot of money has been spent on the public areas to give the hotel a 'design' look but the rooms are very basic and over priced for what you get. The finish of the rooms is that of a budget hotel rather than a 4 or 5 star property. My tiny double room faced the rear light well. so my window looked out on to other rooms which also had no view. So my curtains remain closed the whole time. The rooftop bar was it's only saving feature as this was a great spot for drink in the afternoon and at sunset. Pity the bar staff are not better trained as well in mixing drinks as we were served some odd concoctions. The rooftop pool design did not encourage me to use it as it filled up with only a few guests. The final downside is the breakfast room off the reception area. The waiting staff seem to have lost all control on how to run a dining room with 70% of tables covered in dirty dishes when we cam down for breakfast and we were forced to sit at a dirty table for 10 mins before someone appeared to clean it. The breakfast selection was not wonderful and we left preferring to eat out at a cafe rather than pick and scraps from the buffet.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for my 40th Birthday at from the 26th Feb for 4 nights. Stayed in room 605. Found that the room nada constant musty/damp smell that only subsided when I kept the bathroom closed. For the first 2 days of my stay I had free access to the wellness spa in the basement. When I went to go and relax on my birthday I was told that I would have to pay as there was a change of policy as the wellness centre no longer had a relationship with the hotel. There was no communication of this change when I checked in. It all ended up with a very uncomfortable exchange with the centre staff and ended up paying 7€ to relax to be constantly cross-sold at that point for massages, drinks, etc. The hotel should have managed this situation better and subsidised existing check-ins before 1st March until they left the hotel or advised customer before hand. Rooms were bright and very quiet. in room entertainment met with my requirements when used. Wifi was intermittent and sometimes very slow unless you were in the corridors, but free for the duration of the stay so not a real deal breaker. Mix of clientele was good though and relaxed. The day desk team were helpful with a smile, where at the person on the night duty always looked like he didn't want to be there. Jury is out if I would stay here again. Although I would have recommended it for the wellness centre.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">How this hotel keeps on getting such high scores is mistery to me. Been here 4 times and always there's a problem with something. First time : construction works, noise, no pool, no rooftop solarium. Second time construction should have been finished but was not, so I ended up with same problems. Third time : construction was finished but work was going on on the wellness pool which was empty + lots of dust and noise from painting still going on in some rooms. Fourth time : all is finished but with rooms barely a year old there's mould in the shower, dirt under the bed, ... It kept me wanting to go back to see how it would be if everything was finished but it's getting worse. The so calles sound-proofed rooms here every noise from next door and if your neighbour watches TV all night you're not getting any sleep. How's that for soundproofed ?! Rooms next to the elevators should not count on much sleep either. Several days left the room at 9am and hung the sign at the door to "clean the room now". Got back at 4 in the afternoon and still nothing was done. The cleaning staff needs to drop their attitude and start getting service right. I could go on for a while but neither the quality of upkeep, nor the service justify the price you pay. At these prices service, facilities and cleaning should be perfect. I'd call it "a nice try" and than I'm being kind.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent 2 nights here, booked very last minute so got a good rate. First impressions very good, trendy, nice furnishings in the reception and a bar, restaurant, spa, rooftop bar. We were given a standard room which was fine, nice to have English channels. This is a gay hotel and this is quite in your face in terms of room decor, pictures, a "please distrurb" sign to hand on the door etc. This was fine with me and my husband but might not be to everyones taste. Nice shower, nice modern decor in the room. The reason for my low score is the lack of attention to detail to have a pleasant stay. There was a lack of hangers (3), no robes as advertised, one pair of slippers, no WiFi. On the bed were just sheets, we put up with this for 1 night but it was October and I was cold so my husband asked on the 2nd day if we could have a blanket. I had assumed we were meant to have one but they'd forgotten, this wasn't the case, the hotel didn't have any! They managed to find a single, rather dirty duvet, but this is meant to be a luxury hotel, very strange. It's a shame as if they sorted this out (I'm not the first to complain) it would be a nice hotel. We didn't use the bars (rooftop closed in October) or the spa but everything looked nice. The area is good but we generally preferred the location and the hotel we stayed at next - Room Mate Emma so will stay there again on our next stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed at Axel a number of times and until now enjoyed it, good value, location and service. This time, i had several issues which were all manageable but the staff handled them badly. First, my reservation was prepaid but apparently a problem with my card at the time of reservation meant it didnt go through. They said they emailed but could not show me the email and i didnt get one. they provided a room that was still free, it was off a public balcony area on the 1st floor.. the floor was water damaged and generally the room shabby compared to my previous stays at axel. i asked to change the next morning, they said there would be a €20 charge!! i refused and they changed anyway without the charge. my new room was much better but when i returned from work that evening, there were no bath towels. i used hand towels to dry as i was in a rush to a business dinner and asked the reception to arrange towels while i was out. they said there was nobody available to deliver them and asked if i would collect them from reception myself!!! i said, No, shouldnt my room have towels provided? they did not bring towels to my room. i had to return to reception when i got back later that night to get the towels myself. i think this is terrible service. such a pity because i used to really like this hotel. i think their success is going to their heads so now they think they can be arrogant to their guests... doomed.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “VERY COMMERCIAL- loosing its gay market niche”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First Impressions: This hotel has recently been renovated clearly at great expense and is indeed trendy and modern inside. However noticeably the philosophy of the hotel has also now changed (compared to prior years) to one of pure commercialism -and that means large numbers of families with children and straight couples are staying - there much more than before. It is no longer serving the niche market it once claimed. Hotel Image: The hotel slogan of "hetro friendly" is now just a brand image - the reality is that as a gay guy with partner i felt overwhelmed by the number of hetro families with children. Staying there: Generally clean comfortable and pleasant - everything the hotel used to be. However my advice is get down to breakfast early before the choice from the buffet rapidly diminishes! They also played loud pop music in the breakfast room which included lyrics containing a range of 4-letter swear words! Nice! Wellness Area: Parts of the the new 'wellness' area were (already) being repaired during my stay and were out of use. When open again, the Wellness area was relatively empty except for hetro couples. The wellness area is regularly monitored by staff to ensure everything is in order. Overall: The hotel continues to offer high standards and trend setting design. However if you stayed at this hotel in prior years - you will now notice the difference. We are not sure if we would want to return.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Wonderful room made for a pleasant off-season stay”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good about the “Axel Premium” room: A fabulous little balcony, with two chairs, table, and electric socket, enclosed by stained-glass windows that opened for a breeze, overlooking a typical Eixample 8-sided streetcorner. The room was bright by day (big window in addition to the balcony) yet very well insulated from street noise and light at night. Recently renovated, great bed, good climate control. Practical, no frills, easily-cleaned surfaces. Good about the area: Blocks from Passeig de Gràcia, but not overrun by the bad element that follows tourists. Plenty of food around on the two cross streets, ranging from groc shops serving locals, to super delicious dainty pizza slices, to sit-down evening tapas. Nice walk to the coast. Stylish shopping. “Fun” notes: Mirror outside bathroom was angled for a view of the shower area. “Please Disturb” door tag could invite other fun-loving guests to your room. (I did not hang it.) The bad: I had a good stay - The bed, the windows, the fabulous balcony made up for the hotel's flaws. But these were numerous. Malfunctioning internet. Cleaning staff ignored the “L” door tag and serviced other rooms before mine. “Barcelona City Card” rate did not include the card itself, but rather a voucher that I failed to redeem because I would have had to wait in line a long time in the tourist information dungeon, and I preferred to cut my losses and just go out and be out in the ambient.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Axel used to be a GREAT Hotel. Small, with friendly staff and a great little gym, sauna and Jacuzzi on the roof terrace. Now it's a big, impersonal machine with an "anal" spa in the basement. The staff are nice enough, but can't exactly be called "friendly". This is a predominantly gay hotel but with the strapline "hetero friendly". Firstly I checked in at 4pm and didn't meet one male staff member until breakfast the following morning. I visited the Spa and was asked for 6 or 7 euros. I was in my gown and slippers and explained I was not carrying my wallet. I therefore asked for the amount to be added to my hotel account. Oh no..I was made to go back up to my room and get the money...not to mention the rolling of the eyes and tutting when I handed the girl a 20 euro note. The spa itself was quite relaxing except that 3 of the water jets were not working (and haven't been working for over 1 year !). 1 guy removed his trunks to take a shower and the swimming costume police from reception descended on him like flies ! Breakfast choice hasn't changed one ounce in the 5 or 6 years I have been staying at the Axel and is dreadful value for money. 16 euros for very little and the fruit juices and coffee are served in cracked jugs. And why is the scrambled egg always brown ? Why is it that "speciality" hotels seem to think they can get away with a drop in standards, just because they offer a "unique" service. Come on Axel, get your act together.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Fabulous Time in Barcelona”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiancé and I recently returned from a trip to Barcelona and stayed at the Axel Hotel and had a great time. What impressed us about the hotel and our stay was... 1. Price....Hotel cost was reasonable and not overpriced compared to other hotels. 2. Location...Hotel location was excellent...access to the metro, restaurants, ATM's and major city intersections was ideal. 3. Staff...Hotel staff was more than accommodating and helpful. Staff was able to provide us great recommendations on where to eat, visit, what to look out for, etc. It was my fiance's birthday as well and Wim at the front desk helped to arrange flowers to be delivered for her. The rooms were typical size of hotel rooms and housekeeping always keep the room clean and provided us with extra towels and toiletries when requested. Everyone also spoke good English. 4. Customer Service....This is a lost art at many hotels we stayed at,however at Axel it was a staple. We've stayed at many hotels throughout our travels in the U.S. Caribbean (St. Kitts, St. Lucia, Jamaica, Antigua, Bermuda, Puerto Rico, Hawaii), Asia (Taiwan, Thailand) and Europe (U.K. Germany, France, Prague, Brussels) sorry for the list but we had to emphasis that we travel and stayed many hotels. By far the customer service experienced and exhibited at Axel is in our top 5 rankings. The only minor matter is the hotel did not have wash cloths. However, it was explained to us that wash cloths are not a common amenity provided.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I stayed at the Hotel Axel in July 2006 for almost two weeks and had a really wonderful stay. First, the staff was, across the board, all excellent. From the patient front desk staff who all spoke English and had excellent knowledge of the city, to the wait staff that was super friendly to the housekeeping staff that kept our room in perfect shape for the entire stay. We had a third floor room on the street. We never had a problem with noise either from the street or from the hotel itself. It’s quiet enough to get a great night’s sleep and the optional black-out shade was a bonus for when we stayed out late and wanted some extra shut-eye. We also loved the rooftop deck. It’s a great place for hanging out and enjoying the sun and the plentiful eye candy. Yes, the pool is super tiny and not deep at all. But, it was still nice to jump in and cool off when laying out. The Jacuzzi is clean and nice, as are the steam room and sauna. Again, the service in the Sky Bar is excellent and the drinks yummy. The free Internet was really helpful and the free bottled water saved lots of money. Finally, the location of the hotel is great. It's 2 short blocks to the Universitat Metro station (with a good Starbuck's on the way). It's also just 5 blocks to Passeig de Gracia and restaurant / shopping paradise. It's right in the middle of the gay neighborhood so you don't have to go far for gay bars, clubs and restaurants. We loved the Axel and recommend it highly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Checked in around 1am on a Monday. We'd made a three-day reservation because we weren't sure of our itinerery for the whole week. At check in, we asked about availability during the rest of the week if we decided to stay on. The desk clerk was very helpful. Although the hotel was booked through the weekend, he followed up and on the next night stopped us in the lobby to let us know he'd secured our room for the balance of the trip. It IS a pretty decent place. When we first arrived we were a bit put off by the rather spartan rooms and linoleum floors. The bed was nice however, and we had a room overlooking the street with french doors. The bathroom worked well enough, although the floor flooded with every shower because the shower "door" only closes across 2/3rds of the opening. The baseboards were pretty dirty, but all in all we thought the place was decently clean. Nicely located, just a few blocks from Las Ramblas -- about a 15 minute walk. The hotel was pretty empty on Monday, but by Wednesday things started to pick up and by Thursday and Friday it was full. Nice roof bar, pool and weight room with a sauna and steam. Complimentary computers on the mezzanine level. We checked out a few other hotels in the area while we were there, and decided that all in all this was a nice place for the money. Would I stay there again? Yes; however, if I go back I'm likely to try somewhere else just to get a different perspective -- and perhaps stay in a different part of the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The lobby is impressive when you walk into the hotel but sadly things were not so great after that. When we first arrived to our room there was no electricity and it took the staff almost half an hour to sort it out during which time we just had to sit and wait. The room itself was much smaller than we expected and only had a view of the building directly opposite. We had to keep the curtains closed so that the people in the building couldn't see directly into the room. The bathroom only had a shower and no bath. On the second day just as we were getting up the electricity in the room failed again and we had to sit in the dark for about 45 minutes until the staff found the problem (a leak from upstairs into the light in the bathroom). A request to move to another room was denied by reception staff who assured us they would fix the problem but it wasn't done speedily and meant we couldn't leave our room to go out for the day when we wanted to. The room key cards also stopped working regularly during the day and on the second day housekeeping hadn't left us any towels. The WiFi coverage in the room was extremely intermittent. Although the staff did try to fix the problems we had it is a shame that this did not happen more quickly and that they didn't agree to move us to another room. On the positive side, the hotel is in an excellent location and the roof-bar is pleasant to sit out in and enjoy the views and the sun. However, despite this our experiences overall will mean we won't be back as there are several other excellent hotels within the vicinity.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The feeling of genuinely being welcome at a hotel is the only thing that describes walking through the doors at the Axel Hotel. I had the pleasure of staying here for 10 days, and enjoying everything that Barcelona had to offer. From the friendly greeting, to the amazing benefits card, the rooftop pool/Jacuzzi & bar, to the stylish rooms…the Axel is truly a gem in the heart of the city! The friendly vibe that the staff exudes flows right to all of the people staying at the hotel, and makes for a memorable stay. The multi lingual staff was very detail oriented, and went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure my stay was very nice. I was greeted each day by my first name with all of the front desk staff. All of the printed materials and discounts that come with staying at the Axel were a vast surprise. The local area around the hotel was very nice as well. There are many fun and quaint shops on the same street as the hotel, as well as very festive bars, and eateries! As a young traveler (25), I feel the Axel took care of all of my needs, and then some. As a Miami beach native, everyone brings music with them to the beach. An amenity that was very invaluable was the portable iPod speakers that you could loan at the front desk. I’d also occasionally stay out late partying and having a great time, and was never interrupted by housekeeping early in the morning. There were a variety of shows that brought in many locals to the hotel, which was exciting. Is the Axel hotel pricy, YES! That said, looking back at all of the offerings, the Axel was well worth every Euro!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Barcelona I've been many times in Barcelona and love the city in many ways. This was my first meeting with the Hotel Axel. The location is perfect. Outside, but inside. The street Aribau is a beautiful setting among it all. And I mean everything. The staff is professional and never to bother. Apart from the woman who never said hello on arrival, it was brilliant reception from the boys who worked there. The price is higher than i normally appreciate, but through hotels.com it was an affordable price. I had a request for a room high up in order to have a good sense of space overlooking the streets, apparently the receptionist did not understand when he placed me with a view to the backyard. But, I should've told him, which I did not. So... The room is perfect, but something small. Everything works well and it smells clean and delicious. TV facilities were good, but the remote was very slow and design from the last century. The phone was in modern design (...) It also costs money to release a fart, and I am always annoyed when it costs money to be on the Internet. So 90s. Include it in the price for the room is a suggestion. I really like the style that the hotel is «hetero-friendly» that signals the good values from the owners. There are also several minor details established with a twinkle in your eyes. Very good - and create a including atmosphere. Room service and food was terrific. Try cheese and fruit salad. Perfect!. There is also a fantastic roof terrace that you will love with a Jacuzzi. A hotel, I certainly recommend, especially if you manage to get a good deal from hotels.com.</p></li>

<li>The phone was in modern design (...) It also costs money to release a fart, and I am always annoyed when it costs money to be on the Internet.</br></br></li>
<li>So 90s.</br></br></li>
<li>Include it in the price for the room is a suggestion.</br></br></li>
<li>I really like the style that the hotel is «hetero-friendly» that signals the good values from the owners.</br></br></li>
<li>There are also several minor details established with a twinkle in your eyes.</br></br></li>
<li>Very good - and create a including atmosphere.</br></br></li>
<li>Room service and <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">food</span> was <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">terrific.</span></br></br></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our room was very nicely appointed, though not so big though. Our room had an enclosed balcony with stained glass windows, which fronts the front of the hotel. It was very pleasant to sit on the balcony and take in the sun in the early morning before heading out. The king-size bed was very comfortable. Unfortunately, the hotel does not use mattress covers on the bed. We were a bit concerned by this for hygenic reasons. The shower/bathtub does need a grab rail as they are very slippery to step into. There were always plenty of towels and bath amenities. The shower had good water pressure ! The hotel has 2 computers at your disposition on the mezzanine level of the reception area. This would not constitute a true business center. There are no printers hooked to with computer. The spa area was very well appointed and extremely design. The pool on the rooftop desk was closed as it was out of season when we stayed here in December 2010. We did try the breakfast one day at 16 EUROS. It was adequate but a bit overpriced for what was offered. It is a continental style buffet menu with fresh juices and fruit, scrambled eggs, sausages, ham, cheeses, cereals, yogurt, and a hot beverage of your choice. We did not try the restaurant in the hotel for dinner. There is a bar as well on the ground floor. Typical trendy bar atmosphere and very smokey too as Spain did not start anti-smoking in public areas until 2 January 2011. Definitely worth a stay as the location is very good with bus and subway lines nearby. You can walk to many nearby shoping areas, restaurants and nightclubs. The neighborhood is quiet and safe.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you don't want to take a taxi from the airport you shouldn't worry about the access to Axel Hotel. Just take A1 (from terminal 1) or A2 (from terminal 2) and get off at Universitat. The hotel is 300 m from here, a nice walk in a great city. Because it was not a very busy period and the hotel was not quite full we have been upgraded to a superior room, first sign for a great stay in this hotel. The room was very nice, it was a simple style we really enjoyed. The bed was very comfortable and I loved the pillows, we slept like babies :). I was a bit disappointed by the bathrooms, they were a bit in contrast with the rest of the room. The door from the shower cabin was not very clean and the floor of the bathroom had some spots of dirt on it, old ones that couldn't be removed. One of the best spots in the hotel is the SPA area, for me it was great. Jacuzzi, steam bath, dry sauna... they were all just perfect. I promise to return here during summer time so that I can also enjoy the pool and the relax area on the roof :). The breakfast room is not very large but it is cosy, breakfast is not huge but plentiful and very tasty. It is also a nice place to watch stylish men having their morning coffe. I can't leave unnoticed that there are many str8 people that are being accommodated at Axel, it was not bothering at all but I would have expected the place to be more like a gay oasis. This is not hotel's fault, you cannot control the sexual orientation of guests at the time of booking. All in all, my experience at Axel Barcelona was a great one, this is the reason I rate it 5 out of 5. And here I have to mention the very friendly staff (men and women) that were helpful and spiritual...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my first trip to Europe and I loved Barcelona. The Axel Hotel was the perfect place to stay. It is a beautiful building and the rooms are modern and spotless. The staff was so welcoming and helpful. Marrisol (spelling?) was especially helpful. She was at the front desk when I checked in. She was able to get me into a room 3 hours before the normal check in time which was wonderful. She took the time to give me directions to all the places I had on my list that I wanted to see. It was nice to have a smiling face greet you after a long overnight flight from Boston. I had a beautiful room on the 6th floor on the street side. I had a small balcony that had a view of beautiful 19th century buildings. I had a king size bed with a pure white comforter. The bed was super comfortable and the linens and towels were spotless. I loved the large rain style shower head. It was great after a long day of touring. The Axel Hotel is in a great location Lots of small shops and restaurants in the neighborhood. The streets are very clean and safe. A great area to go walking. Only about a 10 or 15 minute walk from the hotel is the Plaza Catalonya in the city center. A great area for shopping and restaurants. La Rambla is close by too. I used the Aerobus for the airport. When I wasn't walking, I was touring on the Hop ON Hop Off bus or Julia Tours which I used for my visit to Montserrat. All of these modes of transportation were within a short walk from the hotel. I had room service a couple of times and the food was excellent. The pasta and bolognase was wonderful. When I return to Barcelona, I will definitely stay at Axel Hotel again. Comfortable, Clean, Affordable and Friendly. What more could you ask for?</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just returned from a 2 night stay at this great hotel. Located in the Eixample area of Barcelona, you can walk to most of the major sights in the city center. Plus, Barcelona has an excellent subway system with stops near the hotel. Of the four hotels I stayed at in Spain on this trip, incuding another much more expensive 4 star one in Barcelona, this was my favorite. Great location, clean, airy rooms, the most comfortable bed and large bathroom were all appreciated. I booked a standard single (has a king size bed). They gave me one on the corner, so my bathroom had a tub, not just a stand up shower. And the soundproof doors opened up to a small juliet balcony overlooking the street. I liked the open shelving/closet in the room. I thought it provided more room than the airmoires some European hotels offer. The little touches made a big difference here too. A refrigerator on each floor stocked with cold water for whenever you wanted. Two sets of bath amenities in the bathroom. Extra large and soft towels for both the bathroom and the pool. Large, fluffy pillows for the bed... The staff was all very helpful, especially at the front desk. And the service at breakfast was the most attentive and quickest I had all trip. Maybe not a big thing for everybody, but I loved that they served you a pot of coffee, rather than just one cup at a time! The rooftop pool and bar were also quite nice. The pool is small (there's also a hot tub and small, but quite adequate, gym), but they loungechairs and views are wonderful. It's a great spot to meet friends for a drink at the end of the day. When I come back to Barcelona, this is the only hotel I will stay at and I have already recommended it many of my friends.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Well I read the reviews before booking and I can just say that gay guys are tough customers! All those little things in the reviews are tiny things that sure could be better - but overall its a great quality hotel..and best of all its gay. Its not a 5 star hotel but its great - extremely clean, very friendly staff who went out of the way to help with everything, nice rooms with terrace overlooking street, great jacuzzi and steam on rooftop, very convenient location to both gay and tourist sights. Beds are super large and comfortable, yes the clothing rack is a rack and not a closed cupboard (can this seriously ruin your time in Barcelona!) and yes the shower door doesnt go right across the shower and some water gets on the floor - but you have a mat to put on the floor and your room gets cleaned every day - so does this really matter so much?! As for the guys saying there are men looking for sex here - well it is gay hotel! But if you are in your room with the door closed - how would you know what is happening outside your room!!! I saw a few guys giving smiles and eye contact - but nothing more than you get on the streets outside! There were straight couples here when I stayed and gay guys with straight friends staying too - everyone was super friendly and relaxed. It is a little bit expensive for what it is - maybe should be a bit cheaper but overall I had a great stay for 5 nights, met friendly guys, walked to the gay bars, enjoyed the terrace on the roof, and slept wonderfully in the bed and with the 3 curtains that block out all the sun in the morning. And finally yes its a busy streets outside, but look around you. It is Barcelona! Everyone lives on a busy street here, its city life and thats what is part of amazing Barcelona. So book here and enjoy your time in Barcelona ;-)</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “ambience has changed completely”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I have always stayed here when in Barcelona but with enlargement and refurbishment the hotel ambience has changed completely from *hetero friendly* to being a hotel where gay guests feel less comfortable than before. The management is clearly going with the money with straight guests but still trying to milk the overpriced gay market. The facilities that were previous included free and exclusive to guests on the roof are now a mixed public facility with swimwear police in the basement where paid spa and gym members are coming in from the street - past the dining room which is usually freezing because of the open door. Hotel guests feel extremely unwelcome - and have to pay - down there. The reception staff in the spa are very rude. The breakfast is very expensive and very poor - the hot items are badly / over cooked and the cold items looked exactly the same for the three mornings of our most recent visit stuck to the plates. The gimmicky metal wardrobes in the bedrooms have been the same for years but are not much use - the token glass sliding wardribe door in our room had vanished. The recently added minibar fridge will probably cook your netbook and other electronic gear because the room safe is directly above it - and they have scrapped the free chilled bottled water that used to be available on all the landings. This hotel actually has very few facilities yet you are paying as much as 5* straight hotels in the centre of Barcelona for a now non-existent gay ambience. The extended ground floor bar is cold, the music is too loud and the drinks prices are outrageous for perfunctory service. I think we have just about decided to stay elsewhere in future. This was a great place to stay but the management has systematically destroyed much of it that appealed the gay market.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel for our honeymoon in March and stayed for 5 nights. First impressions were great, the hotel lobby was lovely and the staff were pleasant. We were a little diaspointed with the room, it was small and had very little natural light with it being on the inside of the hotel. As others have mentioned it was all one room containing bedroom and bathroom, there was a sliding door separating the toilet. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. There was wifi available in the rooms, but it wasn't cheap. There were 2 old computers on the first floor for guests to use that had internet, unfortunately though for the last 3 days of our stay the internet wasn't working at all. The main disappointment for me was the service... Everyone was nice enough but nothing seemed to get done. For example, the first night of our stay we asked if we could upgrade to a suite, or a room on the outside with a balcony. The girl on reception said that the hotel was fully booked that night but it shouldn't be a problem for the rest of the week. Nothing ever happened with that, despite me mentioning it again. Also we had a problem with the keycard, the door wouldn't lock all the time. We spoke to the staff member in reception and he advised us that maintenece would check it the following day, again this never happened. The rooftop terrace was lovely, though the pool was freezing in March! My only suggestion for that would be to perhaps keep at least one of the lights up there turned on at night. The downstairs bar was nicely decorated, the barmaid was friendly but the drinks were somewhat overpriced at £12 per mojito. The location was pretty good, roughly 10 minutes walk to Plaça de Catalunya and Las Ramblas. Overall it wasn't bad, but it wasn't exactly the hotel i'd have chosen for my honeymoon. Barcelona in general was fabulous! Can't wait to go back.</p></li>
