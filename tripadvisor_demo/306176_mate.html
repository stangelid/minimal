<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I would like to comment about the great experience me and my husband had when we stayed in Singapore. I was recommended this place by a mate and we have no regrets. We were warmly welcomed by a staff Miss Kripa at the club floor where we were staying on. All the other staff were very friendly and took care of us for the few nights we were there. The rooms and service were top notch.I will surely recommend this place to fellow Kiwis that go to Singapore.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent location, very close to MRT City Hall, Raffles Shopping complex and City Mall shops, about 25 min walk to Suntec City. The rooms are not big but you don't come to Singapore to stay in a hotel. We didn't use the restaurant at all as there is so much amazing food elsewhere. Some people mentioned before thin walls, well all hotels in Singapore we stayed before were the same, you could hear people walking in the corridors but definitely not TV from next rooms.</p></li>

The breakfast buffet had everything you could want. On the second evening we had a drink in the bar while we listened to the live music.

The staff are really courteous and the rooms are clean, although from my room there wasn't much of a view. As I had arranged for a taxi to meet me at 5am, the Concierge knew I was coming and addressed me by name as I came into the lobby which was unexpected but appreciated. The location is great, right in the middle of the city and close to the subway. I thoroughly recommend staying at the Grand Plaza.</p></li>

It was only on the 9th night that I realised something was wrong and gave them a call. They assured me everything was fine. However, they then emailed me on the 10th that they cancelled my booking for the 14th, seriously, have the decency to call!</p></li>

In terms of location, if you want to shop at Orchard Road, there are plenty of other hotels that are much closer. But if you don't mind walking and taking MRT this is an okay location. It is also walking distance to Clarke Quey..</p></li>

Great breakfast and swimming pool very welcome after a hot day sightseeing. Only use public transport whilst in Singapore as it was so good and cheap. The MRT was fantastic, even caught it back to airport. It was a nostalga trip for us as my Husband used to live on Singapore as a child with the British Army so he wanted to try and find the house where he used to live. We did manage it, which is a miracle as most of Singapore is new.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A very comfortable and well located hotel. Transport, attractions, food and shopping are all within walking distance, and the staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed, and it was good to have a separate bath and shower. Breakfast was well presented, with a good range catering to all tastes, though the icing sugar on the French toast was a little odd. Good coffee too. The pool was a tad small but clean and well maintained. Only major gripe would be the drink prices, but that's common in Singapore.</p></li>

We did a lot - Sentosa, Orchard Rd, Bugis, Night Safari, Clarke Quay, Night clubs, etc We are 2 fun nearly 30 girls from Perth WA. My friend and I had a 4 night stay in a twin room. We booked online. We loved the Grand Plaza Park. The hotel was lovely and well kept. Our rooms were very clean with very good facilities. The location was perfect. Close to everywhere via the MRT. It had a nice pool and a great gymnasium. We ate out so we cannot comment on the hotel food. We would definately stay at GPP again. The staff were very polite and check in easy.</p></li>

We were also given complementary breakfast as we were staying for >3 nights. Overall the hotel was great - a good buffet breakfast and helpful staff.

It is very central to shopping, restaurants etc. The staff were particularly pleasant and could not do enough for us. The room was very large and well stocked. We somehow managed to join into the wedding party for the nightclub singer who was leaving to live in England and had a great night dancing, drinking and eating! I went to Singapore not expecting very much but came away very impressed with everything about the city and intend to go back again in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Never had we before booked a room with this Park Hotel Group, but the Chinese New Year limited leftover choices for our late booking drove us to this option. But we had the luck of the dragon and got a really nice newly renovated room allocated by very friendly front desk staff. The location is very central with everything around you at your doorstep. We especially enjoyed the rather small looking pool, which had two hidden treasures in the very green and lush views towards Canning Fort Hill and secondly a hidden and green outdoor Jacuzzi.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What you can expect from a 4 star hotel, basic, nothing more. Breakfast is quite average in terms of quality of the food and of variety.

Mostly asian customers. very noisy, people going up and down in elevators all the time. Location is fine, you can walk both to Orchard Road and the river or you can get the subway to go anywhere. all in all you can probably get better value for a few extra euros staying at a 5 star hotel like the Intercon.</p></li>

The hotel is located right in the commercial district of Singapore. A drive of under 2 SGD to Clarke Quay makes this location an amazing one. I was able to reach the hotel after shopping at Mustafa Centre in the middle of the night(3 am) with under 10 SGD. Such was the location. Well appointed rooms but room service can be better.

Of particular mention would be the Concierge team who provided terrific assistance through advice, suggestions and support whenever we placed a request to them.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent 3 nights here on the way home to Australia from a European holiday. I chose the hotel largely on the basis of TripAdvisor reviews and because it is right in the middle of the city, close to train & bus routes, shops (mid-level & high-level) and cafes & food outlets- I was not disappointed. The front-of-house facilities & service were excellent, the cafe meals & breakfasts good and the room good. The gym & pool were excellent, better than most 3-4 star & some 5 star hotels I've stayed at. My only complaint is that housekeeping response to a request was slow, but the quality of their work was good.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was a welcoming sight after our long flight from London. We were given a very warm welcome from Leonard, the Customer Services Manager who was fantastic throughout our stay. We were very pleased with our room on the executive level and enjoyed the amazing buffet breakfast. The hotel was very spacious and decorated with lovely xmas decorations and all the staff were very polite and helpful. The hotel is in a good location, near a train station and taxis are available outside the door and don't cost much to get anywhere. Would definitely stay here again and we thoroughly enjoyed our first time in Singapore.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Right from the time I stepped out of the cab in front of the hotel the staff, were amazingly helpful, I was fortunate to be staying as part of the Crystal Club and I’m not sure it's an extra part of the service but the staff especially Janette & Tiffany were amazing. The hotel is a little older than some in Singapore but it's not dated and old, the rooms are what you get in any hotel of this caliba, but extremely comfortable and roomy enough for me while on business. I would certainly recommend the Grand City Hall Hotel to anybody coming to stay in Singapore and I will be doing just that on my next visit. Regards, Kevin Todd</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at Grand Plaza Hotel, Singapore for 3 nights. Good location and very clean room. Receptionist was excellant. Arrived at 7 am after a long flight and it was pouring rain outside. It was understandable that I needed to wait for someone to checked out before I can have the room so I waited about 40 mins. I had a good rest before I started my day fresh. The room is a bit small good enough for 2 people and the set back is the swimming pool and gym is another block away. It would be nice to use the facilities. The housekeeping staff were warm too. Plus side the MRT is 5 mins away and plenty of eateries. Would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was a great place to stay. Excellent customer service, very helpful and polite front office with ever welcoming staff with a smile. I would recommend this hotel for people staying there with family as it's very central for shopping, restaurants, and public transport. It has a good in-house restaurant and bar, swimming pool, spa and gym. You don't need to organize your trip in Singapore, as their friendly staff will take time to make sure you know what you need to do while you there in Singapore. I would definitely recommend this Hotel to everyone I know, as I had a good experience and one that we'll remember for years to come.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Best point about this hotel was its prime location. The service was very good.Only there was no complementary water (in Singapore tap water is portable, but for a water fearing Indian, i still prefer bottled water) An excellent spread for the morning Buffet. Very close to the prime shopping locations and wide range of multi cuisine restaurants(Decent number of vegetarian restaurants with McD, KFC, SUBWAY thrown in at Furan Mall). Boogey Street which is next metro stop is an excellent shopping for cheap street stuff. Its close to Jasina (a perfume addict paradise) and Furan Mall (a Techie Paradise, entire Mall dedicated to Electronics ).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked based on a discounted rate available and TripAdvisor reviews. Rooms alright, although the age is showing. The usual smell associated with hotels in humid climate countries. Location very central, a 5-10 minute walk to the Esplanade and Raffles city. Two malls directly adjacent. Service was good, housekeeping prompt. Concierge could use some improvement, cannot be relied on with calling taxis which are rather difficult to get in Singapore. I was late for a meeting despite ordering a taxi the previous day and giving the destination address (no traffic jams). Was a good deal because of the discount, not sure if the usual rates make it worthwhile</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here on a two night stop over. The hotel is well located. The MRT is only a couple of blocks away and the restaurants of Boat Quay and Clarke Quay are within easy walking distance. The service in the hotel was generally very friendly and helpful and nothing seemed to be too much trouble for the reception staff. On the negative side, judging by our room, the bedrooms are in need of a fair amount of upgrading and refurbishment. There were signs of wear and slight grubbiness in several places in our room, the basin was a mosaic of cracks and the stopper was ineffective. Such a pity that the good service provided by the staff should be let down by the tiredness of the room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 8 days , this being our first time to Singapore. After reading all reviews on this hotel we made the decision to stay here with the Crystal Club package. From club check-in on the 10th floor we were made to feel like family. Tiffany and all club staff were fantastic. Our room was cosy but there was three of us. The location of this hotel is perfect. The MRT is a 5 min walk away, but if you like walking as I do you can walk to China town one way and Orchard Road the other. I ventured out at night and felt safe. Clarke Quay was the best for all food styles and night clubs. So many open air bars too choose from. Yes will return to both Singapore and Grand Park City Hall.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Hotel for three wonderful nights and enjoyed every minute of it. We availed of the hotel's weekend promo and was even upgraded to a de luxe room. The hotel is currently undergoing renovation though disturbance is kept to the minimum. Food was excellent and we love their breakfast. The staff were great and provided us with much help when needed. We also love the location its less than 5 mins away from the sub-way station and nearest shopping area. You can also walk to nearby tourist spot like the Singapore flyer, Esplanade and Merlion park. Will definitely stay here again. Though this hotel is not for the budget conscious, but you'll get your money's worth once you try it.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel surprised us. We arrived on our first overnight stay at 8 in the morning. Our room was ready. We had to leave on our second stay at 8 in the evening and they let us stay in our room until 6 in the evening. The staff were constantly helpful and keen to be friendly. With the Stopover package from Singapore Airlines the buffet in the restaurant was half price and superb value for under £10. Breakfast was similar excellent value. The rooms are rather dull,city centre, business-orientated and could do with a comfortable chair or two!! Nevertheless the hotel's central location, superb public rooms meant that we felt we had excellent value for under £60 a night. Strongly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent 10 nights at this wonderful hotel and it surpassed all expectations . Had seen some reviews here which were a mixture of opinions so not sure what it would be like. We arrived very early in the morning so did not expect to have a room straight away . However we were able to get into our room by midday which was absolute bliss after a 14hr flight from the UK. The room was spacious and spotlessly clean as was the rest of the place. Extremely luxurious given the price . Breakfast from the buffet ranged from traditional English to local specialities with plenty to choose from . We were very well looked after by very attentive and friendly staff. All in all I can highly recommend the Grand Plaza on Coleman street</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is well located near the MRT, shops and some food halls. We arrived late in the evening. Check-in was speedy, receptionist was friendly and funny at the time of night we arrived. The concierge staff was also friendly and helpful. The hotel is clean, has a great restaurant the nightly singers were enjoyable to hear. Depending on how much space you need, my mother and I shared a deluxe twin room which had 2 x king single beds, massive bathroom and flat screen tv and enough amenities for us to use. I wouldn't complain about the room size or what it offered. I didn't see the superior room, and given that Singapore accommodation is generally more expensive than the other south east asian countries, the deluxe room was worth the price paid.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose this hotel as it was advertised to have free wifi - and found out only upon check-in that wifi is available only in the lobby and other common areas. When I complained about this and asked for a wireless router, they sent one to my room within 5 minutes. They also helped to set it up and did everything with a smile. Other than this, I found the hotel to be getting old and tired. While the room was clean, the age was starting to show through. The thing it has going for it is it's location. A couple hundred metres from the metro station, it convenient enough get to most places within Singapore. For the price, it's sufficiently worth the money but given the number of choices for hotels in Singapore, I'd have to think hard if I'd stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel recently with my mother on a two day stopover. We love Singapore because it is so clean, friendly and safe for women travellers. This hotel was on the Singapore Airlines stopover list and although I have been to Singapore on five previous occassions I had never stayed at this hotel before as I usually stay on or near Orchard Road. I was impressed with the staff who were very helpful and polite, we arrived about 8.30am and they gave us our twin room straight away which was wonderful as we had flown overnight and were desperate for a rest. The room was clean, quiet and with comfortable beds. The location was good as the SIA Hop on Bus stop was close by so we used that as well as taxis to get around the city. I would stay at this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved our stay at the Grand Plaza Park Hotel. We were on a stopover of 2 nights each way to and from New Zealand. On our first stopover we booked a Club Room (floor 9) and were so impressed we upgraded for our return visit and we were given a room on floor 10 which was even better. After a tiring day of sightseeing etc it was lovely to be able to relax around the pool area. I have never been in a hot pool that was so hot! Staff were very friendly and efficient. Could not fault the hotel at all. The location was spot on. Easy to walk to the Boat Quay and Clarks Quay. Walked to Chinatown, but due to the heat we had to get a taxi back! Close to all other areas and the MRT is just round the corner, which is clean, efficient and cheap. Loved Singapore and will definately be back.</p></li>

Service at the hotel was friendly and our room was ready even though we arrived quite early in the morning. We were also asked if we would like a late checkout and given a free upgrade to a Clubroom. The room however feels and looks like any standard room despite the upgrade. It was clean and the king size bed was quite comfortable. The shower basin was however slightly stained, old and probably needed replacing. Breakfast was good with lots of variety. The hotel itself is conveniently located next to Funan Digital Centre where you can find floors and floors of computers and electrical equipments. Orchard Rd is not too far away. Overall the price is quite reasonable for an expensive city like Singapore.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just spent 4 nights at Grand Park City Hall and had a wonderfull time. The rooms were spacious, clean and the staff were very helpfull and friendly. The buffet breakfast was spectacular and even though the hotel was very busy, there was no shortage of food or seating. This hotel is in a very good location, being close to MRT, shopping malls and Clark Quay where there are some amazing restaurants. If you are travelling Singapore Airlines make sure you keep your boarding pass as this will offer discounts on the hop on hop off bus run by Singapore Airlines & also the Singapore Flyer, Zoo and many other attractions. Our check out time at the hotel was mid day and our flight did not leave until midnight but they offered us a room to freshen up before we were picked up for the airport.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Singapore was our final stop of our honeymoon. Our travel agent had secured a room upgrade with flowers and fruit on arrival. However, when we were greeted by the unfriendly receptionist, there was no mention of our honeymoon offers. Having stayed at the Traders Hotel in Kuala Lumpur and experiencing excellent service, it highlighted how poor The Grand Park City Hall was. Breakfast was poorly organised with miserable and unhelpful staff. The room was very small as mentioned on previous reviews. There was no free internet access or wireless connection. On the positives - the location is great for the MRT which is a highly efficient and cheap way of getting around Singapore. The concierge were helpful (the only people in the building it seems!) We would not recommend for a romantic getaway.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for 4 nights on business January '08. At an average price per night of Sing $ 230, service and tax inclusive, this is excellent value. Perfectly located for business or pleasure, it offers great facilities, even if the rooms are smaller than previously experienced in comparable Singapore hotels. Rooms, however, very clean and bathroom huge in relation to the room, with both bath tub and walk in shower. Importantly (for me) in room iron provided as standard alongside the fully expected minibar, multichannel TV and high speed internet (fee liable but works!). Staff helpful and knowledgable, bars and restaurants good, although in Singapore, why stay in the hotel? A short walk to Clarke and Boat Quays gives a wonderful spectrum of eating and drinking opportunities. Would not hesitate to use again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel for a stopover after reading tripadvisor reviews. We couldn't have been happier. Every staff member has been so helpful and friendly and effiicient - without being over the top. Nothing is too much trouble. We arrived at 5 am hoping for an early check in - the manager said as soon as housekeeping arrived they would get a room ready. We had breakfast while waiting and by 7 am we were in our room. A corner room with great view and huge bathroom. They even gave us a rollaway bed for our son even though we were expecting to share the king bed with him. Later we found out this was a deluxe room even though we had only booked a superior. The pool area is gorgeous - hardly anyone seemed to use it though. Absoutely spotless everywhere. Lot's of shops close by. We have rebooked for our stopover on the way home.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in a Crystal Club room, well worth the extra $ as you are free to enjoy continental breakfast and cocktails daily, which is something to look forward too. The location is great, around the corner from the City Hall MRT (with great links to Orchard Road & Little India) and a short stroll to China Town. The room was a generous size and nicely furnished, however the bathroom was a little small with no power points. The staff were all AMAZING, so friendly, attentive and ready to go out of their way to help, particularly Jeannnie, and Joey and the others from the Crystal Club. The staff alone make this hotel a place I would love to come back to any time I stay in Singapore. A 5 star experience and one that I would easily recommend to anyone. Also, the foyer smells amazing, very welcoming after stepping in from Singapore's humid streets.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently travelled to Singapore and ended up to the Grand Hall City Park as booking late on a busy weekend, the rest was either sold out or too expensive. I had a corporate rate, and must say it was good value for money, given the quite central location. The service was good and the hotel staff very friendly. On the negative side, the hotel is a bit outdated and lacking style. I got a room close to the elevator, which turned out to be very noisy, and got waken up in the middle of the night by people spekaing loud (isolation is really bad, and that is the main reason why i would not recommend this hotel). Also breakfast was disappointing with very limited choices and no fresh fruit apart from apples and bananas. There is a pool, which is ok, but very very small. Perhaps a better room would make me change my opinion, but still it was lacking style and personality.</p></li>

Suggest that you opt for staying at the Club Floor where you have the option of using the Club Lounge. The staff at the Club Lounge are excellent in service delivery and very helpful. There are fairly good eateries and shopping mall closely by. Also, for Night life there is Chimes and Boat and Clark Quay. Raffles Hotel is about a ten minute walk away and a delight to visit.

My wife and I stayed here for 4 nights on a stop over to Australia and thought this Hotel was fantastic. The rooms, restaurant, reception and pool area, were excellent; but above all the staff were friendly, helpful and very professional. If possible have the breakfast included when booking as this will set you up for either a days site-seeing or shopping, depending on your preference. Singapore can best be described as a Botanical Garden where people live and work. The whole island is spotlessly clean and perfectly safe of a night. The hotel is located very close to the river where restaurants are bars are not in short supply. We liked this Hotel and as our daughter now lives in Australia I am sure we will be making this our stop over destination again, hopefully very soon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The title says it all - this is a good quality city hotel in a superb central location, walking distance to everywhere and much more convenient for sightseeing than being stuck out on Orchard Road or the Marina. It is near an MRT station for easy access, very near to Raffles hotel and to Clarke and Boat Quays for alfresco eating. Walking distance to Chinatown as well. The room itself was modern and clean, if a bit small (especially the bathroom) and with no view. The hotel itself is comparatively small compared to some in Singapore! We upgraded to a club room and felt on balance it was worth it (child-free floor, breakfast and free drinks between certain times). The hotel is geared up for business travellers and is being upgraded all the time. We would happily return next time we are in Singapore - Singapore itself is an incredible place for food! We have never seen so many restaurants in one place!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If it was not for the fact I love Singapore I would seriously consider not returning, so bad was our experience at the Grand Park City Hall Hotel. The fiasco that was our stay ranged from thread-bare, fraying bath towels to leaking vanity sinks (and I am talking the Niagara Falls of leaks) to bug infestations. Perhaps if our concerns had been handled with more aplomb and (something resembling) remorse my review would be a very different one, however this was not the case. Repairs were inconvenient and slow to occur and we were forced to change rooms on our last night amid assurances that the bugs infesting our room were not "very dangerous"! At no time was there any suggestions of complimentary services to make up for the disruptions or even a "sorry for the inconvenience". I have stayed at numerous Singaporean Hotels in the past and had hoped that my stay at the Grand Park would follow the trend of wonderful service and amenities, I was singularly disappointed.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Location - Decent Food - Tired Rooms”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel provides an ideal base for anyone who needs to get to Suntec every day, but doesn't want to pay the premium to stay somewhere like the Mandarin. Walkable to the exhibition centre throught the air conditioned mall, and set amongst the traditional architecture of City Hall. The hotel itself is decent enough. The lobby looks suitably impressive (as it should in a £120+ hotel), but the rooms are a little tired and are starting to border on 'shabby'. Staff are helpful and friendly (as they invariably always are in Singapore). I was sent to the 'Club Floor' when I arrived, where they managed to convince me to part with an extra £25 per night to have free internet, breakfast, laundry and pre-dinner drinks... Turns out it was a really good thing, but it was still a bit of a hard sell which you could do without after 16 hours of travelling. All in all a great hotel for business, but I probably wouldn't stay here with my family (although that choice would come down to location rather than any other factor).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located very centrally the Grand Park is well located near many major sights including Parliament building and the excellent Clarke Quay. From the moment you arrive there is an instantly welcoming feeling from the front of house staff and a modern, clean cut lobby. Stemming off are the bar with great entertainment each evening and the restaurant with a particularly good breakfast buffet! We were located in Club where the rooms were very well sized and modernly appointed. The views from most rooms seemed good and even mine on the supposed 'back side' was pleasant with a good view of the city. The fitness centre was well stocked with a good selection of modern equipment, while the pool was one of the real highlights. A nice oasis in the city with sharply designed pool and smart terraced area to while away a few hours! The most significant factor of our stay was however the excellent customer service received from all staff. The management team are particularly approachable and instill a very good attitude throughout their staff.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Club rate not the best for business travellers”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked the Club rate for the Grand Plaza which provides dedicated rooms and services for business travellers. The advantages are free internet, use of dedicated club lounge, free breakfast, free cocktail hour, free 2 piece laundry per day, and personalised check-in service. The club staff are very helpful and friendly. The main disadvantages were: 1) the size of the room - a twin share is too small for colleagues to share. The only desk in the room is less than one foot from the end of the bed, which means either sitting on the bed to work, or sitting off to the side! It's hard to imagine how this could be presented as a workspace for business travellers. 2) Breakfast - the breakfast offering (in private club room) was appalling - barely warm eggs and bacon in a warming tray, cereal, sweaty cheese. 3) Internet access - free but slow and unreliable. I wouldn't recommend the club rate for people who intend to work in their rooms while on a business trip. The hotel would be a great option, however, for tourists because of its location.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I flew out to meet my teenage daughter who was arriving from Cairns, we wanted a centrally located hotel which didn't cost the earth and this hotel certainly fitted the bill. We caught the MRT to City Hall and the hotel was just around the corner, easy even with luggage! The room was fine twin beds, mini bar with fridge space for our own drinks! I have to say the only criticism was that the shower was never really piping hot. There is a swimming pool and well equipped gym on the third floor, very relaxing in the late afternoon. A nice touch is that you check out at noon, the hotel store your luggage and you can use the gym shower to freshen up before your evening flight. Raffles City Shopping Centre is two minutes away, there are several mini markets close by and the Quays are within easy walking distance, quicker than taking a taxi! We paid £95 per night for the room including tax and service, which seemed good value to us by Singapore standards. Never used the restaurant or bar so can't comment. Staff very friendly and helpful. Would certainly stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have been to Singapore many many times and have always stayed at the Phoenix Hotel that was located on Orchard. It was torn down about three/four years ago and was my little gem in Singapore until this last holiday. I have found another gem and it is the Grand Park City Hall Hotel. I stayed there for 4 days and nights on the club floor. The staff was wonderful and all of my needs were met especially by the men working the concierge desk and the head concierge, Mr. Sadi Sariman. I want to express a big thanks and appreciation to this wonderful man, for going that extra step in taking care of mailing three parcels back to my homes in the US. All arrive safely. To Sadi! The head Concierge, thanks for everything in getting my packages back to me in the US. I look forward to seeing you and the wonderful staff at your great hotel in the future. I also would love to add that to anyone looking for a gem in Singapore, The Grand Park City Hall Hotel is ideal. Singapore is a costly/pricey city but I found the hotel great for value over the more pricier places such as Fullerton House or Raffles. Mr. Topps</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Generally I liked this hotel. The Staff especially the waitresses were friendly and fun and the reception staff were always so polite and helpful. The English breakfasts are very good and varied. The prices were not the cheapest but then apart from electrical goods nothing is cheap in Singapore. The rooms were OK, although unfortunately the bathroom in my room suffered from a slight drain problem and occasionally stunk of urine. We were only there for three nights so by the time we had figured out what the problem was it was not worth moving rooms, although it was offered. Our friends next door had no such problem. This hotel is well located for the river for shopping and for raffles hotel and is close to the MRT and bus routes. Orchard Road shopping is only a short taxi drive away but then being a small island everywhere is only a short ride away. Singapore it's self is well worth a stop over visit. It is such a clean, tidy and civilised place that that puts most other International cities to shame. They even drive on the right side of the road, the left. Take time out to visit the Orchid gardens</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is my first holiday with my children to spore. After choosing so many hotels (many were fully booked) we finally decided to stay 4 nites in the park city hotel and 5 nites in copthorne's king hotel. It was great from the beginning we checked in, we got an upgrade to a deluxe room, the people were really friendly and helpful. The concierge were very helpful in assissting us on how to go to the tourist attraction as we always travelled by mrt or buses. They search the internet to find out the time or even called the place to make sure that they are opened (some are closed during xmas). We thank you so much to Mahendran, one of the concierge who always helped us to give direction. However, one thing I regret is the housekeeping not doing such a good job. They never washed our glasses or cups in our room until I complaint the third nite we were there. The table was dusty (wasn't there anyone stay there before us?) and never been cleaned up. To keep up your overall performance, please give some more training for them. I guess everyone agrees that we want to stay in the clean and healthy enviroment and don't want to get sick by using the glasses with germs(after a few days) in our holiday, right?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Like so many previous reviews, my stay at the Grand Park City Hall was lovely. I arrived around midnight after a long and delayed flight for a 24 hour stopover on my way to Europe. The staff at the desk were expecting me and had my booking details at hand almost as soon as I walked in the door. Within a minute, I had my room pass, and my bags were taken up. The 'bell-hop' showed me through the room and explained how to use the air con., phone, alarm etc. The room was spacious with a king bed - though I only booked a single. A huge bathroom with a big shower as well as a separate bath tub. Lots of green marble, plenty towels, with shampoo and lotions, there was nothing more I could need. Like others mentioned, I had a very late flight out. I recieved a 4pm complimentary checkout, had my bags stored until I returned after dinner, and then access to a room to shower and freshen up before my next long flight... Honestly, you need it after a hot, sultry, humid day in Singapore! Lastly, the location was fantastic. 500 metres to City Hall MRT, lots of places to eat and shop very close by, and a 5 min walk to Clarke Quay. I'm not a fussy traveller, but Grand Park City Hall really impressed me. Thank you!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed for a week at their exclusive Crystal Club Floor. Room was spacious with all modern amenities and facilities. Club wing had a free internet with a decent speed. I could make VoIP calls. Check-in was smooth and was done exclusively at the Club floor. Room service was good but with very limited options, laundry service was average. Bathroom and bath accessories were average, expected them to be a little better especially in premium rooms. Hotel main lobby was really grand and had a shopping arcade. The best part of the hotel though was its location. Located right in the heart of main business and shopping district. It was a walking distance from Raffles, several other malls and Esplanade area. Taxis were also readily available from right outside the hotel almost all 24 hours and hotel is a stone's through from the City Hall MRT station. Had regular meals at Indulge At Park during lunch buffet, the spread was good and had variety and selections from various cuisines. Breakfast served at Crystal Floor although gives an exclusive feel but has a repetitive menu but a good lounge area and premium condiments. Hotel also serves free drinks/canapes in the evening and snacks/tea/coffee all day long in the Crystal Club.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel for well over 15 days in the month of July. Its location on 10 Coleman street was very ideal for me as it was close to my workplace, literally just a 10 min walk. There are restaurants for various cuisines around, the restaurant in the hotel itself is multi cuisine and they had live music which was just the thing i needed after a long day at work to relax and get geared up for the next day. There are three bus stands near by, which was really helpful for my commute to various places. there is a mall right opposite and behind the hotel catering to one's needs with respect to apparels, electronics, cameras and accessories etc. It is kind of a landmark as all the people at work as well as my friends there knew where this was so it was easy for them to drop by. I came to the room one day and saw a fruit basket on the table with a note expressing there gratitude that I chose to stay at their hotel, this was really lovely, the staff as such are very helpful and some of them are multi lingual which is an added advantage. Overall a wonderful place to stay for a Business traveler, again I say for a Business traveler as it would otherwise been a hit on my pocket as I am a middle of the road kind of a traveler.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed our stay (22/01/08-27/01/08) with Grand Plaza Park Hotel City Hall (Singapore) very much. First, we would say that the service from the staff is exemplary. Without fail, everybody greeted us friendlily at every occasion and quickly assisted us where ever possible. The positive and relaxed feel that radiated from all the staff was really amazing which is a true asset to the hotel. The quality of all facilities (the pool, lobby and breakfast service) easily met and exceeded all expectations and the rooms and appliances were surely adequate. Transportation was made very easy through a constant stream of taxis always present and the central location and the MRT only 1 block away made getting around Singapore very easy. The Grand Plaza Park Hotel City Hall (Singapore) set itself an exceedingly high standard that others in the industry can only aspire to, which made our stay very good value for money indeed. As we expect to be travel to Singapore more often in the near future, we will most certainly stay with them again (we've stayed with Copthorn Orchid and Waterfront before .... they simply don't compare .... different league all together) and we have no hesitation to recommend Grand Plaza Park Hotel City Hall to family, friends and colleagues.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights and we really enjoyed our stay. Firstly, the location of this hotel is fantastic. You can easily walk to Clarke Quay and Bugis Junction and even China Town, Little India and Kampong Glam are close enough to walk to if you don't mind breaking a sweat :). Furthermore, the City Hall MRT station is right around the corner and two lines run through this station, so it is really convenient. Secondly, the breakfast buffet was amazing. We were lucky enough to get a deal through wotif.com that included breakfast and it was really worth it. There was so much to choose from, it was delicious. Thirdly, the staff were very helpful - particular thanks goes to the concierges who booked a restaurant table with a view for us and a trip to the zoo for breakfast with the orangutans (recommended!) but all staff throughout the hotel were very friendly. Lastly, the rooms were nice. The bathroom had a big bath in it and there was plenty of room. The only negatives that we experienced were that sometimes the tv reception was bad (not that we had much time to watch tv anyway) and that twice the water in the shower was only warm, not hot, although this was only a problem for me, not my partner. Overall we had a great stay and would go back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Grand Park , City Hall has only one advantage , you get Indian Food around , if you are Indian . Else trust me even the Conceirge service is very Poor . I really do not know early check in was not allowed . Any how flight from Delhi - Singapore reaches at 8 :00 am so it was first very tough.

It was worst if you go in before 2 :00 PM to them , they would simply not entertain Staff very RUDE , atleast the Concierge Guy . They have this small candle being lit and suddenly it got fire . I was sitting nearby and this guy instead of asking if everything ok , asked me 'Did you do anything' I said , do you think I would have done it and this is the way you speak your customer. He said 'its better to ask' Sick . Atlast finally I got a room at 12:45 PM , and that was not my choice , but whatever available with them Pathetic its not 4 star at all . No Cofee maker , No Morning tea , and I do not know if the Breakfast was included at all, She did not even informed anything about the package .

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 6 nights during May in a deluxe room. It was an excellent choice. Whilst the rooms are not as luxurious as the public areas, they were more than adequate and comfortable. The location was perfect for all the activities we planned. Easily central for walking to many tourist and shopping sites. We found the nearby Raffles City Mall one of the best and had no trouble finding plenty of eating places around, especially at Clarke Quay. When we tired of walking we used the MRT with no problems and the station was literally just around the corner. The MRT was so clean and efficient it was a pleasure to use. The concierge was always cheerful, helpful and arranged several tours for us. The cleaning staff were thorough and the toiletries plentful.. We did not eat at the hotel breakfast buffet, but found a small "BreadTalk" nearby where we had a "Rise and Shine" breakfast (inc. orangeJuice) for $2.20, extremely good value for those who don't do justice to a hotel breakfast. We did eat in the Coleman Cafe downstairs one night when we were lateback after the Night Safari excursion, the meal was not more that barely adequate, warm greasy and tasteless. But it was late and the Malls had closed early. If you can book this hotel at a discounted rate, then it is good value indeed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel staff is WONDERFUL, from receptionists to cleaners !!! So helpful and friendly. My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 6 weeks for business and vacation. Staff members provided us with loads and loads of useful information such as history, celebrations, food, directions, etc. They are very attentive, pleasant, all smiles and eager to help. We particularly enjoyed the Network Open House held every fortnight or so that we had been invited to and had a chance to mingle to staff members and other guests. The location is smack in the middle of town and practically surrounded by museums, churches and activities. We watched wonderful fireworks on Independence Day from down the street 1 min from the hotel! It is also within walking distance to a few MRT stations and very convenient. The hotel is also practically next door to the Burmese food court with authentic Burmese food. Since we have not been to Burma (Myanmar) and have no plans to go in foreseeable future, so we really felt fortunate to be able to try authentic Myanmar food and chat with the people. I have stayed in many hotels throughout the world. Grand Park City Hall is by far with the best service I've ever experienced! To Melinda, CT and Bernard--you are the best and thank you for making our stay like home away from home and special! B&D</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently I was delighted to have stayed at the Grand Park City Hall for a three week business trip in Singapore. The hotel was by far the most outstanding hotel I've ever stayed in so far. This is ultimately due to the unmatchable level of service and courtesy which all of the hotel staff, especially the front office and the concierge staff, provided to me during my stay, Every day and every night I was pleasantly greeted and assisted with all of my business and leisure needs and all of the staff made me feel like family and very welcome in a new country. I cannot be more appreciative of the staff at the hotel. The hotel also was superbly decorated and elegant from the hotel entrance, to the leisure facilities and of course inside the hotel rooms. The hotel room was extremely comfortable and spacious and serviced on a regular basis and the fitness centre and pool were all very well maintained. The hotel also was wonderful in looking after corporate guests by providing a lovely cocktail party every second Wednesday for guests to meet the managers and to get to know other hotel guests. It was a lovely gesture indeed. I would highly recommend the hotel to any business or leisure traveller and will be honoured to return to the hotel in future. Thank you to all the staff at Grand Park City Hall. By Monique Jeremiah</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed two nights at this hotel prior to and after a cruise originating in Singapore. We chose the hotel based on reviews from TripAdvisor travellers and after reviewing comments on the original hotel selected by our travel agent. Upon our arrival at the hotel, we were surprised to learn that it was the same one we stayed in 7 years ago, albeit with a somewhat different name. The front office staff were both welcoming and professional - they also upgraded us to a Club floor! The room was large and well-appointed with a mini-bar fridge and coffee/tea-making facilities. It was also non-smoking and contained the queen-sized bed requested by our travel agent.. The hotel is clean and well-maintained and beautifully appointed throughout all of its public rooms. Staff at all levels were friendly and efficient, especially the concierge and front desks. Our booking also included an American breakfast which did not disappoint and which contained both Asian and Western fare. We used the lovely outdoors roof-top pool which is surrounded by lush shrubbery and fountains. The hotel's location and Coleman Street is ideal for walking tours of Singapore and is only 10 minutes walk from Clarke Quay. A good choice of hotel at a reasonable rate and it will be, once again, our home-from-home on our next visit to exciting Singapore.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For our stay in Singapore we stayed at Grand plaza Park, we found it very central there are four shopping centers within 5mins walk and MRT is a 2 min walk.Our hotel room took about 25 mins before it was ready but they gave us a free drink while we waited, we stayed on the 9th floor with an ok view. Our room was clean small but enough room bathroom was quite nice, there were around 12 channels we only watched the movie channel and the australian channel as the rest were not in english lol. The pool was ok at night look alot better with the lights, spa was big for a spa and the fitness center was very good my partener approved. We had the breakfast included in our package and there is soooo much food lots of different things like noodles and lots of choices of fruit,cheese and drink. I think it cost aound $30, there bar is quite fancy no thongs or singlets and quite $$$ better to go down the road to chimes they have happy hour on all drinks at 3pm - 9pm. They have a spa there if you want to get pampered but you pay a high price $$$, they also have a koi fish pond nice to watch. The service was very very good they are there to serve you ask them anything, we even tipped we were so happy with how helpful they were. Overall this hotel is good hotel but a bit $$$ with food and drink but there are plenty of cheaper places around.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the river and price. I cant walk large distances at present and it is also close to the MRT. When we checked in we were told they'd upgraded us to a Deluxe Poolview room but on inspection it was very "average" and not very big. The Pool 'view' was tucked away in the corner so you couldnt see it anyway. We then changed rooms to a corner one as it was bigger which was better but still not what I'd classify as a 4-5* hotel. We tried to get upgraded to a Crystal Club room buit no luck. Our package included B/F and this was indeed a fabulous spread catering for all tastes.Bed was comfortable but shower recess dirty with soap scum and only 1 bar of soap left for sink and shower. Carpets were filthy too. No free internet or wi-fi here. No free water here either as they said tap water was 'potable'. Some of the Concierges were extremely helpful, others were not. There are local eateries round the corner which were cheap and quite safe to eat at as well as a small supermkt and a McDonalds which had free wi-fi as do most coffee outlest in S'pore. Handy to walk to MRT and 10 mins walk from Clarke Quay. Regarding recommending it - do your homework and see if there's anything better for the price as there are loads of hotels in this area. They also had a Spa attached but prices were extremely high.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was my second time staying at this hotel after years back for the 1st one. I like the location of this hotel in the area of city hall and near to the Raffles City. Very convenient as well to walk to reach Clark Quay in the evening. And other interests in the surroundings are peranakan museum, bible house, Armenian Church and others which located in the green neighbourhood. The check in was smooth, with good acceptance from the front desk staff and my reservation was upgraded to be on the club floor. The room was clean but quite modest for a club floor room; seems to be in deluxe category, but I had no problem since the room and bathroom were clean. The furniture looked bit run down but overall still tolerable. The breakfast quite okay, with lots of varieties of bfast dishes. Pity they dont provide the crispy bacon again as they used to.But seem the staff in the coffee shop too busy and no smile or welcome greet addressed to us. Seems so Jaded, well very Singaporean, simple, easy and straight to the point D. This also seems to happen to the staff at the lobby except one lady that greeted us on the last day when we were rushing getting into the Chrysler taxi, she was very nice and cheerful (forgot the name). So overall, this hotel provides good service and accommodation; the improvement shall be done soon to the interior of the room and staff attitude to be more servicing. Hope to stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel on the strength of its picture and website and the fact that it had a stay 4 pay 3 deal. We booked a delux room and we were not disappointed ! It is a lovely old building in great condition. I loved all the marble in the foyer and its modern indoor-outdoor lobby area. Our room was a twin and, to our dismay, was a connecting room. However, the view was nice, the a/c was very effective and the lighting facilities good. The bathroom had separate shower and bath facilities, so that we could both shower/bath at the same time! Cool! The pool on the 3rd floor was not just a token facility, but really lovely, and we made good use of it. The breakfasts catered to all tastes and ethnicities and was much enjoyed. The staff were very pleasant and helpful.Disadvantages: 1. we found the location not handy to anything, so had to find transport to almost everywhere as I had foot problems and couldnt walk far. Cabs were cheap and plentiful tho, and the MRT train system close by and exceptional. 2. I thought the shower tiles ever so slightly grungy . 3. The room's walls not especially sound proof. This was apparent when the room next door hosted a small but highly vocal gathering until late. We eventually called reception who dealt with it immediately and effectively. 4. Internet access was very difficult. All in all we had a very relaxed and happy stay at the GPCH and would consider booking again if in Singapore.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On our arrival, a very courteous porter took our bags from the taxi and showed us to reception. At reception, I asked about the possibility of a late check out and internet access. The receptionist suggested that we upgrade to CLUB Room for an additional $60 per night. It was definitely worthwhile, We were given a 16.00 check out, unlimited internet access, breakfast in the club room as well as an free open bar and lovely snacks from 17.30 - 19.30 each night, and 2 free laundry items each day. All the staff was very friendly but in particular the three staff in the Club Room were brilliant. On our last day we went to the Club Room for a coffee at 3pm with the intention of then going to reception to check out at 4pm and wait in the foyer until 6pm for our taxi to the airport. John, the Club Room Attendant said that there was no need to do that. He would arrange the check out for us from the club room whilst we had our coffee. He then invited us to stay in the club room until our Taxi arrived and to partake in the food and Bar. He also arranged for our suitcases to be taken down to the foyer for the concierge to look after. The whole experience was very memorable. As other reviewers have noted, location is great, 5 minutes from MRT , Raffles City Shopping and Clarke Quay. The MRT is very easy to use and the trains are air conditioned. Our room on the 10th floor was large and very comfortable. Thoroughly recommend this Hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When we arrived at this hotel, the lobby was very impressive. Once we got into the room, it was an utter disappointment. The room smelled really bad! We reserved a superior room since all hotels in Singapore are very expensive, and this was the best price we managed to find. But, it was so small that it barefly fit our luggages, and the baby bed which we ordered. Not only that, internet is payable at a ridiculous price of more than S$20 a day (12 euros)! We found that they provided unnecessary toiltetries in the bathroom, so full that we had little space to put our own toiletries there. They could have just reduced all these ridiculous bottles in the bathroom, and charge us with cheaper room price instead with free wifi! In addition, the unnecessary qty of the mini-bar, it was so full, that it took up all the place at the bar. We needed the space to put up our baby's bottles, milk and to do the boiling that we had to move the potato chips & nuts (they're pretty expensive anyway if one consume one of those!) to the cabinet. Singapore in general is charging too expensive for hotels, and we find this a real pity. Most hotels in this country do not provide the key factors needed by travellers, like free wifi, and space for families with children. We are very disappointed at the bad condition of the room in this hotel, and the bad service (the non-chalant attitude of the staff, and keep repeating what you think that might come out of a script!).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visit Singapore about once per year, and this time around I decided to try a different hotel. The Grand Park City Hall in Singapore stood out from the page for its good value and amenities, and great location (I also get a corporate discount at this hotel, but I believe it is still very competetive when compared with other hotels, especially the ones on Orchard Road). I splashed out a little to stay on the Crystal Club Floor, which has its own business lounge that provides cocktails and snacks from 5pm to 7pm (I say snacks, but the array of hot food was actually enough to substitute for dinner), and a varied hot breakfast buffet from 6am to 10am. Add to that the free internet and free two pieces of laundry, and soon the higher price for a club room seems much more reasonable. The hotel's location is very good, sandwiched between Fort Canning Park and the historic Padang. The MRT is just around the corner, and there is a liberal smattering of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. The hotel lobby area is airy and light, with a cafe/bar at the far end, and plenty of reception space for checking in (although Crystal Club guests check in on the 10th floor). I would not call this hotel a bargain by normal standards, but compared to other similar hotels in Singapaore - where the land price and exchange rate combine to significantly elevate hotel prices - the Grand Park City Hall is a good pick. I would definitely stay there again on the next trip.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner selected the hotel thinking the malls will be a step away. We ended up with the Funan mall nearby which specializes in electronic and computer products.. The upside is it is a good 6 to 10 minute walk to the City Hall MRT station. The only downside to walking in Singapore is the humid heat of its weather so be prepared to sweat it out. The hotel is a bit out of sight from the main road and not much taxi drivers know the place (or perhaps i have a problem pronouncing the name of the hote), The location makes it a bit difficult to get a cab or taxi as it is along a main road... so be prepared for a long wait or perhaps call to book a taxi instead. The place is pretty central, it is a walk away to Boat Quay, Clark Quay and Esplanade...also near the raffles shopping centre and Supreme Court building. As to the room we got, it does not come up to my expectations. Walls are rather thin. We can practically hear the other people talking and laughing in the other rooms. I also get awaken by someone opening their rooms (sounds like our room was the one being opened). Room too is rather small with just basic work desk... no couch for day reading. The hotel also forgot to provide us with the basic toiletries expected like disposable shavers, cotton buds, toothbrushes and toothpaste.. Oh and they forgot to provide us with bedroom slippers so had to walk on the cold floor of the bathroom. The hotel has a well equipped gym but their pool is rather small though it is clean. The jacuzzi is also clean.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have been working for the hotel industry for the last 15 years, I saw the rating of this hotel was 5 star, when we get there the reception area looks nice and hotel very central, I thought we will stay for 4 nights there,we arrive 9 am so we had to wait for 5 hours to get a room. At 2pm we got the twin bed room faced to the wall of next door building, the door was broken, the whole room was smell and damp, the bed was so old, sheets and the pillow cases smell like it hasn't been wash, the bathroom ceiling was mouldy, the sink didn't work properly. I couldn't believe that they actually rented this room out, we were so tired and I couldn't be bother complaining at the time. So I checked out the next day, the room cost 310 Singapore Dollar/ night without b/fast, had to pay 56 dollars for 2 b/fast and 12 dollars/hour to used the internet. What make me laugh was that they were doing this promotional for their 50th years anniversary and asking the guests to send their happy photos and good feedback so you could win a trip in one of their hotels around the world. When I check out I've told the receptionist about their room condition, and i heard there were another guest also had complained the same time i was there. We moved to the Fullerton Hotel and took their book two enjoy packaged, luxury hotel, we stay 2 nights in the heritage suite room, great buffet b/fast and free charge of internet during our stay, it cost me 560 Singapore Dollar for it all...fantastic deal! After all we had a great time in Singapore.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 3 nights over Christmas for the second year running and both years have been very happy. We arrived at about 8am and they had managed get us a room available and it was upgraded too. This was about as good as it comes after a 14 hour flight. We looked at other hotels in the area but decided that for the price and knowing the location its is a great choice. It is a reasonably large hotel so the service is not too personal but it is efficient and the small bar is a nice place to end your evening. The breakfast buffet is good and the pool is a nice place to spend a couple of hours when you don't want to be running everywhere. The main thing is the location. You are a couple of minutes walk from City Hall MRT which can take you all over the city including straight up Orchard Road if that is you thing. Alternatively you can walk to Boat Quay/Clark's Quay in about 5 minutes and the Marina Bay area in about 10-15. This year they have free internet which is good. Just something to note that while it is WiFi in the main ground floor it is through a LAN cable in the rooms which is not great for iPhones/iPads but fine for laptops. The rooms are clean and a decent size. We were upgraded to what I think was a club room so not sure about the rest of them. The gym is also well stocked with machines and the spa is lovely. My only slight issue was the blackout blind would not quite close at the join and the air con from the room next door was noisy. These were very minor issues and we did not bother to report them.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I travel often to Singapore for business issue. And had been staying in this hotel for more than three years. From my personal point of view, this hotel is the best hotel in Singapore, because of the personal touch by their staff during my stay. An example,is last September, I need a catch an early morning flight to china. I remember a lady, miss Melinda, arranged the morning cab for me. Their prompt and swift action to arrange the check out make life so easy for me. And the moment, I step out the lift and rushing to the cab, a mr Leonard handed me a bag of morning goodies, mineral water and just steam hot dim sum, bread, cake, tissue, etc. Gosh, I was overwhelmed by their attentive care and thoughts. Briefly, I said thank you and dash to changi airport. After I have boarded all my luggages, I was hungry and thirsty. Thank you very much Leonard for your early morning goody bag. And many many more beautiful moments staying in this hotel. And by the way, do you know that they serve the best Cantonese food. Please look for mr shek. He knows how to prepare each meal for you. Just tell him you are tired, he would prepare good that after consuming, you are revitalized. I think the tonic is his smile, careful thoughts for each evening menu and etc. Thanks, mr shek for the wonderful food. And after, pop into my ever clean and cosy room for my beauty sleep. I strongly recommend this hotel to any traveller. Yup, not forgetting their concierge. Another best concierge service in Singapore. Thanks bob and your team of concierge colleagues. Syabas.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed twice in 2 weeks July 2009 - before and after cruise on Virgo. Wanted a good 4 star that was not an airline tourist hotel and we got it. Lobby etc is very nice and breakfasts v.good. We paid little extra for the superior room and this got us a good rooms on both occaisions. Most rooms are executive/business setup which is what we like. As for anywhere in Asia - make sure you stipulate non-smoking when you book. First room (5th floor, at front) had seperate bath and shower which was very good, second (9th floor, around side) had shower in bath, this bathroom was bit smaller but room itself slightly larger with king size bed. Rooms were quiet and very little external noise. Staff were excellent and the facilities much better than the typical tourist hotels - on a par with most 4-stars in Australia-Asia. There is a Day Spa located in hotel complex and at present hotel guests get good discounts (very enjoyable, and worth having). Internet is available in lobby at S$4/15minutes, else public wireless hubs in general area. In-room access is available but expensive - if you really need it pay extra and get a room in the business floor (10th). The City Hall MRT station is a short walk around corner (200m) and once mastered makes travelling very efficient. Clarke Quay and Raffles City Plaza are only a walk away (500-700m) or indirect via MRT. Orchard Rd is 2 stops on the MRT. The heat/humidity is Singapore - if you do not like it then you should avoid Singapore or book a different noisy hotel right over a mall. Else grab a taxi to anywhere in CBD for S$7-10.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Grand Park City Hall was touted by my holiday operator as a 5-star hotel. Maybe star ratings have undergone depreciation. I'd not rate it more than 3. Location's great. City Hall is pretty much central to the tourist circuit with Bugis, Raffles, the Merlion, the Clarke Quay, the Esplanade, all within a decent distance. The City Hall MRT station is a 2 minute walk, so you could get to anywhere in Singapore and not be lost when you come back to the City Hall station. The Funan IT Mall is also a 2 minute walk. That said, the rooms are amateur-designed. The entrance opens into the bathroom door, which incidentally has no ventilation. So live with the Parfum de Loo while you're here. The washbasin was cracked (the cracks were cement-filled, but the cracks were on glorious display). The potty doesn't have a jet-spray or hand-shower that is critical to everyone who doesn't simply wipe and forget. The minibar did not have many of the items listed on the minibar price list. The cupboard had one door unhinged. Despite knowing that we were a married couple, they gave us separate twin beds and could not shift us to a double-bedded room. Breakfast was nice-ish but not 5-star again. I had to remind them on 3 of the 4 days to refill the bowl of honey for the waffles. Housekeeping was responsive enough, though we have no idea of the room service. For some reason, they never placed the newspaper at my door, despite reminders each day. The stay was comfortable overall, given that we spent most time touring around. But for the USD 174 they charge, I just couldn't see the value for my money. I don't know how this hotel compares to the others in Singapore (we are not talking The Raffles or Swissotel here), so I'd give it a middle-of-the-road rating here.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Shame about the room, restaurant, TV, Internet, and shower”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Grand Park City Hall (GPCH) is well located: within walking distance to Raffles City and other shopping malls, Clarke Quay, as well as to the MRT. The hotel is safe, clean, and the concierge is friendly (more so than those at the reception). The concierge is also more knowledgable about the city than those at the reception. Unlike some reviewers here, I did not experience any musty smell, moulds, stained carpets, or the hotel being stingy with the shower gels. Perhaps the hotel took notice and ratified these problems. That said, I was disappointed by the size of the room. It is a tad cramp. The mini bar area was also cramp. I had to rearrange the cups, kettle, tray, and other utensils so I had enough room to boil water and make my cup of tea! (No complimentary bottled water here) Also cramp is the shower. The shower door opens inwards, so once getting into the shower, you have to squeeze your body out of the way so that you can shut the shower door! Also cramp is the restaurant which serves breakfast. I had to navigate carefully around the serving counter so that I wouldn't bump into tables, chairs, and patrons. In all, I felt a little cramp staying here. The internet rate is cutthroat: SGD28 per day. At that price, only the desperate or ignorant would hand over their hard earned cash to surf the net. Lastly, the room TV also do not carry many channels or many varieties. In conclusion, GPCH is not quite worth the value it charges. Chris TIP: Surprisingly, many Singapore cabbies are not familiar with GPCH. So I advise you to print out the hotel's map (from their website) or carry the hotel key card (which shows the hotel's map) and show the map to the cab drivers. Alternatively, all cab drivers would know GPCH location once you mention that GPCH is at Coleman Lane, or near Raffles City or City Hall MRT.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Grand Park City Hall hotel for three nights while attending an international conference in Singapore. After a long flight from the UK it's really important that the process of getting from the taxi to a shower or to bed is made as easy as possible. Not only is the lobby of the Grand Park cool (after the humidity of the street) and clean, but I also found the staff attentive, welcoming and efficient. My room was comfortable but nothing out of the ordinary, with not much of a view. However, it was cleaned and had broadband (not free), a safe for valuables and a nice walk-in shower. The restaurant serves good food, but was self-service (even at night) and resembled a refectory rather than a restaurant. This is only a comment on style, really. It was clean, with a wide variety of choice and, again, attentive staff. The location of the hotel is good. Very close to City Hall MRT station, close to Raffles Hotel (good cocktails!) and to the Suntec convention centre. The reason my overal rating of the hotel is high is predominantly because of the staff. Two examples among many. First, I needed a large amount of photocopying done for a meeting. Despite asking for this to be done between 8pm and 9am (at a weekend) the staff took on this challenge with no hint of irritation. Indeed, the task was completed early and I'm sure at least one member of staff worked late into the night. Second, having checked out on my last day I was able, as in many hotels, to store my luggage until later in the evening as I had a late flight home. On this occasion, when returning to pick up my bags, the staff gave me complimentary access to a room so that I could have a shower and change. This made a big difference to my level of comfort as I prepared for a 12 hour flight home, and I really appreciated it. I can recommend this hotel for business travellers.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked 4 nights in a Superior King room, but were upgraded on checkin with out even being asked or notified! Our room had plenty of space, and the bathroom had a separate shower. I'm not sure how much space the Supior King Room would have had, but the Manager did tell me it would not have had a separate shower. The bed and pillows were very comfortable, my only qualm being the bed did seem unusually short. My partner's feet hung over then end of the Queen bed, and he's not quite 5'11". I was told that the King beds in the hotel were only wider and not longer. The buffet breakfast had a great selection of both western and asian options, although getting a good coffee at the hotel was a bit of an issue. They also didn't have soy milk available for those among us who are lactose intolerant. There were a couple of issues with the room, however the manager and staff were eager to efficiently fix any problems. In fact every staff member we had contact with was friendly, polite and professional. The staff at the checkin desk speak excellent English and the Female Manager who assisted us several times was a credit to her hotel. The fitness centre has all the necessary equipment, however the air-conditioning didn't seem adequate for the environment. I visited the centre several times and there were never any staff on hand to assist with my request for cooling the room further. The Grand Park is in a great, central location for a first time or repeat trip to Singapore. Walking distance to Chijmes, Raffles city, Suntec City, Clarke and Boat Quays. A multitude of shopping and eating options at your fingertips. The City Hall MRT is just around the corner which links you to Orchard Road and everywhere else that you'd want to visit. Taxis are also cheap and plentiful if you don't fancy venturing out in the humidity. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Arriving by taxi from the cruise terminal we wondered what was in store for us. The hotel staff rushed to unload the taxi before we could reach for our cases, then checked us in despite our being two hours early: luggage would be delivered to our room as soon as available, while we should relax in the spacious (and atmospheric) main hall (in fact we nipped round to Raffles Hotel 100 yards away for a nice expensive Singapore Gin Sling). On returning we found our luggage in our room which was spacious, comfortable (double king size bed!) and well-appointed. Throughout our stay nothing was too much trouble for the friendly concierge who pointed us in the direction of trips, advised on airport transfer etc etc. Breakfast was included and featured everything one could wish for - the traditional western cooked variety, different oriental specials daily, proper juices, tasty bread, croissants etc. We had little need to eat out afterwards. Other reviews comment negatively on the reception staff: we found the exact opposite - friendly smiles, help with whatever was needed and so on. We dined in one night (convinced to do so by the 20% discount voucher offered to guests). We chose the bar option which saved money as the meals seemed to arrive direct from the restaurant. My steak was one of the best i've had in years, washed down by two glasses of excellent red wine (2 for 1 happy hour offer), while a beautiful young lady sang a selection of Carpenters songs (extremely well) accompanied by a proficient pianist. Nothing is perfect of course - the bathroom decor was a little tired - but this wasn't far off; our homeward flight was at 2.00 am but the staff made the hours after checkout pass quickly by looking after our luggage, providing a free hospitality room (with shower, TV etc), summoning a taxi to the airport and again loading our luggage: all in all one of our best hotel experiences ever.</p></li>
