The fitness center was a bit small, but had a good mix of machines. Didn't use the pool, but the pool area looked good. Had dinner in the sports bar, and while the food was fine, the bar seemed a bit cold and sterile. Again, a good, solid hotel with no surprises.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel has nice, updated rooms for an older building. It is often very busy. Allow plenty of time when going to/from your room in the elevators. It seems that there is often only one elevator working. The Los Angeles Airport Marriott has a great pool area and outside deck. The reception desk has great customer service. Allow plenty of time when using the hotel airport shuttle.</p></li>

Would give 5 star if room was bigger. Maybe free breakfast would have been nice.</p></li>

On the other hand, parking is very expensive - almost $30.00 a day. Ouch!</p></li>

The hotel was clean but did not offer free Wifi and once you were on the system was so slow that it was impossible to get service. It is a nice area to stay in as you can walk safely to other restaurants or do some general sight seeing. Maybe not a 4 out of 5 but definitely a 3.5. The beds were a little uncomfortable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Clean, quiet and comfortable rooms equip with everything you would expect from a Marriott hotel. Staff were more than friendly, check in / out very fast and easy. The on-site restaurants were adequate but maybe a bit too pricey for what they offered. The location is not bad with easy links to visit the surrounding areas. Great place for a short stopover but would probably stay somewhere more central if staying in LA for longer than a day or two.</p></li>

My room was very nice apart from the fact that the bath tap was dripping constantly and as it was a large hotel, it was about a 5 min walk to get to my room from reception. There was a Starbucks and a restaurant inside the hotel which had prompt service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel meets the normal Marriott quality standards. In comparison with other airport hotels, I would rate it above average in terms of cleanness of the rooms and silence. One advice: if you ask the Courtyard shuttle driver nicely (there is a seperate shuttle service for the Courtyard and the Marriott hotel), he might also drive you to the Marriott. This worked perfectly for us as we could directly catch the Courtyard shuttle when we left the terminal</p></li>

After a long trip from London, the bed was wonderful. I loved the bedding and bath soaps. The only thing was that I could hear planes taking off in the night. When I flew out the next day I than really saw how close we and other hotels really are to the runway. The shuttle at 6 am was very full so go early. Many flight crews stay here and that could be part of the reason.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our group stayed here on the way out of America and it was fine. As and over night hotel before a flight we found it both reasonable in cost and close to the airport. There is a very good bar in the building, restaurants and shops. A short walk down the street will find Pizza at the Crown, ATMs and bus stops. There is a free bus service to and from the airport every 30 minutes or so. If I was transiting through LA I would stay here again as a matter of fact I have booked for my next trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel quite a few times in the last 5 years as an overnight hotel on the way back to our home in Hawaii. The rooms are very clean, but could use some updating. Hotel staff are very helpful, and the FedEx office downstairs makes sending home items from shopping sprees a breeze. Love the Starbucks store in the lobby. The only problem is the price of parking. Crazy expensive, especially the valet. If close proximity to LAX is a must, this is a great hotel. We wont go anywhere else near LAX.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a total surprise considering it was a last minute deal on Priceline. This would be great for both a layover, or as I found out, for someone just passing through. In my case, I had a car. Parking lot located at the end of the side street was approx $11, so really decent. Hotel is not too far from Santa Monica Pier with a car. This Marriott was just as good a place as any to explore LA. No noise from the planes and the room was modern with a nice TV and awesome beds. I've paid a lot more for a lot less, so ithis was excellent value.</p></li>

Good dining options from nice bar meals to fine dining, and the small convienience store in the lobby was reasonably priced and well stocked with every thing you could want, or might have forgotten.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel to catch an early morning flight. Waited a long time for the shuttle to pick us up from the airport. Once it picked us up it was a short trip to the hotel. This hotel is a crew hotel as flight attendants were also checking in. Arrived late in the evening from a Honolulu flight. Didn't see a restaurant open at the hotel to get food. There were vending machines and the news stand had some packaged food. Slept for a few hours and got up for an early morning flight. Shuttle was prompt in the morning to return to the airport. It did have to stop at the Courtyard too.</p></li>

All the staff were so friendly and helpful, and the courtyard area looked just like one in a resort, it was absolutely stunning! Everything was so clean and well taken care of. We had a problem with our room (didn't like the view facing out into the parking lot) and the front desk was so quick with getting us a room that walks right out to the courtyard at no extra cost! The only downside would be the fact that there's no free wi-fi in your room, however there is in the lobby next to Starbucks. We will definitely be staying here during our next visit.</p></li>

The rooms were very nice and the desk staff very helpful and accommodating. Before visiting this hotel we read Trip Advisor's reviews and unless you are a particularly fussy person who is after 5 star plus service then I find it difficult to read some of the hotel criticisms with any confidence. This place was fantastic and served our needs very well. We will absolutely book to stay here again anytime we do the long-haul trip to North America and beyond.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">after a 14 hour flight the Marriot was a haven before another 12 hour flight. Large beds, lots of pillows, sunny rooms, nice bathroom. Everything I wanted in a stopover hotel. Staff were very helpful and couldn't be faulted. Breakfast was typical american fare, but there aren't many options around LAX, so it did the job. After checkout, was able to hang around on the couches in reception for a few hours before my flight. No problem for the staff, never hassled, and very comfortable. Shuttle to the airport is part of the package. I would recommend this for a stopover after a long haul flight.</p></li>

It is difficult to communicate with alot of the staff because of the language barrier but overall it's clean and comfortable. The shuttle service is a subcontractor called Destination Shuttle Services. They are the weak link. It can take from 25-45 minutes for a 10 minute rude to the airport or back. You can call the hotel all day and they'll just say " 10 more minutes" I would stay here if I hada rental car or alot of spare time Allow an hour to get to the airport if you don't want to be rushed.</p></li>

It was great to jump in the hire car and be in Manhattan Beach and its restauratns in only five to 10 minutes. It was a suprirse that the Marriott's coffee shop didn't stay open later, but the bar/restaurant did, though that might not be the atmosphere you want. The shuttle buses to the airport worked well.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 2 nights with our 2 year old daughter on our way to London. We had booked this hotel before we left for our RTW trip so got a really good deal on the room rate. Close to LAX and free shuttle. Friendly staff. Fantastic beds but small bath room. Room opened to patio with the swimming pool. Too cold to swim in December but must be great in summer. We only tried the sports bar restaurant which served fast food type meals. Ok but nothing special. There is also Starbucks near the lobby. In front of hotel is bus stop to Manhatten Beach and shopping centres. Only available for hotel guests and at $4 return excellent and cheap activity.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this place because we needed a hotel by the airport before we left LA. The room was so tiny, it was like being on a cruise ship. Could barely move around without tripping over something. The bathroom was even smaller. No wonder why flight crew members go bizerk after staying in such a tiny room. The room was clean though and quiet. We had a nice view of the pool from the 12th floor. We ate dinner in the sports bar, food was pretty good. We had the breakfast buffet the next morning and the food was good and there was plenty of it. I'm not sure if all the airport hotels are like this, the price wasn't bad but the room was just so small.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is just ok. Parking is expensive and not readily available. Very crowded parking lot. It feels like Grand Central Station around there. Decent, big lobby with Starbucks, though. That was nice. Food is just ok. People are were nice and friendly. Gym is ok. BUT... if you need to be near the airport and that convenience is important to you, then go for it. They've stopped putting money in this place and it shows. Our bathroom ceiling was gross, messy-looking and discolored. And the bathrooms seemed super small to me. Again, just an OK place. No more, and no less. Not sure if I'd stay again unless it was critical that I be close to LAX.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Marriott LAX has most things you want in an airport hotel; comfortable and quiet room, friendly efficient service, good restaurant and computers for checkin as well as a shuttle to and from the airport. We had one complaint. We arrived at the hotel in the evening from Sydney. Suffering from the dreaded time zone shift, we found ourselves hungry at about 2:00 AM. We only discovered then that room service was not 24 hours. The restaurants were closed. The room didn't even have a mini-bar with outrageously priced snacks. Of course we survived the night. And we stayed in the hotel on our way home to Sydney two week later (with a snack safely tucked away in our suitcase). :-)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Traveling through the country, my family spent one day and night in L.A. and we stayed at the LA Airport Marriott. The hotel is beautiful and service was excellent. My biggest regret was that we spent so much time enjoying the sights of L.A. that we didn't get to really relax in what was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept on! This hotel is a little far from Hollywood Blvd/Sunset Strip etc... (it was a $50 taxi ride or a $12 tram that took over an hour one way) but if you have your own transportation or just need a comfortable place to sleep, this is a fantastic hotel. We were disappointed that there wasn't free internet anywhere in the hotel but that was the only negative.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never been disappointed. I agree with other reviews that the decor of the hotel is a little dated, but its clean and the rooms very comfortable & spacious. We had a problem where the safe was jammed shut with all our valuables in it. The hotel staff broke it open eventually, were very apologetic and gave us free breakfast & dinner. This attitude made it easy to forget the minor inconvenience. One of the only negatives is that I wouldnt rate the dinners at the Latitude restaurant downstairs that highly at all, but their breakfasts are fantastic and something to look forward to in the mornings. Overall, this is a very good hotel and I highly recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I decided to take a room at the Marriot Lax based on other reviews I read on here and have to say I was very disappointed with the standards of the room. The bathroom washbasin had a huge hairline cack right through it, the wallpaper was all scuffed, and the furniture looked tired and a little unclean. The concierege was completely rude to some customers before me and completely disinterested in helping me use buses. His explanation was 'everyone uses taxis' and that was the end of his help. The restaurant was good and the service there was excellent. So all in all, I found my experience there below expectations, especially as I use Marriots in other cities and would definately not recommend this hotel to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For all you jetlaggers flying abroad to visit lovely, sunny los angeles and you need to recover from being squished in your plane's seat for over 14 hours, this Marriott hotel is ideal for resting your pretty head for a good night's sleep. Everything you need is at your finger tips and the full breakfast included is a real treat to look forward to when you awake. We also enjoyed the service provided at the Hertz car rental desk at the hotel and we wish to thank Tikco for her wonderful service there. It is a much better way to hire a car than to go back to crazy LAX to stand in queue and hope you get a decent car. Overall, a wonderful overnight stay and we do recommend to all and will return the next time we visit LA.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at this hotel as part of a package deal. The shuttle service to and from the airport was very convenient. Our flight arrived at 12:30pm and we were able to check in immediately. The staff was very busy because of the Rose Bowl and several weddings / conventions, but they were still very polite and attentive. We ate at Champion's one night and the service was very good. The food was typical bar fare and was reasonably priced. The room was very nice. It seemed a little bit smaller than newer hotels, but the decor was new and the bed was very comfortable. My only real complaint was that not all the elevators were operational and at one point there were about 25 people waiting for an elevator to show up.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Every year I make a point of breaking my long distance travel at the Marriott LAX. It's proximity to the airport, the quality F&B outlets, and the service make this my preferred choice for LAX layovers. And as I normally need to stay on a Friday/Saturday, the weekend rates make the hotel especially good value. Final meals before flying out long haul are always taken at the JW's Steakhouse, which represents good value in a relaxed atmosphere. When killing time in the room there is a huge choice of TV channels, as well as an impressive in-house movie on demand service. Look for daily movie specials as low as $4.99. Rooms are comfortable and a good size - bathrooms are pretty small, but at least that makes for a larger living area.</p></li>

The service was excellent, the staff very helpful and our room with a balcony overlooking the pool was very comfortable and clean and very reasonably priced. There was no noise at all from the planes and we got a good nights sleep. The shuttle to and from the Airport was very convenient too. This was our second visit to LA which I must say is not our favourite city in the States and we stayed over to do the city tour and rest up before flying to Honolulu after a trip to the Eastern states. We decided to eat in the Hotel and this was a good choice. The food and the drinks during happy hour were very reasonably priced and excellent quality. I would recommend this hotel without reservation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It is fine except that the air-conditioning never really got cool enough. I think it's one of those systems where if the outside ambient termperatutre goes below a certain point, the compressor turns off. Also, the pool -- besides being one of those wacky shapes that makes it impossible to swim laps unless one of your arms is shorter than the other -- had more chlorine than any pool I've been in since the 1980s. Even more than the Washington DC drinking water. A word to travelers who are taking cabs to their destination the next morning (as opposed to the two other options LA offers -- renting a car or walking). Don't hang at the main entrance if there is a line, which moves slowly. Simply walk down the driveway to where the cabs are waiting. Faster, and you save the obligatory doorman tip.</p></li>

How wring I was.. We got there at 11.00 am and room was not ready which was fair as check in was 3.00 pm. We could have had another room but it only had one bed. Not very good if you have 2 kids! (i booked a quad room). So we went shopping to wait for our room... We got back to the hotel at 4.30 pm to get our room keys ASAP and this was very seamless.... When we got to the room though the carpets were wet and the room smelt like vomit! It was gross! The hotel was hosting a conference and at 2.00 am they must have finished and they were all around the pool laughing and carrying on! This hotel is fine if you just want a bed to sleep in!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Yes, I am in agreement with some other reviews that the rooms are not huge and the shower/tub toilet is a bit tight. This is LA however and real estate per square foot is likely astronomical. More importantly the rooms are really clean as is the bathroom and the bed is very comfortable. There is a beautiful interior pool/hot tub courtyard area that is very nice, not to be missed. The only problem is the Marriott no longer has its own van to pick you up at LAX. Most of the major hotels now have to use a 'city bus' that picks you up, you have to be really careful or you will miss the correct bus. We flew in from Boston to LAX and arrived in terminal 7. This is basically the last stop and by the time the bus arrives it is full. We had to wait almost an hour to finally catch that bus to the Marriott.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Like most close proximity airport hotels this one is pricey but worth it. Location is great and I was surprised and pleased at the lack of noise from aircraft. Rooms surround a great pool and courtyard, Starbucks in the lobby and 3 places to eat including a sportsbar and higher end steak house. Our meal and service at the steakhouse were excellent as was the service at all points. Typical Marriott rooms comfy and mine was quiet even on the 3rd floor. I do however resent they charge you for internet when you are already paying a premium for the room! If you need to be near LAX and paying a bit more is worth it, this is your place. One tip, if you need to take their shuttle to the airport plan on up to a half hour wait in the morning because the lines are greater than the capacity of their shuttle van so you wait for the next one.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My stay here wasn't by choice but due to a late connection I needed to overnight at the airport. the travellers aid desk at Internation Arrivals managed to get a very good rate for here which after missing my flight home was nice. The hotel is well served by a shuttle running every 15 mins. The room I got was slightly small but very comfortable. I had some food in the Champions sports bar which was fine and there is one or 2 other food choices there as well as a Starbucks in the lobby. The outdoor pool is nice and helped wake me up the next morning. With a few hours to kill I took the trolley shuttle which goes from the airport district to Manhattan Beach which was nice. If you're ever stuck at LAX would very much recommend this hotel though I'm not sure apart from conventions in the immediate area if it would be a good base for LA in general.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stay here frequently. The price is very reasonable especially on the weekend. It is on the edge of the airport so it is ideal if you have no car and just have a brief lay over at LAX. The parking is a large uncovered lot which is not ideal if you have lots of luggage or it is raining. The lobby looks good and has 3 restaurants. Room service runs till midnight. The food options are reasonable but very plain. The rooms and corridors are tired and old. The doorways are unusually narrow. The bathrooms are very small but have a reasonable amount of counter space. They still have the old narrow Speakman shower heads instead of the much wider and pleasant Kohler rain fall fittings. The beds are very comfortable. The windows do not open. The airport noise is acceptable. The staff and service levels are very good. This is a good airport hotel option for LAX.</p></li>

It's a decent and inexpensive lay-over, one notch better than it's sister, The Courtyard Marriott, one block away. We paid $119 for the night, compared to $99 otherwise at The Courtyard. Breakfast was not complimentary. The room is small, as expected, but the reception area is unexpectedly large, as large and good looking as several other 5-star hotels. The staff at the reception desk is professional and courteous, though not as warm or welcoming as they should be. The transfer shuttle to the airport is efficient, on time, and our driver was pretty nice and helpful. Other than that, nothing else is extraordinary, except for the really convenience of the location. We will definitely stay at this hotel on our next needed lay-over.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here on our way to a cruise vacation (one night before and 2 nights after). The hotel itself is very nice with 3 different restaurants (not open all the time), a Starbucks in the lobby, the beds were super comfy and shuttle service was 24 hours a day and very quick. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The staff was amazing!! The best hotel staff as a whole that I have encountered anywhere!! Any time you were in the lobby, you were greeted with smiles and warmth! The desk staff was friendly and efficient. The waiters we experienced were attentive and polite. I would definately stay here again in the same situation! My only problems with this hotel was the cost of the food and the internet service. The restaurants were quite expensive ($4 for a tiny glass of orange juice) and the only free internet was in the lobby. WiFi in your room would cost you $15 a day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The LAX Marriott was the location of a business conference. I asked for a quiet room after a long trip and little sleep. The staff was friendly and very helpful. I stayed four nights and had a great night's sleep every night. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. The fitness room was amazing - the best I have ever seen in a hotel. There were seven treadmills, several eliptical machines, lots of free weights and almost a dozen weight machines as well as some exercise balls. I have never seen anything close in other hotels. There were cool eucalyptus towels for guests after finishing my workout. We ate at J.W.'s Steakhouse in the hotel. The food was delicious, and we were given a complimentary appetizer. The conference food was excellent. I would love to come back in the future. Every staff person was friendly and accomodating. I would recommend the Los Angeles Airport Marriott!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Welcome to Marriott's idea of a smoke free property. First, upon arrival, you'll see that the smoking area outside has been placed in such a way that the smoke blows in both to the sports bar (so you can have that "still in a smoking bar" feeling) and to the elite level check in desk. Not being satisfied with that little episode, they have also conveniently placed ashtrays all throughout the pool area - including one right by the water. I suppose that is so that someone can smoke with their legs in the pool if they like. Marriott Los Angeles Airport has a definitely strange idea of what a smoke free property is like. I woudln't have found all these ashtrays except that I had to go on a walk because the internet wasn't working properly. They were also under construction at the time. All in all, it could have been a lot better. The bed was nice, the room was comfortable. The staff was reasonably helpful. Don't think I will go back though.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here on night on our way home from Mexico and while the property is updated and the rooms clean, there may be better alternatives for the price. We are Marriott Gold members and like the Marriott brand. This hotel is older, although updated you will find the rooms very small and the bathrooms even smaller. The shuttle service is an complete disaster. This hotel is 4 blocks from the terminals but they only run the shuttle every 30 minutes - so we waited while the other hotels passed us by 3-4 times before our shuttle showed up. On our return trip to the airport, they only run shuttles every 20 minutes from 5 am - 7 am - after that they are back to 30 minutes. I think they are missing the point of being at the airport. The conceirge lounge is nice and offers a basic breakfast. Unlike other lounges that you can access 24 hours for water, soft drinks, etc. this hotel has limited hours. So as we arrived at 11 pm there was no option for the lounge.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I decided to overnight at LAX before flying to New Zealand. The LAX Marriott was a good choice. We found a reasonably priced modern hotel with great service, a friendly staff, and good options for dinning. The hotel has four dinning/coffee establishments including a Starbucks (opens at 0530 AM), Champions Sports Bar, JW's Steakhouse, and Latitude 33 Restaurant. We tried Champions and were pleased with the food and service. The hotel also has a very nice fitness center and a guest laundry. The LAX Marriott was so convenient that we stayed another night upon returning from New Zealand and before flying off to Europe. Pros: - Close to airport and rental cars with a complementary 24-hour airport shuttle (although shuttles are available, one could actually walk to the airport or to the rental car locations). - Do It Yourself Guest Laundry is inexpensive and they offer free detergent. - Nice fitness center. Con: Older hotel, so the rooms and bathrooms are small</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sad to see that Marriott is stuck in another age...stayed at the LAX Marriott instead of Manhattan Beach to avail ourselves mainly of Hertz desk. The room was average, asked for a quiet room and got a 4th floor room facing the road, smallish but OK, no great shakes for over $200/night (incl.tax) on senior rate. The amazing experience of the evening was the absolutely awful Champions bar, totally ghastly food, thank goodness we had ordered one appetizer to start off with, my gin and tonic was totally average, the table and menus were sticky/tacky, the only redeeming grace was the service. How can a hotel like Marriott serve defrosted rubbery slices of totally tasteless shrimp with about 6 tiny morsels of avocado and tasteless salsa under the mellifluous and bombastic title of shrimp and avocado cocktail...Wake up guys this is the 21st century and California knows about real food so get on with the program!!! $34 worth of junk....buyer beware, we spend a lot of time in LA and this is definitely under par. We would not recommend the place to anyone....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's very close to the airport and a free shuttle service is offered. The rooms are not very spacious, but it's okay! The bathroom is a little bit small, so that only one person can use it. The rooms have pretty new furniture, and the decoration is stylish. We even had a room in the 5th floor, with pool view and balcony, that was great. Unfortunately there wasn't a fridge in our room. At night you can hear some planes, but it's not very loud or disturbing. The pool and spa area is huge and looks great with all the palms and a little "river" with two bridges. Everything seems to be well-kept and towels are available at the pool all the time. The lobby is big, and even a starbucks is located in the lobby. The staff was extremely friendly, and offered help whenever you needed it. In the lobby you can put your baggage on the scales to check if you have excess baggage and you can check arrival and departure flights on two screens. If your flight leaves in the evening, you can store your baggage in a special room because check out time is 12 noon. We would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The shuttle was pretty bad the driver refused to help with the bags stating it wasn’t his job. We arrived at the hotel and the check in line was 45 minutes. We arrived at our non-smoking room “with a view” the view happened to be the building next door and the room had clearly been smoked in for an extended period of time – the smell was covered with a febreeze like product making it worse. We tried for a new room but were told we were out of luck as there was conference booked so we were out of luck. We had rented a car which was delivered to the hotel (enterprise car rental, wonderful service) and parked behind the hotel. I think it was $10US for the day with in and out privledges. Parking staff were great. Room service took 90 minutes for 1 salad, 2 burgers, fries and 3 sodas. The food was warm, the fries soggy. The room service attendant was super nice though and came back about an hour later to collect our plates and give us some more towels that we had requested. Two of us were traveling and one flight out was at 9pm at night, due to the mix up with the smoking room management they gave us a free late check out.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “very small room”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here for a night in May. We only spent about 10 hours in the room because we left early the next morning. The room was clean but the pillows were a bit uncomfortable. I found the room very small for the price that we had to pay and the AC was sort of in the bathroom which was strange. The room felt very cramped compared to other hotels we stayed on our trip. In terms of noise, we didn't notice any sound and could sleep well through out the night. There is a free shuttle bus but for some reason, we had to wait about 30 mins to catch it from the airport. We kept seeing other hotel shuttle buses drive by several times and even wondered whether we needed to catch a taxi instead. The shuttle bus showed up just when we were about to see how else to get to the hotel. I don't know if it was just that night or the shuttle buses to LAX marriot are just less frequent. I think this hotel ok for a quick stay like ours and if you got a good deal for th enight. But if you have to park your car, please note parking is very expensive. That was the reason why we decided to pick up our hire car the next morning instead of paying the expensive parking fee.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I haved stayed here a few times and also in other hotels nearby but this would be my favourite. The check in was quick even though the hotel was really busy. There was a convention on and everybody in the hotel seemed to be there for it except us ! (they took over everywhere pool , lobby, restaurant but at same time gave a bit of life and atmosphere to the place.) Rooms are ok size wise and beds are very comfortable. Tea and coffee maker in room nice touch. Wifi is free in lobby area so nice to grab a coffee in Starbucks and use it there. Lots of people complaining about price of starbucks more expensive than normal but I would expect that in a hotel. Fitness center is good. Bigger than most hotels and each time i used it was very quiet. Pool area is lovely and normally has plenty of sun loungers (except this time as convention people had all of them!) Only ate in the Sports bar and it was good and fairly reasonable. This is a good hotel and has friendly staff. Parking rates are expensive so be careful if driving. There isnt too much happening around the hotel so a 10 min bus ride to Santa Monica or Manhattan makes for a great day out.. All in all nice hotel and would reccommend it .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here two nights on September 26th. After getting to the airport we call the hotel and they told where the shuttle will pick us up. The shuttle driver was a very nice guy who help us with our luggage. We got to the hotel and a nice bellman greeted us. The check in was smooth and Pepe (bellman) took us to our room. He was very nice, he tols about the hotel services and in general he made our arrival experience an A+. We requested a fridge in the room and it got quickly... free of charge. The safe wasn´t working but after a call a Loss Prevention officer helped us out. The hotel has complimentary shuttle to the airport which is great... we took a ride to the airport, and then a ride to the metro station,,, which tooks us to downtown, Walk of Fame and we even got to Santa Monica not spending more than $5 each. The hotel have a self service laundry which is great!!!! Try to use it early on because there are only 2 washers and 2 driers.. The only bad thing is that the pool in not heated... and the water was freezing.... Overall we did like this hotel... having a Starbucks and a Champions inside is a plus. We are Marriott International employees and the rate we got was a real bargain...!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here for one night as we needed a place to crash before catching a super early morning flight.We chose this hotel because of the proximity to the airport, ratings and price. We checked in around 10.30pm very easily and went straight up to our room. When we walked into our room we were greeted with a hot room with no air circulating. It was stifling and disgusting. We turned on the air conditioning and dropped the temp to as low as it would go and went down to the depressing sports bar in the lobby to have a drink while we waited for the room to cool down. We returned and it was still warm after 45 minutes. I was so tired at this point I didn't care, I just needed my 4 hours of sleep before catching our flight. We didn't complain about the temperature because the a/c was just shut off and we just had to turn it on. I slept fine and we checked out at 4.30am. I don't have much to say about service as our only interaction with the front desk was checking in and that was prompt and easy. We just slept and showered. It was fine for a basic place to do these things. I wouldn't stay here if I was looking for a super nice hotel. It does the job for sleeping and having a frequent airport shuttle.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stay at the LAX Marriott every year in February while attending a Doctor Who convention there and I always enjoy it! The rooms are great-very comfortable and pretty spacious. You have your choice of three restaurants here, which is nice, though it's worth noting that the food in Latitude 33 is very similar (sometimes exactly the same) as the food served in the sports bar. There's also a more upscale steakhouse, which I've only eaten in once and wasn't overly impressed with. There's a great, comfortable lobby and I believe it has free wifi, though the same cannot be said of the rooms (internet access will run you about $12/day in your room). Aside from that, there are some nice amentities, like the big outdoor pool and hot tub-very nice! It's an airport hotel, so it's very convenient if you're flying into/out of LAX, especially with the hotel shuttle that runs regularly. There aren't many things to walk to, but you do have a few choices for restaurants nearby. You can also hop on the shuttle that picks up about two blocks from the hotel and hitch a ride to Santa Monica and a few other nearby destinations (tickets are about $3 are are available from the concierge). I know that this one hotel that I'll continue to return to!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location: Very convenient to LAX with frequent shuttle bus service. To me this is also sufficiently close to downtown LA or touristic sites with a car. Parking seems to be paid parking. Staff: OK. During check-in at the Elite desk, had to wait a few minutes before was attended too even though there was another staff standing near the desk. Felt ignored. During check out, again did not feel that the staff was friendly. Not the best impression. But they were not rude either. Room: Standard Marriott type room. If I remember, it was flat TV. Amenities in the room was good which included a small complimentary bottle of water. Sadly, all my requested amenities were not delivered. But not a big issue for me. Bathroom: Good size and amenities. In general, a good hotel. One of the highlights was the treatment of Elite members. I was quite surprised to be offered an option because I booked a room which included breakfast and since I had an early flight to catch I had to missed it. I was offered a credit to my account for dinner as an alternative. First time being offered such an option which I sometimes hope more hotels offers such options. The hotel seems to be quite a popular hotel compared to the Renaissance, maybe because of the brand. There was also an outside pool and jacuzzi.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Unfortunately this review ain't going to get me too many "was this review helpful" clicks because I'm going to briefly reiterate what others have said. It's obviously a perfect location if your travel involves arriving at or from LAX. I make it a habit to stay at airport hotels when I'm flying east and have an early morning flight. Quite convenient ditching the rental car the night before and then hopping on the hotel shuttle bus. From check-in to check-out this hotel was a delight. I was a solo dad traveling with a tired, cranky 4-year-old and they got us in and out perfectly. The pool at this hotel is great and for those of you who specifically seek out airport hotels to watch planes this place is amazing if you ask for an airport runway view and there are many. As for those of you don't don't like airport hotels because of the noise this place should not be an issue. I didn't notice any plane sound. Rooms were newly renovated, there's a Starbucks in the lobby, parking is a ripoff (but that's the case at all LAX hotels...) and the restaurant was decent for breakfast. I've stayed at the Embassy Suites across the street, that's a good bet too if you specifically need a suite hotel. The LAX Marriott is one of my personal favorites because of the runway views but that's just me</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I located this hotel at the AAA website and found it to be a great value. (Paid less than at any hotel during our 10 days in Ca., including most that were not as nice.) The check in was efficient and the ladies were most helpful. We were pleasantly pleased to find that we could check our Hertz rental car in at the hotel, rather than down the street at the large Hertz facility. The room was easy to locate. (I don't know why some reviewers said they got lost in the hotel.) It was an average size with beautiful, plush bedding and lots of pillows, which were of great quality. The decor was updated with a table, upholstered arm chair, desk, chair, and bureau with TV on top. In addition the room was quiet, and we did not hear the planes taking off and landing across the street at LAX. We found that the remote to the TV did not work, and it took two calls to maintenance to correct the problem. The bathroom was on the small side, but was not a problem. The shower in the tub was high enough with good flow. The counter was granite. The linens were nice, thick and oversized. We had dinner in the dining room, and had a good experience there. We used the complimentary shuttle to the airport and only waited about 10 min. for it to arrive in the am. I would highly recommend a stay at this hotel. If ever I need a hotel to use when flying in or out of LAX, I would use this one.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Overpriced with no support for kids with allergies”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked into the Marriot LA Airport to stay on the way to London from New Zealand to break up our trip. We had rung ahead from New Zealand and been assured that their restaurant could prepare allergy safe meals and/or allow us to supply our own meals for our peanut allergic 3/12 year old daughter. Once in the restaurant - we were informed that they could not even heat up the canned meal we had bought - let alone prepare an allergy safe meal. Even front desk were unable to do a single thing. I have no idea what other families with kids with allergies do here? I guess your kids have to eat cold canned food. A simple heat in the microwave is we wanted. It seems this is litigious USA gone mad and after a 12 hour flight from NZ, 2 hours through customs (with no line for families), our 2 toddlers were already in meltdown and this restaurant experience is a final nail in the coffin. Ironically, I had been telling my wife that from prior travel experiences in the US, that I had experienced some of the best customer service of anywhere in the world. This has been some of the worst. Add in, price gouging charges for everything else (no free basic TV), portable cot not put up and with no mattress and bedding and I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyway. My only small compliment would be that most of the staff are very nice - but obviously have to adhere to some ridiculous policies and very poor customer service systems to follow.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I traveled from Jordan to London to LA. Before I continued on my journey, I was in need of a comfortable bed a hot shower and decent room service. I found all of that and more at the LAX Marriott. There are hotel shuttle buses that circle the airport. They will pick you up at specific boarding locations outside your terminal building. Each bus goes to a couple of hotels that are near each other. The wait isn't very long, about 10 minutes. There was one person ahead of me at the check in line. I was greated with a smile by the staff member behind the counter. He was quick and efficient in giving me my room key. This hotel is huge and very busy, however, I didn't hear a single sound from anywhere in my remodeled, extremely comfortable room. I ordered room service and was told it would be 45 minutes, it was at my door in 20! The food was quite good. The small bathroom was spotless with bath and body works aromatherapy shampoo, conditioner and cream. The room was nicely decorated and very clean. My king sized bed was so comfortable, I felt as if I was sleeping on a cloud. There were 5 pillows on the bed, various sizes, take your pick.... There was a desk, comfortable chair, large TV with digital cable, a large, illuminated, bedside clock (easy to see without your glasses....LOL...) as well as good lights for reading. I slept like a baby and was ready to get up and face the next day's travel refreshed and well rested. Thank you Marriott LAX.....</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 1 night on 30th March 2006 as part of an epic journey from Inverness in Scotland to Kauai in Hawaii. We paid £40 for the room via a cheap internet site and we were not expecting much but we were pleasantly surprised. The room was spacious with a king bed which was very comfortable. The room was reasonably quiet, and very clean. Furnishings were of good quality. The bathroom was small and quite pokey, however everything worked and as this was just a pit stop then it was fine - we had very nice freebies in the bathroom - stuff you would want to use and all aromatherapy based. Staff were very helpful and gave us all the info we needed. Did not use the leisure facilities. We ate in the large restuarant (can't remember the name) which was Ok, but thought it was expensive, and next time would just order a pizza - concerige will give you alist of who delivers. Warning - the draft beer in the bar fizzy! Not sure if it was meant to be but it was definatley odd - however the wine was very good. If we had to stopover in LA then we would definately use this hotel again - the shuttle was prompt and efficient and the driver (a lady) was very helpful and actually happy - small miracle for LA! However if you are there for a few days and have a generous budget then I heartily recommend Shutters on the beach in Santa Monica - get a room with a tub where you can look out and see the sun rising and setting - the cafe there is excellent for b/fast and brunch.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Shuttle: This hotel is part of the cooperative with other LAX hotels with a single provider that provides 24 hr loop service. Arriving at LAX, you simply collect your luggage and go outside. Watch for the shuttle bus indicating Marriott LAX, and get on. The ride to the hotel just takes a few minutes, and they they go on to one other hotel, then back to LAX. I tipped the driver $1 per bag IF he handled it. Shuttle runs every 20-25 minutes. Check-in: I was prepaid through AARP so check-in took about 3 minutes and we were headed up to our room. Very efficient and pleasant staff. Room: Not very big, but hey, this is a stop-over, not exactly intended to be a week-long pad. The room was clean, no complaints. Lots of pillows. Nearby airliners departing at 5 am may wake you. Check-out: We had no incidental charges, so checkout consisted of handing the desk clerk the key cards and then heading out. Dining: Uh-oh. The costs for dining are so high they're laughable. If you are returning to LAX the next morning, we recommend that you get your breakfast at the Burger King kiosk near your departure gate. You'll save HALF! I did not see any outside restaurants near the hotel, but if there were, they would no doubt be cheaper. This was the most expensive hotel breakfast menu I have encountered. Evening sandwich in the sports bar was good, but again, way too expensive. All said, this hotel worked just fine for the purpose intended - an overnight layover flying to/from Cancun.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at this property at least 3 times and while the rooms are rather dated and the bathrooms are fairly small, overall the rooms are a reasonable price at convention rates. The pool area is nice and has ground floor access for special needs visitors. The really bad news is that the restaurants have odd hours, the service and selection at the Champions sports bar are dreadful and the steak restaurant is incredibly overpriced. But here's the good news: the LAX Four Points Sheraton is located just north of the Marriott and they have T.H. Brewster's, an EXCEPTIONAL beer bar that's open all day long and has food service. So, we like to check into our cheap lodgings, then go for a short stroll next door to enjoy fantastic beer and good food which costs just as much as we'd pay for a crappy burger and a Corona (exotic import? NOT!) at the sports bar. The Sheraton's beer bar staff are very helpful with the wide selection of imported beer offerings and very attentive, in contrast with the lackadaisical service at Champions. Then we stroll back to the hotel, visit with our friends at the convention, attend some parties and genuinely enjoy ourselves. Also, at this hotel, I once found an opening in the acoustic ceiling tile over the shower (?) about the size of a peephole. With my husband's help, I plugged it with some toilet paper, but it certainly made me feel insecure on that stay! And why is it that Marriott properties never seem to have proper ventilation in the bathroom?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Marriott and Embassy Suites in LAX during a recent trip to Hawaii. I secured a good rate on-line. The Marriott is a nice looking hotel with convenient access to the airport. The shuttle arrived within a few minutes of us getting to the Airport Shuttle Stand. It made a quick stop at the Sheraton before dropping us off at the Marriott. Check in was quick and the room was clean and adequate for an overnight stay. They had a Champs, Starbucks and a Steakhouse on the property. The rooms were very quiet and the outdoor pool looked very nice. The only minor issue we had was that we needed to check in and then return our Rental Car across the street at Budget. The parking is not free. When we asked the Valet he said we had not choice but to Valet or Self Park and pay the fee. When I inquired at the Front Desk they told me that the first 30 minutes were free. In the meantime, my husband who was outside spoke to the Valet Supervisor and he told him to just park it i a valet parking spot until we were ready to return it. That worked out fine for us. Bell Services was prompt and the next morning the shuttle was also prompt but I am not sure that I would stay here again unless I was able to get a good rate. I felt that they in a way I was being nickel and dimed. Internet was $12.99 and parking was also additional. You would think that a hotel of this caliber would offer some services inclusive of the rate. We liked the hotel better than the Embassy Suites but it did not convince me to want to return.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is above average given its location near the airport. I've often found that hotels near the airport are often dungy and un-kept - that was not the case with the Marriott at LAX. That being said, the service was quite poor: - We called the morning of our arrival to ask if our room could be available for early check-in. We were assured that it would be no problem. Upon arrival 3 hours later, we were surprised to find that our room was not available, and we had to be down-graded to a lesser room in order to check-in early. The front desk person was so rude that I almost asked to speak with the manager, until I realized that the rude person WAS the front desk manager! - I didn't have access to a car in LA (I know, I'm crazy) so I needed to know how to reach my office via public transportation. I asked twice, and twice I was promised a call back in my room once they found someone who could answer my question (no one knew their way around LA, and no one had a bus map?!) - Overall, we felt that they are used to people staying either for conferences (which means they didn't have a choice where to stay) or only for one night (if their flight was cancelled). So they don't care to ensure repeat customers since most of their business is one-time only. Some positives: - Wonderful pool area, very clean (and I'm picky!) and not that busy (it's mostly business travelers who are in a conference all day long) - this was the hotel's biggest plus as far as we were concerned - Starbucks in lobby (very convenient) - Very comfy beds</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had to stay in LA for a 2 day seminar on July 8 and 9th. We were impressed by the size of the hotel and the drive in to the parking area. This place is HUGE. The rooms were a decent size with a nice color scheme and a good view. The front staff was very helpful as well. What I loved about the hotel is their large, often candle lit lower lounge area. This is where you could get free wireless....other wise it is $13.95 a night to have it in your room which I do believe is a little extravagent. Luckily we did not have to park at this hotel as I have heard it costs about $25 a night. There is a business center which is convenient, however the charges are INSANELY overpriced...I believe it was $24.95 an hour....rip off! If you want to go out and about, I suggest you rent a car or know someone in LA to show you around. This hotel is only near other hotels, but very few restaurants and things "to do" are around... The pool in this hotel is FABULOUS...it is heated and outdoor which are two perks. It is built like those you see in Mexican resorts, with a gazebo and lagoon. It is nice and shallow for the kids and then gets deep for the good swimmers. The ballrooms where our seminar was held was incredibly huge...and the food service was great. Overall this is an excellent hotel for the atmosphere, ambience and price value (we found it on hotels.ca for $100 a night!). Just be prepared to have to take the bus around town if you want to go anywhere...,I suggest this place as more of a stay for those on business or seminars that are nearby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel had nice touches that most don't have. In the beautiful lobby are bowls of apples and bowls of ear plugs!! Possibly needed because of the airport being near, but I didn't need them for airplane noise. Maybe others used them for noise period. Also in the lobby were two containers of fuit infused water. One container had strawberries, oranges and pineapples. The other had lemons, limes, and oranges. YUM! The concierge was very helpful explaining how the free trolly to Manhattan beach works, "Go out the door and it's the 5th palm tree on the left!" She also arranged a tour of LA by night withing 15 minutes of the tour leaving for two of us. Great Job! My room was recently remodeled and had nice contemporary Mediteranian flair. The carpet was burgandy with gold swirls. The walls were painted a warn brownish yellow and a warm red. The bathroom sink was granite. The bed was a feather bed with a down comfortor and pillows. They sure were comfy. At the foot of the bed was a nice chenile bed scarf. I didn't have a problem with noise. I had a newspaper out side my door each week-day. My room had a balcony overlooking the freeform pool. The pool area had nice gathering areas with soft outdoor couches and chairs. Food at the hotel is pricy. Desserts are wonderful. A baked potato was $6. Take the trolly to Manhattan beach and go to Rock and Fish down by the pier. It is pricy but the food is very good and is enough to share.We had a celebrity sighting there. My only complaint is that the training rooms were set at 55 degrees and I had to take my bed scarf down with me to keep warm.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Marriott on Sept 19th for 4 nights at the start of our trip to USA.The hotel was clean, the room we had was excellent, clean, very comfortable beds and lots of pillows. We had a room overlooking 2 of the runways and there was no noise from outside. We never encountered any problems with the lifts, the staff were all very nice and helpful and our room was made up everyday perfectly. My 2 kids loved the pool, it was very very nice and not crowded at all, as I guess a lot of people are just stopping over for a night. The lobby was always busy, but we were all checked in within around 5 minutes. The concerge was very helpful giving us information and maps on how to get around. We caught a bus to La Brae Tarpits,we had to change buses but found it very easy. the tarpits were quite interesting and from there we caught another bus just up the road to Farmers Markets and The Grove Shopping Centre. On the way back we had to change buses again and whilst waiting for the bus, we spotted the Hollywood sign in the distance. The next day we caught the bus to Santa Monica which was not far. The next day we had arranged a tour with Starline Tours and were picked up from the hotel and had the full day at Universal Studios. There are not much food options around the hotel, one night we ate at the hotel resturant and the meal was very good.There is a liquor shop which sells anything else you might need just down the road and a Burger King. There was a Denny's a couple of blocks away, but the concerge suggested we not walk there once it was dark, which was very nice of her. The shuttle bus was prompt and the driver very friendly. I found no faults with this hotel and would definetly stay again</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice hotel but not 4 star and valet service was very slow”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stay at this hotel about 4-5 times a year and am always happy with the rooms and amenities, however I don't think they should be rated a 4 star hotel, i would say more like a 3 star, just based on the amenities offered and services. However, again the service is always great, housekeeping always great as well as the bellhop service. The only huge gripes I have about this hotel is the ridiculous parking rates, both self and valet and the valet service. The price to park is just out of this world..I understand valet is a premium service but I've paid less at 5 star hotels here in Hawaii where we live and the self parking rates are ridiculous too. Based on that my husband and I decided to just valet for a few dollars more and the expected convenience of not having to lug our two small children through the parking lot every time we came and went. The first night we waited about 10-15 minutes for our car which btw we could see parked..the next few days it was a little better with wait times in the 10 minute range..still for about $32/day valet fee, i'd expect better service. It seemed like they were short staffed with only 1 or 2 people getting the cars...very frustrating!! To me , this is the only downfall to this property but it's pretty major..when you're on vacation you want the convenience of fast service..we would end up sending my husband downstairs 5-10 minutes earlier just to give the valet our parking ticket to get the car, then I'd come downstairs w/ my two kids..if you plan on not getting a car (which would be pretty dificult for this hotel, because nothing major is within walking distance) or you don't mind crappy valet service and overpriced parking rates than this place won't be an issue for you. I just hope they fix this flaw to an otherwise great place.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Tired and ready for a room at Manhattan Beach Marriott they transfered me to LAX Marriott due to overbooking (elite member prepaid). Arrived at LAX Marriott. Valet didn't even approach me. Lobby Elite member help desk made me wait then pointed me straight to the anyone line. Took forever to confirm that my stay was to be complimentary due to the overbooking at the Manhattan Marriott. Offered me condolences and mini size water to match the micro sized room. No refridgerator, itsy bitsy bathroom, ice machine across hall, planes taking off every few minutes. I called the front desk to ask if they had bigger rooms I was left on hold for over 10 minutes. I finally hung up and went downstairs. When I complained that this was not comparable to what I had booked through "Marriott Rewards as an Elite Member" they questioned my Elite status (been member over 10 years). I showed them my well worn card. Told me it wasn't their fault. Told me all the rooms were all the same size - which wasn't true. Front desk put up with my angry description of my experience so far, but did nothing to compensate me. No offer of a better room, no comp drink, NOTHING but a blank stare and fake geniality. As though I didn't matter whatsoever. Waited a solid 15 minutes, thirsty & tired in restaurant while staff in nearly deserted restaurant argued over who's turn it was as though it was an inconvienience to serve me. Soup tasted like Progresso out of a can for $10. What a joke. When I stated that I have used Marriott because I expected consistency in service, quality of rooms, and responsive staff they stared at me as though I was speaking another language. I will never ever trust Marriott again & I like to travel to new places therefore I need a reliable hotel chain. Westin has really comfy beds. Hmmmm.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Cool, pool, freezing shower”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose the Marriott for an overnight before an early- AM flight- which is probably the case for most of the people staying there. It’s on Century Blvd., which seems to have one of every major hotel, and it’s right on the edge of LAX. It took me 10 minutes to get to my terminal the next morning using the hotel shuttle. There were very few restaurants in the area that I could see- only a Burger King appeared to be within walking distance. After checking into my room, I looked out the window and saw the pool. Wow. It was 6:30 PM and dark, temperatures were in the 60s, but I had to use it. And so I did, after calling Room Service and ordering dinner to be delivered in an hour. I’ve never seen a pool this nice outside of resorts- definitely choose this place if you have kids or swimming is your preferred exercise. There’s also a large exercise room- I counted 8 treadmills plus the other usual equipment, and there’s a whole section devoted to weight-training apparati. It was a bit downhill after that- I got upstairs a little chilled and looking forward to a hot shower. There was none to be had. Despite the fact that the hot water supply in the sink was fine, all I could get was cold water from the shower. I decided that a swim counted for a shower and gave up. I’d already spread my possessions around the room, dinner was on the way, and I didn’t want to change rooms or have a plumber in the way. I spent about 10 minutes trying to get on-line and gave up on that, too. Dinner arrived- about 10 minutes later than promised, but piping hot and in good condition. Rooms in one section have balconies overlooking the pool and gardens; mine didn't but if you plan to be there in nice weather you may want to request one. I'd probably stay at the Marriott again, despite the problems, but then I have a weakness for fancy swimming pools!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Value”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. What great value! I was in LA for a few days and had an early morning departure so decided to stay in a hotel close to the airport. This hotel is large, providing several dining options. The pool and lounging area are wonderful. The rooms are a good size, perhaps just a tad outdated but certainly pleasant, and the bed was by far the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in. I got a package that included valet parking so I didn't have to worry about that cost, which some of the other reviewers have pointed out, can be expensive. Breakfast was also expensive but there are so many other options in the area you can always go someplace else. The health club has a variety of machines and is clean. The cardio machines have personal TV monitors and complimentary earphones are provided. It is an airport hotel but I hardly noticed any noise from planes. The real jewel in this hotel though is the service. Everyone I came in contact with, the clerk at check-in, the parking attendants, the staff in the restaurants, housekeeping, were all magnificent. Even the people dusting and sweeping late at night took the time to smile and say hello. After ordering breakfast in the restaurant the first morning, the server remembered how I took my coffee and automatically brought it that way the other two days. I called the "at your service" number to have an iron brought to my room (the one that was there was malfunctioning). I had a new iron in under 5 minutes and there was also a follow-up call to make sure I'd received it. I can't say enough about this place. It is not a luxury hotel but it is definitely worth the money and the great service I experienced all around elevated the level of the stay tremendously. Whoever is in charge of customer service at this hotel should be commended. Job well done.</p></li>
