I'd stay again. We also ate at the Ranch, great food!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">#102 is nice, clean with a full kitchen and nice view, staff is friendly. Your dirty dishes get cleaned while you're out- might want to show your appreciation in the tip envelope when you leave. I didn't notice any room to room noise but if your neighbors are out on their deck you'll hear them. The decks are walled off and private. Easy walk to Hana, located on the beach. What's not to like?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hana Kai for one night during a week long stay on Maui - and it was by far the most romantic, charming and peaceful part of our visit. We wished we could have stayed longer. You feel like you've left the whole world behind. The waves crashing on the beach was the best sound I've ever fallen asleep to. We highly recommend making a stop in Hana and staying here when on Maui. You won't regret it.</p></li>

Jaw dropping when we entered our room. The view is incredible, ultra comfortable beds and setting. We spent a fair bit of time just taking in the grounds there and enjoying the sound and beauty of the waves from our balcony. Played games rather than watch tv, did not even miss it. Beautiful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in Rm 206 which had been listed as a luxury condo. While it had some good aspects, it was definitely not luxurious. The main drawback was that the only sleeping area was up a flight of unsafe stairs to the loft, while the bathroom was downstairs near the front door. Otherwise, it was clean and had a small but well-equipped kitchen and a beautiful view of Hana Bay. Another room in this complex would probably have been better.</p></li>

Each morning we awoke to a beautiful sunrise and the sounds of the waves hitting the beach. Hana is amazing. The rooms are a bit dated and air conditioning part of the day might have made things a little more comfortable but just look out the window and you can tolerate a lot. Staff are most helpful and service is good. It appears to be one of the nicer places to stay in Hana.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our first overnight trip to Hana, so not a lot to compare. Our feeling is Hana Kai Maui offers solid value (for Maui, that is). The room was clean and tasteful (Unit #201). Comfortable beds. Small bathroom but the organic shampoo/conditioner/soap was a nice touch. The large lanai provided an excellent view of Hana Bay. The kitchen efficient and well stocked. All in all a good base for exploring Hana and Southeast Maui. PS - the only loud sounds we heard were the waves crashing onto the beach.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hana Kai is a nice place to stay for a night, maybe two after enjoying the drive to Hana. We stayed in a one bedroom unit on the second floor, with a good view of the ocean and it was very peaceful. It had a stocked kitchen and though It was a little rustic, it was also a decent price. We enjoyed a walk on the (rocky yet quaint) beach, explored Hana & as well as a day trip to the Seven Sacred pools. The weekend manager we met was very pleasant and friendly. Overall a fine alternative for the budget traveler.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here one night, wished we could have stayed longer. Tip: If you're only staying one night, start out early on the Hana Highway so you can spend more time in the Hana Kai. Pros: Idyllic location. Room was clean, well-maintained and comfortable with beautiful furniture, fully stocked kitchen with high-end appliances. Large balcony with ocean view. Ocean waves and cool breezes to lull you to sleep at night. Inn was fully booked but we had no issues with noise from neighbouring rooms. Cons: Free wifi signal was very weak so we gave up making a connection after six attempts.</p></li>

The Hana Kai had a much better view, lovely room with a million dollar view!!! It was great to have the kitchen with full frige, microwave, stove, and all the untensils (dishes, pots, pans, brita water filter pitcher, coffee, etc) you need provided for you. Also they provide full size shampoo, conditioner, and soap. The only downside, no ac. You get wind off the ocean with the huge doors out to the lanai. But during the day it can get toasty. We stayed in room 102 a studio. Perfect for a couple.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a wonderful time at Hana Kai! It was fully equipped with all kitchenware and a beautiful view of the black sand beach, which is literally outside your back door. We walked over to the Hana Hotel and were immediately digusted with the yuppie attitudes and unnaturalness of the whole place. They own nearly everything in Hana and act like it, too. So, it was nice to be with the locals in and around Hana Kai. Anyway, I would love to keep Hana Kai a secret, but they deserve recognition. This place made our decision to come back to Hana and stay another week. Thank you Hana Kai for such a wonderful stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed our stay here very much thanks to the beautiful ocean view, clean room, extremely comfortable bed and well-maintained furnishings, helpful and friendly staff, walkability to Hana bay & restaurants & groceries & red sand beach. The only negative was the lack of insulation between the upstairs units and ours. We were there three nights and were sometimes bothered by the sounds coming from the units above: voices that carry rather too efficiently and the distractingly loud footfalls of people walking around their unit. Still, I'd recommend this place as an alternative to the higher priced Travesaa.</p></li>

We were to stay the night at the Waianapanapa State Park cabins and when we drove into Hana to get some dinner to cook we saw the Hana Kai had rooms available, we checked it out and decided to book the room. We drove back to the cabin to pick up our stuff. We are glad we did beautiful room and great view of the ocean cove. We stayed in room 103 in the second building but we still had a great ocean view and the sound of the waves were amazing! Plus you are forced to disconnect from the rest of the world... there is NO TV! So grab a few beers, chill out on the lani and reconnect with your loved one!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here on business for a night, and at the time it was still called a "guesthouse." After making my reservation I had some apprehensions since the staff was not very welcoming on the phone, and it was pretty cheap, so I just didn't know what to expect. When I arrived it exceeded my expectations. The room was very spacious (more like a condo - includes a kitchen, living room, and verandah overlooking the ocean). It was very clean, breezy, and delightful. It is a small town, so don't come here looking for glamour or things to do - it is very relaxing. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the Hana Kai and enjoyed my stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a great 2 nights in unit 4-5, a 2-bdr (plus living room, kitchen, lanai, balcony and 2 bathrooms) that was beautiful. Seemed newly renovated and beautifully decorated throughout, from bathroom tilework to furnishings, fully stocked kitchen and perfect setting. Our balcony and lanai looked right over the beach/ocean and the way it was situated we felt nicely private. A beautiful sunrise woke us up each morning. Fans and ocean breezes kept the room comfortable at night for sleeping, in spite of no a/c. Would definitely recommend and return again to spend even more time exploring Hana AND enjoying peaceful time on the lanai and balcony.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We cannot say enough good things about this gorgeous condo. Our favorite thing, hands-down, was the crashing sound of the waves. It isn't just 'awake to waves'... it's "awake, eat, see, and sleep to" the sound of those waves. They are incredible.... we wish we could bottle that sound and take it home. The condo is incredibly well-appointed. We appreciated the well stocked kitchen, the very helpful visitors guide, the welcome flowers and tote (what a nice thing to do for your guests). When we return to Maui, we're spending a week in your condo. Three nights was not enough. Staying in Hana (three nights) was our favorite part of our 17 night honeymoon in Maui.</p></li>

The thing we appreciated is the view from the balcony, we were very close to the ocean and the view was great, of the black sand beach at hana bay. The whole impression of the apartment itself is it's a place that is not well taken care of, paint peeling off everywhere, a bit run-down. we stayed 2 nights there, in retrospect one night in hana is enough and we should have forked the $500+/night (christmas/new year pricing) at the 4 star hotel Hana Maui.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">STAY HERE! I am one of those travellers that seek high and low to find the best places to stay when on vacation. My family (husband, daughter, and I) love the beach, and this condo definitely has a wonderful view of the beach. We enjoyed walking on the beach in the morning and coming home to relax there later in the day. We ate breakfast outside on the covered patio while looking for whales-we saw several "blowing" in the morning and evening hours. Everything is exactly as described. Many extras in condo that we forgot at home-umbrellas, ice chests, extra beach towels. These were all greatly appreciated. Hana is truly a unique experience, and this particular condo was fabulous.</p></li>

Shayla is a great host. Condo had wonderful furnishings and we apprecaited the staple items such as spices, etc. in the kitchen. Kitchen was wonderful. Loved sleep number bed!! Loved the view and sounds of the ocean and rain from the condo. It is impressive to hear the rocks rolling on the beach. Only down side: we are from a cool climate and had a hard time adjusting to heat and humidity even though Dec. is the winter. Condo has no air conditioning although it is well ventilated with wind blowing, if it is still, it is warm. View from balcony is gorgeous!</p></li>

We spent most of our evenings out there enjoying the sights and sounds of the ocean, a great way to unwind after days of hiking and sight seeing. Thank you so much for the hospitality.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in room 101 with my wife and two teen age kids. Nice open air condos with good beds. We stayed here in July and it was fine with no AC, but a plug in fan helped. Ceiling fan in bedroom was stuck on slow speed so it did not help much. The grounds are very nice and there is a nice BBQ area below next to the ocean. Rooms are sparsely equipped and you may need to request more paper products (paper towels, coffee filters), but the staff was helpful. We started our drive to Hana later in the day and stayed two nights. That gave us a full day to drive to seven pools and hike the Pipiwai trail (best hike on Maui). This place was not cheap, but I would stay here again and spend the two days.</p></li>

Like guide books and beach towels and good olive oil in the kitchen.....they even left us flowers and chocolates for Valentine's day. if this is your first time to Hana, you'd be lucky to find this place available. We are travelers who do not mind things on the funky artsy low tech nature oriented spectrum and this condo would be great for travelers like us or a more comfort oriented traveler.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stumbled into the Hana Kai without a reservation and took the last open room. The prices were a little high to me (esp since we already had a place paid for in Kaanapali) but forget about that!!! Do yourself a favor and stay here. Sooooo relaxing, laid back, perfect location, and a lanai to die for! Seriously I have never felt more relaxed than sitting on that lanai drinking wine and watching the waves roll onto Hana Bay. (I really did conjure this up when having my teeth drilled.)The front desk girl was very sweet also. Hasegawa's has food and drink handy. It made all the difference to overnight in Hana and have the extra time for Wainapanapa, Red Sand Beach, Hamoa Beach, and the Pipiwai/Oheo Gulch exploring. Loved!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hana Kai 206 is a lovely, cozy condo on the Hana Bay. It was absolutely perfect! Exactly what we were looking for. It was a nice quiet, relaxing change from the hustle and bustle of the resort side of the island. The condo was in wonderful condition, clean, cute, absolutely terrific. I would recommend taking the road to Hana (a must do) and finish end at the condo. It's also very close to the rest of the Hana drive to the 7 Sacred Pools (another must-do). We especially had a nice evening cooking dinner, drinking wine and playing board games (that are available at the condo). It was the relaxing "get away" I hoped for. I would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling to Maui and would also stay there again in a heartbeat!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are trying to escape the crowds of tourists and looking for peace and quiet on your vacation, this is the place to stay. If you need a TV or feel naked without your iPhone or Blackberry service, you probably don't want to stay here. We loved our 2 nights in Hana, but there is not much to do at night. Daytime there are numerous day trips to waterfalls or lava tunnels, but with designated quiet time each night and a shortage of restaurants and bars, you'll likely find yourself going to bed early each night. The condos were large with great kitchens, views, and ammenities. I would recommend staying here and taking advantage of the kitchen and local grocery store to stock up the kitchen and cook, rather than eating at the few overpriced places in town.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">While exploring Hana we stayed in rooms 101 and 202 at the Hana Kai Maui. Lots of positive things about this place. We thought the location was great and loved the large full-size windows and sliding door to look out at the ocean from the bed (room 202, not 101. The bedroom in 101 faces the street). Though small and basic, the kitchen had everything we needed and they supplied delicious coffee every morning for the coffeepot. Bed linens were top notch, and everything felt very clean. They supply a very nice gas grill out front to use and they do the clean up. The only negative at Hana Kai was the very thin walls. You could hear everything through the walls, and I mean everything. Thankfully, everyone took note of the "quiet hours". Not fancy, but a cool place to stay in Hana.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I went to Hana to celebrate our birthdays. We were so lucky to find unit #206 available. It made the trip perfect. The condo was furnished perfectly and we loved that there were appliances, condiments, beach toys and things we didn't have to bring with us. We spent a leisurely day getting to Hana and saved the best for the rest of the trip. We found the beaches, waterfalls and hiking past Hana the even more fun and beautiful than the road there. Highlights for us at the condo were the incredible sunrise view from the lanai (worth getting up early for) and the richly remodeled bathroom with a waterfall shower head to die for. Favorite places on the trip were Koki beach, great sunset dinner at the Hana Maui hotel and the very best was the hike on Pipiwai trail up to the falls.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were in Hana over 30 years ago and stayed at the same resort. Not much has changed in Hana or the Hana Kai but unit 206 has been completely updated. Hana is a lush quiet spot with not much going on except for the beauty of the beaches, waterfalls and green green drives and hikes. We were there for 3 days and we wish we had more time. The unit had chilled beer mugs, an espresso maker, a great bed and a very romantic lanai. There were beach toys and coolers and an ipod dock along with a collection of DVDs. We were a little nervous about the road but it's not bad if you go slow. The owners did the condo in the same style as their unit at Maui Kai. Bamboo ceilings and cheerful furniture. The stairs to the loft are a little steep so you have to be careful. We left a night light on for safety.</p></li>

Well, I found my new happy place - it's unit #5 of the Hana Kai. The location, decor, ocean views, ocean breeze, and black sand beach - everything about our stay here was perfect. Waking up and watching he sunrise from your bed while breathing in a gentle ocean breeze .... I've never experienced anything like it. The only thing I regret is not staying longer. My family and I had an absolute perfect experience staying with Susie Pu and the rest of the staff. Every moment, from check in to check out, we were treated with a sense of caring and warmth. The town of Hana is an absolute must see when visiting Maui, and I strongly recommend staying at least two nights at the Hana Kai.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in Room #2, front and center. Great view of the beach, and we could hear the rocks moving with the incoming waves. It was very relaxing. We loved Hana more than anything else we did on our trip. Could have stayed longer! This was my second favorite place to stay on Maui, only because the first place we stayed allowed for more privacy. This is a great base for seeing Hana. Its a walk to the red sand beach and short drive to Waianapanapa and Oheo Gulch. My husband loved the more aggressive wave action at Hamoa Beach. We stopped at Mana for groceries in Paia before we came so we were able to have all our meals and cocktails at Hana Kai or while out hiking. However, there were PLENTY of options for food in the area. You will not go hungry if you have cash on you. If we visit Maui again, we WILL stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">These are individually owned condos, so that I can only vouch for Room 201 as the most amazing place we've ever stayed. From the spacious lanai, overlooking the black sand beach and witness to awe-inspiring sunsets, to the spacious and comfortable California king bed, one makes discovery after discovery that enhance these rooms even more. The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking, baking or (our favorite) BBQ-ing at the grills one short walk down the hill among the beautiful gardens. There's even an herb garden! The lack of air conditioning is fully compensated for by ceiling fans and the wonderful breezes that waft through the unit. The bedroom can be shut off from the rest of the unit by panels that retract into the walls to accommodate late sleepers. I actually did a video walk-through of Room 201 so we'd never forget it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great for 1 or 2 nights. Slightly dated but everything functioned well and the bed was certainly confy. Great location and very good value for Hana. Excellent ocean view from the end unit, second floor, in the back building. Room 207--I think. It's a rocky beach so the sound really travels. The ocean lulled us to sleep each night. Tip: Do drive out the extra 10 miles to the National Park Service (7 Sacred Falls). The "sacred" falls are nice but the real treat, if you're able to hike, is to cross the road and climb up to the incredible waterfalls. It's a 60-90 min. hike and goes through a magical and truly wonderful bamboo forest. The best we've ever seen. Get there and start your hike by 9a.m. and you will probably have the falls almost to yourself. Another mile down the road is where Charles Lindburgh is buried. Very Quiet....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed two nights in July in Unit 207. Beautiful view, unit was clean and comfortable. Really enjoyed sunrise from the lanai. We hiked to Waimoku Falls at Kipahulu, swam at Hamoa Beach, checked out the brackish caves at Wainipapa State Park, visited Hasegawa General Store daily. Be aware: finding a place to eat in Hana is a challenge. Hotel Hana Maui is good but very pricey. Hana Ranch: owned by Hotel Hana Maui (like almost everything in town) food is OK but expensive and the flies were maddening! Plus they don't open for breakfast until 10am! Tutu's had delicious teriyaki chicken and was reasonably priced. Both stores have pretty slim pickins for cooking meals...best bet: bring something to BBQ. Hasegawa had pretty decent veggies. Hana Kai has BBQ grill and well equiped kitchens. This is a wonderful place to stay and we will go back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We picked the perfect place to get married! We stayed in the two bedroom condo on the top floor and had the most beautiful view of the harbor, black sand beach, and water fall-ponds from the lanai. It was so gorgeous we decided to get married right there on the lanai. I can't say enough about this condo. The tastful furniture, fabulous bed/bedding, patio off the bedrrom, lanai with beautiful talbe/chairs and loveseat. Stainless steel appliances, beautiful breakfast bar, living room with huge windows, great bathrooms, local girls that cleaned the whole condo spotless! The people who own it had a book on the desk where people who've stayed there have written a note about their stay. The manager Stanley was wonderful and we called to him from the lanai to come and celebrate with a glass of champagne after our ceremony. Well worth every penny.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Didnâ€™t really like the look of the only room available (1 BR #3) online but the view of the ocean hooked us in. We checked in early evening so we didnâ€™t catch the view until the next morning. What a lovely view of the sunrise. The room has a huge lanai, but it definitely needs some sort of privacy screen and maybe some nicer furniture. We spent many hours sitting on that lanai just looking out to the ocean, sipping cocktails. The grounds are gorgeous but the room itself needs some major updating. Itâ€™s clean, had great water pressure and has enough amenities, it just looks pretty dated. Comfortable bed and awesome pillows. Not sure if it was the pillow or the surf pounding outside my window but I sure slept well. Has a nice community grill that we used once. Any staff that we encountered was very pleasant. We thoroughly enjoyed our three night stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was a little nervous about staying here but everything went better than I had anticipated. I called a few months ahead to book room 207 for one night, since I had seen pictures from another review and knew it was a corner upper unit. Everyone I dealt with for check in/out was very nice and courteous. The grounds were very lush and the outside of the complex appeared well maintained. The inside could use a makeover but was adequate. The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed. Since there is no A/C, the windows have to stay open to get the breeze which also means you do hear all noises around you. All was quiet pretty early (8p-9p) so going to sleep wasn't a problem. The bathroom was the biggest downfall as it seemed dirty and badly needed to be remodeled. If you're only staying one night in Hana, or you're on a budget, this is a decent place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hana Kai was awesome! The staff was so welcoming and helpful when we arrived, after our long drive from Kaanapali! The room we orignally booked had some issues, so instead of cramming our party of 5 into a small room, they actually give us two different rooms....so we had plenty of space! The no phone, no tv, no air conditioning concept was a bit of a shocker at first - but trust me it was so appreciated the longer we stayed there. The breeze from the ocean was amazing and the seclusion of the resort on the beach is so unique and well worth the drive on "The Road to Hana"! The rooms were well kept and the resort is very peaceful. The resort is defintely a kid-free zone - so if you need entertainment for your kids, you may find more at another resort. If you are looking for a beautifully relaxing place to put your feet up and enjoy a cocktail after your day long drive....this is the ultimate place to do it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in Unit 2 at Hana Kai April 20-24th and had a fabulous experience at this wonderful little place with amazing views of the black sand beach and some time to just relax at an amazing location. It rained every day we were thereâ€¦ but drove to do some hikes and find some sun every day. When you sleep in these rooms at night you are overwhelmed by the sounds of the ocean and the ambiance is unlike any you can find in Hawaii (and I have been to Hawaii 8+ times). But donâ€™t expect the amenities of the Grand Waliea - - but do expect an equally relaxing stay if you like the outdoors and donâ€™t mind cooking for yourself. I was a little concerned because it sounds like some of these reviews on this place are from overzealous condo owners that are simply trying to get people to book their condosâ€¦ but let me tell you if you stay in the lower building you cannot but disappointed. I hope to return someday.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here for two days after a drive down the Road to Hana. It was our homebase for excursions in that area, so we wouldn't have to drive all the way back to Tourist Town across the island. (I highly recommend doing this, by the way -- it really let us see a lot more of the sights on the eastern side of Maui.) After half a week in the hustle of Ka'anapali, this condo was a great place to put up our heels and cozy up for a while. The kitchen had everything we needed to make a couple of comfort meals for ourselves, which we enjoyed on the lovely patio overlooking Hana Bay. At night the sound of the ocean lulled us to sleep. Two caveats: There was no A/C, and if it hadn't been early December I bet the strategically placed fans would have had trouble keeping up with the heat and humidity. Also, don't plan on long comforting warm showers, or even a relaxing bath -- the teensy water heater for the unit runs out pretty quickly...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place was just wonderful. We stayed there for only one night, but wished we had known how wonderful this little place was, because we would have stayed an extra day. Some of our friends stayed in another room, so we were able to see two of the rooms. Both rooms were individually decorated with cute beachy decor. The rooms were very clean and so cozy. The rooms had these great dark wood louver doors both as the entry door and as the sliding doors onto the balcony that let the cool ocean breeze flow through the room. The night we were there it rained, so our last night in Hana (and in Hawaii) was spent sleeping to the sound of crashing waves and rain. It was so nice. My only negative comment was that there isn't much to block the bright sun from coming into the rooms in the morning. It would be nice if they had some window coverings to block the sun in the morning. I highly recommend spending a night at the Hana Kai-Maui if you stay in Hana.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in a studio room (#102) for 2 nights. We found the room to be clean and nicely decorated. It had a full kitchen, and included kitchen supplies--- dinnerware, silverware, pots, cooking utensils--- I think anything you would need to prepare a simple meal. The refrigerator even had a filtered water pitcher filled with water already. When we arrived in the afternoon, since there is no a/c, the room felt stuffy, but by evening, with the breeze off Hana Bay, it was comfortable to sleep with the lanai doors open and ceiling fan on. The room has a lovely view of Hana Bay, and falling asleep to the sound of the water is so relaxing. The lanais have privacy walls, but sitting out at night, you do hear the conversations from others--- but we did not have any noise in our room that kept us from sleeping. If you desire something more affordable than Hotel Hana Maui-- I recommend you check out the Hana Kai, I would not hesitate to stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are doing a one nighter in Hana, it is fine. They were rude when my family of four showed up, and I asked for sheets for the futon bed for the kids. They said the room wasn't reserved for 4, and they were going to charge me an additional $60 a night for the room. Are you kidding me? I specifically told the woman I booked the room with I had two young children, and would this complex be ok with them? We were already paying $225 a night for a one bedroom that had not been updated in years, with the tiniest kitchen ever, and no disposal! Then, wenwanted to do a load of wash. They charge $5 to let you use the washer and dryer, but they only let you use cold water and only the short cycle, which D does not get things clean. I asked if we could do a longer wash cycle because we had hiked in the pouring rain and mud up to the falls and had dirty clothes, and she said no! Rude again. Would not recommend this facity to a friend, and wod never go back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked a condo here back in January, for March 9th. Our family was really looking forward to our 1 night stay in Hana. We wanted to take our time to explore Hana and the drive to Hana. Well, on March 8th, late in the evening, much to our dismay, they closed the road to Hana due to all the rain; there was flash flooding and rock slides. We we unable to go. We called Hana Kai in the morning and they knew that the roads were closed so they gave us a full refund on our condo. I wasn't sure if we would get a full refund or any refund at all, just because some (most) hotels have the policy of once they get your money they've got it. It really helped with our trip to not have to put out extra cash for a night in Lahaina. Even though, we didn't get to stay here, I highly recommend it. Great service! Thank you so much. On our next trip, we will be staying here! We did make a day trip out to Hana a few days later and the grounds of the hotel looked very nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I wanted to drive to Hana while on Maui and took the advice of others to stay at least one night and not be rushed. We looked online for a place that would allow a one night stay and the Hana Kai fit the bill. I was able to call and make a resevation easily. When we arrived the staff was friendly and helpful.. our unit, 105, was clean and comfortable. Got a great breeze through the screen door to the deck. The beach that abuts the grounds of the hotel was really beautiful, as was the sunrise! We sat out in chairs on the beach in the late evening dark and marvelled at the stars. Do yourself a favor and shop in Paia before setting out for Hana, as the grocery options are limited. I will add that there are no shortage of roadside eateries that offer a lot of great food though!! Also there is no TV here, similar to many facilities in the area. Really, did you come to Hana to watch TV? :-) We would recommend Hana Kai and we would stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a gorgeous place to stay after the long drive to Hana. The condo is RIGHT on the beach with views framed by palm trees. This was by far our CLEANEST accomodations on Maui. The staff service was impeccable. We stayed in unit #1 the first night. A large 1 bedroom with a full kitchen, spacious bathroom and excellent lanai looking right out onto the ocean. We thought the hotel should have "sold" this unit a little better. On line it looks like #2 is actually nicer. And while nice (we stayed in #2 the 2nd night), it was much smaller with a tiny kitchen and smaller bath. The lanai in #2 is also wonderful. I think we paid around $225 per night and found it a great value. Their "ocean view" condos aren't that much less expensive, so go for the beach front condos (1,2,or 3). For access to the beach, the beauty of the grounds, the service, and the cleanliness this was a great place to stay. A room of this quality on the west shore would be at least $100 more per night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For once, the pictures on a hotel website are absolutely truthful. The Hana Kai Maui is a tropical paradise located next to a black sand beach with few sounds except the wind in the palms and the roar of the Pacific surf right outside your room. We stayed four nights in the only privately-owned condo on the property: Room # 206. Contact the owner, Shayla Middleton <shayla@awaketowaves.com> for reservations. The condo is well-stocked with towels, beach gear, kitchen appliances and condiments left by previous guests. It is sparkling clean, well-maintained and beautifully decorated in an "island style" that makes you think of the "old Hawaii" of the 1930s. You might have just arrived from the mainland on one of Pan American Airway's fabled Pacific Clippers! Finally, the view from the lanai is staggering. Don't be surprised if you suddenly burst out singing "Some Enchanted Evening" from "South Pacific!" Hana is the heart of Hawaii. The Hana Kai Maui is a great place to discover it!</p></li>

We spent 3 gorgious days and nights a unit 206 which had totally been redecorated from floor to ceiling. We love the king size sleep comfort bed and all the new appliances. My husband was so happy to have a desk and internet access as well so he could keep up with his business some what! The kitchen was so well equipped I felt like I was at home and not in a rental place at all! Thanks for remembering a winebottle opener too. The view is wonderful and we ate our meals mostly on the patio and enjoyed that part so much! Hana is a place no one should miss and the jungle and plants are so different from the rest of Maui !! Don't miss the sunrises and the art galleries ----- Cute "old" general store as well !! Hated to leave for Minnesota and the cold winter. We will be back to Hana Kai 206 for sure as soon as we get a chan Thank you vreny from Apple valley, MN</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in room 205 which is an efficiency unit in the 2nd building back from the bay. This building sits higher on the hill so you have very nice views of the bay looking over the closer building. Our unit, although a bit dated, was clean and comfortable and exactly what we needed for our one night stay in Hana. The bed was comfortable and the sound of the waves and nice breeze was delightful. This is an older wooden structure so there was a fair amount of noise from adjacent units. There is also parking lot both in front and behind this building so you get a fair amount of those annoying remote doorlock horn beeps and door/trunk slams. I'm sure many enjoy the black sand beach but it reminded me too much of a NE PA strip mine site. It's only about a 5 minute drive to Hotel Hana Maui where for $50/pp we enjoyed a great dinner. Considering the limited options in Hana and the fact that they will rent for single nights this is a great place to spend the night after driving the Road To Hana.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in Unit #2 for three nights in Hana. The location is great, and Unit 2 especially has a fantastic lanai looking right onto Hana Bay. The staff was very nice, but we had a few minor complaints. They were doing some kind of construction, both to a decorative pond area outside the buildilng, and to the unit above ours. They only seemed to work between about 10am and 4pm, but when they did, it was VERY loud. We mostly went out during the day (to Homoa beach, or to Haleakala Natl Park, etc), so it was just a minor annoyance, but if we had planned on spending the days in the room, it would have been a bad situation. The bed (Murphy Bed) was also not super comforable, but it was managable. Otherwise, everything was great. The price was good, and going to sleep with the sound of waves out the door is the ultimate in relaxation. Just from driving around, this seems to be one of the nicer properties in Hana. Overall, great place to stay. If you plan on spending most of the trip in your room (why?), make sure you ask about construction.</p></li>

We had booked unit #4 (Nanualele) the lower building corner, for our 2 night stay in Hana. Upon arriving in Hana, after stopping at a small outside Farmer's Market outside of town to pick up homemade pesto (Yum), we came upon the blue sign of "Hana Kai". Parking is at a minimum at the lower units, but never had a problem. Check in was a breeze. To our surprise the unit was even better than expected! Huge lanai overlooking the black sand beach & ocean, 2 day bedsin living rm, full kitchen, bed & bath. They have a nice grill on the bottom floor. We bought steaks at the general store and had grilled steak , baked potatos, corn & salad, on the lanai. The "Hana Kai" makes for a GREAT place to stay for a trip to the "Sacred Pools". If returning to Maui & Hana, would definetly book another stay at "Hana Kai! (Just be forwarned... when staying in the lower units, & having the windows open for night breeze, you WILL hear the fist size rocks washing back & forth on the beach!)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I found the Hana Kai Maui to be a great value. We had six rooms, counting the bathroom and patio overlooking the ocean. The staff was highly professional, making check-in quick and efficient. Several pages of descriptions were emailed to us ahead of our visit. Pay close attention to these, as we found them to be helpful and accurate. We would definitely stay here any time we go to Hana. Be sure to request an ocean view, and of the two buildings, the once closest to the ocean provides the best vista. One tip: bring breakfast food! There is no place in Hana to eat breakfast at a reasonable price. The Hotel Hana-Maui is beautiful, but its breakfast will cost about $18. We were not adequately prepared, but luckily we had picked up some banana bread from one of the several roadside stands and had that with the coffee provided by the Hana Kai. Oh, and don't miss a hamburger at Tutu's, especially if you've just driven in from the west, as the simple food at Tutu's tastes wonderful when you are hungry. Unfortunately they don't open early enough for us at breakfast (9 am or so).</p></li>

<li>The <span style="background-color:#911eb4">staff</span> was <span style="background-color:#911eb4">highly professional</span>, making check-in quick and efficient.</br></br></li>
<li>Several pages of descriptions were emailed to us ahead of our visit.</br></br></li>
<li>Pay close attention to these, as we found them to be helpful and accurate.</br></br></li>
<li>We would definitely stay here any time we go to Hana.</br></br></li>
<li>Be sure to request an ocean view, and of the two buildings, the once closest to the ocean provides the best vista.</br></br></li>
<li>One tip: bring breakfast food!</br></br></li>
<li>There is <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">no</span> place in Hana to eat <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">breakfast</span> at a reasonable price.</li>
<li>There is no place in Hana to eat <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">breakfast</span> at a <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">reasonable</span> price.</li>
<li>There is no place in Hana to eat breakfast at a <span style="background-color:#aaffc3">reasonable</span> <span style="background-color:#aaffc3">price</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>The Hotel Hana-Maui is beautiful, but its breakfast will cost about $18.</br></br></li>
<li>We were not adequately prepared, but luckily we had picked up some banana bread from one of the several roadside stands and had that with the coffee provided by the Hana Kai.</br></br></li>
<li>Oh, and don't miss a hamburger at Tutu's, especially if you've just driven in from the west, as the <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">simple</span> <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">food</span> at Tutu's tastes wonderful when you are hungry.</br></br></li>
<li>Unfortunately they don't open early enough for us at breakfast (9 am or so).</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hana Kai Maui for one night at the end of our vacation to Maui. We had a premium studio which had a queen size bed on the main level and a queen bed in a loft (with stairs.) It also included a small kitchen which was pretty much fully equipped (except it didn't have a dishwasher...not a big deal as we didn't make any extravagent meals.) The view from the lanai was gorgeous and we loved the nice beachy decor of the unit. Our children (11 and 8) loved sleeping in the loft and we all had a comfortable night sleep. A couple of things to note: The wifi didn't really work very well unless you were in one specific spot on the lanai right next to the rail. This wasn't a huge deal, but since they advertise wifi, it is worth noting. Also, this is a very quiet place with posted quiet hours (I think from 10pm-8am) Our kids are not very noisy, but I could see how it would be a bit trying for everyone if that wasn't the case. Staying here allowed us to take our time on the "road to Hana" and gave us a great head start to the Oheo Gulch pools in the morning before the crowds rolled in.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband, 2-year-old and I spent one night here to break up the long drive from Kihei and I am glad we did. We stayed in #207 and I was pleasantly surprised. Sometimes things online look too good to be true, but Hana Kai Maui lived up to the photos and descriptions online. The whole place was clean and nicely furnished and the small kitchen was well-appointed. The bed was quite comfortable too. What we all liked the best was the big balcony and watching the ocean. Since this building is the one closer to the road, you do get some of the other building in your line of sight. I guess that's the difference between 'ocean front' and 'ocean view'. The grounds here are well kept, with koi ponds that my daughter loved looking into as well as lounge chairs, umbrellas and little tables on the lawn that leads to the nearby black sand beach. The only thing that disappointed me about our stay was that the nearest beach had a fair amount of trash on it. Much of it looked like stuff that had washed ashore from elsewhere, so I don't know if the hotel can do anything about that, but it was definitely too bad.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent one night on Hana so our drive along that famed highway could be more leisurely, as well as give us a chance to bask in the moist, sleepy pace of Hana. The hotel itself is very modest by any standard, rustic even, but clean enough and charming in its own way. The room reminded me of a small cabin, sort of. We got a good deal on one of the central rooms overlooking the rocky beach, since our one-night stay serendipitously coincided with two longer rentals before and after. Great view of the water and beach, though it's of course vastly different than the sandy beaches of the leeward side. We found many Portuguese men-of-war scattered on the beach, quite nifty looking creatures. Mosquitoes and other critters (there was neat looking spider in our room that we put outside on the terrace for its own safety) are not uncommon, so squeamish folks may want to stay elsewhere. You're definitely closer to nature here than the typical touristy spots that abound in Hawaii. Didn't have much interaction with the staff, but they were pleasant enough. A good place to stay overall, given the few choices in Hana.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The other reviews that caution you about whether Hana is right for you bear repeating. We had done the Road to Hana on a previous visit to Maui and wanted to spend the night. From the road, the hotel has an almost motel look. The girl at check-in was obviously bored with her job. We stayed in #201, a nice but aging condo with a beautiful view. The day we arrived was pretty hot and humid and even with the fans in the room, we needed to keep on the lanai until dark when it cooled off. Like all hotels on Maui now, the hotel is a non-smoking property, which is fine but my wife will smoke two or three cigarettes a day and she was directed to a fruit bush between the two buildings as their smoking area. The big problem is that the fruit tree attracts a lot of bees. Not very welcoming. They advertise wi-fi in all the rooms, but the connection was spotty to the point of being unreliable. The rooms in Hana are scarce so you won't find value here. There's no competition, so they will charge more (about $300) than the room would be worth anywhere else. Our efforts to get a slightly later check-out were unsuccessful.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hana Kai is clean and the location is nice IF you have one of the units with a view of the water. We stayed in unit #102 which provided a nice view. We felt that #102 was a pretty spartan affair for which we paid $222 per night plus a onetime service fee of $20. There really wasn't any service. There is also no A/C, no heat, and no TV. Our room did include a kitchenette and there was a very nice propane grill available on the grounds. The trouble is that the options in Hana are really limited unless you split for the Resort so it may be necessary to stay at Hana Kai and just accept that value is not an option in this town. We ate at the Hana Maui Resort which was OK but also overpriced. We had read so-so reports about the Hana Ranch restaurant but decided to try it anyway. On a positive note, although the menu is limited in scope, we felt that the choices available were very good, as was the service and that the price was fair. Don't let this review discourage you from driving out to Hana. In a four week trip through the islands the road to Hana (and slightly beyond) was one of the most memorable things that we did. Don't miss it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at Hana Kai for two nights in room 205. It is an ocean view studio with a nice, large lanai. This room has a loft, but no way to get up there. It is not usable space. The room is for 2 people. The unit has been updated. The appliances are new and the shower has new tile. The bed is very comfortable. The view is very good. Hana Kai is a very good option for Hana. The two restaurants are pricey and usually require reservations. The Ranch restaurant is not open everyday. The General Store closes at 7pm and the small grocery store closes at 7:30pm. It is nice to know that there is a refergerator and stove and microwave in your room, in case you are hungry. So I recommend bring a few grocery items and getting milk and ice cream when you arrive. A quart of milk in the store was $3. Ice cream was pricey, too. We bought a few of the "Plate Lunches". They are big enough to share. They are really good and about $8 each. The hiking trails are often muddy. We brought old shoes along. I am glad we did not try to drive to Hana and back in one day. It would have been exhausting. Staying in Hana allowed us to enjoy a full day of exploring and a chance to rest before driving back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hana Kai Maui Resort My husband and I stayed one night at the Hana Kai last April. Our trip to Hana was a side trip on our week long visit in Maui. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hana Kai as did many others who previously signed the guest diary of room #2. Upon opening the door and entering the room we were greeted by a breath-taking view of the deep blue sky and blue Pacific waves crashing against the black sand. The glass door wall was open and you could hear the surf. Wonderful! The room was spotless and fresh. We sat on the lanai and watched the waves and surfers. There is no TV nor is one needed. Very relaxing. We slept on a Murphy bed which we found to be quite comfortable. At night we kept the door wall open and slept with a fresh sea breeze and the sound of the surf. Kitchenette was clean and was nicely furnished with basic cooking essentials. Hana Kai is a great place to experience Hawaii without the commercialism and tourism. Hana Kai is more than lodging. With its attractive setting and close proximity to the ocean, it is an experience. Would definitely stay here again, next time longer. Side note is we found the drive beyond Hana far more scenic than drive to Hana.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hana Kai (#104) for the last 3 nights of our 16 day Maui trip. It was a very relaxing way to end our holiday. The sound of the ocean at night and hearing the birds first thing in the morning are sounds we will never forget. The condo itself was clean and the kitchen was well stocked with dishes, utensils, pots etc... Our kids were a little freaked out when we first arrived and had some unwelcome insects crawling around. Being that this is the "tropical" side of the island, we fully expected this and after the first day, there weren't any more insect issues. We kept the screendoors closed to avoid further "guests". We had one extra "guest" each night and I really don't know how he would get in or out. It was the cutest little gecko and he wouldn't bother anyone, he just came in, saw if there was anything for him (insects) and left. No big deal and the kids were ok with him, they thought he was cute. The sofa bed was very comfortable. I highly recommend staying in Hana for at least a night or 2, we were able to venture out each day to do some sightseeing and hiking and not feel rushed.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Beautiful on Hana bay! It's a decent option if you don't want to pay the ridiculous prices of Travaasa Hana. Although the prices here are also ridiculous for the quality of the building(s)... but it seems your options are limited in Hana. We stayed in room 205, in the mauka building, for one night. The room itself was actually clean, nicely outfitted, and comfortable. There's a nice high ceiling with two fans to keep the air circulating. We had a good view of the waves crashing onto the black gravel beach portion of Hana Bay... it's not a nice swimming beach, but it is nice to see/hear the waves crashing from your room. My complaint and the reason for 2 stars is that the floors creak and the walls are super thin. You can literally hear everything that's going on in the other rooms, in the building and outside. You can hear your neighbors conversations and you can hear them coming and going. Also, the free wifi doesn't really work.. and you're not going to get reception. So expect to be off the grid while you're here, ie. no Yelping! to find local eats =) For $250/night, I'd unfortunately expect a little better. That being said, I knew of this potential when I booked, as it's mentioned in many of the reviews.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We wanted to stay in Hana a couple day and hike the nearby National Park. Hana Kai was right for our budget (Hotel Hana Maui - way to expensive) and the location from the photos looked ideal. The location is also ideal for the tsunami wave to hit the bay. Yes, we were there for the tsunami. At 9pm the manager called to forewarn us. At 10pm the sirens sounded. We packed up, but was greatful for her call. The one bedroom apartment was very nice. We were kind of worried when read the other reviews. But was nicely surprised when we openned the door. Clean, fresh smelling and fantastic views. We even spotted a whale or two while eating dinner on our lanai. The bathroom was newly tiled, new mattress, and everything was very clean. The staff was overly friendly and very helpful. The windows had all new screens and were huge to let in ocean breezes and lots of light. It was very comfortable sleeping weather with the windows just partially open. Plenty of places to sit and read, and the table had 4 chairs. The kitchen was amply supplied and no bugs. We would stay here again with no worries. The only problem was when other people walked their rolling suitcases on the wood decking it was loud, but we were asleep pretty early (trying to stay on CST).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Old Hawaii; simple, timeless, breath taking. What a find! Situated on a black stone beach on the bay all rooms have views from their balconies. We were treated to a (nearly) full moon rise and a sunrise over the bay. Spectacular! The area is lush, green and tropical. The hotel has landscaped with the lush vegetataion and flowers and intersperced it with coy pools and little waterfalls. You are surrounded by the sounds of water not only from the landscaping but the ever present waves breaking on the stoney beach. The sound of the water is a lullaby with which to get a fantasic night's sleep. (there are quiet hours here so nothing does disturb your sleep!) The only other sounds you hear are the birds songs and the breezes rustling the palm leaves. They also have laundry facilities. This was our mid-way point and we packed light so it was nice to have a (jumbo) load done at a minimal price. There are no TVs but you wont miss it--just sit on your balcony and enjoy! Rooms have kitchenette that ar completely equiped. If you are doing the "road to Hana" trip stop here and spend a night (or 2 or 3!) for a peaceful relaxing recharge and enjoy what this area has to offer instead of rushing the trip all in one day! Also try the fish tacos at Braddah Hutt don't the road. They will not disappoint.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We are SO glad we stayed in Hana for two nights on our most recent trip to Maui. We have done a day trip before but it was too rushed. Hana isn't for everyone but it is definitely for us! We considered splurging on the higher-priced Hotel Hana Maui but I'm so glad we didn't. The Hana Kai condos were very nice and we were especially thankful for the well-equipped kitchen, which we wouldn't have had at the hotel. We stayed in Unit #1 Waikoloa, which had a nice kitchen and an updated bathroom. We also appreciated the room divider which allowed our four year old to sleep on the fold-out sofa bed in the living room while we were in the bedroom. The view here is soooooo amazing and the sound of the waves will lull you to sleep. A few negatives: Musty smell but I imagine this is pretty hard to prevent in such a lush, damp climate; not much access to food -- BRING YOUR OWN! We stopped at Mana foods in Paia (which is a wonderful market) for fresh fish to grill for our first night in Hana. Next time we would bring enough food for both nights. We had thought that we would be able to go out the second night but the only restaurant in town (excluding trucks which we tried to visit but couldn't find an open one) got such bad reviews that we decided to grill hot dogs at our condo. Overall an awesome time in Hana and we will be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My mom and I traveled to Maui for the first time in late October. Stayed in Ka'anapali for most of the trip because we were attending a conference there. Decided, on a whim, to spend the last night in Hana because we didn't want to drive the Hana Hwy roundtrip in one day. Boy, was that the right thing to do! Gorgeous and exotic drive (be sure to stop at the Garden of Eden) and then landed in lovely, sleepy Hana, which was what we had imagined and wanted Maui to be. Loved it. And LOVED the Hana Kai. Very friendly staff, and wonderful amenities. I gather each condo is separately owned and therefore amenities may vary, but our one-bedroom (which was a complimentary upgrade from the studio we booked) was fantastic. I don't recall the Unit number, but it was on the corner of the upper building. Clean, spacious, brand new appliances, great water pressure, lovely lanai, incredible views...everything you'd want and more. We agreed we could easily return for a week or more and just hang out, relax, read, beachcomb -- in fact, we hope to. Will happily by-pass all of the rest of Maui and just spend time here on the next trip. If you're looking for nightlife and action, this is not your spot. But if you want seclusion, quiet, stunning sunrises, beaches that have more locals than tourists, and unparalleled natural beauty, Hana is your place and the Hana Kai is a fantastic option.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We rented all the rooms at the Hana Kai Maui for my son's wedding and we can't say enough good things about this very special place. First, the site on the black sand beach is one of the best I've ever seen, no structures visible from the patio and lawn, just a tropical paradise. Secondly, the rooms are all different and nice, and the grounds are so lovely, koi ponds, small waterfalls, and tropical plants. We gave all 42 guests continental breakfast every morning in their nice patio, which I prepared in our exquisite 2 bedroom condo. The first of the 3 nights spent there we had a barbecue cooked at their grill on the patio. This patio was a perfect place for all to meet and enjoy each other and the spectacular views. The large grass yard was ideal for the wedding. Of course the wedding co-ordinator bought all the food we needed and worked closely with the hotel staff to make sure everything went smoothly on the wedding day, and it did. The staff were so nice and easy to work with and you could tell they wanted to make this a very special time for us. It couldn't have been better. This is truly a unique location because it's in a residential neighborhood so you feel like you could be tucked away in your own secluded home. We had organized hikes to waterfalls and the seven sacred pools. This happened two weeks ago and friends and family are still calling to say they had so much fun in this wonderful spot in paradise.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in Lahaina but took the road to Hana and stayed there one night during our stay- which I would recommend doing versus just driving to Hana and back. Hana is very interesting- a ghost town paradise- 2 restaurants and 2 hotels to choose from (along with some sketchy B&B's.) We wanted to stay at Travaasa but I wasn't going to fork over a grand for a night. With that said, here are some pros and cons... Pros- the view- we stayed in room #4 which was an oceanfront condo and we were literally right on the beach front. All night we left the windows open (which you have to because THERE IS NO AIR CONDITIONING!) and listened to the ocean waves crash onto the black rock. Also staff was friendly and the room had a fully stocked kitchen- even utencils which we utilized for breakfast the next morning- and the utencils and dishes were nice- not crappy old stuff. Also the room was nice and big- full living room, and free WIFI! Cons- majorly (and I mean majorly) outdated. The tub had corrosion around some of the facuets, and the whole place is in dire need of an update. The bed was also very small- almost thought it was a full size instead of a queen. Even though the rooms were clean, there were tiny ants in the bathroom- not too many but several you could see from time to time. All in all it was an ok place, but I wouldn't stay there for more than 1 night again. If i were to stay in Hana again I'd save my money and stay at the Travaasa.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This condo building is stunning. We stayed in unit one. It had a massive private deck that overlooked the black pebble beach. The beach isn't a swimming beach as there is no real sand and the rip tide is dangerously strong - but the sound the water makes pushing and pulling the pebbles back and forth is like no other. Our room was huge and mostly glass so were able to enjoy the sea breeze and ocean sound very easily. The full kitchen was great, wish we had been able to put it to better use. Unfortunately there are only two store in town and they are not well stocked. Next time we will pack a cooler with meal making items. The bathroom was outstanding in this unit. Massive tile shower with glass door, you could fit about 6 people in there if you really wanted to! Bath amenities to use included Ola products, organic and Hawaiian made, and soft, fluffy Egyptian cotton towels. The bedroom area was great as well. Our bed was super comfy, the Egyptian cotton linens were luxurious and the pillows just right. No tv here, but there was wifi (however you had to sit in a certain spot on the bed and don't you dare move, and board games. The innkeepers are not nearly as friendly as the informational book stresses they are, most locals in Hana don't offer a warm and fuzzy greeting overall. The town is sleepy, the jungle is lush, coastline haunting and this condo is a great place to lay your head at night. I sincerely hope we can stay in unit 1 again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in unit 206 for 5 nights. I was worried before I came that I would run out of things to do in Hana for 4 days. But it was just perfect - very relaxing. We had to make our own beds, but I liked that feature because I didn't have to worry about housekeeping coming in and moving things around - and I was able to come and go without worrying about anyone else's schedule. I really appreciated the cooking facilities and the left over items from other guests - salt pepper, etc. We ate two nights at the Hotel Hana Maui - but I was glad to cook for myself the other 3 nights - because the Hotel Hana Maui only changes the menu once a month - and didn't seem to offer any nightly specials. We brought in food from the West side of Maui the first night - because there isn't much to choose from in the local stores. The Boogie boards available in the condo were wonderful. I had never tried one before and it was nice to get to try it out for free. The table for meals on the Lanai was also wonderful - we always had a pleasant breeze and a great view. I was very concerned about whether it would be cool enough upstairs for sleeping. But by running the ceiling fan below at full speed - ponited up - and running the oscillating fan in the loft we were able to sleep just fine. (Maui was having a heat wave during our visit - but I suspect that the temperatures were only slightly higher than norma. We loved our visit and would gladly return and stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We (mid-20's couple) stayed in room #201 @ the Hana Kai Maui Resort in August 2008. We were pleasantly surprised! Our room was MUCH bigger than anticipated, and very clean. We arrived at the hotel early, and the desk staff allowed us to leave our luggage in our room while we explored Hana (the room was not cleaned yet, so we couldn't "check in early", but we were able to at least get the luggage out of the car while hiking). The room had a great view of the black sand beach, and it had a very open floor plan which allowed for great circulation of air. When booking, I was concerned about not having air conditioning, but AC is completely not necessary due to the cool breeze blowing off the Hana Bay. We LOVED sleeping with the lanai doors open, listening to the ocean. Our room was fully stocked with anything/everything we could have wanted. (Cooking supplies, shampoo/conditioner, blow-dryer, board games, etc.). Sound carried between the various rooms easliy, but not so much that it was uncomfortable. I'm not sure I would have wanted to spend my entire vacation in Hana, but we were very, very happy we spent at least a night (if we would have done it over we probably would have stayed 2-3 nights). I would recommend the Hana Kai Maui resort to friends staying in Hana for a few nights. Again, we were pleasantly surprised. Also, the pictures on the Hana Kai Maui website are very up-to-date and accurate (espicially of the views from the rooms). Enjoyed our stay!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Let me start off by saying that if you took this exact property, picked it up, and moved it to just about any other location in the world, I'd give it a lower rating. But it's right on the ocean in Hana! The rooms were OK -- comfortable, clean, spacious, but a little worn and dated. But to be able to open the sliding door and hear the ocean in your room at night -- that was one of the most unforgettable experiences we've ever had. The place has a full kitchen too, which comes in handy because the food in this area is really expensive and there aren't a lot of restaurants around. Some people complained that there wasn't much to do in Hana, but that's not the point in coming to a place like this! If you're looking for a laid back, relaxing time with incredible scenic views and sounds, and don't want to spend a ton of money at a place like the Hana Maui, then this is the place for you. We've been to this place twice so far, allowing us to relax after making the drive on the "Road to Hana" so we didn't have to drive up and back the same day, and wouldn't hesitiate to stay here on our next trip to Maui. We found that if we can get a flight that gets in early enough in the afternoon, we can take the drive to Hana that first day, spend a night or two in Hana, then head back to Kaanapali/Lahaina and stay the rest of the time there. Or we just spend the first night near the airport and do the drive to Hana the next day. This way we get consecutive night stays in Kaanapali.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">All the reviews are accurate. This is a beautiful location and a different view than you would get elsewhere in Hana (better view than the fancier resort in town). Feels like looking out on a South Pacific island beach. The beach is rocks and great for strolling (when it is not raining). Continue along the beach around toward the point to really explore and eventually meet up with the old kings highway trail (a little hard to find). Swimming is 2 minute drive down the road at the main Hana beach. I wouldn't call it reasonable given that it is >$200 per night after taxes for the 1BRs. But the studios are just as nice (and perhaps better for two people since you wil have a view from your bed while the 1BRs has the bed in a back room with a patio looking o the street). But if no studios are available, this is still worth it. Our only complaint is that although the kitchen is well stocked with cooking appliances, utensils, etc. it does not have any of the main things one needs as a traveler who is cooking -- namely olive oil and salt and pepper. Those would have been nice since the key to this place is cooking in and eating on the deck or using their BBQs down on the beach. Ask for a room in the lower building since it is literally right on the beach (but there might not be any studios there). We stayed on the right corner of the top building which was fine but if we were more to the left we would be looking too much over the lower building. Staff is OK but not super friendly.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here during our honeymoon in order to break-up the road to Hana experience. Hawaii, Maui, Hana we found expensive in general but I believe that the Hana Kai gives good value for money in Hana. It gives you the solid foundation of being more of a hotel as opposed to a guest house - which I'm sure are all lovely in Hana - but with the Hana Kai at least if you have a bad room you have a possibility to change it (assuming its not fully booked). Hotel staff were freindly and helpful, the black sand beach is great, so are the fish ponds in the little garden. The shops are close by too which is handy. The rooms were lovely, I would echo other peoples reviews about noise travelling through - but to be fair to the Hana Kai, they do ask guests to respect quiet time and really, if you've made the long trip on the road to Hana, you pretty much want to sleep once you get there! The crashing waves at night are a great soundtrack. Kicthen was well fitted and they had baking soda in the fridge, which was needed after all the mosquito bits from the waterfalls (baking soda is a recommended remedy)! Also in the room were useful books, maps and board games for fun. The room was spacious and the bedroom very nicely decorated. Place was all clean and tidy and well presented. I can't really fault the place and I am glad I chose the Kai over the other hotel in Hana. I guess it really deserves a 4.5 out of 5. Would definately stay again for more than one night and would recommend as the place to stay in Hana.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Here's the deal - If you love being with the person you're with, and you don't mind a break from Maui's crowded resorts, then I highly recommend this place. Most people drive the road to Hana and back in one day. My new wife and I (we are in our eary 30s)decided to find a place in Hana, and our 2 nights there were the best part of our 8 day honeymoon. It's nice being pampered at the 4 and 5 star resorts in Kaanapali or Wailea, but Hana was the first place we felt like we were seeing the "real" Hawaii. In the morning we could hear roosters and peacocks on one side of the road and the crashing waves from the beach on the other. The beach at sunrise is stunning. There are two small general stores that are a 5 minute drive from the condo. There is also affordable horseback riding through the Hotel Hana - also a 3-5 minute drive from Hana Kai Resort. Hamoa Beach (Bay?) is 5-10 minutes from here - a gorgeous stretch of beach. Yes, it's a good idea to keep all of your food wrapped up in the fridge (we cleaned up every crumb meticulously), because there are obviously critters roaming around - but we never saw a single insect in our room for 2 days. The place is very clean and relaxing. Sitting on our big Lanai (we were in room 203), we felt like we were in a Corona commercial. I loved our 2 nights here - we were asleep early and awake early every day. Don't go to Hana looking for night-life. But if you want to relax and get away from noise and did I mention relax....?? Loved the Hana Kai resort and would gladly stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">the resort was beautiful but no one warned us that they have alot of thieves in hana. not so much in town but on the way to the resort. we were on our way up hana hwy and had plans to stay for 4 nights of our honeymoon at the resort. we stopped at a beach along the way, we were robbed of our luggage. yes the car was locked and we were on our way to the resort so we had everything with us. But that wasnt the worst of it, no police in hana really cared to help us, we had a big hole in our convertible car from the knife the theif put there. alot of rain in hana so we only stayed one night because we had to turn the car in the next day. no car rental in hana, no restaraunt that we could go into with the beach clothes we had on and only one store to purchase attire which wasnt open till the next day. the resort wouldnt let us eat in the nice restaraunt even if our clothes were stolen. but we could purchase a $100 aloha shirt from their gift shop if we wanted to. HA so we ate at the local baseball game which was the hi-light of the trip. do not expect the locals to welcome you warmly. The resort employees were very nice and the room was beautiful but if they dont get a handle on the theives it will ruin this resort. I didnt feel safe in my room after that and with no air conditioning it was a little scary to leave the windows open. so my advice is find a hotel at the bottom of hana leave all your belongings there locked up and drive up and back down hana. also note: this happens alot in hana maui (thieves breaking into your convertible so beware)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hana Kai was a delightful place to stay in Hana. I absolutely loved our room and the location right on Hana Bay couldn't be more perfect. We stayed in unit 202 and I would highly recommend this newly remodeled room. The bathroom was very cool with it's fresh new design and the shower was absolutely wonderful to come back to after muddy adventurous days in Hana. The small kitchen was the perfect size for me. I actually prefer not having a huge kitchen on vacation and find it unnecessary. This unit was very nice because it has a bed on the main level and another in the spacious loft. Before we arrived we were a little nervous about the lack of AC because my boyfriend is ALWAYS hot, but it was not an issue at all. The trade winds blew in off of our lani and the sound of the ocean was blissfully relaxing. Speaking of the Lani, it was very spacious and our ocean view was wonderful. My only complaint is the noise that travels in through the front door and how easy it is to hear your neighbors because everyone's windows are open. It's not that the walls are thin but that everyone is keeping their windows and lanis open so sound can sometimes travel too easily. The front door is a screen with wooden shades that you can close but it's not exactly sound proof from the noise of people traveling up and down the stairs and entering and exiting their rooms. The grounds were very well maintained and the black sand beach was perfect for late night star gazing. All of the staff was very friendly and extremely helpful in every way. I highly recommend this place if you are staying in Hana the price is reasonable especially for all that you get.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There's nothing impressive about the grounds of this little hotel. The decorative pool is green with algae and the building looks really plain from the outside. But everything else was great. PRICE. The price was pretty reasonable. After paying $300/night for a room at a hotel in Kaanapali, I didn't mind paying half of that for a one bedroom unit with it's own lanai and a newly renovated kitchen. Our unit was on the second floor (in the building closer to the road than the beach). It was nicely furnished (and I'm picky about decor). The kitchen was clean, modern, and well-equipped. Based on the previous reviews, it looks like some units may not be as well-furnished as the one we got. VIEW. Fantastic. The ocean is visible from the lanai and the living room and the kitchen. I didn't mind doing the dishes. LOCATION. It's right on a pebble beach. You may not want to swim, but it's nice for walking or for sitting and contemplating about a move to Hana. There's a great beach nearby called Hamoa beach. It's a great place to swim and relax. (The guests from the Hana Maui use this beach). HANA ITSELF. It was the best part of our 9 day visit to Maui. It truly is special and a world away. A FEW TIPS: Eat dinner at the Hana Maui hotel and go to the Paniolo bar to listen to the band. Buy some food supplies and eat dinner on your own lanai. It's very romantic and easy on the wallet. BUT, make sure to use bug spray specially at night (there were mosquitoes). There are no TVs, no phones (inside the hotel), no internet. If you must have these things, then perhaps a day visit to Hana is enough. The locals we met were friendly and courteous. Just be respectful and aware about where you park.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hana Kai Motel 2nd on our Honeymoon stay in Maui. We had chosen this hotel as it was much cheaper than the other option of staying at the Hotel Hana in this area. We wanted to stay in Hana after doing the Drive To Hana, as after reading many reviews of people so tired by the end of their day driving to Hana it ruined the experience, we thought it would be nice to be able to crash in Hana and then wake up the next day and finish the other attractions in the area. Hana has a clearly different feel/style than the other side of the island (ie.Lahaina). Hana is a small village like area, with only 2 general stores for buying food/groceries/etc. There are a few places to eat out, but the best restaurant we found was at the Hana Hotel (very close to hana kai hotel but very expensive). The views and experience of staying at the Hana Kai outweighed the negatives , although, would be remiss if did not mention that there certainly are some negatives for Hana Kai. For starters, be prepared for a very rustic feel. Although it does have a full kitchen/bath , no appliances are high end. The microwave did'nt work, the shower hardly worked, no a/c, no tv,no radio. Highly recommend stopping at the general store and buying or bringing your own playing cards/board games. Maybe bring your own ipod/radio too cuz there is no music/tv to play at all. No iron / ironing board, room service,fresh towels. Seems like a lot of negatives but this stay was pretty fun. Hana is a great place - but you can't expect much from the local lodgings. Even the high priced Hotel Hana has no tv or a/c. It's an experience - recommend staying for at least a day - close to Oheo Gulch, Waipanapa state park, Lava Tube. All lot of fun.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed one night at the Hana Kai Maui on July 15. We weren't sure what to expect upon our arrival in Hana, but were so happy to stay here! There are limited accommodations in Hana and we didn't want to stay at the main hotel, which was costly. We found this place online and the Trip Advisor reviews were helpful & accurate. There are only 18 units between the two buildings. Our studio was in the back building, but we could still see the ocean from our first floor balcony. Our room contained a bed, table and chairs, a small, full kitchen, and a bathroom. No phones or tv, but you won't miss them. (there is a courtesy phone near the BBQ/picnic area) We did have a ceiling fan in our room. At night, we left the balcony doors open and listened to the waves. We found the staff very friendly, although we only interacted with them when we checked in/out. There was a large family split up between a number of rooms while we were there, but the staff told us at check in they informed the family of the "quiet hours" and everything was fine. The grounds are beautiful with koi ponds and direct access to the black rock beach. I don't think you can swim here, but its absolutely beautiful and there are beaches a short drive away with swimming, I think. Hana is definitely a sleepy town with one general store where you can buy groceries to cook in your unit. Since we only stayed one night, we opted for dinner at the only restaurant, located at Hotel Hana Maui. We had a fabulous dinner sitting outside of the bar, opting not to eat in the formal dining room (you can get the same menu in the bar). I recommend their lemonade! We would definitely recommend the Hana Kai Maui for a peaceful, relaxing stay in Hana.</p></li>

<li>The <span style="background-color:#ffe119">grounds</span> are <span style="background-color:#ffe119">beautiful</span> with koi ponds and direct access to the black rock beach.</br></br></li>
<li>I don't think you can swim here, but its absolutely beautiful and there are beaches a short drive away with swimming, I think.</br></br></li>
<li>Hana is definitely a sleepy town with one general store where you can buy groceries to cook in your unit.</br></br></li>
<li>Since we only stayed one night, we opted for dinner at the only restaurant, located at Hotel Hana Maui.</br></br></li>
<li>We had a <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">fabulous</span> <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">dinner</span> sitting outside of the bar, opting not to eat in the formal dining room (you can get the same menu in the bar).</li>

<li>I recommend their lemonade!</br></br></li>
<li>We would definitely recommend the Hana Kai Maui for a peaceful, relaxing stay in Hana.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hana Kai 206 is loaded with artistic touches that bring the tropical beauty of Hana inside. We were greeted by a gorgeous flower arrangement on the kitchen counter containing perfect specimens of every gorgeous flower we had photographed on the road trip up. Showering after the long drive was very refreshing. The luxurious bath features a unique adjustable double shower head and luscious coconut soap. A lava rock sink and beautiful rock tiles with turtle impressions really added a touch of elegance. All the spices and little extras we needed to prepare our favorite dinner were found in the cabinets and even ice packs in the refrigerator - so running out the Hasawaga Store wasn't really necessary. But the store is only just moments away, with lots of history and interesting local information so we visited it anyway. The owners of 206 have provided everything you can think of to enjoy yourself while playing and relaxing here and on the nearby beaches. Their recommendations of things to do was very helpful and right on. We photographed fantastic waterfalls just a shortdrive away, captured magnificent sunrises from nearby Koki Beach and off the 206 lanai, plus caught some great waves with the boogie boards provided by the owners. The loft with bamboo A frame ceiling and king sized adjustable bed is beyond comfortable - often its a challenge to not nap your whole afternoon away. The black rock beach at the foot of the complex is loaded with washed up surprises from the sea each morning. Oh and did I mention how good the coffee tastes sipping it on the lanai at sunrise ? This is by far one of the coziest most beautiful places I have vacationed. Its like you are hidden away in a tropical paradise with all the comforts of home.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our second trip to Maui and we decided to stay at Hana for two days out of our 6 day trip. After reading the reviews and various travel guides we decided to stay at the Hana Kai Maui resort. It is a good deal for the area but not that great of a place. We could hear all of our neighbors (including bathrooms) and every conversation in the parking lot. Now, what to expect: no AC , noisy rickety fan (It never cooled our room), old kitchen, a few dishes, and a ton of bugs outside so no open windows. Overall the furnishings were old and in need of replacement. The major items were clean like the toilet and towels but the sheets and pillows were questionable. The premises and patio/lanai are nice. The best part of the Han Kai is that each room has its own guest book and includes great stories from previous patrons, I ony wish they had gone onto trip advisor to share thier wisdom (it was too late for us so read on). People talk about how wonderful Hana is, but my wife and I do not agree. It is pretty but the locals treat you not as a guest but as a nuisance (excluding Hotel Hana Staff which are being paid handsomely to treat you nice). I was really shocked how far it could go as one set of Hotel guests had their car pelted with cans and cursed at when they tried to park next to the softball field. Apparently it was a locals only event(call the Hana Kai and ask). If you like to experience old small towns with small town attitudes set against a beautiful tropical backdrop then Hana and the Hana Kai Maui Resort is the place to stay. Otherwise, I would highly recommend driving in early (bring your own food) and hiking the major sites and driving back to stay somewhere comfortable, clean, and friendly that appreciates your business.</p></li>
