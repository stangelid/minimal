<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We signed up for a Snique Away deal and were rewarded with a very nice vacation and hotel. The suite layout was perfect for our family of four and while we did not attempt to cook we appreciated the kitchenette. Nice big bathtub and roomy shower. Quiet rooms. Great location. Plenty of room to spread out. No complaints. Fold out couch was comfortable and spacious. Thanks Snique Away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I decided to visit old Montreal for the weekend and I found great reviews about this hotel. It definitely did not dissappoint! The staff were extremely friendly and always willing to help. The hotel was very clean and we ended up getting a free upgrade to a suite. The bed was very comfortable! We are definitely coming back to this hotel when we visit in the summer. Highly recommended!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent service with a real smile, at the desk, for breakfast and at the door. In the heart of old town Montreal, next to the Cathedral close to most restaurants. The rooms have a large bed and a good quality pullout for a family. The lofty shape is trendy, allows for light to enter the room, but does not have some level of privacy for a family. A kitchenette may be handy for some, but could have done without.</p></li>

The hotel only has queen beds, which were cozy. Only negative was the continental breakfast , which was just so-so and the upgrade to hot for $9 was ridiculous.</p></li>

My husband made full use of the gym and thought is was better than a lot of hotel gyms but I have to say that the spa wasn't really worth that much of a look.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I can't believe this lovely boutique hotel in Montreal is not in the top 10 list of recommended accommodations. We had a beautifully appointed suite with living room (including a sofa bed for our daughter), separate bedroom and full kitchenette for the price or a regular hotel room anywhere else. The setup is perfect for families, but the quaint, nicely furnished and quiet room would also make this a great choice for a romantic getaway. And the location couldn't be better -- right in the heart of Old Montreal.</p></li>

The front desk staff recommended a wonderful restaurant within walking distance, and were helpful in answering all of our questions. We would definitelyu stay here again. The close location to subway services made moving around the city in the nasty cold Quebec winter tolerable!

I didnt see any issues with carpeting or age of the rooms as others had noted. I think we got a recently renovated room. Room was great, concierge (Ettien?) was excellent he reall understood what we were looking for in restaurants and shopping, and the location cant be beat. My only issue would be that we were on the first floor facing the street so our room was a bit noisy and we couldnt not open our curtains. Otherwise great boutique hotel..</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One of the best experiences I've had with a hotel. The location is great, every staff person I encountered was friendly, and incredibly helpful. The room was bigger than we imagined, clean, and pretty luxurious (large deep tub, gas fireplace, Nespresso maker, two TVs, great bed, etc...) And on top of all this, they welcome dogs. No "dog smell" in the room, no attitude from staff or other customers, very accommodating in terms of cleaning the room when we were out with our dog. This will be where I always stay. Oh, and there's free breakfast.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I found it to be quite a rip-off. Nothing looked like the pictures the hotel website provided. Everything looked smaller. My room was supposed to be a non-smoking room but when I walked in, I smelled cigarettes. The staff tried to get rid of it by bringing in this ozone machine thing. The smell did go away but came back the next morning. That's when I realized that the smell came from the outside. Not only the smell penetrated the window so did the noise from car. However, there is one good thing about this room. It has a really nice gorgeous bathroom.</p></li>

Even tried to make up for past troubles (lost my laundry for a day) by giving me a special edible treat, which turned out to be spoiled! Rooms are soulless, and have found the previous guests garbage or crusty washcloth still in the room upon arrival on more than one occasion. There are many better places in Montreal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here over the Christmas and Boxing Day holidays. The hotel is in an outstanding location, directly behind Notre Dame and steps away from the shops and restaurants of Rue St. Paul. The room was fairly large, and included a small kitchenette. The bathroom was spacious, and had a separate (large) tub and walk-in shower. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel staff were polite and helpful. There isn't a gym inside the hotel; but they have access to a very small facility about one block away. There is free wifi in the hotel, but it was pretty slow.</p></li>

One recommendation that I would make if booking this hotel, would be to make sure that you arrange for a room on the second floor or above, it's a very well travelled street and you would get a lot of noise at street level. We had an excellent experience and would stay there again in a heartbeat!</p></li>

We had a three room suite (BR, LR/Kitchenette and Bath) that was like having our own apartment. There is a real neighborhood feel to the area and we were right around the corner from the Notre Dame Basilica. There are many restaurants in the area, plus we found a grocery store and a pharmacy within a 10 minute walk of the hotel. The staff was courteous and helpful and the service excellent. We plan to return to Montreal and will stay in the Saint-Sulpice.</p></li>

We had a large living room and bedroom, the bathroom was very large with a great tub and walk-in shower. Service was excellent, I broke the hairdryer in the middle of drying my hair before we were going out to dinner, and in less than 5 minutes they brought me a new one. Great location -- very short walk to the Metro. Only thing that needs improvement is the "gym". Outdated treadmills and very dark gym room. Other than that, I highly, highly recommend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I love boutique hotels and by far, the Saint Sulpice is our favorite getaway. It's located in old Montreal by the Cathedral and surrounded by great shops and by loads of entertainment. The food and staff are always spectacular, and the location is superb. I understand that there are options to purchase a suite. It is well worth it since there are many festivals that occur in Montreal such as film festivals, and the famous jazz festival. During the Christmas Holidays, they do a superb job of decorating as well. Overall, it is an ezqusite boutique hotel and charming in every way!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything was fantastic during each of my stays or visits to this hotel ! I went there a dozen of times last year for business cocktails as well as for a birthday party in a suite of the hotel. I can sincerely say that I was impressed by their team, the location, the bar and the rooms ! Nothing to complain about, we were always in for quite an experience ! This boutique hotel is one of the finest in Montreal. In the heart of the Old Montreal, a few minutes away from the business center as well as the Port of Montreal, business men and families alike will find a great value. I definitely recommend it !!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here with my mom and sister and we had a great experience (amazing location, great staff, clean rooms, etc.) EXCEPT for when we had a drink one night in the garden. We ordered a cheese plate and two glasses of champagne (didn't specify which) and the bill was $75 for the champagne. We almost choked it back up and told the waiter who returned with the "fixed" bill, which was $50 for the champagne. This really left us with a bad taste in our mouths in an otherwise wonderful 3-night stay with no other issues. We felt rather cheated - if it was indeed that much, at least let us know if the price when ordering.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location in the midst of Old Montreal. The highlights of the hotel were: nicely appointed clean room, quiet location, short distance to Metro stop, better than average gym and access to many good restaurants within a few blocks of hotel. Disappointed to find out that if you book with Expedia your room will not include breakfast which apparently is included for most other types of reservations. In this situation consider saving a bundle of money by eating breakfast in one of several cafes just around the corner. Also, conceige was helpful with directions but restaurant recommmendations were no better than our random selections.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Le Saint Sulpice was a delightful stay in the heart of Old Montreal. Granted, Montreal has some funky neighborhoods and unusual B&Bs, but we could stay in Vieux Montreal and easily walk to those neighborhoods--or take the metro from the Place D'Armes station. The staff at Saint Sulpice was very helpful when we needed any help, which was just once on arrival to adjust the air conditioning. Breakfast was included in the room price, also good because eating out every meal in Old Montreal can add up quickly. It is tres chic and the prices are too. The decor was well done. The bathroom was exceptional with large walk-in shower. All in all, very good value for the area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My mother and I stayed at this hotel and we thought it was fabulous. The way the rooms are set up - like small suites - was just wonderful for a vacation. It was as if we each had our own room, for the price of one. If one of us wanted to stay up late or get up early it wasn't a problem. One night we ate dinner at the hotel restaurant. Frankly, we were just expecting mediocre "hotel food." But we were delighted at the meal and agree that, for both of us, it was one of the best restaurant meals we had ever had. And for two foodies from Chicago, that's pretty good. The concierge was great. I left my sweater in a taxi and they scoured the city and found it. Wonderful!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We've stayed at Le Saint-Sulpice several times and have always enjoyed our stay. The hotel is located in the heart of Old Montreal just behind the Notre Dame Cathedral. The lobby of the hotel is warmly decorated and includes a cozy sitting area around a large fireplace. Through the lobby is a beautiful courtyard restaurant under white canopy. We've eaten at the restaurant a few times and have found the food and service somewhat hit and miss. Overall acceptable though. The rooms are beautifully decorated with dark wood accents and modern decor. Some have electric fireplaces and some have small balconies. The rooms tend to be somewhat narrow but still provide a comfortable stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had the pleasure of travelling to Montreal for the weekend and stayed at Le Saint-Sulpice. We had researched different hotels to stay at and chose this one based on the location and reputation it presented. We were amazed at the beauty of the hotel with the gardens and fresh scent as we walked in to the hotel. We were greated with a smile and were treated like royalty throughout the weekend. Our rooms were adjoined, as we were seven women travelling together for a girl's weekend pleasure trip. The rooms were large, beautiful and perfect for our needs. We really cannot say enough about this hotel. I plan to return in the fall with my husband for a romantic weekend. Thank you!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel, the rooms are spacious and furnished nicely. The hotel is not much for night life as for the bar, but everything is just a walk or metro ride away. Old Montreal is where it is located and it is awesome, lovely views and so many little places to walk into for coffee, dinner, or wine. The staff were helpful and eager to assist and were not looking for tips all the time. Typically we stay at Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton. This hotel is our choice for Montreal. People said the Murphy bed was not comfortable, but we slept perfect. Bathroom is large and plently of room for things on the counter and such. Nice touch also to have great huge windows that open for fresh air.</p></li>

We arrived late on a Thursday and were given an upgrade to an exec. suite which was roomy and comfortable w/ a fireplace and a spacious deck. All the rooms are suites of varying size so I wouldn't want to mislead anyone but as I said this room was ideal. My wife enjoyed a 1 1/2 hr massage in their spa which is not luxe but nonetheless clean and comfortable. There's that word again.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from a 5 day stay at Le Saint-Sulpice, and couldn't be happier with the hotel. The staff was very accommodating and friendly and it was wonderful to come back what is basically an apartment instead of a bedroom with a chair or two. The hotel is perfectly located in old Montreal down the block from Notre Dame and within a short walk of the downtown area. Breakfast was ample, it included fruit, cereal, yogurt, cheeses, croissants, sweet rolls, toast, nuts juices, and coffee or tea, if you wanted an American breakfast including eggs, bacon and potatoes it was $7.00 extra. We certainly enjoyed Montreal, there was a lot to do and the people there were exceptionally friendly.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose the word Golden because for me it means something that last forever or memorable. Sometimes it hard to imagine that you can find in a small hotel the same quality of service that you expect in one big five-star hotel. Le Saint Sulpice is a small place but well located in the beautiful old part of Montreal. At the courtyard I think they have one of the coziest garden that I've seen in the area. Pleasant place to welcome friends or a special person. And regarding the service, what could I say as they have two Clefs d'Or Concierges there just for you! No doubt that those two Golden Keys holders helped me enjoy the most of the city and then leave there with that memorable experience!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently hosted our daughter's wedding in the garden at the Saint-Sulpice. The staff was extremely efficient as we planned this out of town event: the event coordinator was especially enthusiastic and detailed. We were not disappointed: the rooms are spacious and comfortable and have great provisions for a family: we especially liked the espresso machine on our bar. Continental buffet breakfast is included in the cost of the room: fresh fruit and excellent croissant. The dining room was ours for the event, and the meal was of the highest calibre. the location is smack in the middle of Old Montreal - take advantage of the valet parking. Our entire party had only positive things to say about this location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great apartment hotel in Old Montreal. The room was spacious and comfortable with a really luxurious bathroom. Tthe public areas were very stylish, except for the restaurant which was a bit dark and severe for breakfast. However, the thing that sets this hotel apart is the staff - they seem to genuinely enjoy working there, which made it a pleasure to stay there. When the wireless connection in our room didn't work, four people arrived, one after the other, to sort the problem out till it was fixed. The location is great for sightseeing, although many of the restaurants nearby are touristy and mediocre. Montreal `grew' on us as a city and if we returned we would be delighted to stay at St Sulpice again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I knew I had picked the right place for my weekend stay. The staff was warm and friendly, the concierge was incredibly helpful, and within 30 minutes after I'd entered my room, a staff member was already at my door to offer free water and see if everything was okay. The bed was incredibly soft and comfy, and the bathroom had both a shower and large tub, along with ample toilette space in the middle for all of my things. On top of all that, the room itself was gigantic - probably bigger than a studio apartment. The hotel is indeed right in the heart of Old Montreal, literally just behind the Notre Dame Cathedral and only a few blocks from a Metro stop. Extremely convenient, warm, friendly and efficient - would definitely stay over and over again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I were looking for a weekend get a way and the Saint-Sulpice was a perfect destination. We stayed for two nights and took advantage of their package which included two passes to the Scandinavian Spa. The spa was only a block away and heavenly. Although we had a rainy weekend, our deluxe suite was very comfortable and inviting with a fireplace and balcony over looking Old Montreal. All of the staff we encountered were very helpful but I cannot say enough about the Concierge. His recommendations were exactly what we were looking for in terms of restaurants, walking routes and entertainment. We were also very impressed with the selection and scope of the continental breakfast. Don't forget to try the croissants! We would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Montreal. Enjoy!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We love to visit Old Montreal always something happening in this beautiful city. Our favourite hotel is Le Saint-Sulpice Suites, first class from the minute you pull the car up to the door. Valet service on arrival, smiling staff everywhere, fast check-in, bags arrived to our room in a flash and our one bedroom suite was spacious, comfortable and very cozy with a gas fireplace. Very clean and we appreciated the cooking facilities which we used for breakfast. Located close to the convention center we used the â€œunderground cityâ€� to walk uptown and do some shopping ok alot!.. :) Back at the hotel we went down to the bar for a cocktail before we headed out for supper, there are so many good restaurants just take your pick. We saw John Malkowich who was staying at the hotel for a movie production called Warm Bodies.</p></li>

I arrived around 10:30pm and needed a dining suggestion and the lady at the front desk gave me a nice place to dine about five minutes by foot. This historical section of Montreal is worth the stay. The architecture and history are very interesting. I had a delicious breakfast every morning by room service. Always arrived on time. The room itself is very spacious with a large bathroom and a great view overlooking the main street. My interactions with the staff to be very friendly and ready to help me when I needed it. The Concierge were especially helpful with directions and suggestions for dinner and sightseeing. I highly recommend staying here. Not many hotels in Montreal are as charming as this place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a lovely hotel in the Old Port, a great section of Montreal. An inviting and elegant lobby. Very easy access to Metro (you can get absolutely anywhere on the Metro), and close to many shops and restaurants. The Saint Sulpice has a very helpful staff who recommend places to eat, give great directions and are fairly quick to respond to requests. The only problem we had was our TV remote control didn't work (horrors!) and they never got around to replacing it. Great bathroom with separate shower and wonderful toiletries (L'Occitaine). One note is that, in our room, the shower had a frosted glass wall that was visible in the room, so if anyone was talking a shower, their silhouette was there for all to see. With small children it would be very embarrassing. For a couple traveling together, maybe not so embarrassing!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family stayed for four nights in a one-bedroom suite at the HÃ´tel St-Sulpice while I was attending a conference at the Palais des CongrÃ¨s. We were very pleased with the hotel. The front staff were exceptionally friendly and efficient. The lobby had a European charm, and the our room was very comfortable and modern-looking. (Although it was quite cozy for us, with a rambunctious toddler and a baby.) The hotel was very quiet, which was appreciated! The complimentary Internet service and nightly bottled water service were nice touches. The included continental breakfast was also good. The restaurant had excellent food at dinner, including a children's menu, although the service was average. The location can't be beat â€” adjacent to Notre Dame Basilica and very close to lots of lovely restaurants throughout Old Montreal.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Le Saint Sulpice for a long weekend the week before Christmas. The hotel was one of the highlights of the trip! The room was quite spacious, well decorated and very clean. The large living room, bedroom and bathrooms were all separate giving it a "home" feel. We even had a kitchenette. The balcony view of the back of the Notre Dame cathedral was very nice. The location was fine as well, we were right in the heart of Old Montreal. The service was great: we were expecting a little snotiness because are Americans but there was none of that. The staff was courteous and very helpful. The best part of our stay there was coming home at night and lighting a fire in the fireplace- it was just what we needed after a long day out in the cold. We will definitely stay at the Le Saint Sulpice on our next rip to Montreal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stay at the Saint Sulpice 2/3 times per year when in Montreal for business meetings. After the renovation works of last year, it was clear to me that imporvements have continued at the hotel. Staff was extremely nice, as usual; excellent service; location is right in the heart of old Montreal. I personally didn't like too much the new dÃ©co of the restaurant and especially the acustic... We happened to be there a day while a big group of probably 50-60 people from a conference were having lunch and it was impossible to listen what we were saying. Also somewhat disappointing was the fact that the minibar was empty, with just a bottle of wine in it. I know this could be used for own grocery, but when travelling for business and after a long day I find quite nice to have a drink without needing to call the room service! Beside that, I was again quite satisfied and will certainly return.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've recently stayed at the St-Sulpice as I wanted a special place to do my wedding proposal. One day before my arrival,I called the concierge (Patrick) who ended up working miracles for me. I told him: do whatever it takes to make it nice, fuzzy, warm and romantic. He had the flowers, the rose petals, the music, the candles, the fireplace, the violonist, the champagne, the strawberries, etc. His ideas were unlimited. Of course my girlfriend said: YES!!! Nonetheless, the room was charming, the rest of the staff was way up to par more so than many hotels I've traveled in. This staff takes their job to heart and it shows. Great bellmen and frontdesk clerks. Very few names I remembered cause they were all great. (Dave, Rafel, Mike, Julian, Mary-Helen). Wow! St-Sulpice, you know what it takes to be on the top, BRAVO! I will definitely come back in remembrance of this day. Thank you all for your great work!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in August. The hotel staff were always friendly and accomodating and answered all our questions. The room was wonderful -- tons of room, comfortable seating, nice view of the street. I wasn't too keen on the bed -- it was rather too firm for my taste, but I didn't really expect anything different. My only complaint would be about the maid service. While they do way more than I would expect (like washing the dishes we used from the kitchenette), it was a constant battle to keep our toilet paper and tissues replenished. We finally left a good tip for housekeeping and got some toilet paper. I almost think this is housekeepings way of getting back at the people staying in hotels (this seems to happen more often than not, and not just at this hotel). The rooms were clean, linens fresh, many extras available that normally aren't at other hotels, and the room service was superb!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perhaps we'd been spoilt by the fabulous Auberge Saint Aintoine in Quebec City, but the Saint Sulpice was a little bit of a disappointment. It's location is excellent, but the room we were given (which we subsequently discovered to be one of the smallest in the hotel) was hardly the "loft siuite" it claimed to be. In fact it was not a suite at all - just one room - and given that the TV was opposite the bed rather than the sofa you couldn't even pretend it was a suite. The bed itself folded down from the wall, which wasn't in itself much of a problem (other than having to clamber in over a large frame) but it was rather bizarre. However, our biggest gripe was the restaurant where almost unbelievably they allow smoking in all areas - I was just amazed by this. Also, they short-changed me on both occasions we ate there; once could be a mistake, but twice... Perhaps I'm being fussy but I expect better at these prices.</p></li>

He was extremely rude while informing me and my wife that it was for GUests Only!! He was shocked to learn we were guests. Check in was a disaster, as they could not find our rsvp( Good thing my wife printed the confirmation letter) After seeing our room, we felt better but it was dirty still!!! The bellman apologized and we returned to the lobby until it could be fixed. One Hour later!!! For the price we paid, they did not even compensate us with anything! Breakfast the next morning was good but the staff didnot have any information on bus tours and seemed clueless? Overall. it was not a memorable experience, and I unfortunately cannot reccommend this hotel. It is it worth 400$? Never!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A great hotel! As previous reviews mentioned; excellent service was housed here and all the staff that we interacted with were polite, smiling and helpful. The room was a deluxe suite (#216). Very nice size, bedroom was great and the bathroom was extremely comfy. The room also had a kitchenette, with pots, and dishes provided if you really want to cook. Two tv's in the room; one in the bedroom and one in the sitting area. The negatives were bad food via room service (just luke warm and bland) and albeit still a nice bathroom the tiles were starting to get warn. All that aside and you have still have a great hotel in Old Montreal. Approx. 5 min walk to the Metro (Notre Dame station), liquor store near by (1min away), and lots of great restuarants. Don't go to Eggspectations across from the Cathedral...its average food and packed with tourists. Try a little cafe or restaurant within Old Montreal. Ask the concierge. Enjoy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Le Saint-Sulpice is located in Old Montreal - a great location for walking to Chinatown, several museums, and the Quays of the Old Ports of Montreal. The hotel is small, and our room was perfect for our stay. We had a refrigerator, sink, dishes, and stove top. The hotel's stay includes a breakfast in the hotel's dining room. It includes breads, muffins, cereal, tons of fruit, great coffee, juice, and ambiance. If you want eggs, you will pay an additional $10. We stayed one week, and on the last night, a maid walked in our room with a huge bottle of water. We were leaving the next morning via plane, so we left the bottle. I'm not sure why we didn't get that water during our stay. One oddity was that we asked the front desk to call a taxi for us to leave at 5 AM for the airport. When we got downstairs, there was no taxi, so my husband walked to the end of the block and flagged one down. The main valet kept apologizing. Odd -</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was disappointed after reading the tripadvisor reviews because I was expecting something out of this world. This is a nice high end hotel. Things were clean, things looked pretty, and things were safe. It was nice. It wasnt cozy or unique or romantic. The bathroom had a walk in shower and a tub which we liked. The bedroom was set apart from the living room which would be nice for parents so they could close the doors while the kids sleep in the living room I suppose. There was a mini kitchen area where we made breakfast. The concierge downstairs helped us decide where to go to dinner and made reservations. All in all, it was a nice high end hotel. It was quite large so it did not feel initimate but it was nice. The location is nice as it is right around the corner from Notre Dame and across the street from a cupcake shop and a tea shop. There were a few restaurants walking distance. Would work well for business travel as well.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had the good fortune to stay two nights this February while visiting family in Montreal. We loved the service provided by the door and desk staff that greeted us each time we came and went. The guest rooms are luxurious and very well appointed with comfortable furniture. Our room could sleep six with a murphy bed, pullout and queen bed in the bedroom. There was a kitchen for preparing light meals so we kept the beer and wine chilled and popped some popcorn one night snuggling in for a movie. I couldn't get over how sound proof the rooms are....I heard not a pipe,voice, or car muffler throughout our entire stay.... we had amazing sleeps. We loved visiting the church next door - and how close great restaurants, shops and people watching locals were. With everything we needed within walking distance, we parked the car upon arrival and left it in the garage until departure three days later. We'll be back in warmer weather to see much more of Old Montreal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I took my husband for a weekend away to celebrate his 40th birthday and I wanted to make it a special weekend for him. The hotel was the perfect beginning to a wonderful weekend. Right from the front door we were greeted by smiling faces and helpful employees who made every effort to meet our needs. The staff were always very prompt with any requests (such as running right up to deliver an internet cable for our laptop when we had difficulty with the wireless connection) to calling for taxis for us when needed. The room was beautiful and even had a wood burning fireplace (we did not make use of this, but it was a really nice touch). The location of the hotel was ideal for exploring the old section of Montreal. We had dinner in the restaurant Le S on Friday night. The food was incredible!! Service from Simon was impecable and there was even a lovely jazz trio to entertain us. Overall we loved our stay at Le Saint Sulpice and look forward to staying there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and daughter (age 14) spent two nights at the Hotel St. Sulpice in Montreal. The hotel is located in Old Montreal and very close to the Cathedral. We chose the hotel because it offered a suite with an enclosed bedroom so we could have privacy. We were delighted with the tastefully decorated room, comfortable bed & comfortable enough pullout sofa; with the quaint balcony, and extremely professional service at the front desk. We also received free breakfast for 2 each morning and that was delicious too. I would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat. Another plus, the hotel lobby had a subtle but nice fragrance - verbena, I think. Really nice. This hotel would be equally good for business travelers, families with older children and friends on a weekend shopping/cultural trip. You can walk to the shops and restaurants of Old Montreal. Did I miss anything? Go there!! The cathedral "light show was kinda, okay very, hokey but still informative. Don't get me started on the bus tour....skip that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Le Saint Sulpice for 3 nights. We got in very late, (12 am), the first night & were greeted by two very nice & helpful staff members. Anything we needed the staff would immediately accommodate us & they also had great suggestions on where to go for entertainment, etc. The food in the restaurant was incredible, the chocolate torte was most delectable and the waiter, Martine, never rushed us, even after the restaurant was closed; although, the maitre de was not so friendly, he was actually very rude both times we tried to dine there. The rooms were so comfortable with a goose down comforter and big bathroom. My room had a balcony & living room which was great since we were traveling with friends; when they came over we could "entertain" in our suite. I loved the location because we were a step a way from everything...we did so much walking. The jazz festival was 5 blocks north, the port was one block south and touristy stuff was a few blocks away. I had a great time & would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Sulpice after Christmas through the New Year and were absolutely in love with it! We were given an upgraded room because it was our honeymoon so we had a huge room with fireplace, balcony (winter so not really useful), a separate bedroom, separate shower with huge soaker tub and a very well stocked kitchenette. The service was absolutely unbeatable....the staff were always polite, helpful and very prompt if we needed wood, towels or reservations. We were surprised with a unique New Years Gift and were always delighted with the turn down service with weather report in the evenings! The free breakfast was okay, we prefer Eggspectations, but free is free! We did not eat in the restaurant for dinner, but heard others rave about it. We also used the massage therapists in the gym and both my husband and I had amazing massages that were well worth the money. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about the Sulpice and would stay there again, actually we are planning our next trip to Montreal already!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For an 18th birthday/graduation present I decided to take my sister to Montreal for a long weekend. After hours of research I decided to go with this hotel due to the outstanding reviews that it got. I've stayed in many hotels all over the world and I've never been as disapointed with a hotel. The service was HORRIBLE. Right after the valet parked my car I realized that I forgot some things in it. When I approached one of the valets about it he rolled his eyes and sighed. Not called for! The next morning I couldn't find the tickets for my breakfast, which was included.. When I explained it to the girl that was working she was extremely rude and talked down to me about the situation. I also have severe allergies, which I communicated to the hotel before I got there and when we checked in. There was one really nice girl at the front desk, I wish I could remember what her name was.. Long story short.. My needs were ignored and I got blamed for the situation. Most of the staff weren't very understanding or very friendly. It is in a great location though.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for two nights this weekend. The location is superb - right in the heart of old Montreal. The staff are wonderful - they greet you by name once you've registered, the valet parking is quick and efficient, the registration staff lovely. The hotel lobby is tastefully decorated and comfortable. I had stayed here twice before years ago and loved the room. The room this time seemed to be missing something. The furniture was quite scratched and there was a blank wall with extension cords going to lamps - it looks like there should be a chair or table or something to furnish the wall. I don't think we had a queen sized bed but it was very comfy - with a big duvet. The bathroom is terrific - big, modern, clean. Having a little kitchen counter, glasses, bottle opener was great. We had a complementary breakfast in Sinclairs and had invited friends to join us. The continental breakfast buffet is very good - lovely little croissants and pains au chocolat, fruit, cereal. My husband ordered Ã  la carte and said the eggs, sausage, beans, potatoes were not great.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Fiance and I stayed here to celebrate our engagement in December 2011. We greatly enjoyed our stay. Excellent location allowed us to leave our car with their valet and walk throughout much of the Old Port as well is only a 5-10 minute walk from the nearest metro station which allows quick access to the rest of the City. We stated in a Deluxe Suite which did not disappoint, a great balcony, wonderful fire place (which we used daily) a large bathroom and a small en suite kitchen which was wonderful for preparing snacks and drinks throughout our stay. The Staff were all lovely and very welcoming and the golden key concierege lived up to their reputation arranging anything and everything we requested. We had drinks in the Sinclair lounge several nights and really enjoyed the bartenders there, they encouraged us to try SortilÃ¨ge - a locally made whiskey infused with maple syrup - this did not disappoint and we left Montreal with several bottles to stock our bar at home. All in all our trip was a complete success thanks to the wonderful staff and beautiful hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall, we couldn't have asked for more from Le Saint-Sulpice. The room was spacious, clean, and had all the modern amenities...stove, sink, separate living room and bedroom (each with a television), large tiled shower and sepate bath. We had two dogs with us and the staff provided great service. We were welcomed curbside by the friendliest of gents who was super with the pets and provided us with all the information that we needed. Having dogs is always tricky when traveling, but again, the staff was exceptionally accomodating. When we inquired about the best local restaurants, the staff was honest (and not pushing their own place) and guided us well. Right in the heart of old Montreal....close to the water and walking distance to everything. Courtyard-side was worth the small extra charge. The dog-friendly room was out of the way of the rest of the patrons which allowed us to take them in and out without bothering others, but quality of the room wasn't compromised because of the dog's presence. Loved the staff, loved the location, loved the room. Great place!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Ask for a room with a normal (not a Murphy) bed”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were allocated a Loft Suite and at first thought the many negative comments on this site about their Murphy beds were over the top as we normally like a firm bed. We are not from North America and had not seen one of these before - they can be folded back up into their frame on the wall to create space. This seemed strange since the suite had loads of space. With a 3 night stay, the bed did seem firm but OK on night 1. Night 2 involved a lot of tossing and turning with the lower sheet not staying in place as it was not big enough to reach under the mattress. Night 3 was the same, also affected by a lot of outside noise until the small hours (a Thursday evening) and I woke up to backache which did not clear throughout the following day. Otherwise, large well equipped room, free wifi and great location. The bed had a decent quilt and pillows, and the bathroom had a separate bathtub and shower. The shower was a bit feeble and (most strangely), the toilet roll was fitted on the wall opposite the toilet and out of reach. Good continental breakfast with juice, meats, various breads and croissants etc, and some delicious pots of panna cotta.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">this was our first trip alone since the birth of our daughter 3 years ago so we wanted it to be restful, luxurious and elegant. It was all three, definitely. Our room --- a Deluxe Suite -- was on the 6th floor and had both a fireplace and a balcony. The room, while slightly in decor, felt like our own personal pied-a-terre in old Mtl - we loved coming back for a late afternoon nap, cocktail hour on the patio and time to get ready for dinner in the well-appointed bathroom. The espresso machine was a great touch and continental breakfast on the Terrace was all we could have asked for to set off each great day. The neighbourhood is under construction, but there are still lots of opportunities for lovely moonlit walks down cobblestone streets. The hotel recommends some great restaurants on its website (see: "for foodies") and we tried two of them (thanks to reservations by the Concierge) and were totally amazed at the quality of the food. All in all, the Saint Sulpice feels very old school, quiet, and lovely - not for the party crowd or those who want the most modern feel - but wonderful for those who want to just enjoy a true Montreal vibe in a great area.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our first visit to Montreal and we chose Le Saint Sulpice based on the glowing tripadvisor reviews. We were not disappointed! Our room was actually a small apartment--separate bedroom, living room w/electric fireplace, kitchenette, balcony overlooking the outdoor dining area and gardens and a large, extremely well appointed bath. Grohe fixtures, a beautiful molded glass vanity, large tub and an enormous shower. There was plenty of closet and drawer space, the furnishings were very nice and the queen bed was comfortable with high quality linens. As a coffee addict, I especially appreciated a large, 12 cup coffee maker supplied with a more than acceptable blend--no tiny pot dribbling out foul brown water like most hotels. The location of the hotel is superb--right next to Notre Dame, an easy walk to the Metro and in the heart of Old Montreal. My only quibbles: some of the walls were scarred in places and in need of repair and paint and the carpet was stained and frayed in spots. As a previous reviewer noted, pets are allowed in some of the rooms and I suspect the carpet issues can be attributed to that. All in all--a very pleasant experience in a wonderfully unique city.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved this place!! Not sure if all rooms are suites, but ours was--two sets of windows opening onto lovely courtyard, complete with a wedding ceremony/reception to watch on our first evening with our fellow third floor residents. While not the full balcony we had hoped for, the windows opened enough so that it felt like it. One night we had a torrential downpour, and it was so romantic to open up the windows, lean on the rail, and watch the lightning and listen to the rain fall while staying dry... Water was delivered daily, the doormen and concierge were always attentive, every amenity was available, and the accupressure massage in the spa was, put simply, the best I've ever had. If they had an open appointment, we would have gotten a pedicure as well. You cannot beat the location--the waterfront two blocks away, all of the old city at your doorstep, the metro within 200 yards. (Only two suggestions: higher thread count sheets would be nice, and staff need to give more precise directions to restaurants. We missed a reservation because we hunted for the place we were sent without success, even with the map.) The price was right, and I have been raving about all the St. Sulpice since I got home. Thanks for a memorable 20th anniversary!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a lovely stay at this Hotel. It is centrally located , walking distance to everything. Science Center , Imax theater, waterfront, parks, Shops, restaurants, and around the corner The Notre-Dame Basilica. The Basilica has a wonderful light -sound and history show at night this is a very nice way to see the church. Our 12 year old daughter loved it! The hotel has everything to offer, outdoor patio seating and another restaurant down stairs This is where they serve breakfast. Our room was huge, large living room with kitchenette, pull out couch. French door opening out to patio. plenty of closet space. Great bathroom ,shower and soaking tub glass sinks, robes and plenty of L'Occitane products. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. We needed to get our car out to go to the Boidome area and it took less than 10 mins. This Hotel has a small gym upstairs and a spa. I didn't have time to use either. The other thing that this Hotel has to offer being in old Montreal most buildings have steps. Saint-Sulpice is totally handicapped accessible. They offer accessible rooms with showers, there is a ramp in the lobby, no steps to get into Hotel, and an elevator. I would reccommend this Hotel to everyone, Because of the great location, accessibility, and friendly staff and service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just returned from an overnighter at Le Saint Sulpice and cannot say enough great things about it. We have already recommended it to all our friends. Our Loft Suite was very spacious, immaculate, wonderfully decorated with European simplicity and taste, and made for an awesome stay. The leather loveseat and chair were new and comfortable. The full kitchenette with refrigerator, stove and sink was great - we could not remember staying EVER at any hotel that included REAL glasses (water, cocktail AND wine glasses). What a treat. The queen bed with down comforter was scrumptious. The faux fireplace was a nice touch. The balcony would have been phenom if it had been summer! The bathroom was huge, with ceramic tile, a large soaking tub, large tile shower, and beautiful glass vanity. The toiletries and robes were also top notch. The staff was incredibly gracious, and we felt very pampered and taken care of - from the valet parking to the moment we left. The location is superb, right in the heart of old Montreal, and walking distance to all the great restaurants and the port. We will not consider staying anywhere else in Montreal, and will definitely be back again and again. Perhaps next time we will try massages at the Spa! Thanks to all the staff for our wonderful stay - and we can't wait to return!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I had 2 stays here over a 2 week period on a trip that began and ended in Montreal. The staff and the location are fantastic. The rooms are beautifully appointed albeit with some questionable furniture pieces. Staying in 2 different rooms gave us a better perspective of things as they have used the same funiture to address different room configurations. We actually had 2 tvs in the second room - #614 which I highly recommend. Facing the inner courtyard is a good idea as it is very quiet in spite of the ambient noise of the air conditioning exhaust. Facing St Paul St can be a very noisy experience. The balconies are small but serviceable. A really nice touch is the L'Ocitanne toiletries that are provided as well as the complementry bottled water that is delivered every evening. The Chateau Frontenac in Quebec was charging $8 for a bottle in the room. Some other reviews have been critical of the continental breakfast but we found it quite good and it is complementry. There is a breakfast menu for those wanting a full breakfast. The concierges were really helpful, courteous and well informed, as were the rest of the front desk staff. The valet staff were also first class and the car came quickly when requested. The bang for the buck in this hotel is outstanding, I have already booked it for a business trip in August.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our son and daughter-in-law arranged a 50th wedding anniversary celebration at the hotel. The staff was uniformly helpful and gracious. There were 18 of us (including children) and when we checked in the concierge welcomed us personally and wished us happy anniversary. We were extraordinarily fortunate and the weather was warm and sunny the whole weekend. We were able to have our before dinner drinks and canapes on the terrace. The celebration dinner at the hotel was excellent. Each evening bottled water was placed next to the beds - something one never gets even at the most upscale hotels in Europe. I have a theory that there is a correlation between the quality of hotels and towels: the towels were wonderful. The continental breakfast was fine although it would have been nice to have had rolls as a choice. Some of our party ordered cooked breakfasts which looked quite nice. One afternoon some of us had lunch on the terrace. Although service was slow, the food was good. Our one caveat: there is deferred maintenance and the carpets in the room should be replaced as should some of the couches, especially in our daughter's room. Our room, though, was perfect as we had been upgraded. The location in the heart of Old Montreal, near restaurants and the waterfront, was superb. If we ever returned to Montreal there is no question we would stay at this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I recently visited the hotel and we were very disappointed at the quality of service of the hotel. This is our fifth visit to Old Montreal, we absolutely love the city and the sites. Upon our arrival to the hotel we approached the concierge to check in and was brushed off by one of the staff "alain" who told us to wait for his colleague to help us. He clearly was not busy but for some reason didn't have to time for us. The staff are not friendly, we have been to other hotels in Old Montreal and they are always smiling, saying hello and always willing to help and suggest places for us to go. When returning back to our rooms, none of the staff including the concierge would acknowledge us or even smile or say hello. The room was decent but not what you would expect for the price you pay. The sofa bed was absolutely terrible, the mattress was old and uncomfortable. The breakfast selection is poor to say the least. There are no eggs (extra charge), 5 slices of cold meats, small variety of fruit, cheese and toast. I've been to other hotels with a much better selection of french pastries, fruit, eggs, cheeses, etc. Upon checking out we were never asked about how we enjoyed our stay and were charged for items at breakfast without the staff telling us about it Overall we would never go back! What a shame especially for the ridiculous amount they charge.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and our friends spent New Years weekend here and I must say I do not see why everyone is giving this hotel such good reviews. Yes the rooms are nice and spacious, but that is the only thing that is nice about this place. The food was not good, it was not fresh, and tasted as if it was sitting out for hours before it was brought out to our table. The service was not the service of a 4star hotel. We had a mix-up with our suites, and were told that one of them was canceled; we did not get any apologies and were told that if they donâ€™t have cancellations we would just have to deal with it and share one suite, which was okay considering they gave us an upgrade to a bigger room, but they did not give us any extra towels, toiletries, or pillows needed for four peopleâ€¦even after I called and requested it, it was still never sent to us. My overall experience was not a positive one therefore I would not be coming back to this hotel. However, you get what you pay for and this hotel was not at all expansive considering the room size and the hotel location, plus they give you free breakfast, which was not bad. Another thing the hotel needs is a lounge or a bar, they have about five chairs at the restaurant bar. which is not sufficient for a hotel this size, and a little shop where guests can get things like coffe, soda. or meds without having to leave the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was lovely and very accommodating. It is located in Vieux Montreal which is a good tourist destination to stay in. The hotel is surrounded by art galleries, tourist shops, and restaurants which offer table d'hote meals where you can get an appetizer, entree, drink, and dessert for one price. Le Saint Sulpice is also by the water which is a nice area to stroll through. In addition, the hotel is located a few blocks from the Metro which can get you downtown. In my opinion, the only 2 places to stay in Montreal when visiting would be either the old town or downtown. The suite, I stayed in a deluxe suite, was nice and luxurious. My only complaint would be the size of the room for the bedroom which was a little small, but then again you're just sleeping in that room. Also, in the living room area, I had to stand up closer to the television for the remote control to work. I stayed on the first floor which was kinda strange since the outdoor dining service was outside my window. A white curtain blocked the inside view of my suite, but it was strange to not have the curtain opened most of the time. I enjoyed staying at this hotel despite the mediocre free breakfast which charged $4+ for hot food such as bacon and ham which weren't even cooked that well. The service is good though especially if you're only fluent in English, like myself. The staff was courteous and very helpful.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First off, I want to say that the hotel is a nice property, with great staff, in a beautiful area. But, I think it really depends what you are looking for, and what your preference is. For my wife and I, we didn't realize until staying at st. sulpice that we prefer a cozy (but good size) hotel room over a suite hotel room with kitchenette, and living area space. I think these rooms are ideal for people who have a family, or have friends over to enjoy a drink before a night on the town. If thats the case, st. sulpice can't be beat. As for the location, it's ideal for old montreal, but it's still a 20 minute walk or so up to saint catherine. There are many other hotels which are located more in the middle (10 minutes to old montreal, 10 minutes to downtown). But again, if staying in Old Montreal is your thing, the location can't be beat. Another thing which I noticed on tripadvisor were the comments about the murphy bed. I agree, there is simply no need for it, and it's not all that comfortable. The room is big enough, I won't need to put the bed back into the wall to save space? Also, the shower 'wall' which you can see the shadows from the living room just doesn't make alot of sense. I'm into chic and trendy things, but I found this unnecessary. So, I don't want to be too hard on st. sulpice (I did give it 4) because although it's not exactly what my wife and I were looking for, it could be ideal for others.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently traveled to Montreal on vacation with our teenager, and this hotel was recommended to us by friends who had stayed there previously. Although the room with our bed was quite tight, it was great to have a set up where our teenager could have her own space. The location can't be beat, the hotel was clean, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the continental breakfast included was good, although repetitive after 4 days. The croissants were outstanding, and breakfast is served in a nice outside courtyard. The concierge, bartender and desk staff were very helpful with directions and recommendations. When we checked in late at night, the person at the counter had not given us the correct amount of breakfast passes, suggesting that I speak with the manager in the morning. When I went to do so the next morning, the woman there had already been informed and had the breakfast passes ready for us. I didn't even have to go into explaining it. The location is in old Montreal, and the perfect location from which to explore the city. The only time we took our car out was to travel to La Ronde. I was so glad we had chosen to stay there, and have already started recommending it to anyone else traveling with a family to Montreal. We enjoyed staying here better than the Chateau Frontenac in Quebec (we had one room, not a suite there)! I only wish I had remembered to take the book which has all of the hotels in the group they belong to, of which all are suite hotels!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I -- 2 middle class Americans with modest travel experience -- recently stayed here for a long weekend. We were attracted by the outside courtyard and the many excellent reviews. We were not disappointed. We were treated superbly by all staff members, the hotel is beautiful and unique, and the courtyard is a terrific place to enjoy a bottle of wine, a glass of beer, a Cuban cigar, whatever. The hotel is a great mix of the old and the contemporary, and we really loved just laying around the room. Some people suggest Claude Postel for breakfast -- be aware that they have moved and I am not certain it is the right choice unless you are looking for pastries. Our friends gushed about Bonapartes for lunch but we went for dinner and found the place staid. So lunch would be the better choice and we do trust their call. Perhaps the true highlight of the trip was our dinner at Ferreira's, a Portuguese place. Pricey but worth every penny. I started with grilled octopus and went for the fruits de mer -- wow! and I am not even a big fish eater. My wife had a salted blackened cod -- again, blew us away. The staff was great and the ambiance upscale hip but not pretentious or uncomfortable in any way. (We are not hip or upscale!) If you are looking for solid bistro food near the hotel, we liked Holder's. Also contemporary. Not fabulous, but an enjoyable experience and very convenient to the hotel's location. If you are ever thinking you deserve a splurge, this may well be the place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I traveled to Montreal in late April because he was attending a conference which was located at Saint-Sulpice Hotel. We decided to add a few extra days to explore Montreal since we had never been there before and spent six nights at Saint-Sulpice. We found that the hotel was in the perfect location in Old Montreal, literally around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica, about two blocks from a Metro station, and just off Rue Saint-Paul, which is the oldest and most charming street in Old Montreal. There were so many sights, shops, galleries and restaurants within easy walking distance. We were very pleased with this hotel. Our room was spacious with a kitchenette, living room, desk with wireless Internet, and a large bathroom with a shower and soaking tub. We also had a small balcony that overlooked a courtyard. Our bedroom was a separate, small room and I was surprised how quiet it was---we slept well. We were also at the end of the hallway, so we did not have many shared walls. The decor was more contemporary than traditional. My only complaint is that the carpet was a little bit worn and puckered in our room, but otherwise we were very pleased. A continental breakfast was included in our room. It was fine but nothing special, as continental breakfasts usually are. We did not eat any other meals at the hotel, although they have a nice courtyard cafe that would be enjoyable in warmer weather. We found the staff to be friendly and polite. Overall, I would recommend this hotel, particularly if your budget is less of a concern.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently returned from Montreal after honeymooning for about a week at Le Saint Sulpice. The hotel was magnificent! My husband called in advance of our trip to request an early check-in, and we were able to get into our room upon arrival. We had a deluxe suite on the 4th floor that faced the courtyard. The bathroom was very nice with a large bathtub and huge shower. The bedroom was small, but very cozy and romantic. The bed was amazingly comfortable. We also had a fireplace and a lovely balcony. I highly recommend a balcony. I spent a lot of time sipping my morning coffee and evening wine while watching the activity in the courtyard. On another note, continental breakfast was included with our rate and available in the restaurant until 11:00 AM. And, nightly turn-down service was provided. Le Saint Sulpice is perfectly located in the heart of Vieux Montreal. Highlights located nearby include the museum Pointe-Ã -CalliÃ¨re, the bar at the Hotel Place d'Armes, and the restaurant Le Club Chasse et Peche. Make sure to escape the tourists, though, and head to other areas of town. We had great bagels in Montreal's Mile-End neighborhood and smoked meat sandwiches at Schwartz's on St. Laurent. For a fabulous brewpub, go to Dieu du Ciel on Laurier Ave. For sushi, go to Jun I, also on Laurier. The English area of town around Crescent Street is also worth checking out. We bar hopped starting at the Winston Churchill Pub . For a clubby, Manhattan-ish experience, go to Cavalli on Peel. For you gamblers, spend an evening at the massive Casino de Montreal. We won!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Really, a wonderful hotel. In four nights we kept waiting to find SOMETHING that would disappoint us, but never did. From the first Bon jour! as we pulled up out front, we were greeted time and again not with a robotic mumble but with a genuinely warm greeting, as if from old friends. Lobby was stylish without being weird, as was most of Montreal. Comfortable, relaxed. And the room - mon dieu! (Pardon the attempts at french - Montreal will do that to you!) Absolutely gorgeous suite with entrance including closet and a wonderfully handy little table to drop your keys, maps, change etc, then a well equipped kitchenette with microwave, refrigerator, stove, etc. Incidentally, we have stayed at some 5 star resorts (when we can catch a great bargain) all over North America and never before have we had a full sized coffee maker with TEN cups of great french roast every morning. Anway, from the kitchenette you enter the living room with a pull out couch, fireplace, and flat screen tv. Separate bedroom had a wonderfully comfortable bed with thick down comforter and another flat screen. With doors to bedroom closed was as quiet as our own country home - we slept like babies! Bathroom was beautiful with luxurious towels, great soaps and lotions, very elegant glass sink and extra large (two person!) shower stall/deep bath tub. Location is just behind the extraordinary Notre-Dame cathedral, in the heart of Old Montreal, with tons of stuff immediately nearby and a subway station two blocks away. I swear if I could have justified it, I would have made reservations for our next stay when I was checking out this last time!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Took the TripAdvisor recommendations on board and booked a stay at this hotel using Expedia. Got a great rate which made the stay even better. Friendly front desk staff and concierges. The room was really good, a big bath suitable for two and a separate stand up shower. Nice comfy bed and separate living room with TV - windows overlooked yard. The bonus was having a very well equipped kitchenette too. Great for making sandwiches and snacks for our trips out of the city. The fridge had plenty of room for our food too. Plenty of cutlery, plates, bowls and a microwave. The rooms in this hotel were as good as any European hotel I have stayed in. Now what could be better? The lighting in the living area was a bit too subdued and akward to control centrally. The glass wall between the bathroom and bedroom could distrub someone sleeping if someone else used the bathroom at night. The restaurant and breakfasts were really good with excellent service. However, some tables close to the restaurant entrance seemed to have lots of flies when we were there on several hot August days - not a serious problem but the staff could do with managing it. We went out to the rear garden restaurant one evening for a drink and it too was very dark and service was a bit slow. Car parking is extra but you are in the middle of Old or Vieux Montreal. Cab s arrived promptly on request and the local Metro station is 5-6 mins walk away giving easy access to other parts of the city. Highly recommended and I will have no hesitation in staying there on future visits to Montreal - way better than one of those 80s / 90s chain hotels that claim to be 4 or 5 star.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my second trip to Montreal, and my second stay at St Sulpice. I absolutely love this hotel. The service is top notch staff is friendly and helpful. I paid the additional nightly fee for a suite to avoid the Murphy bed. To me, it's worth the $20 or so extra per night to have so much additional space and a comfortable bed. We had another lovely suite- this time with a fireplace. The bathroom was larger than our suite from last year- we had a double sink and did not have the frosted glass btwn the bath & bedroom. Only disappointment in this layout was that the bedroom did not have a dressing table. However, we did have a larger living room. I love that they remember little details- like the personalized business cards upon check in, the nightly bottled water, and the card showing the weather forecast for the next day. I've read reviews here before about the free breakfast- once again I didn't try the breakfast. There is a fabulous pastry shop about four doors down on Notre Dame called Claude Postel. Drag yourself out of bed and spend the money you would have spent tipping the waitstaff for the free hotel breakfast at Claude Postel. It's worth it! Even in the bitter cold!! As long as CP is open, I don't think I will ever eat the hotel breakfast. We ate dinner on our last night at the S Restaurant in the hotel. The food was tasty, but not very adventurous, and was more expensive than some of the delicious meals we had during the weekend. It was what I expeceted food to be at a hotel of this calibur. Spa staff was great, front desk staff was very helpful, valet was prompt with our car, room was clean and neat. Another wonderful stay at this hotel- can't wait to return!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I had to travel to Montreal on business and within minutes of our arrival, took the smiling suggestion of the reservations desk and extended our stay to two nights. The hotel is lovely - shares one (or more) of it's walls with Notre Dame cathedral, yet is very contemporary, solid (read as "thick" walls so we found it very quiet!) and immaculate. We selected Saint Sulpice based on location, ability to bring our small dog, and cost - and it didn't fail our expectations on any front. It was convenient to include our dachsund in our plans (very much worth the extra $50 deposit to have her with us rather than kennel her) and the exceptional staff had all three of us feeling more than welcome. Kudos to the concierge/front desk recommendations - we were steered right with every request for the where-to-eats and what-to-sees! I strongly agree with the former reviewer's commendation about the valets. They parked our oversized van right next to the hotel - safely and without complaint - quick to call our room when they were uncertain as to how to lock the side cabinets for us. I loved our spacious room and small deck. Just behind the hotel is a perfect grassy spot to walk the dog (bring baggies! The lawn and little garden is well-kept). We found the down-filled bedding very comfortable, so our mattress was clearly not the same as the former reviewer's. Our only complaint became a little joke between my husband and I - that the towels are far from soft. We laughingly called our drying off "The Exfoliation"! This hotel far exceeded our expectations - especially when it came to service. We'd return - wouldn't stay elsewhere in Montreal - if it weren't for the seven hour drive.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the St. Sulpice from June 26 - 28. The rooms are very comfortable and spacious. Our deluxe suite had a sitting area with pull-out queen and a small bedroom with frosted french doors - this provided some but not complete privacy. The suite was appointed exactly as you would expect for a boutique hotel. It was perfect for our family of four including one teenager. Plenty of storage for clothes.The rooms were very clean and best of all very quiet - there was no noise from above, the street or the hallway - the room doors are recessed slightly and this may have helped. Our room faced St. Paul Street, which tended to be very quiet from 9 p.m. on and then into mid-morning. There was a building being renovated directly across the street so it did not make for the best view but overall was charming. The location is excellent. It is a block or so away from the very commercial and touristy section of St. Paul and you can easily walk to area restaurants and attractions. If you walk down St. Paul's in the opposite direction you come across more boutique type shops and less touristy places to eat along with art galleries. The breakfast was just so-so. Skip it and go to Claude Postel, one block away or Olive and Gourmando two blocks down St. Paul. The work-out room was small but suitable. The staff were very eager to assist and provided great service. The valet was very timely and pleasant. The front desk folks did give us a few vague directions and some incomplete information but otherwise were great. We attended an Alsace wine tasting in the garden - which was so pleasant - it is too bad they do not serve breakfast out there - it is also fun for an after dinner drink. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Le Saint--Sulpice very much. It 's in an ideal location just behind the Notre-Dame Basilica and just a five minute walk to the nearest Metro station (Place-d'Armes) or bus stop. We enjoyed that the rooms have a little kitchenette as the first day we went to the Jean Talon Market to buy salami, baguette, cheese, fresh fruits, and wine. The room came equipped with everything we needed to have an enjoyable dinner in front of the fireplace (dishes, utensils, wine glasses, etc--they even have microwave, refrigerator, and two burner stove). The included continental breakfast was great as well and we had good service each morning. Otherwise, we didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, but we did have some enjoyable meals just a few minutes walk from the hotel (Resident, Olive and Gourmando, Europea Espace). When we first arrived, our toilet made a loud leaking noise every five minutes, so we called down and a service man was in our room within a few minutes. He was very friendly and helpful and did his best to fix it. After he left, it started leaking maybe every 10 minutes, but we weren't going to complain about it. When we got back to our room from dinner that night we realized that it was no longer leaking. We assume that the service man came back to our room to fix it when we weren't there because it was fine for the remainder of our stay. If management is reading this--we are very appreciative of his help! The only reason I'm not giving St. Sulpice the full five stars is, while still nice, the rooms could stand for new carpet and paint and possibly new televisions. Also, the first towel I picked up had some long strands of hair stuck to it, which made me hesitant about the cleanliness of the hotel, but that was my only negative experience.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Arrived on 11/23, late in the day (for me) and tired. First room they had us checked into had red carpet stains. Second room they put us in was on ground floor right next to outside terrace. Murphy bed was lowered by staff so didn't notice the dried orange fluid (orange juice/vomit?) on the frame of the murphy bed until the next morning. Yuck! Place is nice but not spectacular, for the amt of $, if you can get another hotel w/a WARM breakfast take it. Their breakfast is a choice of 3 cereals, 3 types of cold pastries, dried fruit and yogurt). The concierges: Maxim, Etienne and Alan were very informative. Housekeeper Guadalupe was very sweet. Overall nice stay, but not something to rage about. Next time, I'll try a different place. Definitely recommend you check out the room, even under the sheets, before accepting it. Also, on the Friday nite that we were there the downstairs bar hosted a very loud party which went on until the wee morning hours. I was awoken at 4 am by people smoking and laughing loudly in the outside terrace. If business travel is what you are after, you may want to opt for a quieter place. Although the staff were very apologetic to the hotel guests the next morning, that wasn't going to replace the sleep everyone had lost the nite before. It should be noted that the entire hotel only has ONE pc for internet access and it's in the lobby next to the valet, no privacy and sometimes you have to queue up to use it. Last note: The murphy bed is located next to the kitchenette. I am a light sleeper and was awoken on the 2nd nite by a dripping noise that resembled Chinese torture. I turned on the fan to muffle the sound and woke up with a sore throat the next day. I couldn't locate the origin of the drops, but definitely don't stay in room #120 if you're a light sleeper.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First off all, I don't know why the other reviews talk down about the Murphy Bed. It was just a trendy furniture with a real mattress. I've stayed previously with my girlfriend in a Deluxe closed bedroom last time and I can assure you that it is the same mattress and firmness with a tad of heavenly soft on the top. Now to the good stuff. As it was our second stay, we knew very well where we were going. The hotel is super well located in the heart of Old Montreal behind the Notre-Dame Basilica which is holding an Exhibition on the artifacts of the Vatican's museum. You should go and have a look. WOW! The staff as usual was very pleasant and helpful. Some of them even recognized us from a year before. I took the time to remember some of the names of many good employees such as Michael, Rafal, Dave, Luis and the lovely Anthea. Although we had been here before, we made sure to look for the Chef Concierge Patrick who had given us great restaurant recommendations last time. He gave us the 411 on what was happening and the new restaurants we should try out and the new whereabouts for shopping. Wow! Once again he didn't fell us and sent us to great eating places (Club Chasse et Peche, Version Laurent Godbout, Europea and Boris Bistro). Last but not least, we had been referred by Julien to try out the lunch on the MAGNIFICENT terrasse in the back. They have this hidden garden located in the back of the hotel and the kitchen cooks BBQ grilled meat and vegetables outside in front of you. Food was delicious and the service way up there just like the hotel. I took time to remember two fantastic waiters, Bojan and Etiene I think. In sum, all I can say is that becoming the best is easy but staying the best is the hardest part and all of you at the St-Sulpice seemed to know what it takes to stay on TOP. Great job and keep it up!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a very late review and is coming on the heels of some terrible service at another hotel. This bad experience had me thinking "jeez, these guys need to learn a little customer service from..... and Woila...Le Saint Sulpice popped in my mind. I was traveling on business for what turned out to be a difficult customer install which left me stressed out at the end of every day. So it was great to come back to a very welcoming staff and clean elegant room everyday. With a great neighborhood full of shops, restaurants , and art galleries I never had to venture far if I didn't want to. Then there is the beautiful church right on the corner along with the charming narrow cobblestone streets which made you really feel like you were in "Old World" Montreal. On top of the great ambience, the service I received was the best. I had arrived during hockey playoffs and was intent on watching my favorite team being a die hard team. Cruising the channels I couldn't find it and was scrambling to figure out what station it might be on. Not knowing the stations in Canada, I called down to the front desk. The desk immediately sent some one up( someone into sports) and they went through all the channels with me and when we couldn't find it, he then used the internet to verify what station it should've been on(which it wasn;t) after apologizing for something that was beyond his control, I thanked him and proceeded to stew about not being able to watch. Ten minutes later, he comes back up and had found a canadian site streaming the game online. I promptly found the site and ended up happily watching the game. While this may seem trivial, to me it was going the extra mile as he saw how p***** off I was. They were also great with tips on restaurants, directions etc. I gladly recommend this place and look forward to bringing the wife back for a romantic trip.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Fabulous hotel - terrible restaurant”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Le Saint-Sulpice for 6 nights with our 19 month old daughter. Having a toddler it was important to stay in a hotel with a separate bedroom as well as kitchen facilities. I would definately reccommend Le Saint-Sulpice for this! Great spacious, clean rooms with fabulous facilities. We got one with a terrace and had dinner outside most nights. The location of the hotel is also fantastic. Right in the old town of Montreal with cobbled streets, restaurants and a childrens playground at the old Port. There is also a fantastic childrens day nursery with spa facilities for parents about a 20 minute walk down Rue Notre Dame called Parentheses Montreal. A MUST for anyone with kids! The only dissappointment was the hotel restaurant where we had breakfast each morning. Since we stayed for 6 nights it shouldn't have been a surprise that we wanted a high-chair each morning but unfortunately we had to ask every day and they would have to go and fetch a usually soaking wet chair (left out in the rain all night!) which they would then dry and give to us for the baby. We would have to beg for coffee and butter for our toast - usually got it after about 3 requests. Also, the breakfast was the same for all 6 days! Not even a change of yoghurt choice or fruit.Not what I'd expect from a 4 star hotel. We also ordered room service (which comes from the hotel restaurant). We ordered chicken for our daughter which was undercooked when it arrived. Since she was so hungry we didnt send it back but microwaved it to ensure it was fully cooked. It was also overcharged on the room service bill. When we complainted to the restaurant manager he refused to belive it had been undercooked and said that the chicken they use sometimes looks rose coloured when cooked and then went into detailed explanations about their cooking techniques! For $22 I'd expect fully cooked chicken! In summary - fantastic hotel but avoid the restaurant.</p></li>
