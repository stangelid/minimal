They didn't and didn't make much of an effort to find me a room elsewhere: the best they could come up with, after 30 minutes of trying, was a hotel an hour out of town.</p></li>

Front desk is poor on check in and rooms are a closet. Restaurant is poor service and valet will take over 20 minutes to get your car. Find another hotel so you can enjoy your stay in Chicago.</p></li>

Wireless Internet would be a great addition (they still have Ethernet plug in option), but like I said, it's older.

At the lower end of a four star hotel but that is reflected in the cost which is very reasonable. Smallish but comfortable room, small but well-equipped clean bathroom with complimentary toiletries. Free newspaper delivered to room every morning.</p></li>

Both my husband and I never even saw a mini bar in our room, and definitely were not drinking during this trip (ie: was not possible for us to do this negligently). I am pissed.</p></li>

We pulled into the parking across the street--$35/day. No coffeepot in room, but everything else total luxury.</p></li>

Staff were friendly and helpful at all times and the room we had (which i think was a standard) was spacious and very nicely furnished. In my opinion you would be paying a lot more for a better hotel than this and unless you were splashing out for a honeymoon or something i wouldn't bother.</p></li>

Our room was classically dressed, clean and quite large enough for 2 people. Bathroom was roomy as well. What really stood out to us, was the incredible serice EVERYONE on the staff gave. We were always greeted and doors held open for us. The concierge was most helpful with tickets to museums, maps and specific directions for the L & buses. Fornetto Mei was just as wonderful. We will certainly stay again at this old gem of a place!</p></li>

<li><span style="background-color:#808000">Bathroom</span> was <span style="background-color:#808000">roomy</span> as well.</br></br></li>

<li>We were always greeted and doors held open for us.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#911eb4">concierge</span> was <span style="background-color:#911eb4">most helpful</span> with tickets to museums, maps and specific directions for the L & buses.</br></br></li>

Although the bar and lobby faintly echo lost days of glory, the halls were dirty and smelled stale, the rooms had damaged furniture, the bathrooms are tiny and dark. Worse, the manager was surly and the persons who parked our vehicle were careless with items stored in the vehicle. It appeared that it was given the "Ferris Bueller" treatment.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I don't understand how a hotel plans to make a good impression on its clientele if when you arrive they tell you - "Sorry, we overbooked so we will need to send you to another hotel." May I also say that I booked the room at normal price - $350/night - and this fact still didn't guarantee me a room. Very poor planning by a, supposedly, 4-5 star hotel. Then they think I will simply forget about the problem and come back the next day when they have room available. Sorry guys, you just lost my business forever. Good luck to you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent 1 night here while spending two days downtown Chicago to shop and to see the sights. The hotel was fine. Nothing special except a great location to North Michigan Avenue. Room was small but comfy and quiet. Really all you need for a nights sleep. USA Toady delivered to door in morning and coffee or tea downstairs. Parked at 120E Walton in the Bloomingdale's building. 24 hours for $27.25 plus tip. One block walk. Reasonable. Lunched and breakfasted at Foodlife in the Water Tower Place across street. Great selection and price!</p></li>

Our internet connection was not working so they gave us a pass for free wireless access. Concierge seemed to be very helpful as well. The highlight was probably the beds. Best bed/pillows I've ever slept on. As 5-star hotels go the Whitehall is probably not up there with the Four Seasons...but neither was the price. Definitely a better value for the money than other options in Chicago (we would have paid more to stay at a Best Western).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked our stay on Hotwire and received a very reasonable rate. Although I agree with several reviews that the Whitehall's glory days may have passed, we had a very nice stay. For location and sleep comfort, you can't beat it! Also, housekeeping was prompt and friendly, and the service overall was outstanding. Rooms are well-appointed even if not terribly large--it is a big city, after all, so small rooms can be the norm. If you're looking for a reasonably priced boutique hotel near the Magnificent Mile, be sure to check out The Whitehall.</p></li>

Tile was chipped and broken around the toilet.The thermostat did not work in our room and when I reported it to the front desk they said that was a common problem in their rooms. The overall appearance of the common areas was very worn. I would find it very difficult to rate this a 3 star hotel and certainly not a 4 star.</p></li>

I know that the restaurants are often leased to other operators, but hotels that lease their restaurants need to understand that the restauran is a direct reflection on the guest experience and the hotels brand reputation.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved this hotel, tucked away in the Gold Coast, yet quite accessible and quiet. Very friendly and courteous staff, although the small lobby felt a bit cramped when it was full of people and stored luggage. The cushy and comfy beds were perfect after a day roaming the city. The only downside was the drinks in the bar. We paid $12 for a call drink, but instead of getting a gin and tonic, it was gin and soda. I would return again, as the prices were more reasonable than the box hotels, even on the weekend of the Chicago Marathon. Kudos to the Whitehall, and thanks!!</p></li>

Suite was beautiful but some of the furniture was threadbare. Would have loved a coffeepot in suite, instead of having to go to lobby each morning.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here for a one-night getaway, and I was pleasantly surprised. The lobby, elevators and halls were smallish, as is to be expected from a boutique hotel that dates to the 1930's. They were nonetheless well-appointed. Check-in was smooth, the valet fast. The room itself was SWEET. It was a bit small, but well appointed too. Bed was perfect, the bathroom spotless and tastefully appointed, with higher-end guest toiletries. The only gripe would be that the walls seem a bit thin. Other than that, great stay, walking distance to the city's best restaurants and bars.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The staff at the Whitehall could not be better. When I phoned to inquire about operable windows, the reservations agent took the time to find someone who could unequivocally confirm that I would be able to open my window. The room was immaculate and the furnishings were very tasteful. Everything worked properly. The bar looks charming, though I did not have time to check it out. The overall location is excellent, just steps from North Michigan Avenue on a relatively quiet street. Only one downside, and this isn't a deal-killer: the corridors look a bit weary--the paint needs touching up.</p></li>

Some of the hotel patrons were waiting on a bus and their children were pushing each other all over the sidewalk. The children tripped my mother-in-law and she fell and cut her knee. It was bad enough the children and parents did nothing to help but the doorman offered no help either. A passing paramedic stopped to help. We took here inside so I could get some towels and water and not one of the staff offered help as they watched me clean and bandage her knee. Later when we mentioned the incident to the doorman, he said nothing and then snickered to the bellhop as we left.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located on Delaware Place near Rush Street, the advertised price averaged around $120 per night caught my attention first, the location and rating sold me. However, I was more impressed with the updated decor of the room,and the friendly service.of this old hotel. Convenient CTA bus service is within a block, which provides access to the CTA Trains as well as MERTA Rail Service to the suburbs. Nice resturants are within blocks as is Rush Street attractions. The lobby is tiny as is the elevator, but we chose to sleep in our up-to-date, comfrotable, clean and spacious room, and do our sightseeing all round Chicago.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Whitehall has a solid reputation for service, location and amenities. I agree with the service - it was EXCELLENT, from the doorman to the front desk and housekeeping. The location is EXCELLENT - shopping and nightlife within walking distance. Down comforter and pillows a nice touch. However other amenities were a bit on the ragged side - our room had a very slow draining bathtub, dirty carpeting, chipped and worn tile in bathroom, poorly lit powder room, towel ring came off of hand towel holder, and the curtain rod for sheers came out of ceiling when trying to draw drapes. Yikes! Updating definitely needed!!</p></li>

We found this hotel to be really charming and cozy. The staff was very sweet and helpful. I had asked for a room with a view and sure enough, we were given a room on the highest floor overlooking the John Hancock Bldg. and Lake Michigan. The rooms are not large, but our room was very clean, elegant and cozy. This hotel feels VERY different from a large chain hotel....it is intimate and welcoming....almost a throwback to another time. The location CANNOT be beaten! This hotel is a sweet gem!</p></li>

To keep things short -- front desk customer service was rude -- we booked online and we arrived from a long flight (8 hr red eye) just to tell us that we can wait for 3 hours or look for another hotel; rooms were clean, comfortable bed; but very outdated (it's known to be the oldest building in Chicago, so understandable); although location was great!!! 5-10 minute walk to restaurants, shopping district, and many attractions.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got stuck with this hotel through priceline at $150 a night. Don't be fooled by the four star rating. I would give this at best 2 or 3 stars at the most. It maybe a historical hotel but that doesn't mean it needs to be run down and dirty. The water for the sink and shower cuts in and out. There were cob webs on the ceiling. There was a fake decorative tree that was covered in dust. There was pop spilled down the wall. The only nice part was the bed. The matress is amazing. The owners need to spend some money and redo the rest of the room. There were tears in the wall paper. One of the worst hotel experiences we have had.</p></li>

I placed a call and the representative at expedia kept me waiting nearly an hour before he was able to determine that an error in their computer system was causing the e-faxed reservation confirmations to not be sent properly to hotels. Cecelia was very patient and helpful. She also upgraded us to a beautiful suite even though the hotel was not at fault.

They said four stars but to my eyes it is two stars. Starting at the reception, where the paint on the wood trim looks old and five layers thick. The room is old, dated, not renovated for several decades. The air unit was noisy. The room layout was awkward. The TV was old school. The light switch did not work. Bed was good, so was water pressure. Shower curtains were the really thick plastic type that does not bend. It is an embarrassing address. Had to leave. Got no refund, lost two nights. Went to the lovely Dana down the street. Lesson...never again Hotwire.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found this as an advertized deal on a last minute trip down into Chicago for the night. The location, right behind 4th Presbyterian, across the street from Hancock, can't be beat. The restaurants in area offer a great variety in quick walking distance. The hotel has a more European feel. The rooms are nice, not great, but have good amenities that make the stay more pleasurable. One short coming was the front desk. Those working there are very cordial, but both for check in and out our wait far exceeded what should have been. Other desk help would walk by without a comment or offering to help expedite the process. If the first and last taste is the poor service offered, future visits may not be as quick.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">XWe booked it through Priceline and got it for under 100 dollars, For a business trip where you are only in the room to sleep it is ok. The positives: safe, good location, doormen who are very prompt and nice, front desk staff genuinely warm and gracious. As far as the room, they were smart enough to have clean, new carpet, excellent mattress and linens and a small but decent condition bathroom. The negatives is the furnishings and wall paper are showing their age. The entry door to the room actually had kittle chunks out of the bottom like a big mouse nibbled on it. I can't say I've ever seen a door like that ever and was veey worried when I first saw that. But all in all, it was clean and the price was right.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For a girls weekend we went with Expedia's unpublished rates. We ended up at the Whitehall...it was the most perfect location! Not even a 2 minute walk from Michigan Ave and the Hancock building. The only realy way to park is the valet and the staff were very helpful in everything and always very polite. The hotel restaurant was a bit out of our price range but there were plenty of places nearby. We ended up in an accessible room which didn't bother us because it was huge! And the beds were very comfortable. We had read the reviews and were only a bit wary of people complaining of noise from the street...we didn't hear any. Only issue was there was only 1 free outlet in the bedroom for all our phones and cameras.</p></li>

The room was clean. There was no coffee maker, and the requested bathrobe (listed as an in-the-room amenity) was torn and stained. Room service got ice for me, however I was a bit uncomfortable receiving ice into a questionable bucket.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was in a nice location, pretty high end. The elevators did run a little slow and broke down once during our stay. That wasn't that big of a deal to our group. The rooms were nice, if on the small side, as well as comfortable and clean. What was a big deal was the very incorrect bill we got on our last morning. We were charged $200 for parking that we didn't use. The bill was eventually corrected but it took an hour and a half to locate the manager!! Beyond frustrating! There seemed to be a total breakdown of communication between the staff and management, I was beginning to wonder if a manager existed. He came running after us as we stood on the curb grumbling waiting for a cab. Great price on Hotwire, now I know why.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in this hotel for one night before the Chicago Marathon. Room was nice, recently updated with a really nice bathroom. It was small, but not too bad. The front desk help seemed to be clueless about the marathon and had no coffee available until 7:00 am (we had to be there at 7:00). They suggested that we could pay for a breakfast buffet just to get coffee. We found a coffee shop down the street. We asked for a late check out and were told it would cost $50. It is a pretty nice hotel, and you can't judge it completely by a marathon weekend, but I probably would stay somewhere different next time. It does have a great location and I have no complaints about the rooms, but the service was pretty unfriendly and unaccommodating.</p></li>

But staff will fix it. Try the hotel restaurants, the sampler plate in the Asian restaurant is wonderful. Try the quiche in the Italian restaurant, it is fresh was very good. The bar has been remodeled, notice the tiles on the pillar. Others have described the sleep comfort, now you can enjoy the history. I asked the valet what the qualifications were for his job, his reply, 'to listen to people and to smile' You will find that qualification at The Whitehall.</p></li>

We booked the Whitehall hotel through Hotwire for Labor Day weekend. It was supposed to be 4 star, and I've never been as disappointed in a hotel. This place is a dump. It's under construction and the staff is rude. (We had to wake up the front desk person to check us in at midnight last night.) We routinely work from hotels. I knew that this hotel charges for internet, but they charge $10 for every laptop you want to use...so we are paying $30 a day for internet access in this hotel which is outrageous. The room isn't even worth $30. From a typically easy going travelor, take my advice and avoid the Whitehall Hotel. It's a dump.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Whitehall was a great experience. It is on Delaware, right off of Michigan Avenue. The location is perfect for shopping, restaurants and even a healthy walk to the Chicago Art Museum. It has a cozy lobby and a wonderful little bar. If you are looking for a lot of glitz, this isnâ€™t the place. It is quiet and comfortable. Other reviews commented on the noise level but we had no problem with this issue. The rooms are small but well appointed. The staff could not do enough for us. All of their suggestions for dinner and entertainment were spot on. It was inconvenient to have to call for ice and there was no coffee maker in the room but free coffee was provided on the first floor. The staff made all the difference. I would recommend it to my friends and stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've just returned from 5 nights in Chicago staying at the Whitehall. The hotel was for me, perfect. A great location just off the Magnificent Mile. Close to all the shops and restaurants nearby. The loop is walkable as is Lincoln Park from the hotel. The hotel is not part of a chain group which I think makes it all the better. It has a more personal feel to it and adds to the experience. The room was great and the bed and pillows are the most comfortable I have experienced. The staff were very helpful and just after check in, the guy on the front desk (Lemar I think) called to see if we were happy with our room. Great staff, great hotel, and reasonable price. All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel. If I'm back in Chicago I know where I'll be staying. 10 out of 10. Richard, Dublin, Ireland</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent a leisurely weekend at the Whitehall Hotel after a week business stay at the neighboring Westin. Aside from the great location of both hotels there is no comparison. The Westin is a modern luxury hotel with modern amenities and the Whitehall Hotel is a moth-balled museum of vintage Chicago hotel history. A repairman was in my room repairing the HVAC system as I checked-in and for the remainder of the trip I noticed that the room felt colder than usual. The rooms are very small and there is barely enough room to squeeze between the bed and the television. The television is standard definition, the showerhead is too low to be useful and the closet was extremely small. This hotel is worth it if you can find it on Hotwire or Priceline for $100 or less - or if location is the most important thing for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved the Whitehall hotel. The beds were so comfortable I had a difficult time getting my family motivated to get up and explore. The service and staff were excellent. I'd stay there again! If you're looking for historic charm (built in 1928, recently renovated), this is the hotel for you. Our room had hardwood floors and feather beds. And most important, they welcomed my 9-yr-old. The location is perfect for sightseeing Chicago. The Hancock Observatory is practically across the street. Famous restaurants, shopping, etc. are in walking distance Taxi's line the street waiting to take you where you need to go. Or, there is a subway two blocks away. Going to the game at Wrigley field was very easy. NOTE: If you have two or more in your group, I would recommend taking a taxi to and from the airport versus a shuttle.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel for a week in September 2007. After reading the reviews on TripAdviser I asked for a room facing the street and we were given one just opposite the lifts, but this caused no problems except for someone talking loudly outside the lifts one morning. The room was furnished with dark furniture but we expected this from other reviews, the bed was really comfortable, and the bathroom, although small was perfectly adequate for its purpose. The bar prices were reasonable, the only complaint was that we were not informed about the free coffee in the mornings, which we only found on the last day. I had booked at a reduced rate with LastMinute.Com. and after booking was facing the stay with some trepidation after reading reviews on other sites warning against doing this, but our fears were unfounded it was good value for the money we paid.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Even if we didn't have a terrible experience with the front desk about the inadequacy of our first room, I would have to comment on how the hotel has deteriated since our stay just a year ago. The staff is still extremely cordial (except for our checking in experience), but our room was in terrible shape. The sliding closet doors would absolutely not move. One was open so we had access to the hangers but could not use the safe which was behind the closed part. The magnifying mirror in the bathroom was on a loose bracket and could not be used because it hung so low, not to mention that the light on it did not work. The chair at the desk had upholstery so worn that the stuffing was coming through. It looked like it should be on the sidewalk for garbage pickup. This is very sad because we were looking forward to our return after a wonderful stay last year.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found this hotel for what we thought was a steal on Southwest Airlines website for $85 a night for the weekend before the Thanksgiving holidays. It is in a wonderful location if you are wanting to shop the Mag Mile and not wanting to pay for all the excess of the Four Seasons etc. We are without kids so we just wanted somewhere comfy to crash in between museum hopping and shopping. Nice to walk a block for everything, red line is two blocks down, and see the parade while there. Pros: The beds were comfy, quiet for the area, fast elevator, very polite bellmen and front desk staff at any time of day Cons: Small rm but only two people, no ice or drink machine (Walgreens is a block away - just plan ahead), DO NOT VALET A CAR ($48/NT) We liked the place for our uses even if it was dated compared to the fancy newer places around it, but perfect for what we needed</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When I traveled to Chicago alone for the first time to visit my boyfriend I stayed at a hotel that was supposed to be excellent. At the end of my trip my flight was cancelled and I had to find a hotel to stay at. The WhiteHall was the only hotel that welcomed me in for even cheaper than my first hotel! The room was so comfortable and warm. When I first check into a hotel I always check out the bathroom, it was really upscale with tile floor and granite sink top. This hotel is perfect if you are planning to visit Giordano's for some deep dish Chicago pizza for dinner or stop off at The Tempo Cafe for the best breakfast you'll ever have. It is also very close to shopping areas and The Cheesecake factory if you are staying a bit and want a variety of food. Every trip I have planned since and will plan will be with the Whitehall Hotel for it's location, price, and great atmosphere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I needed a hotel downtown to stay at while we celebrated our 6 year anniversary. We stayed downtown on our wedding night, so we wanted to stay downtown again. But it was the week of a huge music festival and prices were skyhigh. So we searched and found a great price online for the Whitehall. We knew nothing about it, but looked it up on tripadvisor (as we always do). Many people had good, and some bad things to say about the hotel...but our experience was all good. First, great location. Blocks away from the Hancock building, shopping, great food...and everything is in walking distance. Second, the hotel is classically beautiful and clean. Finally, they treated us well. We had a problem with our air conditioner, they fixed it quickly. When they found out it was our anniversary, they upgraded us. We were thrilled with our whole experience and would recomend it highly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The best thing about this hotel is its location. Just 2 mininutes walk from Magnificient Mile for those who love shopping...and few blocks from downtown Chicago. The hotel room itself is ok, nothing special. We got a room right across from an evalator so it was quite noisy in the early morning. The hotel used to be a luxury apartment so the wall between rooms is a bit thin. I could hear water pouring when the neighbour taking shower in the morning. The air conditioning was not working properly the second night so we got trouble sleeping. The staffs here are nice and helpful. I was actually about to book Hotel Club Monoco for this trip. I got a discount rate for Whitehall so I went with it. However, I should have gone with Hotel Monaco since I have read a lot of good feedback about it...No matter what, I had a great time in Chicago. Love the city....Definitely come back again and stay longer...:)</p></li>

<li>However, I should have gone with Hotel Monaco since I have read a lot of good feedback about it...No matter what, I had a great time in Chicago.</br></br></li>
<li>Love the city....Definitely come back again and stay longer...:)</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we stayed at the Whitehall for 5 nights and were very satisfied with all aspects the location could not be better only a block from Michigan Avenue, the reception was friendly and helpful as well as a concierge they have a self service information computer in the lobby which allows you to get information on all the local interests and to check in and print your airline pass the suite ( superior king on 11th floor ) was a very good size, bed was comfortable with luxury linens , bathroom was small but clean and good shower. also iron and ironing board in room which was very useful. only occasional street noise which was surprising given the busy location we had breakfast each morning included in our rate, the breakfast was table service and the service was good although the restaurant was pretty busy so probably best to allow a bit of time if taking breakfast all in all a great hotel in a great city</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I came to Chicago on a little extended vacation in the area and I have to say that the hotel at first glance is very nice, but then you get down to it the nitty gritty. The room had a comfortable bed and the staff at the front desk were very kind and accommodating - those are the pros. The water pressure in the shower is awful with variances in temperature throughout the entire 5 minute shower. I mean it will get freezing cold and hot again within 15 seconds without you bothering to touch the knob. The wall paper in the room was peeling in several places and the room extremely dusty (top of furniture, etc.) The halls are very hot and stuffy (we were there while it was cool outside) and the elevators take what seems like ages to get to you - not to mention how small they are. All in all, thank goodness the hotel was inexpensive but I would not recommend staying here to anyone. After all, you do indeed get what you pay for.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the whitehall hotel with another couple so had a room with 2 queen beds. The first thing we noticed was the GREAT location of this hotel, it is one block from the magnificent mile, just down the street from one of the lakefront beaches and a short walk to the transit system. We didn't have any complaints about the hotel, it is a lovely old hotel and has been decorated accordingly. We just didn't feel it was up to a 4 star standard, although everything was fine, the bathroom could have had better amenities (such as a slightly larger shower), and the carpets needed replacing. But these are just minor adjustments that did not affect our stay at all. However we also did not pay full price to stay here, so if you can get a good deal then I recommend staying there, but don't pay their full prices because then its not worth it. Just a comment regarding the elevators, yes they are small but they are functional and we loved the look of them.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here at the end of September for two nights on our first trip to Chicago. We had a king room on the 17th floor and booked it last minute on the Orbitz web site. It was great value for money for a central city location. The check in staff were very attentative, the valet parking and bell boys were very efficient. Our room was not ready but they took my cell phone and called when it was, however we were having too much fun sightseeing to go back for several hours. There is a lot of history with this hotel and the leaflet dipiciting it is well worth the read. This hotel is in a fab location, can't fault anything about it. Our floor was quiet, room spacious and very clean, shower good and the bed delightfully large and very comfy!! The only thing that seemed out of place was the old style television, having been very used to the new flat screens but now I am just nip-picking!! We loved Chicago and the Whitehall Hotel was the icing on the cake!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Whitehall Hotel, a national landmark hotel in Chicago, is a charming hotel in an excellent location in downtown. Because it is old and has character, there were a few minor inconveniences. The two biggest ones for us were no ice machines(you have to call or ask someone in the hotel to get ice for you which means a tip) and trouble getting into our room with an electronic card. We had to slide the card at least half a dozen times to get our door open. But these annoying little things were more than made up for by the friendliness of the staff, the great beds and bathrooms, and the concierge service. Did I mention the location? The Whitehall is less than a block off the northern end of the "Magnificent Mile", near the El Red Line and major bus stops, and within walking distance of many of Chicago's major attractions. We were near several good restaurants and felt safe at all times. There were only 2 of us, but many families with 4 to 5 members were in the hotel. A lot of business men and women were in the hotel as well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Somebody should explain the management of this establishment that the qualification of BOUTIQUE stands for "small & sofisticated " , not "small, decrepit , dusty & noisy ". Unfortunately, American people are so fascinated with Europe that tends to accept every forgery of a European Establishment, whether British, Italianate or even French-looking, and be very forgiving of every possible drawback. In fact, this hotel , in a way, peculiarly encompasses the worst of European hotels (small rooms, tiny bathrooms, dingy hallways, crammed elevators, funny receptions, pretentious common areas) with the worst of American establishments (noisy AC, bad food, mediocre toiletries, neighbours having sex at 4 a.m. and rude yobs from the country spending the W.E. in the Big City) . But not all is so depressing : the bed is extremely comfortable, room was clean, the doormen are very friendly and the all-Black-young women frontdesk is crisp , attentive and (to me) exotic. The Bar is indeed very nice. All of this for 239 $ a night. Better somewhere else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just stayed 4 nights in this hotel. Really pleased with the location, rooms were a little tired but very comfortable bed. My only complaint were the front desk staff, who were actually really rude at check in and other times during my stay. I rang down to the concierge, I think her name was Denise to help me book a restaurant, I had been recommend. She was fantastic, organised it all and even left a voucher at the front desk for me. When I went to the front desk they said they couldnt find it and basically tough luck. On another occasion I asked for a recommendation for a restaurant and told Rush St. was a block away and just to find one there. I wasnt the only guest who seemd to come up against the rude front desk staff, I saw another guest have a massive agrument with the front desk staff in front of about 10 other guests. Its all about first impressions, someone smiling and asking how you are is not too much to ask, after spending 8 hours on a flight. Other then the front desk staff I would recommed the hotel as you can practically walk everywhere from it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As others have said, The Whitehall feels very European--aka the rooms are small, the furnishings a little outdated, and a decided lack of emphasis on technology. But, we had a very pleasant stay there. The biggest recommendation for the Whitehall is its location. You are literally steps away from the Hancock Center, Magnificent Mile shopping and restaurants, Lake Michigan, and other attractions. You're also across the street from the Four Seasons so stop in there for a spa treatment. All this for a fraction of the cost of other area hotels. The room was clean and housekeeping did a thorough job of cleanup every day. Yes, the elevators are small--but they're fast. Who cares about small elevators? Our room was comfy, clean, and quiet--pretty much all you can ask for. No wi-fi, about $10/day for wired internet(this isn't unusual but still would have been nice to have free wi-fi). Fitness center was small, but well kept. I only used the treadmills so I was content. Staff was friendly, though a few of them could have used a refresher course on what their hotel offered. No hesitation in recommending this hotel to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had my doubts about this hotel when I first blind booked through a third party site. The price was just a little too good and the location too perfect for it to be real. We breathed a sigh of relief when we walked into our room. Upon arrival they "upgraded" us to a top floor, corner room and what an awesome room it was. We were staring right at the Hancock building and lake Michigan. For those of you planning a visit to the American Girl store, you will be happy to know, it is half a block away and within view of the hotel. The beds were comfortable and not too small. The bathroom was very nice, updated and clean. The shower was a bit finicky but that is to be expected in an older building. And the room did have a slight musty odor upon arrival but that went away after a few hours - again, older building. The hotel staff was courteous and attentive. They were more than happy to point us in the direction of cheaper parking rather than pay for valet - they do not have a parking lot on site. There are plenty of shops and restaurants in the area as it is just off of Michigan avenue. I would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in September 07 with my husband, it was a quick city break with friends who joined us from Cincinnati. We booked the hotel on Hotels R Us and got a great deal for the short stay we were there. The hotel is located on a quiet side street and has a central location for the beach and all the shops just off the Mag Mile. The staff were extremely friendly and we had a great stay. The rooms although compact had everything we needed and were very nicely decorated. The bed was really comfy and had nice bed linens. I liked the touch of the free tea and coffee which was available each morning in the lobby, you could fill up as much as you wanted. Our friends came to visit one morning, they were staying in the Marriott Downtown and paid double the amount we paid and were every impressed with the hotel for value for money. We asked at reception if they could join us for coffee and they said to help themselves. with no charge which was really nice touch. | really enjoyed my stay here and would recommend the hotel to those who enjoy small stylish hotels with helpful staff , without having to pay top dollar to stay in Chicago.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My associate booked us a couple of rooms at the Whitehall Hotel. I was pleased with the superior King upgrade from the lovely attendant at the front desk. The main elevators were the smallest I've seen, maybe holds 4 with luggage- not that it was ever an issue(maybe there is a service elevator for large hauls). The hotel appeared to have early 20th century construct and was very cool looking. If you like cozy in the old fashion style this is your kind of place. I enjoyed it. The room provided me plenty of space and the view from the 19th floor was enjoyable. I had to ad an extra night stay and there was no problem, not even have to change my room. The room staff was right on and the front desk staff was friendly and accommodating. There is a work out room that has one elliptical trainer and two treadmills on one side and some free weights and a universal or two on the other side. I managed to get to my equipment with no problem. I didn't rent a car because parking is expensive and traffic is difficult downtown (as most of Chicago). The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the room was quiet. I enjoyed the Hong Kong style restaurant there, as well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in Chicago for 2 nights mainly just for siteseeing & a relaxing weekend. I am a student and am on a tight budget so I was looking for a hotel that was cheap but in the metro area. If you've been in my position before you know its a hard thing to find. But the Whitehall Hotel does offer a PRIME location for it's price. In the heart of the Magnificant Mile, its walking distance to all the great stores, water tower, Hancock Building and even The Loop. The staff is very friendly and ready to help. The room I god was a bit small, but it was only for me so I didn't mind. If you have a bigger group I wouldnt recommend it. The bed, however, was INCREDIBLE soft and comfortable. Loved it! The view wasn't spectacular but I wasnt staying there for the view anyhow. I think my only complaint would be that I was charged a $50 fee to use their internet jsut to "verify" my credit card even though I was already being $10 per 24 hour period to use it. When I questioned the front desk about this they said it was only verification and wouldnt come out of my checking account, however, it did and I had to contact their accounting office several times to get it resolved. Other then that it was a fantastic stay</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just finished a 4 night stay at the Whitehall hotel. Got a great deal on it on an Orbitz sale. It was a nice older hotel with smaller rooms and no fancy extras. The location was amazing - one block from the John Hancock building and all the buses to the museums. We didnt eat at any of the hotel restaraunts - too pricey, esp when there are so many great options a within walking distance. The hotel does not have free internet... its $9.95 a day. There also are not ice machines - you have to call room service for a complimentary ice delivery. A little awkward and it took them about 10 minutes to bring it. One thing I didn't see mentioned in other reviews: The hotel makes you put a 50 dollar a night hold on your credit card for incidentals. Since we stayed 4 nights, that was 200 dollars on hold. Just be prepared to make this deposit knowing it will lower your remaining credit on your card! They claim you will get it all back pending you haven't used the mini-bar or broken/ stolen anything. Hopefully the money will be restored to the card soon. It was just unexpected and something I would have liked to know about ahead of time. But overall, the hotel worked out great and we had a very pleasant stay!</p></li>

<li>One thing I didn't see mentioned in other reviews: The hotel makes you put a 50 dollar a night hold on your credit card for incidentals.</br></br></li>
<li>Since we stayed 4 nights, that was 200 dollars on hold.</br></br></li>
<li>Just be prepared to make this deposit knowing it will lower your remaining credit on your card!</br></br></li>
<li>They claim you will get it all back pending you haven't used the mini-bar or broken/ stolen anything.</br></br></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here with family for a short stopover, enroute to New York City. We had a smooth check-in, had great rooms, comfy beds, and loved the interior which was very vintage and historical - seeing that it is a landmark location in Chicago. It is also close to the main Magnificent Mile strip, which was close to all the great shopping and food areas. But the only incident which we as a family did not appreciate was that, after getting help from the concierge in getting a cab enroute to the airport to NYC, and loading our bags into the van, and ALTHOUGH we tipped the concierge manager (thinking he would share the tip with the doorman who helped with the bags), the doorman was incredibly rude to us and made a big fuss about not tipping him. Perhaps it's an American culture we did not understand, cause when we tip in Asia, the manager always shares the tip with his/her team. Perhaps it is not the case in the United States? But it was unfortunate because they knew we were foreign, and he treated us with incredible disrespect - causing me to give this hotel a review that is a less than a 100% mark. Apart from that though, it was a great location. But if you ask me? I would not return to this property and would be exploring a different hotel for my second stay in Chicago.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I see there is a new option here on Tripadvisor.com that allows you to add photos! I wish I had taken pictures of the peeling paint, the mildew on the shower curtain, the water stain on the ceiling, grungy carpeting, dirty grout... You get the picture, this is NOT the special place, the "boutique" hotel, they would like you to think it is when making a reservation! If that's what you're looking for, stay around the corner at the Tremont! Yes, we got it for the bargain price of $139 on a weekend Travelzoo special, but there are plenty of hotels (even in similar excellent locations) where you can get that kind of price on a weekend in Chicago. I would have to echo an earlier review here on tripadvisor.com: "The Whitehall is listed in the publication "The Best Small Hotels in the World." Please. The Whitehall is the worst Chicago hotel at which I have ever had the misfortune to stay. The location is excellent - one block west of Michigan Avenue. That's where the good news ends. The staff is uppity. The rooms are VERY small. The hotel is badly worn, in need of a face lift. The noise from the pipes is awful. This is an expensive hotel. For the same price you can stay at wondeful Chicago hotels - Fairmont, Peninsula, Meridien, Intercontinental. Do yourself a favor - avoid the Whitehall."</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked thru hotwire for 100, where you don't see the hotel. Bad idea! Customer service agent wasn't so nice at all, tried to be friendly to her (Yana) not happening.. I get to my room, Ned skirt dirty with white stains and ripped at the bottom. the chairs had Nasty dirty stains looked like urine and they were torn. The old zenith tv from when I was born in the 80s, had stains around the frame, the cabinet it was in one door was falling or leaning the hinge was broken and the other door had the knob to open cabinet missing. I understand historical, maybe that's why the furnitures wood was chipped. The bed had a mink cover to hide the rips and tears on the blanket, and not sure what else was meant to cover the tears on the sheets and a stain on sheet.. Ugh.. I'm thinking the plush pad was nice or was it one of those covers to so bed bugs can't get on top.. I didn't see any and don't plan on it cuz I'm checking out.. The bed shirt was ripped and had white stains that looked like they could have been easily washed out. The bathroom was the only decent thing, for the 1/2 I'm here I was ok sitting in there. It's like a closet tho, the toilet was right next to tub, no space between shower n toilet. If your claustrophobic don't go in there altho it's the nicest thing I saw so far.. For the price, not a good deal!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Whitehall just after the new year. Staff was all very helpful and friendly.

Unfortunately, my chats with the front desk staff was frequently interrupted by ringing phones. I travel quite a bit, and have never witnessed anything quite like this. Shouldn't an operator or other employee be in charge of answering phones? The girls at the desk were swamped with reservation calls, and even room service orders at times! With that much going no one gets the attention they deserve. While the staff of the Whitehall is great, their understaffing puts everyone, guests and employees alike, in a poor situtation. I must say there are aspects of the hotel that are charming and it couldn't be in a better location, it does not under any circumstances live up to the somewhat "overly-glowing" reviews. I was treated well and hotel was average and old. I did not feel like a celebrity! I was not Lapping up all the Luxury! Not sure if you have to tip like a mad man or work for the hotel's sales team to be able to write a review like that, but in any event, the hotel is fine, but their best feature, their staff, are over worked and under appreciated. I will most likely stay elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Whitehall while I was taking the Illinois Bar Exam in late July, 2008. Overall, the stay was quite pleasant. Check-in was quick, and a friend and I were both upgraded. As far as service, it was always very efficient and friendly. When I alerted the desk that the safe was not working properly, a very courteous employee came up instantly and quickly reset the safe. As far as the room, I found no major problems. I knew there may be a few "rough edges" here and there from reading previous reviews, and was not disappointed by the hotel whatsoever. There was a little bit of what seemed to be water damage on the wallpaper in a corner, and I noted one 1" slit in a pillowcase. Aside from that, everything was very clean and fairly up-to-date. Sure, the elevators are tiny and one public restroom on the ground floor was very tight, but I knew that going in. My room was very quiet (and cool via the a/c), and the bed/linens were extremely comfortable--just what I needed to relax in preparation for my exam. Some previous reviews seem a little dramatic - I had read them, prepared for the worst, and was generally very pleased with the room. And hey - for what you pay (I paid $159 a night), it was a great deal. What do you expect? I doubt you can find anything comparable (wich such a fantastic location) for less!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I booked this hotel thru Hotwire, approx 3 weeks prior to our stay. We arrived 1 hour before check in and told that because we booked thru a third party, our reservation was NOT guaranteed (even though we had prepaid $402.00 for 2 nights), therefore we would have to wait until check in time. After a conversation with the manager we were finally given a room. The rooms are very small and VERY antiquated. The night stand drawewr handles were dangling, the bed skirt was dirty, the sliding closey doors were rickety, the walls were very thin, we could hear coughing in the room to the left of us and the toilet flushing in the room to the right of us. The TV was small and required manual turn off and on, the remote only worked for channels and volume control. There were 3 old lamps in the room, each one required a little maneuvering to turn on and off. There were only 2 outlets in the room, and each one was loose from the wall. The bathroom was clean, but very small, with the toilet wedged under the sink (very awkward). The positive aspects of this hotel. The staff (minus the RUDE front desk clerk, who later wrote us an apology and slid it under our door, ( I'm sure at his manager's urging). Also the location is great, diagonally across the street from Water Tower Place, upper Michigan Avenue. I would not stay ther again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Trip advisor â€“ Whitehall Hotel 4/2/11 This hotel was frequented by the â€œGlam Gangâ€� back in 1972. It is a designated historic hotel which was renovated in 1995. It must have been lovely then. The location is wonderful: one block off Michigan and three blocks from the Water Tower Complex. The tree-lined street is relatively quiet and pretty. If I had not gotten a great room rate, I would have been upset at what I found. The room carpet was torn, the furniture chipped, the extra blanket had a hole in it and the elevator light didnâ€™t work the entire week. My room, 402, was in the back corner. If you are a light sleeper/night person, just remember that bottles are dumped in the alley late at night, followed by the roar and clatter of garbage truck pick- ups between 6-8am every day. If you want to use the business center, the computers cost around $5.00 per 15 minutesâ€™ use. However, the free coffee in the lobby is wonderful and two blocks east on State St. find Potash grocers where you can pick up items to store in the refrigerator for a quiet breakfast in your room. Going south on State you can find inexpensive local breakfast restaurants. The church on the corner of Delaware and Michigan has good concerts for the cost of donations/free. Sdaly,this once glamorous hoteland still historic hotel badly needs a facelift. I sense that they are hurting financially.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just stayed at the Whitehall Hotel in August 2011 for the third time and found it better than ever. I was very surprised to read the recent reviews posted for this hotel. The first time I stayed here in 2009 they were in the process of renovating their rooms. The room we had then was nice and clean. I assumed by now all their rooms had been renovated but maybe not from the sound of some of these reviews. I stayed at the Whitehall in December 2010 and found the hotel again quite nice for the price and a great location for shopping and dining in the snow. It is across the street from the Four Seasons, a half block from the John Hancock Building on Michigan Avenue, one block from Watertown Mall and just a couple of blocks from great restaurants on Rush Street. We found the staff very friendly and accommodating. Furnished us with umbrellas, great restaurant recommendations and directions. The elevators are small but we didn't find that to be a problem. My husband and I fit in it with a large suitcase and a rolling golf bag. Capacity on the elevator is limited to 5. I guess we were just never in a hurry. We stayed on the top floor in a king room with a bay window at no extra cost. Room was spacious, very clean. Bathroom was plenty big with large vanity. The bed was comfortable and we had no problem with the air conditioner. We will definitely stay there again as we love visiting Chicago.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Whitehall this past weekend, and felt at home in this European-style boutique hotel. One of the highlights for us was that, from the moment we entered until we departed, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful! I tend to be somewhat fussy about rooms, and like to view several rooms before selecting the one I want. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. Although the views are not amazing, one has to consider the location - which is west of Michigan Blvd. Our room overlooked part of Michigan Avenue, including the Water Tower Place and the John Hancock Building - pretty nice! I saw two kinds of rooms. One was a bit standard. But, the one we chose to stay in had a wonderful four poster bed, was a nice size and had a very pretty (albeit small) bathroom. Also, there was a plate of chocolates on the marble table which greeted us when we entered. It was the first time we ever slept in a feather bed - very luxurious! And the sheets were very soft. Connected to the hotel is an Italian/Asian restaurant. We enjoyed our lunch there - it had a European ambience. The restaurant has a bar and really comfy adjoining lounge, with lots of sofas and chairs where the staff serves drinks and light fare. But, I think that smoking is permitted in the lounge. A couple of downsides - 1. instead of having ice machines on the floors, the hotel instructs guests to contact room service for ice. It took quite a while for the ice to arrive. 2. The hotel is old.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at the hotel after a 12 hr drive and expected something relaxing. We entered the lobby which was really small and no air conditioning. The bell boy and valet was very helpful. Staff was courteous but not friendly. The elevators were really small and I was glad that they were working. The room was ok. I first noticed the cobwebs hanging from the ceiling. It was kind of cramped. The furniture is all very old. The windows were so dirty is was hard to see out of it. The bathroom looked like it was upgraded but the door could not lock as the lock itself was hanging at an edge. The beds were comfortable and the white bedding itself was on the better side even though the duvet covers itself was broken at the edges. For ice you needed to call the fron desk which arrived quite quickly. As for the internet. It never worked just with the code. We spent nearly 2 hrs trying to get it to work. Some technical person came up to check but then told us we needed to call the internet provider to get it sorted out. My husband spent and 1 hr doing this. The next day the same thing happened. We never ate at the hotel as it did not look good. The most I saw in the restaurants was 3 couples. The outside windows needed a cleaning really badly. The fridge was there but it was a bar fridge not for our use. The tv had very little channels. If you are looking for comfort and luxury definately not the hotel to go to. This was a damper on our Chicago trip for sure. Good location was the only thing about this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Whitehall Hotel for five nights in July while visiting Chicago on vacation. The location is good, depending on where you plan on spending your time. Located in an upscale neighborhood, just a block from the Magnificent Mile, it's a twenty minute walk to the Chicago River and a thirty minute walk to the Navy Pier. The closest CTA station is Chicago, on the Red Line. Our room was quite spacious; having said that, it was located at the rear of the hotel, and may have a different configuration than some other rooms. If you care about a view, request a street-side room (it's not a particularly noisy street) or maybe a higher floor. We were on a lower floor and had a depressing view of the building's mechanicals. Not really a big deal since we were only in the room to sleep. The upside of being on a lower floor is that you can use the stairs and avoid the sometimes slow elevators. Our room was very clean, and housekeeping was attentive. The bed was very comfortable, with a pillow-top mattress cover. The bathroom was of average size but attractively updated with granite and tile. The room was tastefully decorated. Some of the furniture is showing a little wear but it is still in decent shape. The hotel's public rooms are beautifully decorated with a clubby, English feel. We did not happen to eat at the hotel's restaurant, but did look at the menu. The breakfast menu prices are quite pricey. There are a number of breakfast alternatives nearby, namely a very good pancake house on nearby East Bellevue Street, an Einstein's Bagels on East Walton Street, and Starbucks everywhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked our travel last minute (the night before). We read a couple of reviews on this hotel and figured we'd give it a try. My fiance and I were packing all night and landed in Chicago and found out our luggage was still in Atlanta. We decided to not let it ruin our vacation and went to check into the hotel. Needless to say we were exhausted. At twelve noon they said they were still cleaning our room that check in was not until three. We decided to go have lunch (dressed in our Miami clothes with a sweater on top). Front desk told us they would be able to check us in when we returned from lunch. We arrived back at the hotel at 145 and our room was still not ready. We told the women and the gentleman in front desk that we were exhausted and would be sitting on the couch in the lobby waiting for them to call us. "No problem I will let you know as soon as your room is available. We know you have been travelling all day." I logged on to my laptop as my fiance fell asleep on the couch. At 330 I realized time had flown by and I returned to front desk. I asked it our room was available yet and the response was "Oh yes ma'am it's been available for sometime now." I was shocked. How could you not see us there waiting and my fiance sleeping from packing all night? I found that front desk was not very helpfull our whole trip. I do have to say that the concierge was great and so were the door men. The room was standard, but the bathroom needed some major mold cleaning. Also, the water coming out of the shower was either zero below or 1000 degrees. There was no happy medium. I don't think I will ever return to this hotel again because there were many other hotels in the same region that had more or less the same price and I'm sure would provide us with better customer service. BTW our luggage arrived in the hotel at 7pm.</p></li>

<li>The room was standard, but the <span style="background-color:#f58231">bathroom</span> needed some <span style="background-color:#f58231">major mold cleaning</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>Also, the water coming out of the shower was either zero below or 1000 degrees.</br></br></li>
<li>There was no happy medium.</br></br></li>
<li>I don't think I will ever return to this hotel again because there were many other hotels in the same region that had more or less the same price and I'm sure would provide us with better customer service.</br></br></li>
<li>BTW our luggage arrived in the hotel at 7pm.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am writing this review on my last afternoon/night at the Whitehall. I was very nervous after PriceLining a room in Chicago and coming up with the Whitehall. I started to read the reviews (too late now, did a best price in the blind) and was quite concerned. I couldn't wait to tell everyone that my experience was much better and absolutely trouble free. I read about complaints of musty smells, dirty sheets, dirty bathrooms, rude staff, bad elevators, bad water pressure; the list seemed endless.... So, as I approached the hotel on super easy public transportation (Blue Line from O'Hare, walk 2 blocks to Michigan Ave, and take one of many buses north to Delaware, walk less than a block and you're there) I took a deep breath. The gentleman that greeted me and checked me in was very polite. There were no problems with my reservation. In minutes I was on the waiting elevator up to my room. Yes, the elevators are small. Big deal. I was on it a total of 30 seconds in the four days I was in lovely Chicago. On to the room: Another deep breath as I opened my door. It was quite warm in the room - 79 degrees. A/C was set at 62. Uh oh! Before I panicked I tried turning the thermostat up to a more reasonable temperature - 74 degrees. Sometimes older A/C units freeze up if you tax them too much. If it was trying to cool to 62 degrees as the thermostat was set to maybe the unit was froze up... don't know if that was the problem but the room cooled to 74 degrees within 30 minutes of my adjustment. It was perfect for my entire stay. The room was clean and nice sized. I got an end of hall room which meant 2 sets of windows and great views of the city. Also - no noise from neighbors. Fantastic. I would definitely stay here again. The location is fantastic. The staff was polite. The room was everything I needed. Great job Whitehall Hotel!</p></li>
