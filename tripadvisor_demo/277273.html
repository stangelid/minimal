Our room was on the front with two large windows overlooking the street; the traffic noise disappeared as soon as we closed the windows. Free minibar with juices, water, coffee was a definite plus, and breakfast was plentiful. Sleek furnishings, hardwood floors, marble bath all made for a gracious hotel and a great value.</p></li>

The hotel will request payment at check in rather than at check out, which is a bit unusual but ok. I would stay here again. People whose items are stolen. Shame on you. If you had done any research on Spain, any, you would know theft is a big problem. Where do you leave your carry-on luggage when at an airport? Always keep on eye on your personal items!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent Hotel - great location Excellent location, right next to Gran Via Metro station and within walking distance of many of the tourist attractionsWe had a nice room with a balcony, which enabled us to see all the way down the Gran Via. The free mini-bar was a bonus and the free glass of cava in reception was also a nice touch.Breakfast had many options and the staff were pleasant and courteous throughout. We booked the Senator on the back of positive reviews here and they were not wrong. Highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent Location, Good Value Situated along Gran Via, the hotel is ideally located for shopping and sightseeing in Old  Bourbon Madrid.Accros is a Mc Donald, and probably, the most policed square of Madrid. Thats because it is a pick-up point of hookers. Dont know if McD had anything to do with it.In all, it was not threatening nor annoying.Hotel was clean, comfortable. New room, nice staf, relatively good breakfast. Metro right in front.All minibar consumptions were on the house.We would book again in this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent hotel with impeccable service Thanks to other reviewers foir recommending this hotel. We stayed for two nights and found it an excellent choice. Good rooms, excellent staff and a great location. The double-glazing is very effective at keeping out the noise from the bustle of the street below, but it's nice to be able to look out on Gran Via and get the atmosphere of the city.Take the option that includes breakfast, as its very good.Free mini-bar is a lovely touch, and all the staff were efficient and friendly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">very nice Stayed at the gran Via for Easter weekend and were very impressed. Room was very spacious, with two balconies looking over Gran Via. Traffic was very noisy with doors opened but double glazing made the room very quiet when closed. Free mini bar was a great touch! Ladies of Night (and day!!) and xxx shops were all along the road from the hotel but other than feeling slightly seedy, were not an issue. We always came up from Sol on another road. If back in Madrid would have no reservations about staying here again.</p></li>

Our package included breakfast and free minibar.What we liked:*Location--the metro right outside the hotel, many sights, restaurants, and shops within walking distance*Our room--decent-sized with high ceilings, balcony w/view of the side street, big bed w/choice of pillows, nice bathroom. *Staff--friendly and helpful staff*Breakfast--nice selection: eggs made-to-order, meats, cheeses, pastries, etc.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very nice hotel I had a great experience at this hotel. I spent three nights, and was given a room with a terrace overlooking the Gran Via. The room was compact, but had everything I needed. The television had several english channels, and offered some movies that could be purchased in English or other languages. The front desk staff was helpful with any questions I had. My only disappointment was the bed was rather hard, but it was an adjustable bed and the headrest moved which was nice. All in all, a nice hotel and I would recommend.</p></li>

I stayed here with my partner and was not threatned at all by the ladies of the night across the street, They did not bother us at all. The location of the bars is a couple of minutes walk. The hotel was very clean and very quiet. We stayed on the night of the Real Madrid Celebrations and the hotel managed to block out a lot of the street and party noise. Great hotel, i would definatly stay again. If youve got any questions just ask.</p></li>

Also, the rooms on the top floor were breath-taking and worth the additional expense to have the balcony. The hotel is on a busy intersection. Beware that if you are walking to the hotel in the evening you will have to walk a gauntlet of prostitutes and scam-artists. Don't pay them any attention and get to your destination and all will be okay! I always felt safe in the area despite the unwanted nightly burlesque shows!!</p></li>

Our room was very comfortable with lovely touches like free shaving kit, dental kit etc. The buffet breakfast was fabulous I don't think there was anything more you could want on the menu that included hot  cold food. The breakfast staff were attentive  refilled our coffee cups during our meal. I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anybody wishing to go to Madrid and it has the added bonus of being very central  has a metro station at it's doorstep. We felt safe at all times there!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic hotel in great location Booked here after reading other reviews on Trip Advisor and weren't disappointed. Service was excellent and friendly at all times. As it was our 10 year anniversary, our request for a nice room was honoured not only with a fantastic room with 2 balconies overlooking the main street, but also a bottle of cava and a bowl of fruit. Nice touch. Breakfast was excellent. Metro station opposite was very useful although most tourist areas seemed to be within a 15-20 min walk. Good restaurants nearby - try Gloria or Root - both just round the corner.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent hotel For adults it is an excellent hotel, excellent staff, clean, well furbished and right next to Madrid's main metro station (not that you need it as pretty much everything is within 20mins walking distance). However Madrid's 'red light' district is close by and whilst it can be avoided, it is the quickest way to the main plazas where most of the bars and restaurants are located, not a problem during the day but at night could be a potential problem with children. My girlfriend and I walked through it every night and we didn't feel threatened or intimidated at any time</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">New Year 08 Went to Madrid for New Year's for 5 days and had a brilliant stay. Very centralised to the main centre/square. The reception doesn't look much but once your inside, the interior design is very pretty and cosy. People are nice. Rooms are nice. The only minor downside is that their are not enough hangers, only provide 4 (if your lucky) between 2 people. Also, in the bathrooms, if sharing a room, only provide 1 tooth brush which is a bit odd! Other than that, great plus free bar, everyone loves that!Good hotel to recommend and if not been to Madrid before, ideal place to stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lived up to expectations We just came back from 5 nights stay at the Senator Gran Via, Madrid, having chosen it after checking out the Trip Advisor reviews. It lived up to expectations. We had a top floor corner room, which had windows on 2 sides and a large balcony, with great views of the city. The room was very well equipped and very comfortable, with a free minibar. The standard of cleaning was very good. Breakfast in the basement restaurant was good, with a large selection. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We'd recommend it to others and will stay there again next time we visit Madrid.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful stay at the Gran Via We had two wonderful nights. We lucked out with our Venere booked room this time, and got a top floor room with a large balcony and windows that opened on to the plaza. We had a birdseye view of the Euro Pride parade events. It was thrilling to see the power of so many people all together. (1.5 million)The free mini bar is wonderful, as was the bathroom and amenities. A very central location right around the corner from Puerto del Sol. The hookers on the street looked like actresses right out of Sweet Charity. Very colorful. The staff was very nice. Highly recommended.</p></li>

The rooms are clean and comfortable and the bathrooms have recently been renovated. Staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is right in the middle of all the great shops - shoes,clothes,food - everything. Just steps from the hotel door is the subway entrance, making it a perfect location. The Prado is within walking distance as well. Lovely walk with parks and trees and stores ,restaurants and sidewalk cafes.I would definitely go back again.</p></li>

Aircon did not work on arrival but got fixed the next day with a bottle of Cava by way of an apology. We requested a nice room (as we visiting for a birthday treat)  a high floor to avoid traffic noise. We were given the top floor (8th) with a private sun terrace which was fabulous to view the city  look down on the street below. Staff were helpful and efficient. We would not hesitate to use this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great experience at the Senator Gran Via We stayed at the Senator Gran Via for three nights in late September. It is in a very convenient location, the rooms are functional and the staff is extremely helpful and accommodating. I read some commentary from other travelers who found the Gran Via somewhat unsavory, but we had no problems whatsoever. The hotel is also a very good value for Madrid. Sure, you can pay twice as much and stay in an upscale touristy area that does not have the Gran Via elements, but in our opinion, your money would be better spent staying an extra night and/or seeing another city in Spain.</p></li>

Also price was right. However, appearance is rather seedy as you walk into the lobby and service was not the best. Safe in the room did not work and after they said they would be right up to check it out, they never showed up. Conversely, request for a sewing kit resulted in an instantaneous delivery of one to our room. Ice machine was convenient and there was coffee, though instant, in the rooms. These are amenities we didn't find in any other hotels in Spain. On the whole, probably wouldn't stay there again.</p></li>

From the friendly, helpful and efficient staff and the central location to the free mini bar and the excellent sound-proofing from the busy street below, I could not fault it.Ladies (and gents) watch your bags - petty theft is rife here, more so than in any other major city I have visited. I would advise you not to bother eating in the expensive Plaza Mayor - we had possibly the worst meal I have ever eaten. Stick to the restaurants and tapas bars populated by the locals away from the main tourist areas and I guarantee you'll get value for money.</p></li>

Great location though a bit disconcerting coming out of such a lovely hotel to see a MacDonalds opposite and all the ladies of the night hanging about; if I had been on my own it might have been a bit frightening. Anyway, good room, very quiet as requested, spotlessly clean, very comfy bed. I particularly liked breakfast, where they would make you an omelette, scrambled egg or whatever on demand. Very friendly staff at reception and at breakfast. Lovely central atrium and fountain and efficient lifts. Would definately stay there again if I ever get back to Madrid (which I hope I do)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fabulous! Just spent four nights at Hotel Senator. Outstanding! Great location to walk to many areas and metro stop is literally two steps out the front door. Rooms small by American standards, but very comfortable, extremely clean, excellent amenities. Great balcony overlooking the city. Excellent free breakfast in the morning. Staff very pleasant. Can't say enough! One word of warning - they offer a shuttle to the airport for 6E, which is a great deal compared to taxi (25E). THey told me about 30-40 minutes to get to the airport, however, we had to pick up at two other hotels and it was more like an hour. It's a great service, but be sure to allow enough time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">ideally situated Earlier reviews on tripadvisor were very useful. Hotel staff were very helpful. Staff spoke very good English and were anxious to please. Rooms were meticulously clean. Our room was at the side on the 7th floor so we did not experience noise from Gran Via. earlier references to the 'working girls' of the area were accurate. They were visible as in many parts of Madrid but posed no difficulty for my wife and I. Hotel breakfast buffet was more than adequate - selection of cereals, fruit juices and fruit salads were excellent as were varieties of cold meats, cheeses etc. Overall a very good recommendation. Tripadvisor got it right yet again.H  M Ireland</p></li>

Would definitely stay there again, we were right in the heart of the city and it wasn't at all seedy, ok there were some prostitutes but they were no bother at all and i'm sure a family would not even notice them, so families should not be put off by this.The rooms were very comfortable, with everything you need there, including bathroom essentials and we had a wonderful view of the city, but it wasnt at all noisy thanks to the sound proofing. All in all a fab, beautiful city hotel and an excellent city break.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, lots of extras! My husband and I visited the Senator Gran Via for 3 nights in May 2007. This hotel exceeded our expectations because of its value, location, and service. This hotel is very centrally located, but better yet is the metro stop right outside the hotel entrance. We used the metro stop frequently and it was a real time-saver. The hotel staff are very professional and spoke english well. The hotel was clean, and made us feel comfortable with the little extras they provided at no cost. The mini bar was restocked daily with free water, beer, juice, and cola. Also, it was my birthday and the hotel manager sent up champagne and fruit for free! Overall, it was an excellent stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fabulous Hotel We stayed at the Senator Gran Via on the 16th and 17th March 2006. The hotel is one of the best 4 star hotels I have stayed at and has some lovely 5 star touches such as the free mini bar and the free dental and shaving kits in the bathroom.They also offer free fruit and some drinks beside the reception desk.Room 206 is a decent size with a large wrap-around balcony overlooking the Gran Via.There is a good police presence in the area and if you are a couple you will be ignored by the working girls. If you do find the street where the girls are (Calle Montera) not to your taste then walk up the Gran Via to Calle Carmen/Calle Preciados (2 minutes walk) and turn down one of them to get to Plaza del Sol.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent Breakfast buffet We were very impressed with the excellent breakfast buffet and the mini bars were filled with juice, soda, water and beer and it was FREE.The rooms were good sized and the beds were comfortable and adjustable. Although the hotel is located on a busy street, the rooms were quiet.Tourist attractions are all within walking distance. There is a Metro location within steps of the hotel. The airport is about a twenty-five minute drive from the hotel.There is internet access which charges 1 Euro for ten minutes, 2 Euro for twenty minutes.The staff were very professional. When two family members unfortunately had their wallet/purse stolen, Rosa, the Concierge went about and beyond to help us. She was kind, caring and helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very Convenient Location I booked this hotel based on location and reviews that I read. I was not disappointed. They gave us one of the larger rooms because they said we were staying a full week. Breakfast was great; plenty was offered including omelettes and eggs any way you liked them. Room was clean. We had a great view onto the Gran Via. The french doors seems to have insulated glass and it was pretty quiet. Our balcony had a few cracks in it and slanted a little, so we didn't go out on it very much. The red district was right there, but it was very safe and ot menacing at all. People with little kids walked down there as well. Metro stop right there. Very convenient to everything. Would highly recommend it. October is a great time to go to Madrid.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel in a red light district... Lovely clean, quiet hotel - choice of pillows, adjustable bed, free mini bar and ideal located within walking distance of all of the main sights/shops of Madrid. The hotel is located in the redlight district and prostitues are outside the Hotel night and day and can be viewed from the hotel bar which makes for an evening of great entertainment if you are so inclined.....look out for the Portuguese transvestite prostitute - every town should have one! Having said, that the police presence probably out numbers the prostitues 4 to 1, so this is by no means an intimidating or unpleasent area, but if you are of a sensitive nature like me, you may be a little taken a back at first, none the less we really enjoyed our stay.</p></li>

Got taxi from airport to Hotel, 40 euro but there is a shuttle bus service from hotel to airport 16 euro pp. Asked for a nice room  got one facing on to Gran Via. No noise - Soundproof windows. Red Light street to side of hotel but no distraction. Staff very friendly  helpful. Metro station right outside front door. Ample selection for breakfast. The hotel is well located for sightseeing, Plaza de Espana, Plaza Mayor, Plaza Sol all app 20 mins walk from hotel. Bernabua Stadium app 20 mins away by metro..12 euro for tour.. Well worth it if you are a football fan. Overall hotel was guest friendly, well located  very good value for money.Married Couple - Dublin, Ireland</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Romance  I stayed here for four nights with my partner. What a great place to stay and what an amazing room we had. It was on the 8th floor and had a huge terrace on which to sunbathe and enjoy the magnificent sights of Madrid. The terrace was equipped with sun loungers and table and chairs. The room itself was quite small but the huge terrace more than made up for it. The staff were all friendly and spoke many languages. There was one small problem with the shower that was put right within minutes by the maintenance men. The location was superb and if you need the metro it is right outside the hotel. The free mini bar was great and complementary fruit in the foyer was also a plus! All in all a really nice place to stay and made Marid a memorable romantic holiday!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Incredible Hotel! This is one fabulous hotel!! I have travelled extensively around the world, and never have I come across a hotel that attends to every detail a traveller would want. From the friendly and helpful desk staff to the cold water, orange juice and champagne available each day, to the coffee/tea heating unit and free coffee and tea packages, to the room refrigerator stocked with Coke, beer, water and juice (free for your consumption) to the breakfast where you can get eggs cooked the way you want, sausage and bacon. And, oh...did I mention the CD player and balcony in the room, and the fact that the Gran Via Metro station is literally at the door of the hotel? All this for an extremely fair price. If you have any doubts about where to stay in Madrid, doubt no more.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Give It a Try Stayed here with husband and two friends in October. We had two rooms on sixth floor and with windows shut could not hear noise from the busy street below. Had twin beds with electric controls which meant more sleeping space. The bathrooms were a bit on the small side, but we didnt spend much time in them! The complimentary drinks in the minibar and in the foyer were a bonus. The breakfast had plenty of choice for everyone. Small cafe/bar adjoining main entrance where drinks can be purchased up until midnight. The staff were very obliging. We found a very good restaurant if you turn directly left into the street that runs down the side of the hotel, just a short way on the right. The location was very good and overall we had a brilliant stay, would definitely stay there again if we ever go back to Madrid.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic Hotel My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights during the second leg of our honeymoon from April 29th - May 3rd. This hotel surpassed any expectations I had. The breakfast is excellent and their is so much to choose from: freshly cooked eggs, spanish omlettes, iberian ham, manchego cheese, ....just to name a few. A filling breakfast is essential to start off your long day.The free minibar is also a great treat. The rooms are extremely spacious and very clean. The hotel is walking distance to Puerta Del Sol and Plaza Mayor. There is a convenient subway station right outside the hotel (Gran Via).I wrote them an e-mail to request a room with a good view of the Gran Via since we were on our honey-moon. They not only provided us with a great room but they sent up champagne and fresh fruit on the first night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I agree with all the reviews This hotel doesn't look like much when you drive up to it but it is very nice inside. I asked for a quiet room and was given 419 which only opens to the interior atrium - there was no street noise, only some noise drifting up from breakfast. Our friends had 418 and said there was no siginificant noise. Their breakfast is very good, it's in a good location and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Don't worry about the girls working on the pedestrian street to the left as you leave the hotel. There are always a lot of police in front of the hotel where there is a bus station. It's very hard to approach the hotel by car and load/unload because of this bus station. There is a very good, moderately priced restaurant around the corner called La Gloria de Montera which we enjoyed. We were there Nov. 1 to 3.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">excellent location We have just got back from a 4 night break in Madrid. The hotel is very central with the metro outside the front door of the hotel. We were a little disappointed with the size of our room. The room was extremely small and when I asked for a larger room we were told they were all much the same. The amenities however were excellent. Tea and coffee facilities and a fridge containing soft drinks and beer which was all free. This was restocked daily. The breakfast was very good with an excellent selection of items. Unfortunately the breakfast staff cannot smile and walk around with gloomy faces. This should not put you off the plentiful breakfast. The bar was always busy and had a good menu and cocktails. The staff were happier looking and actually spoke to you. On the whole I would recommend this hotel if you do not mind small bedrooms.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Awesome hotel--A 10! This hotel was excellent in every respect. Our family of five stayed in two rooms in December 2006, and were not disappointed. Rooms were booked on the hotel's website at the rate of 120 euros. Breakfast was not to be included (15 euros extra per person) however, upon checkin, we were told that breakfast WAS included in every web reservation; a pleasant surprise. The location is perfect in every respect. The underground entrance is directly outside the hotel. There is shopping and restaurants in every direction from the hotel. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The free mini bar in every room is unique and a welcome present for the hotel guests. The breakfast was the best of our europe trip, with several food stations including an eggs/omelets cooked to order. Stay at this hotel, you will not be disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">simply a great place to stay We stayed here for 4 nights and we were really surprised and how great this hotel really was ! we booked it after reading some good reviews but it still exceeded our expecations. The free mini bar in each room is a real bonus and the staff are all friendly, there is even a bottle of champagne on ice in the reception all day if you feel like a glass! the only (slight) downside is the redlight district down one of the side roads, so if travelling with children this could be a slight problem, but it can be avoided by walking a number of different ways so should not stop you staying here! Also I would recommend to not have dinner in the hotel, not because there is anything wrong with it, but there are so many great places to eat I wouldnt want people to miss out on some real spanish cuisine - the meals in the hotel are basic hotel dinners !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Definitely 4 star +++++ My husband and I spent 5 nights here and enjoyed it immensely. It is centrally located within walking distance to everything. The street to the side of the hotel (Montero) caters to the ladies of the night, but we found it to be more entertaining than dangerous. The hotel is equipped with all the necessities plus some. The refrigerator with water, beer, soda is a real plus and is stocked daily. Request a top floor, corner room if possible. Our corner room had 3 balconies and overlooked the Gran Via. If you like to shop, be sure to go to Corte Ingles on the Gran Via. We splurged and hired a private guide to take us to Toledo for the day. We loved this unique city. Transportation from the airport by taxi cost us about $30. If you're traveling on a weekday, allow for extra time; traffic is awful! If you choose this hotel, you won't be disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect for city centre Madrid This hotel was the perfect place for a city break in Madrid. Our group (2 mothers and 4 teenagers) had three twin bedded rooms (with such comfy beds) on the 6th floor and were perfect for us. The hotel is brilliantly located for a city break - metro is 10 steps from the hotel entrance! There are shops and restaurants very close by and the Madrid Vision tourist bus stop is a two minute walk away. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough if you want a place to stay in Madrid for a city break. The hotel staff were friendly and efficient and the breakfast buffet (included in our room rate) was fresh and delicious. The hotel is an interesting design too - the rooms are around a narrow atrium and the glass sided lifts run up and down the atrium. All in all, we had an excellent stay and would definitely stay here again if we return to Madrid.</p></li>

<li>The <span style="background-color:#e6194b">hotel</span> is <span style="background-color:#e6194b">brilliantly located</span> for a city break - metro is 10 steps from the hotel entrance!</br></br></li>
<li>There are <span style="background-color:#e6194b">shops</span> and restaurants <span style="background-color:#e6194b">very close by</span> and the Madrid Vision tourist bus stop is a two minute walk away.</li>

<li>I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough if you want a place to stay in Madrid for a city break.</br></br></li>
<li>The hotel staff were friendly and efficient and the breakfast buffet (included in our room rate) was fresh and delicious.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#f032e6">hotel</span> is an <span style="background-color:#f032e6">interesting</span> design too - the rooms are around a narrow atrium and the glass sided lifts run up and down the atrium.</li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Bien, Bien for the Gran Via Spent 3 wonderful nights at the Gran Via in November--We wish it could have been more. Centrally located in the heart of Madrid--where you are able to catch the essence of the busy Spanish city.The rooms are larger than other european hotels and the bathrooms are updated and big. We were suprised how quiet our room was at night, because the traffic and action on the streets below never seems to stop.The working girls along ave. La Montera make for colorful landscape, but do not bother anyone who is not interested.We recommend a Cuban restaurant that we found in walking distance called La Negra Tomaso. Delicious affordable food and a fun atmosphere. Be sure to eat the complimentary breakfast the hotel offers and to use the Free mini-bar in the room. These extra perks, combined with the lovely room, make this property a Must for anyone who needs a place to stay in Madrid.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location We stayed in The Senator Gran Via in February this year for 3 nights. We had our 10 month old with us and they had a cot in the room when we arrived and there was no problem getting a high chair every morning at breakfast. We ate in the restaurant the night we arrived and it was very nice. The staff in the restaurant were extremely helpful and friendly for our stay and the choice was very good for breakfast. The hotel is very central for all we wanted. It's a couple of minutes walk to Puerto del Sol where there's a great selection of shops and a few more minutes away and you're in Plaza Mayor. The room we had felt alot smaller as we had the cot too but it was very clean. There is a red light district directly outside but we weren't out very late any night and it wasn't overly obvious. I only really realised a couple of days into the trip. All in all a very nice hotel and very central.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel - Excellent location Stayed here for 3 nights in early February. Metro brought us direct from the airport to the hotels front door for 鈧? which was great. Very central location, literally a stroll to everything you might want to see. Breakfast was included and this was very good with a good selection of everything you would expect. Free mini bar in the room, mostly soft drinks and juices but also a couple of beers which was nice. We had a corner room which had two balconies and overlooked the Gran via. The room ws very spacious and airy but judging from the fire escape map it was bigger than most. The hotel is very well maintained and the staff couldn't be more polite and helpful. Other posters have complained about the ladies of the night loitering nearby but they won't cause you any annoyance whatsoever. Highly recomended. If we ever go back to Madrid we'll be returning to this hotel for sure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect for our stay.... My wife and I stayed here from 27 to 30 may 2006. The location was perfect for a short break. The room was just the right size for two people, was spotlessly clean and had everything you could want (including the free mini bar and free Cava in the reception area!!). We opted for breakfast and weren't dissapointed. A good choice of cold meats, cheese, fruit, cereals, bread, cakes, yoghurts and individually prepared omelettes. The only fault I could mention is that the receptionist couldn't find our booking but was very helpful and sorted it out immediately. Every member of the staff who we dealt with were very curteous and helpful.To return to the airport use their mini bus which cost 6鈧?each as opposed to 25鈧?for a taxi.I would definately recommend this hotel and would certainly stay there again.If anyone would like any further information including some great 'local' bars just e-mail me.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent Just returned from a weekend in Madrid where we stayed at the Senator Gran Via Hotel. This hotel is excellent in every respect. The location is very central to Puerto del Sol, Plaza Mayor, Gran Via Street.The hotel staff are friendly, english speaking and extremely helpful with restaurant bookings and advice.Our room was on a top floor with a large balcony overlooking Gran Via. The room has everything you could possibly need and yes the mini bar is free and is stocked up daily. The beds were very comfortable and they even give you the option of various types of pillows!I cannot fault this hotel in any way.The area is well policed but beware of pickpockets in restaurants where they will sit behind you with a large coat over the back of their chair in an attempt to relieve you of your bag! Can highly recommend the Madrid Cathedral bar for an excellent lunch for 鈧?.50 - you won't believe the lunch you get.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Did not live up to expectations Chose this hotel based on the glowing reviews from Tripadvisor. Stayed 2 nights, and the first night my husband and I were given room 719. It was a dark, dinky room with the window facing the atrium, and reeked of tobacco though it was a non-smoking room. Half the curtain was missing. The safety deposit box did not work. The A/C did not work. We were told no other room was available. The staff was quick to send somebody up to spray air freshner and fix the safety deposit box, but the odor was unbearable. It was a miserable night. The next morning, we asked for another room again, and were given a different room that was slightly bigger and had a small balcony overlooking a side street. The front desk staff was very helpful, but the quality of the rooms did not warrant the rate nor the glowing reviews. It was the most disappointing of the 3 hotels we stayed in Spain based on Tripadvisor reviews.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the Senator Gran Via Stayed at the Senator Gran Via for 3 days from 18-21 May 2007. Enjoyed our stay in this Hotel. Everything was perfect. Room was brilliant. We were upgraded to a suite as I asked for a nice room due to the fact we were celebrating a wedding anniversary. We were not charged for this upgrade and a lovely bottle of Champane also awaited us! As others have said the free mini bar was a nice touch. The bathroom was good, shower had a good pressure of water. The only negative thing I would say is that the Hotel is probably due a bit of a facelift (corridor's looked as if they needed painting) and towels although clean were not that fluffy and had been used a lot. This is only a minor gripe though. The breakfast was also very good. It's a very cedntral hotel, near all amenities.All in all an excellent hotel and would definately reccomend it. We found the best deal on 123hotels.com - cheaper than the Hotel website.</p></li>

This hotel looks nice but it is located in an area filled with prostitutes and other related bas fond types. As soon as we arrived we tried to connect to the hotel wireless system which for some reason was not working. So we called the reception and tech staff was sent promptly to our room to fix it. He could see we had a new Vaio. The next day when we were away someone entered our room and stole the Vaio plus its charger and a Nokia cell phone charger. The safe was set to lock and unlock with the plastic magnetic band we used to lock unlock the room door, so we decided to put some stuff in the suitcase and lock it. The suitcase was forced. Luckily our credit cards were with us. After noticing we were robbed we told reception and showed them the damaged suitcase. However nothing was done by hotel management so we called the Police and declared robbery then went to the Police station to sign the papers.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Comfortable and convenient Stayed here in mid-June after finding that our first choice, the sister hotel, Senator Gran Via, had no rooms. The Senator Gran Via clerk had arranged for us to stay at the Gran Via earlier. We had a corner room overlooking the Gran Via. The room had doors that opened onto balconies. We had a king-size bed, but our daughter slept on a sort of couch/daybed. The room was absolutely quiet despite being on the street.The hotel restaurant served a very good dinner. Our deal didn't include breakfast with the room and it was $11/person for a uninspired buffet. The location allows easy walking to many of Madrid's most famous cultural attractions.We weren't aware of [----] on the side street during the day, but they were out by early evening. Still, they didn't dominate the scene. The street was filled with many Spanish families, workers and shoppers going about their daily business. All in all, it was a pleasant hotel in a convenient location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location! Great Hotel! We chose this hotel based on location and price. We arrived in the morning(way before check-in) and the staff was very accomodating-they gave us a room on the top floor with a terrace. My husband and I were very impressed with the size of the room and bathroom, although I will say that the bed was very hard! The breakfast was nothing to write home about. Meats, fruit, pastries and cereal-I'm not sure if it was worth the extra money. I recommend finding a cafe or restaurant to eat breakfeast, you'll get about the same stuff for half the price! The staff was friendly and helpful and spoke about 85% English. However, the location was perfect! We didn't get in a cab or use the subway once! I read some reviews talking about the Ladies of the Night situation and yes, I did see them on the street that runs next to the hotel. However, they really don't bother anybody and I felt perfectly safe. I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, decent price We stayed at the Gran Via for 3 days on a business trip, and I must say that I was impressed. The price was only about 100 Euros per day, and the location was just about perfect. We walked to all of the major sites in Madrid, and for our meetings that took place further away, there was a metro stop,literally outside the front door and taxis on the curb. The breakfast is extremely impressive. It is quite varied and includes a wide array of meats and cheezes, pasteries, fruits, and even cereal. Every morning I looked forward to freshly squeezed Spanish orange juice.The hotel restaurant was pretty good and quite authentic.By authentic, I merely mean that it had not been Americanized. For example, we had a HUGE pan of paella, but unlike the paella you might find the US, all of the seafood was completely whole, making the shrimp, etc, somewhat difficult to eat. This is not a criticism, just a warning for first-timers to Madrid. All of the food was quite good.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel Great Location Have just returned from a three night stay which was very enjoyable. Its very hard to find anything wrong with this hotel it was clean and in a great location and the breakfast on offer was excellent. Our room was on the seventh floor at the front of the hotel and the noise wasn't that even with the French windows open all night. The only complaint I have was that at breakfast and for two mornings in a row I was sat next to the service trolley for dirty dishes and leftovers which parked next to me although briefly. The scraping of dishes and the ingrained food on the handle of the trolley was a bit off putting to say the least but to be fair there really wasn't anywhere else for it to go and I could have complained but I don't speak any Spanish and the staff didn't appear to speak much English.Having said that as I previously said great hotel, great location and I would stay there again. Our taxi was 鈧?5 each way from the airport, for four of us so great value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the Senator Reserved a room through Booking.com. King bed with a view of Gan Via. The room was great! Very nice bathroom, comfy bed and a balcony. Our room was faced Gran Via but we never had any issue with noise. The free mini bar is a great touch. Water, Fanta and beer restocked daily. As a plus, the breakfast was included and not too bad. You get made to order omlets and eggs, fruit, cereal, cheese, pastries and juices. All day long, the lobby has water and juice out for its customers. The wife and I have been in Europe for 2 weeks now(London, Paris, Madrid) and I can honestly say, you can't beat this hotel for the price. The rooms are VERY clean and well appointed. The A/C is great and the location is perfect. For the most part, we walked everywhere we wanted to go. Some might have issue with the prostitutes on the street around the hotel. That's just the particular area. There were no issues at all. The wife and I were walking around with no problems at all hours. Don't hesitate to book this hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Red Light Senator I booked this hotel having reviewed Trip advisor and wasn't disappointed. It is on the edge of the red light district alright but this provided endless entertainment for my wife as she sunned herself on the balcony of our lovely room which overlooked the pedestrian street which leads down(a short walk) to the Puerta Sol(not sure is spelling right). There are plenty of police around day and night so the area felt very safe. We didn't dine at the hotel but can confirm that the breakfast was excellent with a large choice of everything you could possibly want.Everything is within a short walk e.g Plaza Mayor and the Madrid Vision Bus stops on the street nearby on the Gran Via. We got a 2 day pass which cost 20 euro per person - handy way of getting around as you can hop on and off wherever you want.Expect to pay about 25 euro for a taxi to the airport.I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel and as others have said the free mini bar is a nice touch although no vino for the ladies - just beer and soft drinks.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Real Gem! Read many of the reviews for the hotel, therefore no surprises! We were on the first floor down the side street so no view but a lovely room none the less and as we left and returned in the dark didn't really make a difference. The room was great, breakfast very good, staff friendly all in all a wonderful place to stay. Couple of comments! Free mini bar is free but has two bottles beer, water and coke and one baby carton of milk! The road we looked out over was obviously where the ladies of the night took their gentlemen friends for 20 minutes or so. Didn't bother us at all but if you don't like to see and if you look out of your window it is hard not to, don't have a room on the side street. It would have been nice to have a better view but no complaints what so ever about the hotel itself, we have been to many big cities and the rooms here are huge compared to most city hotels so have a Gran Via view and you will have a really fantastic break here. Also found no better deal than their own web site and I looked every where!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Another theft from the hotel reception area! Like a previous reviewer we had the distressing experience of having a bag stolen from the reception area as we were about to check in. If the reception staff invite you to leave your bags while you have a welcome drink......don't do it! Not sure if what is going on is an inside job or not but two similar incidents in the same week is a bit suspicious. Like the other reviewer we found that staff were not really concerned about the theft, did not pass on information to other staff and we have still to hear from the manager! We did finally get a bottle of champagne and bowl of fruit with an apology but this was only after we spent several hours at the Police Station giving a report (not a nice experience) and several hours and hundreds of dollars replacing medications, toiletries etc. Nothing was irreplaceable and we tried not to let it spoil our holiday but if these thefts are happening within the hotel i can only warn all potential visitors to be vigilant with their belongings. And don't expect much help from the staff!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Rather dissapointed. Judging by the reviews and 11th best in Madrid I was excited and expecting great things from this hotel. It just doesn't live up to its reputation. Basic furniture, smallish room and bathroom , curtains shabby, nothing terribly wrong but not that lovely feeling when you know you've walked into a really good hotel room.Yes, the breakfast's nice but it's served in a dreary basement area with sullen staff. Why can't a sunny light room be used to start the day?What we did like was the cold Cava available in the reception area, a lovely generous touch, far better than the free mini bar. So, I would say that this hotel is ok, but there are better places to stay in Madrid. I love Madrid, and I'll be back, but not at this hotel or the Gran Via. Back to the nice, interesting hotels tucked away somewhere.Don't be lured by 'location' , Madrid is so easy to navigate, or by the free mini bar, there are too many great bars to explore to have time to use a hotel mini bar.Enjoy Madrid, it is a fantastic city, full of life, good food and wine.- and it truely never sleeps!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel Senator Gran Via 28th Sept - 2nd oct 2006I booked this hotel from the reviews on the Trip advisor website.I booked 5 rooms in all for a (mature) hen weekend , all we wanted was a central hotel with the sights near and good restaurants. We were not disappointed the hotel staff were very professional and curteous and spoke english. The rooms were clean and spacious, and also had a mini fridge in the rooms with various complimentary drinks, which was well appreciated after a day site seeing. The only thing I was disappointed in was the breakfast and staff, our waitress was having a bad morning and seemed quite happy in taking it out on the diners, for the cost of the breakfast 14 euros it was a basic continental arrangement. I would advise going to one of the local cafes.The ladies of the night were no problem at all in fact for someone who is quite observant I didn't particularly see any unless they were pointed out and there is always lots of police around. we felt completely safe and I would go back and stay again. Definitely worth the money and the rating it gets.</p></li>

The staff were extremely apologetic, polite and helpful in dealing with this situation and personally took us to the other hotel.The next day we returned to the Senator Gran Via and were more than pleased to be told that we had been upgraded to one of their junior suites due to the inconvenience caused.When we went to the room we realised that they had actually put us into the best room in the hotel with a huge private sun terrace with a view sraight down the Gran Via. When we returned to the room after our first day out we had a bottle of Cava and glasses waiting for us to enjoy.Infact any time of the day you can help yourself to the complimentary cava in the lovely lobby area.Overall the staff were extremely helpful and polite, the hotel very pleasing and relaxing to be in, and position couldn't be better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic hotel, highly recommend it I stayed in the Senator Gran Via for 5 days for my boyfriends 40th Birthday. I had requested a top floor room and the one we were given was lovely, it was a bit on the small side but we didn't mind as we didn't spend that much time in the room anyway! We made full use of the complimentary mini bar during our stay, which was great! The only problem we found was apart from making the bed, the maid's didn't seem to be too efficient in the actual room as a couple of shelves were rather dusty and obviously hadn't been cleaned for a while. However the bathroom and toilet were very clean so I can't really complain. The hotel receptionists were extremely helpful and gave good advice when I asked about nice eateries etc nearby. Breakfast staff and bar staff in the hotel weren't very impressive but it didn't spoil our enjoyment of the food and drinks (of which there is a vast amount of choice to suit everyone).We didn't have any problems with the working girls outside the hotel or any external noise at night.Overall, it was an excellent stay and we'd definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">GREAT LOCATION My wife and I just came back after a 3 night break in Madrid for our one year wedding anniversary! After reading the reviews we decided to book this hotel. When booking the hotel we stated that we were there for our anniversary and so when we arrived they upgraded us for free! We were told that the mini bar was free, so one of the first things we did was check what we got. In the fridge was 1 water, 1 coke and 1 sachet of milk, we both looked at each other and said we can't complain because it's free. We then get a knock on the door asking us if it was ok to fill our mini bar!!! She added three beers, water - both still and sparkling, coke, diet coke, three typesof juices, fanta and lemonade! It was also re-filled EVERYDAY!On the same day in the evening we get another knock on the door, when I opened it the hotel provided us with a bottle of champagne and a bowl of fruit, to celebrate our anniversary!The metro stop is right outside the hotel, as is a McDonalds!!! Taxi fare from the airport is approx 25 - 30 euros, and takes about 20 mins. Overall we had a brill time, and would def go again!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Deservedly Number One Just came back from spending eight nights here.Don't even consider elsewhere. Centrally-located and with all amenities (and some you didn't even think of: reclining chair and bed with elevating mattress). Choice of pillows. Superb mattress. Soundproof - both from the street (with double-glazed windows) and from the hall (with double doors). Omelettes freshly prepared to your order at breakfast with ample choices of absolutely everything else. Wish I could find this sort of hotel everywhere. What avalue!I also put up three other friends here - all of whom loved it. Tried to get two other couples in but they were already full.The Director of the hotel, who is fluent in English, was especially helpful. The whole operation was well-run. They are part of the playasentaor chain. I'm going to make a point of looking for their properties when I stay elsewhere.Pity my friends who couldn't get in and had to stay at the Ritz for six times the price where the halls smelled of mildew - and their room was decorated bordello-style. Only reason to go to the Ritz seems to be to dine or drink on its terrace.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Do not recommend I am totally puzzled as to how this hotel is #2 in TA. We paid 鈧?20 a night for a twin room. Our room was terrible - very small and uncomfortable, there is no way these rooms are 4 star. When we asked for a better room we were informed all the twin rooms are the same. It doesn't matter how much cheap cava is provided in reception, or how much free beer and coke you can drink from the mini-bar, if the room is bad, the hotel is bad. 鈧?20 was massively overpriced for what we got. If you can get a twin inc. breakfast for less than 鈧?00, go for it, otherwise, there HAS to be better places than this in Madrid. On the plus side, the breakfast was good and the location is good. There is no hotel security during the day, and the staff don't seem to care who walks around the hotel - we were held at reception for 20 minutes as they couldn't find our booking, and in that time 2 different dodgy-looking people who clearly weren't guests came in, hung around and eyed our handbags and luggage until they realised I was watching them, and then they left. The reception staff didn't seem to notice or care, which was very odd</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Be careful A friend and I stayed at the hotel last June, each with our own rooms. My room was very small, but I paid for a single. My friend's room was larger, but she had to pay the double rate. Also her room had only one window that overlooked the atrium, not the outdoors and at times, the echo from the voices and the water fountain were very loud. The biggest problem was the neighborhood. As mentioned, the street next to the hotel is the red light district. We wandered down the street a couple of times and the girls and/or clients don't bother you, but the girls look very sad and pathetic. Because of the neighborhood, there was a big police presence. However, that doesn't stop anyone from getting into the hotel. One night my friend got off on the wrong floor and was followed onto the elevator and then to her room by a man who was drunk/drugged who tried to kiss her. She managed to push him away and get into her room, but she was very shaken by the incident. Since she doesn't speak Spanish and the night staff does not speak English, she did not report it.I would not recommend staying at this hotel if you are staying alone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great place to stay Just returned from an 8 night stay at the Senator Gran Via in Madrid. We were originally assigned a room on the first floor, but were concerned about possible traffic noise, so requested another room. We were immediately given another room on the 7th floor and had no problems with traffic noise other than the occasional siren. We had a corner room, which appeared to have a little more space than some rooms. The decor is pleasant and the entire hotel was clean and nice. The breakfast buffet was excellent and there was an egg station for omelets or other eggs cooked to order. Champagne was also available free of charge at breakfast and in the lobby every afternoon.The hotel staff were all excellent. They were always cheerful and helpful no matter what the need.The location was also excellent. The Gran Via metro stop is right outside the door, but the hotel is still close enough to major museums, that it was possible to walk if you wanted.. We did see a few ladies of the night on the walkway down from the hotel off the main road, but it wasn't a big issue.Overall, it was an excellent place to stay and I would definitely recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">2nd Visit - equally as good Having stayed here in May 2004, we decided to have a long bank holiday weekend at the Senator to take advantage of the excellent rates (85 Euros per room per night including breakfast - booked on hotels own website) and the cheap fares with easyjet.We asked for a non-smoking room looking out on the Gran Via if possible - we got a non-smoking room, looking onto Gran Via with a balcony!The room was a bit smaller than previously, but very clear and very comfortable. The breakfast was excellent - but if not included in your price you could eat much more economically in one of the many cafes nearby (Zahara for instance).The area is a bit seedy witha few prostitutes around - but they are not threatening and the police are always around. The Gran Via is noisy but what do you come to a capital city for?Unlike the previous correspondent out aircon worked very well and the staff have always been very helpful with the few queries we have made of them.I have stayed in 5 hotels in Madrid and would fully recommend the Senator. Try also the Senator in Barcelona if you are staying there - a little far out (near the Camp Neu) but a good hotel and a nice area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved this hotel I loved our stay at this hotel. It was perfectly located - less than 5 mins walk to Puerta del Sol and the Plaza Major and next to the Gran Via metro stop.Things we loved about the hotel: comfy beds with cool remote control recliners, little balcony onto the Gran Via, the free mini bar - i loved the range of fruit juices, fizzy drinks and water, my hubby loved his two free beers each day :-), fabulous breakfast with a range of Spanish hams, cheeses, fruits and pastries - don't be expecting a full English cooked breakfast, TV with CNN so we could keep up with the news, location next to metro and tour bus on the Gran Via, helpful and friendly staff.Can't really think of any negatives - there have been comments about the prostitues outside. They tend to be on the pedestrian route between Gran Via and Sol but to be honest, they didn't bother us. For holidaymakers with children, it's not likely to be an issue as they tend to just stand in doorways dressed in jeans.Also, we didn't come across any pickpocketing during our 4 night stay but I was always carefully to wear my bag diagonally across my body.Overall, we would definitely stay at this hotel if we return to Madrid.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A great place to stay! I have just returned from a 3 night stay in the Senator Gran Via. I thought the hotel was excellent and thoroughly deserving of a TripAdvisor 5 star customer satisfaction rating. The staff were extremely helpful at all times. Any request made to them was handled professionally and politely. We stayed in a very nice room on a high floor. The room was not huge, but it had everything a traveller could ask for (including a free mini bar). The area around the Gran Via is very good for shopping and sight seeing, with most of the major attractions within a 15 minute walk. I would recommend paying for the bus tours but would advise all travellers to stay away from eating out in some of the more popular tourist areas. The Plaza Mayor is very nice, but the food in the cafes/restaurants leaves a lot to be desired. One word of caution, be very careful with your belongings, particularly if you are eating out. Make sure that you keep your bags in sight at all times. Our group had two very near misses. The thieves there seem to be targeting cafes and shops for easy pickings. Overall though a fantastic stay, I will certainly be going back to the Gran Via on my next trip back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Watch your belongings We have just returned from our 2 week trip to Spain. While in Madrid, we stayed at the Gran Via, and would not recommend it to anyone. My purse was stolen in the lobby of the hotel, within view of the front desk. With much distress, (as you can imagine), we asked the staff for help in cancelling credit cards, cell phones, etc, and they were extremembly rude, and very unwilling to cooperate. They actually told us that making these phone calls might get them into trouble. No manager came to talk to us, no security ever asked us any questions. Many times during our stay at Gran Via, the staff gave us incorrect information of opening times of museums, never helped us with restaurant recommendations, and just seemed to be inconvienenced by any questions we might have. The only positive thing I can say about the hotel, is the mini-bar in the room is wonderful, after a long, hot day of sightseeing.My husband and I have traveled internationally quite a bit, and we have never had this type of experience before. If you are undecided in your hotel choice for Madrid, please think of a hotel, other than Senator Gran Via.By the way, the rest of our vacation to Sevilla, Granada, and Barcelona was wonderful.CMA</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Super Choice This was a fabulous choice. Reasonable rate, wonderful location close to Plaza Mayor/Sol. Especially nice rooms, large with free minibars. A great touch when you come in from sightseeing-cold soda, water, beer. The beds were adjustable. Very quiet. The only problem was getting to the hotel. We tried to take bus from airport. I don't even know where we ended up but took a cab and after unloading and entering found it had taken us to sister hotel by mistake-Hotel Senator Espana at 70 Gran Via.In fact, there was a problem with booking, some of our party was booked at this hotel while we were booked down the street. Also, they warned us about luggage being stolen from reception so had to keep our eye on that while we figured out where to go. They were not helpful with the mixup. We dragged our luggage for blocks to the correct place but it proved worth it. Breakfast buffet was included-something I look for when choosing hotels-it was very good and was enough to hold us for the day. we ate dinner there that night and it was satisfactory but on the high side for what you got. A tip to anyone planning a train trip-book your tickets ahead.!! We spent hours getting our tickets for 2 trips to Granada and to Toledo.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ditto.. pretty good but not amazing I booked this hotel based on all the 5 stars that were awarded to it on this site. Having stayed there, I don't know why it's rated so highly - it's a satisfactory hotel, no more. It is very central but it's the equivalent of staying in Picadilly Square, London or Times Square, London: move a few minutes further out and you will find nicer/quieter areas. If you come out of this hotel and turn left, you'll see all the prostitutes standing on the street - it doesn't feel unsafe but it doesn't look nice either.We initially were given a room right on second floor, right on the corner. The noise from the v. heavy traffic on the street was horrendous. Luckily they had a room free on the 7th floor and we moved there, that was quiet. My friend had a room facing the internal atrium - quiet but very small. We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment on this. Housekeeping is erratic: old food trays and sheets left outside room until late in the evening, sometimes they forgot to refill our fridge. There are also complimentary drinks left at Reception but these go quite quickly. Madrid is a compact city and v. easy to get around so I recommend staying a little further out, that should get you something a little more charming.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the Hotel I stayed at this hotel with 6 ladies last november 2007. I would give this hotel the following grades:Location: 5/5 - We got the metro from the airport to the grand via stop and when we got off we looked up and saw the hotel standing straight in front of us. Could not have been easier.Room: 4/5 - We were on the 4th Floor facing the main street, fab views of the beautiful buildings and no probs at all at night with street noise. Room clean and spacious and good bathroom sizeBreakfast: 4/5 - Good choice buffet breakfast - nice little corner in restaurant where they cooked the eggs fresh for you - nice touchStaff: Housekeeping  Reception 5/5 - Both teams smiley, friendly and helpful  Waiting staff (especially the females in the bar) extremely rude, unfriendly and unhelpful - we felt that we were annoying them when we asked for a drink! - Really they let the hotel down and tainted our overall experience of the hotel.One other point to note, we all found the food in the grand via (main street - not hotel itself) restaurants very poor (to the point the we even considered a trip to Mcdonalds, which is located across the street from the hotel) we tried Saharas, Italians, a diner and a chinese restaurant - All were as unpleasant as each other!!!</p></li>

<li>- Really they let the hotel down and tainted our overall experience of the hotel.One other point to note, we all found the food in the grand via (main street - not hotel itself) restaurants very poor (to the point the we even considered a trip to Mcdonalds, which is located across the street from the hotel) we tried Saharas, Italians, a diner and a chinese restaurant - All were as unpleasant as each other!!</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">good location stayed at the Senator Gran Via for 3 nights at end of March 2008.Hotel location - excellent, within walking distance of all the major sites  right on the Madrid Metro line (Gran Via).Would rate it as 3 star not 4 star. Pleasant interior, bathroom a bit small but no real problem, beds very good  free minibar and safe. Not overly expensive so I would say it's good value for the money. A fabulous restaurant in the next street called Gloria.(or something like that). Very reasonably priced, (we paid 45 euros for a 3 course meal for 2 people including a bottle of good Rioja), which we would have had to pay 70-80 euros for a comparable meal elsewhere. Will I be returning to Madrid? - Definitely.Would I stay at the same hotel? - Yes probably.Tips for travellers-When arriving at the airport, don't bother gatting a taxi as the Metro system links to airport to Madrid City Centre. We bought a three day Metro pass for 8 euros. The link takes 12 minutes from the airport to Madrid centre. The Metro is easy to understand as it is like the London Underground, each line is numbered and colour coded.The Plaza Mayor is in the heart of old madrid, but you will be charged 70% extra if you eat  drink overlooking the square. Go back a couple of streets from the square and you will eat for less than half the price!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A straightforward good hotel This hotel is ideally located: the front door is immediately outside the Metro entrance! This makes getting there very easy from Madrid-Barajas airport. 35 minutes and two changes -鈧? for a single trip, as opposed to the usual 鈧? on the rest of the etro. There is also a shuttle bus that runs hourly from 7am for the return trip (8鈧?a head in cash at booking)The staff were efficient and helpful and all the front desk staff spoke English well enough to help sort out bookings etc for us. Breakfast was a good and generous buffet with excellent coffee. We had a standard room on the 4th floor- a little dark but very well appointed, including an electrically controlled bed, a pillow menu(!) and a perfectly decent little sound system. The safe didn't work when we followed the instructions and swiped our room card through the slot, but worked perfectly well when we punched in a 4-digit code. No problem if you're prepared to think for 30 seconds....Several other guests commented on the ladies of negotiable affection on the road running down from the hotel. They don't hassle anybody, and really are no problem at all. Once again, the location is excellent; not only handy for the Metro, but about 15-20 min easy stroll from the Prado. Across Gran Via is Chueca, one of the districts full of bars and restaurants</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful Stay at the Gran Via *We stayed at the Gran Via for 5 days in July, 2007. We had 2 rooms. One room was wheelchair accessible. One room was a standard room. Both rooms were perfect. The accessible room was spacious, the bathroom had a roll-in shower and a large outdoor terrace overlooking the Gran Via. (It was perfect for a person requiring a wheelchair accessible room.) The standard room was small in size but perfect for my husband and I. There was also a very small balcony overlooking a side street. *In both rooms the complimentary mini bar was always well stocked with beer, sodas and water. There was also complimentary fresh fruit delivered to both rooms at check-in. *In the afternoon a beverage station was available by the front desk. We enjoyed the complimentary champagne, stilled water, orange juice and water with gas.*The hotel restuarant had a fair buffet for breakfast. It was basically a continental breakfast with a short order cook available to prepare eggs any way you want.*The location is prime. It's simple to hail a cab. It's simple to walk to all the surrounding stores and restuarants and a short walk to the squares. *There are working ladies in the area but they don't bother the tourists. *The hotel is clean and the staff are very helpful. *Stay at the Senator Gran Via...you will really enjoy it!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic choice After looking at many hotels on the Tripadvisor website, I found the Senator Gran Via. I was persuaded by the many positive reviews to give this hotel a chance and it turned out to be a fantastic choice.We were two families traveling to Spain with a total of 5 teenagers ages 14-20. The four rooms we booked were all clean and bigger than we had anticipated. My room on the 8th floor even had a terrace, which the adults utilized in the evening.The rooms were quite modern and spotless. The free minibar was a pleasure after spending the day touring in the hot sun. The breakfast was sumptuous, compared to other breakfasts we had throughout Spain. The location was perfect. We walked to the Prado, the Royal Palace, the Plaza Mayor. Regarding the ladies of the evening issue--we told our kids about this and when we walked by, our daughters counted how many they found before we reached the Puerta del Sol; the boys were slightly amused. In fact, it was really quite sad to see them standing there all day. So, for our families, it was a non-issue.We found the staff to be more than gracious and helpful. Although I speak Spanish, they were fluent in English. They gave suggestions for restaurants--Gino's for Italian food. The bellman always had a smile on his face.All in all, I can't say enough great things about this hotel. After a four night stay, we were sad to leave. I would absolutely stay there again while in Madrid. Enjoy!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything fine except internet access rates Very good hotel, with a very good location.Among the (many) positive points: large and clean rooms, sound-proof windows (so there is all the benefit on being on Gran Vian, without the noise of the traffic), nice interior with inside-panoramic elevators, good breakfast with a lot of choice.The location is ideal, on Gran via (cinema  theater avenue), at 200 m of Puerta del Sol, and a little bit more of Plaza Mayor. A subway station and bus stops are just in front.To be complete about a negative point mentioned by other reviewers: the hotel is also at the corner of Montera street, which is certainly not the nicest place in town (some prostitutes and a few sex shops), but this cannot be considered as a problem, first because the hotel is not in the street itself, so it can be completely avoided during your stay. Secondly, there is no particular danger: this street is wide, and there are a lot of tourists at any time because it is the shortest way between Gran Via and Puerta del Sol (not to mention that police is very present everywhere in central Madrid).The only bad surprise in this hotel was the internet connexion rate (accessible either by Wifi, cable or the room's TV/multimedia system), which is sold at the prehistoric rate of 10 鈧?for 1 hour and 20 鈧?for 24h (yes, you read correctly). Anyway, besides this minor point, this hotel is a very good choice. I would definitely come back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Look beneath the headlines We booked this hotel direct using the hotels own website and went with another couple booking 2 rooms staying for 4 nights from 10th Feb. On arrival advised only 1 room reserved but on seeing our printed confirmation quickly remedied. Rooms as you would expect for a hotel of this standard. Nice beds, choice of pillows a nice touch, good shower, nice and free mini bar (very unusual). Our room was on 7th floor overlooking Gran Via with a small balcony. Kept awake first night by continuous sirens and hooting of car horns despite efficient double glazing. However housekeeping left a little to be desired. Replacement of toiletries and replacement of tea and coffee etc. didn't happen. Only happened after complaint to manager. Saw manager as received request to contact reception after 3rd night and advised that we had exceeded the hotels limit of E300. (This was only for the room, no other costs were incurred) We had left credit card details at beginning of stay. Were advised that all guests are put on this limit. Have seen no reviews mention this and have never come across this before.After sorting this out we found champagne and fruit in our room that evening as an apology. We also booked the shuttle for the airport but were dropped off at terminal 4 and told to get the internal shuttle to our terminal (1). We were not advised by the hotel that this would happen.Overall not a bad hotel but let down by lots of little niggles</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect Location, Perfect Room, Perfect Service I have traveled extensively throughout the United States and Europe and have to say that Hotel Senator Gran Via is one of the best kept secrets in Madrid. My mother and I just finished a tour of Spain...Madrid, Barcelona and Sevilla. All of the hotels we stayed in were Trip Advisor top rated hotels. Our goal was to find quaint, comfortable, safe, boutique hotels in central locations --- what a surprise to find that the Senator Gran Via had not only the above but far more: warm welcome, friendly service, a great restaurant (we had dinner in the restaurant and found that the food and the service was as good as some of the best restaurant meals we had in Spain), complimentary mini bar items, kraftmatic type beds in the standard rooms, truly the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in, fantastic views, huge bathtubs...perfect for soaking after a long day of touring....all at a really great in season rate of 120 Euros per night. I booked directly with the hotel after checking with hotels.com, expedia and travel sites in Europe found that direct booking offered the best rate. The location was prime for access to Plaza Mayor, all the museums, great shopping and restaurants. And, only a five minute cab ride from the Atocha train station in Madrid. Just a word of caution for those of you traveling from the airport -- the cost of a cab ride is approximately 15-20 Euro and we found more than one traveling couple that had been charged 40-50 Euro with cabbies that did not run their meters from the airport.</p></li>

<li>My mother and I just finished a tour of Spain...Madrid, Barcelona and Sevilla.</br></br></li>
<li>All of the <span style="background-color:#f032e6">hotels</span> we stayed in were Trip Advisor <span style="background-color:#f032e6">top rated</span> hotels.</br></br></li>
<li>Our goal was to find quaint, comfortable, safe, boutique hotels in central locations --- what a surprise to find that the Senator Gran Via had not only the above but far more: warm welcome, friendly service, a great restaurant (we had dinner in the restaurant and found that the food and the service was as good as some of the best restaurant meals we had in Spain), complimentary mini bar items, kraftmatic type beds in the standard rooms, truly the most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in, fantastic views, huge bathtubs...perfect for soaking after a long day of touring....all at a really great in season rate of 120 Euros per night.</br></br></li>
<li>I booked directly with the hotel after checking with hotels.com, expedia and travel sites in Europe found that direct booking offered the best rate.</br></br></li>
<li>The location was prime for access to Plaza Mayor, all the museums, <span style="background-color:#e6194b">great</span> <span style="background-color:#e6194b">shopping</span> and restaurants.</br></br></li>
<li>And, only a five minute cab ride from the Atocha train station in Madrid.</br></br></li>
<li>Just a word of caution for those of you traveling from the airport -- the cost of a cab ride is approximately 15-20 Euro and we found more than one traveling couple that had been charged 40-50 Euro with cabbies that did not run their meters from the airport.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic! Booked a four day break for myself and my wife at the last minute and hit the bulls eye with the Senator Gran Via.What can I say...we requested a quiet high level room more in hope than expectation. When we checked in we found they had allocated us a room on the top floor at the rear of the hotel facing a quiet side road.... absolutely perfect.It got better. The room was lovely; clean and well decorated, views across the city, a private patio with table, chairs and loungers, complimentary mini bar, an electric bed (raising and lowering at the head end), functioning controllable air con, a silent paddle fan etc etc. the list went on. The hotel d茅cor was clean and stylish. Staff helpful and smiling all the time. The restaurant was fine for our needs with plenty of well prepared and presented food (breakfast and dinner).We chose to take the hotel groups shuttle bus back to the airport (8 Euro's each) as it was more convenient and half the price of the taxi. Another nice touch was that the hotel allowed us to check out a little later without charge, so we didn't have to mess around with our bags or waste time sitting around. Don't be put off by the reviews mentioning the local ladies working the adjoining street. It was in no way sordid and the girls kept their business discreet. In a funny way it added to the scene. Interestingly enough the local police station is only a couple of hundred metres down from the hotel on the same street!If you're looking for a great hotel in a central location then this is the place for you. Ten minutes from the shops and a good selection of restaurants just round the corner. We're already planning out next stay at the Senator.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very good hotel in convenient location The hotel has interesting architecture both inside and out. It is an older building that has been refurbished. The interior features an 8 floor atrium that allows light into the building interior. Rooms are not small by European standards but are not as large as American hotel rooms. One interesting feature of the beds is that sleepers have the ability to raise the heads electronically. Bathroms contain all necessary facilities (including bidet) and the usual supply of shampoo, etc. No wash cloths are provided.Breakfast was a superior buffet with a person to cook eggs, etc as requested. The bar served lunch and tapas and remained open until about 10 PM. The one lunch we had was of high quality and the service was very attentive. We did not eat in the restaurant.The staff were very helpful with suggestions about restaurants and in booking tables. People at the desk were (at least)bilingual Spanish-English.The hotel is centrally located with the Gran Via metro station outside the door. While the street is very busy, very little street noise penetrated the window. It might be a problem in summer if one opens the window rather than relying on the air conditioning. One problem for some potential guests is the presence of large numbers of street walkers on the street between the hotel and the Puerta del Sol, a major tourist attraction. They did not accost my wife and me (at any hour of the day) but they were rather aggressive with single men walking on the street. They were there from 9 AM to at least midnight, and I suspect a lot later than that.All in all we would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay there again when visiting Madrid.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Happy with Late choice I decided to move my booking to the Senator grand Via when my other choice for a better location, the Vincci Soho could not honour a twin room. Amazing in Spain because I have never even when I wanted it managed to get 1 big bed. Booked through Laterooms and had no problem at check in although initially told breakfast was not included. Sorted with no problem. The staff had great English, shame as I wanted to practice my Spanish! We had free Cava every night in reception, which we took up to our room. If the bottles not open just ask. Also free fruit to help yourself to which was a nice touch. In comparision to other capital cities in Europe this hotel is excellent for service and room amenities. The ladies of the night are there with the police in good numbers right outside the hotel but I was there with my mother and we had no problems. The room was amazingly quiet with good insulation although I know they are not of American size. Dont forget to ask for bathrobes, which are available with no problem. Brought within 5 mins on request. We did have a couple of problems, with the air conditioning and the toilet running all the time. Rang reception and a nice chap came to sort out very quickly. Couldnt understand how to get the hotel to pick us up on their transfer bus on arrival, found the stop but although I rang them they couldnt tell me what time it would pick up. The transfer back was great and did cost just 6e. Breakfast was great. Didnt mind the coffee, in fact my problem was finding someone to give me a top up. The omelette chef is good, I always like to see someone do this at hotels, and always think cold scrambled eggs in those bain maries are rubbish. She will also do eggs any way you want.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel on Gran Via Just returned from this hotel at the end of October 2007. The hotel is right beside the GranVia Metro Station (travelled from Airport via metro with two changes). Arrived at the hotel on a Sunday evening (11pm). Desk staff very friendly and efficient. First impressions of room were good.... a hall way containing double wardrobe with plenty storage space, iron, ironing board, press and electronic safe. Off the hall were the bathroom (shower and deep bath) and the bedroom. The room had laminate flooring, very bright, not overly large but didn't feel claustrophobic.... twin beds which had the ability to be raise head and back section. The room (703) looked over onto the Gran Via (a six lane main cross avenue lined with shops/ theatres and restaurants) although a vey noisy 24 hour street .... the double glazing and sound proofing was excellent and blocked out traffic noise and indeed I would say the room was very quiet. There was a small balcony looking onto the Gran Via.The breakfast serves until 10:30 probably some would say basic but nevertheless more than satisfactorily. The staff again were friendly. Selection of cold meats, cheese, cereals, juice and plenty of coffee/tea.The hotel is well appointed and although other reviews mention the ladies of the night I would say they were few and didn't pester (unlike in other European capitals) albeit I was there with my wife but no problem from them. The hotel is right in the middle of Madrid and easy to walk to the parks, museums, shops and galleries. Plenty of pubs and food places (we did not dine in the hotel although the menu looked fine). On the subject of drink... the free mini bar was a nice touch and sums up this welcoming hotel.... I would certainly recommend this!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Surprised that so many people praise it. I booked the hotel based on price (at precisionreservations.com), location and Trip Advisor reviews. I was quite disappointed. Great location 鈥?but there are so many other possibly nicer hotels just as centrally located for exploring Madrid.Reception is extremely unhelpful. There is no assigned place for a car to stop in order to leave the luggage (unless you want to block the whole traffic of the curve of the little street around the hotel 鈥?which is what the hotel considers to be its 鈥渄rop off鈥?place). Since my husband (who was driving) only stopped quickly to leave me (heavily pregnant) in order to get the car out of the way so he would not block the traffic, I was left alone as no doorman or bell boy showed up to help with luggage (not a lot to expect from a hotel that claims to be a four star).Parking is near the hotel, but difficult to get there, specially when we鈥檙e talking about traffic-jammed Gran Via. First we were given a tiny room with a king sized bed. The bed occupied more than half of the room and one could hardly move around. I asked to see another room. They only had rooms with 2 single beds available, so we were moved to one of those. The second room was nicer, larger and had better views.Breakfast had a very limited food selection. Bar, reception, lobby and restaurant d茅cor was a bit worn out and decadent.On the morning I was leaving, receptionist started calling my room at a quarter to noon to make sure I was leaving the room! Called again at 12 sharp to ask if I was already going downstairs (OK, maybe the hotel was full, still that's no excuse to be so inconvenient with a guest).In short, I would not stay there again. I would probably try the Hotel de Las Letras or the Tryp (both less than a block away on the Gran Via).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Madrid Hotel My husband and I and my 8 year old son stayed in the Senator Gran Via on the 4th of July for 5 nights. We could not have asked for a better room then the one we got. We had read previous trip advisor comments and knew to ask for a spacious room withbalcony and we got this and more. The room which I would clasify as a junior suite had 2 rooms one with bed and one with couch which was made up as a bed for my son. Clean lovely modern bathroom with all the little touch bits and bobs ie comb,disposable shaver with tiny tube of shaving cream, a shoe hornand all of the usual other extras such as soap, shampoo, bath gel,body lotion and sewing kit. We had a top floor room with large terrace which had great views over parts of Madrid. 2 sun loungers and a table and 2 chairs which we used in the late afternoons when we would have tea (supplied by the hotel in the room via their little kettle supplied with tea bags, coffee,sugar, milk etc). This was after having our glass of Cava in the receptionon our return of a hard days sight seeing. The soft drinks were free and restocked everyday. At night our beds were turned down and a little chocolate was placed near each pillow. Wardrobe had 2 soft toweling robes and slippers which was lovlely to put ones feet into on return. The staff at reception were very pleasant especially Olga for us. The breakfasts were tasty enough and there was plenty to chose from. The only complaint in regards to breakfast was for me the waiting staff who were quite grumpy every morning and were not in the business of smiling or greeting anybody. The tasty croissants and the smile by the cook who made my omelette every morning more then compensated for this. I cant give this Hotel enough credit as it was all the extra little touches they supplied in this Hotel that made it so memorable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">hotel hell-worst experience in a hotel ever!!! Worst hotel experience of my life. I have stayed in plenty of hotels around the world, and this one by far was the worst.The staff is either rude or sompletely disinterested in helping you. Most of the staff there do not speak English, which is fine if you are not in the tourist industry. Tiny, dirty horrible rooms that look nothing like the pictures. Nasty disgusting area with streetwalkers everywhere you look around the building and down the street. Worst area in Madrid. My husband and I kept asking ourselves where is the Spain we heard such lovely things about??If you decide to stay here instead of a one or two star hotel, which I can assure you would be a far better experience because it could not be worse, make sure you speak some Spansh or you won't be able to order so much as water, or coffee with cream. Dining staff only speaks Spainish, period! Still trying to figure out how this hotel achieved 4 star status!!!In short, I would have to say in all honestly, this was a very depressing hotel and we checked out early because we were so miserable. We found Hotel Quo Puerta del Sol, and it turned our experience around. Hotel was gorgeous, staff was professional, friendly, wonderful to us. Thanks Laura and Simon!!!Breakfast was fabulous, unlike the other place. And the location was a thousand times better. Not seedy at all and right near Puerta del sol.If I go to Madrid again,Quo Puerta Del Sol is probably the only hotel I would choose. You can't beat the location, price, rooms or service. We booked the suite and we could have just stayed there and enjoyed ourselves. It was spacious and wonderful! Oh and as far as the glass bathroom door people mentioned, it's totally frosted. You couldn't see anything on the other side even if you tried, so there's not a thing to worry about.Hope this helps you. Happy traveling!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Senator Gran Via gets our vote! We stayed at the Senator Gran Via for a week at the very end of September, 2005. We selected it after spending many hours online and in guidebooks, trying to find just the right place to stay for our first trip to Spain. The reviews posted here were a big factor, and they were right on target - thanks to all who posted. We really enjoyed our stay at the Senator Gran Via and our time in Madrid.Positives about the hotel: Easy online booking at their website, very quiet rooms despite being in a lively area; free minibar (water, beer, soda); friendly staff that spoke English; super clean rooms; large bathroom with good water pressure and plenty of hot water; and a great location close to Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor and right next to the super easy-to-use subway.Not quite as positive: The waitstaff at breakfast weren't overly friendly or helpful; the area around the hotel had a number of ladies of the evening (we counted 33 our last afternoon!) but they weren't really bothersome and that situation is out of the control of the hotel; and....nothing more than that.We paid the extra money for the breakfast and found it to be a nice option. Our Spanish is very limited and it was much easier to eat there than to try and find a cafe and order first thing in the morning. The breakfast included pastries, fruits, cheeses, sliced meats etc. Other things we enjoyed on our Spain trip include: day trips via bus to Toledo and Segovia (we like Segovia better, but both were neat), great sangria in a cave bar near the Botin restaurant, the Royal Palace guided tour; and the Madrid Vision bus tours. With our phrase book, we got along just fine even though we barely speak any Spanish. Overall, a great hotel in a great place to visit!! They even sent up a bottle of champagne and a basket of fruit when they found our we were there to celebrate our anniversary! We were impressed.</p></li>
