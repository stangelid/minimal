We stayed in France for 12 days on our honeymoon, with the majority of that time at HLP. Like others before me stated, they were absolutely helpful and treated us like family.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The best thing we liked were the Croissants for breakfast - among the best in Paris. It is a small hotel, clean and comfortable. The location may not be the most convenient as it is a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro station and you normally have to change once to reach most places. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They made arrangements to give us a full breakfast early in the morning as we had to catch a flight.</p></li>

Lovely rooms and public space, very nice small bar and breakfast buffet, great front desk staff, and very reasonable rates for a Paris hotel. I was there by myself for just 2 days but found it to be a great base for exploring Paris with the lovely and interesting park acrioss the street a wonderful place to relax. Highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 3 nights early September and can only reiterate what other have said. The location is wonderful with the park across the road, chic shopping nearby and generally a terrific area for a true Parisian experience. The front staff are very efficient,have excellent English and go out of their way to assist you at any time. Our room was spacious and attractive with a beautiful spotless bathroom. Would we stay again..yes in a heartbeat! ..and the barman is charmer!!</p></li>

Firstly, the hotel is in the most amazing area so closed to the Parc. Then we loved our bedroom, the service... This hotel is really cosy, elegant, typically "Parisien". We were really well welcomed. With a really nice staff, you just feel like "at home", especially with Fabienne who cared about us. She was able to help us, by giving us really good adresses (restaurants, shopping...). Our new adress in Paris!</p></li>

Have stayed before at The Crillion and Le Bristol whcih are great hotels at 3 times the price and was not dissapointed in this hotel but it obviousley cannot compare to those hotels.

Quiet at night and yet close enough to walk to most of the major sights (10 minute walk to Notre-Dame and Louvre). Very good restaurants and night life nearby. Great big park next door. Staff was great! Spoke English fluently which was good since our French was a bit rusty. They recommended dinner places and made reservations for us. Also recommended a very good place to listen to some live Jazz music after dinner. We'll definitely stay here next time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Luxembourg Parc. The staff were friendly and very helpful. The rooms are nice size and very clean. The nearby Luxembourg Gardens are absolutely gorgeous! A beautiful place to walk, picnic, or just sit and enjoy the view. There is a good deal of shopping and cafes nearby also. It may be a little further away from some of the big things you want to see in Paris, but the week before we stayed near the Champs Elysee and that was like being on Times Square in NYC. For us a quieter neighborhood was much preferred.</p></li>

We were offered a fan but in order to keep the room cool we needed to keep the windows open. It was very noisy at night and we had a difficult time sleeping. I would think that a 4 star property would get its air conditioning repaired earlier in the year. Too bad because the rooms are nice and the bathrooms excptional.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I took my daughter to Paris to celebrate her 21st birthday and selected Hotel Luxembourg Parc based on Trip Advisor reviews. While I have personally travelled to Paris on business, I wanted to stay away from the big, lavish hotels to experience more of a boutique-type hotel. I can't say enough about the elegant service we received, and the beautiful accomodations. The room was lovely, the library and sitting area relaxing, and the breakfast room inviting. We felt welcome from the moment we arrived, and it truly made our 5-day trip even more special!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lovely hotel in a great Paris location. Very easy access from Charles De Gaulle airport, the hotel really is only about a 5 minute walk from the Luxembourg station (saves a fortune on taxi fares). We booked a superior room overlooking the park - worth the extra for a lovely view. The only negative was that we had 2 singles pushed together rather than a double. At €15 each breakfast is well worth it if, like me you enjoy more than one coffee in the morning, a coffee & sandwich in a local cafe will cost €8 - €9. Highly recommend this hotel for a Paris break.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Saw the very good reviews. Well we spent our time there. Very good base to visit Paris (metro is pretty near). Paris is beautiful just a bit.. too cold. Luxembourg parc has a very helpful staff and the hotel itself is very nice. We were pretty lucky with our room. A couple we met there wasn't like that. We had those napoleon decors and that make it really special. Our time there was just great. Paris is really an amazing city. Need to speak some French. Fortunateòy we had some word. Anyway that is an extraordinary city. Much romance.. we'll surely be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have been going here for years. The people are wonderful, the location is great, and the rooms are very nice. Here is the caveat: so many Americans have been enamored by this hotel, that it has turned into a haven for Americans. I barely even heard another language spoken when I was here last. So, it that is okay with you, this is the place. If you want a bit more eclectic in a foreign county, but may want to consider somewhere else. I'll go back because I love it, but as a lot of Americans use and love Trip Advisor, it has caused a bit of an influx here...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved this boutique hotel for its location and finishing touches, but the staff is the real gem. Xavier, Laurant and Michel are great! They are attentive, offer assistance at every term and can give you local flavor to check out to really see Paris. As for the rooms the AC works totally fine, but the rooms are on the small side (but who cares, your in Paris, get out!). If you get the chance, request room #26. It has a private balcony which is great for breakfast, wine and cheese, etc. We plan to return to Paris and the Hotel Luxembourg Parc can count in us.</p></li>

The rooms are tastefull decorated and a good size by Paris standards. They are spotlessly clean and the bed was great. The staff are excellent and incredibly helpful. On our last full day, a waiter at a nearby cafe spilt a cup of coffee over my wife's clothes. On return to the hotel, the reception arranged for the clothes to be washed and dred in the hotel washing machine straight away, without charge. This attitude seemed prevalent.

We arrived in the hotel with a family of four. It is always difficult to ensure a nice welcome for children, ours are 3 and 1 years old, but the staff exceeded any expectations. We were so well looked after and my daughter wanted to stay in her "home in Paris". The hotel is in arguably the best location in Paris, the decor is very nice in an understated way, but the best of all is the warmth and friendliness of the staff! On our next visit to Pars, our daughter will not stay anywhere else, and the rest of us agree! Bravo!</p></li>

The room we were given was spacious and beautifully furnished with excellent facilities (two televisions, stereo, ample space for clothing, marble bathroom with large corner bath, double sinks and enormous shower). The location of the hotel was convenient for the Louvre and close to the Tour Eiffel (5 minute taxi ride costing 10 euro). Staff were helpful, booking us taxis and providing assistance with directions, recommending restaurants. We will definitely stay there again. Only negative point was the hairdrier which wasn't great quality.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from our first time trip to Paris. Used Tripadvisor which time and time again has been a great resource. Lux Parc is a gem on the left bank. It is a small, well situated hotel directly across from the Luxembourg garden. A lovely hotel in a very lovely area. Walking distance to great cafes, bakeries (how happy was I to stumble onto Gerard Mulot patisserie just a few blocks away!) and boutiques. Friendly staff. Our room was clean, warm and cozy, the marble bathroom was beautiful. The bed was very comfortable. Our room was on Rue de Vaurigard, which is a fairly busy road, but did not hear road noise at all. A great stay, we will return someday!</p></li>

We really appreciated it. Some nights when we came in from the cold they offered to light a fire. They were excellent with directions and making reservations. Very attentive staff. Can not beat the area, close to everything. We stayed at their other hotel. Hotel La Perle two years ago and that was fine also. We were there for our anniversary and everyone made us feel special.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved our stay at the Hotel Luxembourg Parc this July. My teens were skeptical at first after leaving London however quickly warmed up to the hotel and particularly the staff with a special merci to Xavier . The hotel is across from the Luxembourg Gardens and near St. Suplice. It is not too touristy and yet not too far from the Musee D'Orsay (wonderful) and the Louvre (overwhelming). Our room was lovely and the kid's room was smaller yet more than adequate. The hotel had wireless which we didn't have in London. Everyone was friendly, helpful and gave us wonderful advice and support. I also loved being in St. Germain des Pres - less hectic than other districts in Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed in the hotel for nearly a week around Christmas. It was a pleasure – thanks to the helpful good willing personnel, and most of all – Christian. Yet, we could advise the hotel: 1) to improve breakfast (at present it doesn't justify its cost). 2) To improve the acoustics in the breakfast room (we kept hearing loud conversation of the hotel staff in the back room). 3) To turn on the light of the lovely sculpture in the cour – in the evenings. 4) To leave the guests a small Christmas gift / card / flowers / chocolate / wine on Christmas eve – to give the feeling of home away from home. 5) To update the weather forecast in the elevator once a day and not once a week…</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in the Junior Suite at this hotel, as a birthday treat for my wife. We had considered one of the big posh places, but chose the Luxembourg Parc for its apparent charm and location. It lived up to our hopes in every way! The location is ideal; feels a bit like Chelsea in London. Our room was also very nice, with a great bathroom and comfortable sitting area. The hotel booked us a table at the nearby Petit Cour, which is a lovely, romantic place where you can sit outside and eat great food and wine. I recommend that you ask for a booking as it gets very busy. The staff are very friendly and helpful - pretty much a perfect place to stay for a cosy weekend in this great city.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The previous reviews of this hotel were spot-on. The staff was great - all English speaking and helpful. The rooms were spacious for a Paris hotel, and the beds WERE EXTREMELY comfortable! We slept as well as at home. Every aspect of this hotel could not be improved upon. The location was near many good cafes, restaurants and shopping. The ONLY down side was that we could have really used a closer Metro stop. After all the walking and sight-seeing, the extra walk to a Metro stop was tiring. None were what I would consider conveniently close - walkable but not convenient. That being said, I would not consider it to be a "show-stopper". Everything else was simply wonderful and I highly recommend this hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose this hotel after extensive research on Trip Advisor. Although it was more expensive than I had planned, this was due to the weak Sterling against the Euro and not the fault of the hotel. I came here for my wife's 40th birthday and the hotel provided a bouquet of flowers in the room as requested on our arrival. The room was comfortable and clean with a good sized bathroom. Since we were on a short break, we had only brought hand luggage and therefore were very limited in what toiletries we could bring. Fortunately the hotel provided shampoo, shower gel, body lotion, razor, shaving foam. The breakfast was delicious with fresh bread & pastries from a local boulangerie. The staff were very friendly and helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We are repeat guests at this terrific hotel. We have stayed here several time throughout the years and have just returned from yet another terrific stay. One of my most important considerations is safety. It is important for me to feel safe when staying at any hotel. Certainly being a clean room is extremely important but safety is also a high priority. I have always felt safe at the Luxembourg Parc and I have never had any issues with the rooms provided and being clean. The hotel is in an excellent location across the street from the incredibly beautiful Luxembourg Parc. The location is near enough that it make it possible to walk to most of the "Paris must see" destinations. It is only a short walk to Notre Dame and the Seine.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I spent 3 nights at the hotel Luxembourg Parc. Everything was perfect from the moment we arrived and were greeted by Xavier. The hotel is on the edge of the Luxembourg Parc in the St Germain district of Paris which is very quaint and away form the main hussle and bussle of Paris. However, it is only about a 10-15 minute walk to Notre-Dame. There are loads of wonderful restaurants nearby, try Maison du Jardin (only a 2 minute walk from the hotel). The Hotel is very clean and the rooms are very comfortable. The best bit were the staff, they were all very helpful and friendly. Xavier could not do enough for us, he recommeneded places to visit and restaurants to eat at (all were brilliant). We will definately stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were looking for a special hotel to spend our first night of our honeymoon and I'm glad to say this hotel was perfect! A small but perfectly formed hotel, really friendly staff and beautiful rooms. This is a small luxury hotel, so it doesn't offer as much in the way of services as say the Ritz or the Vendome, but it has everything you really need for a comfortable stay. We booked an executive room, which was quite spacious in Paris terms and beautifully presented. The area surrounding the hotel is wonderful in Spring/Summer - lots of cafes for people watching and plenty of boutiques to window shop. A short walk takes you into the heart of Paris. The RER stops very near the hotel on a direct line from the airport, perfect if you want to save a few €!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel - almost everything is covered thoroughly by other reviews. The staff is quite friendly and all speak English well. They are helpful with any questions or concerns, including our need to borrow an electrical outlet converter. The room itself is small, but that was no surprise. The decor is classically French - luxurious and classy, yet unpretentious. There is high speed internet access (a single computer) in the library. The library itself was also very beautiful as well. The best part, in my opinion, it is just around the corner from Pierre Herme for macarons - they're absolutely incredible! And of course the Luxembourg gardens are beautiful and a great place to take a leisurely walk or jog. We would most definitely consider staying here again!</p></li>

The staff are extremely friendly and were especially sweet to my daughter. The hotel itself is lovely--very tastefully decorated, but not stuffy. Our rooms were not large, but the beds were the most comfortable we have found anywhere and the extra deep tubs were much appreciated after a day of walking around Paris! The hotel is across the street from Luxembourg Gardens--a terrific place for a jog or just some down time. We loved that the neighborhood itself is quiet, but very close to cafes, bistros and within a 10 minute walk to the Seine. If we are lucky enough to return to Paris, we will definitely stay her again!</p></li>

This place really is a little gem, with warm and friendly staff, good size rooms and a more than adequate breakfast. The Library is cosy to return to after a day out and about, to sit back relax and enjoy a coffee or something stronger ! Fab location and the staff will point you in the direction of a great choice of restaurants nearby. You must go to the Pantheon nearby to see the pendulum and for Da Vinci code lovers, the St Sulpice church down the road.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Luxembourg Parc for a family reunion in early July. I was impressed by how well the hotel "worked" for all of us, from my 7 yr old nephew to my 70+ yr old parents. Part of the credit goes to the staff who were gracious, friendly and wonderful with the variety of requests we asked of them. The rooms were lovely (well decorated with nice details and for a European hotel room - spacious ). I found the rooms to be very quiet. The library downstairs was inviting. Numerous guests (including ourselves) used the library to gather at the beginning or end of the day. As many have commented, the location is top notch - right across from the Luxembourg Gardens and within walking distance of many of the top attractions of Paris. We will definitely stay here during future trips to Paris!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We preferred this hotel for our anniversary trip to Paris based on high ratings given on trip advisor. Surely, rooms were clean, delicately designed and cosy for Paris standards. We stayed in a superior room looking at Lux. gardens at the first floor where there was a continuous noise of -I believe- old-fashioned air conditioner. Also, hotel personnel at reception were not so much friendly as noted in trip advisor feedbacks. They were excessively formal and not smiling-face on the contrary to my expectations after reading the feedbacks. However, the hotel is at a good location, delicately designed, offering a cosy athmosphere and the road in front of the hotel is not noisy (if you are used to almost frequent hooter noise of official vehicles!) Good value for your money but not deserves five stars.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Luxembourg Parc was a tremendous place for my wife and I to stay for ten days over New Year's on our honeymoon. Anything that we needed, the incredibly sweet and attentive staff took care of it instantly - whether it was making reservations for us at local restaurants, booking us a New Year's Eve dinner, or offering suggestions about places to visit. Each morning, we were greeted with complimentary breakfast in bed, and each night, we relished the opportunity to have a nightcap at the hotel bar and lounge, discussing our trip and French culture with our gracious and passionate hosts. The room size was perfectly fine for us - very roomy and on a high floor overlooking the Luxembourg Gardens - and the marble bathroom was spectacular. We will never forget how comfortable the staff made us feel, and we look forward to a return to Paris.</p></li>

Yes the rooms are small - but this is Paris and our room was stunning, immaculately clean and tastefully decorated. The reception staff were polite, welcoming and accommodating. Lounge/ bar area is small but intimate and tis extends into the library area where we had a night cap after our night out. Our room overlooked the side road and was quite. My husband had rung ahead and as a surprise had arranged with the hotel a car from the station, a bottle of champagne and the largest bunch of roses I have ever seen. The hotel had recommended and booked a restaurant for us and were on had to make suggestions of an itinerary for our short stay. We stayed for two nights over a weekend in the middle of October and were fortunate enough to have glorious weather.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 3 nights on a 2nd visit to Paris, in early October. Relatively convenient location with good access to nearby metro stop. RER B (Luxembourg) is also easy walking distance). Small, boutique hotel with elegantly furnished rooms. The "however" is that unless you can secure a park-view room in the front of the hotel (and I believe there are only 6 such rooms), it is relatively expensive for what you get and there might be better options in Paris. We ended up with a superior room, but on the side, looking out across a small alley to another apartment building next door. Of course, this is Paris, but for the price, you might find rooms with nicer views, if that is important to you. Good breakfast and excellent service by front desk and other hotel staff, but one would expect that in a 4-star hotel. Spacious library and small bar on the ground floor.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent five nights in this delightful small hotel. It is within walking distance of numerous good restaurants, museums, galleries, shopping, parks etc. The staff are English speaking, and instantly make one feel totally at home. They were really charming and most helpful in arranging dinner reservations etc. The rooms are delightfully furnished and have really nice modern bathrooms. However breakfast was not too great.. I think that they must have been short staffed the one day we had breakfast there, as what staff there were were really harried and it took for ever to even get their attention.... not very good at all, with, for example, an almost empty fruit salad bowl sitting there without so much as a glance from the staff. After that we always had our breakfast at a nearby cafe instead. However do not let this put you off staying at the hotel. It is truly lovely with excellent desk staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and myself stayed at this charming boutique hotel in April 2010. From the moment we walked into the entrance we were impressed by the standard of service and hospitality of the hotel and staff. Nothing was too much trouble and the advice and requests were dealt with efficiently and quickly. The hotel is a lovely size, compact and professional in every way. There is a lovely bar and library for a quiet drink in the evening before dinner. The room was well equipped and of a good size with a lovely marble bathroom and excellent shower. All you would need in Paris as you spend so little time in the room! The area of the hotel is perfect right by the gardens and central to all the main sights. There are some good restaurants nearby especially La Marlotte approximately 10 minutes away. We are very pleased we followed the advice on tripadvisor and will hope to stay again whenever we are in Paris. Thank you.</p></li>

The common areas are small, but extremely comfortable and useable. There is little in the way of view from any window, but that little view is pleasant. The hotel is out of the way enough to be quiet, yet within walking distance of the river. We walked happily to the Bastile and the Musee D'Orsay. The park opposite should not be missed. We took two rooms lately, and have stayed in three of their rooms over the past year, all were delightful, although one of the bathrooms could do with some additional maintainance. Breakfast is basic, but good, with the best orange juice. This hotel is unlikely to appeal to those who like Hiltons, room service (which they do not do) or uniformity. I'll be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Proximity to the St. Germain/Latin Quarter makes visiting Paris a breeze. Depending on traffic, taxis to the Marais are only 10-12 euros. We got a superior double room, which was definitely enough space with its high ceilings, ample closet space and surprisingly large bathroom. The bathrooms, by the way, are quite luxurious with marble all around, big sink and counter space, huge mirrors and comfortably-sized tub. Big windows opened up to a quiet, cobblestone side-street as opposed to the grand Luxembourg Park across the street, but that wasn't a big deal. The concierge/staff is incredibly accommodating--made reservations as asked, gave suggestions as needed and made as feel as comfortable as we could. We didn't spend much time here as we were being American tourists in Paris over a weekend, of course, but were happy to return to it each night, bellies full of amazing food and minds hazy with even more amazing wine.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My adult daughter and I stayed 2 nights at this elegant hotel and wished we could have stayed longer. While the room wasn't large, it was beautifully appointed, comfortable, and gave us a corner view from 2 windows. As I was recovering from a cold and the usual fatigue of travel, it was great to pull the blinds, keep the day out, sleep in, and catch up on my rest. We ate a lovely breakfast (late of course) in a room that let us look out on the street scene near the Luxembourg Gardens. The common rooms are beautiful, and the hotel is set on the typically ancient curving streets of the Left Bank. Set one foot out and you're in nowhere but Paris! Shops, dining, and sights are all easily accessible. Our hosts made great dinner recommendations (La Maison du Jardin for dinner--terrific, twice), offered advice for patisseries, pharmacies, sights, and were enormously helpful and kind. I'd stay at this hotel again in a minute. Wish I was still there!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for three nights in Room 11, an "Executive" class room. The room looked just like the photos on the website. It was in the back of the hotel overlooking the center inner courtyard and was nice and quiet - there was no noise from the street in front of the hotel. The room was clean and had a large armoire for storage of suitcases and clothing, so the small size (clarification, big for Paris, small for America) wasn't a problem. We visited the breakfast buffet one morning and it was decent, but was not replenished when food ran out, so make sure you go early to get the best selection. The staff were quite friendly and all spoke English well. They were able to give good dinner recommendations for the area. The neighborhood around the hotel is full of boutique shops that were fun to walk by on our way to the Metro each day. The Jardin du Luxembourg was also fun to explore. All in all, this was a nice hotel to stay at in a great location for our visit in Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from our honeymoon at the Hotel Luxembourg Parc and we have to say it was a gem. The room was deluxe and spotless, breakfast although simple and a little pricey was fresh and tasty. The staff were freindly and helpful. We booked a deluxue room which was superb, I think maybe the cheaper rooms are smaller but equally as sumptuous. There is an endless supply of fresh towels etc. It is very central and we walked all over paris from here, I would book a room over the courtyard as they are very quiet and I am not sure how busy the road is at night. All rooms have air con and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone who wanted a nice Paris break. Do check the price of drinks at the bar before ordering though as they have some very expensive cognacs wich we ordered and consumed before we were told the price! They were however very good so that is merely an advisory note for those on a budget! It is not a cheap hotel but it is very very nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The difference between a good vacation and a great vacation in Paris is not the weather, or the sights, or the food, or the hotel location - those you have a pretty good idea of what to expect prior to your trip. You will plan to see the Eiffel Tower, Versailles, the Louvre or other museums, Notre Dame, Sacre Coeur or any of the other wonderful attractions that Paris has to offer. You can see them by bus, by train, by boat or by foot. Depending on your budget and your taste buds - you will find something that fits. But the unknown is the hotel, and while sites like this one are helpful - it is still the unknown. Everything about this hotel exceeded our expections thanks to the wonderful staff. Everyone we dealt with: Sara, Andreas, Jacques and especially Xavier seemed to adopt our party of fourteen as if we were family. It was the best hotel experience we have ever had and we have travelled extensively. Thanks to everyone for making our family vacation unforgettable. The Collisons.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I, borth frequent travellers, just returned from a two night stay and have nothing but positive feedback to share. Even compared to New York City, Paris can be a noisy, busy, crowded place, but a mere few blocks from the bustle and traffic is this charming, welcoming hotel. Having ready access to the Luxembourg Gardens, the RER (a really economical and convenient way to get from Charles De Gaulle-the Luxembourg stop will put you just across the park and an easy walk to the hotel), and quaint neighborhood restaurants. Blanking on the name of the lovely neighborhood place we ate one evening on Rue de Sevaradoni, but it is mid-block, delicious and fun. Enjoyed a night cap with the delightful company of Jacques, bartender/night front desk person. It's these moments of conversing with locals that really make a trip special. If you are looking for an elegant room, quiet and convenient neighborhood, and to relax and acclimate to a new time zone and City, this is your place.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently returned from a long weekend at the Luxembourg Parc which we booked on the recommendation of previous Tripadvisor reviewers. We were not disappointed - the location of the hotel is very convenient and within walking distance of many of the main attractions. Our Executive room was very comfortable and well appointed although no tea or coffee making facilities were provided (but maybe that is just me being English!). All staff were very professional and friendly. The nearest Metro station to the hotel is Saint Sulpice which is closed for refurbishment until sometime in May 2010 so bear this in mind when travelling to the hotel, especially with lots of luggage, as currently the nearest Metro station is Saint Germain du Pres which is a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. We had breakfast in the hotel which was just adequate for 15 Euros. You would probably find better value in a nearby cafe. Overall we liked the hotel very much and look forward to returning again in the near future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived here in the middle of January during a freezing cold snap (-6 degrees Celsius) and heavy snow. The hotel is perhaps a 5-10 minute walk from the nearest metro/RER station, and is opposite the Luxembourg palace and gardens. St Germain is easy walking distance, with the Musee d'Orsay and Notre-Dame perhaps 20 moinutes walking. We were warmly welcomed and check-in was efficient. The room, although quite small (normal by Parisian standards), was beautifully furnished and spotlessly clean. The breakfast was good, with a range of cereals, ham cheese, and cereals on a buffet. Cooked breakfast was available from a menu, and cooked to order. The library had a fireplace, which wasn't lit on our first night, but was on the second - great, considering the cold outside. There is a computer with free internet access in the library. Bar service was efficient. There is no restaurant, but being Paris, plenty of options nearby. All in all, a very pleasant stay, and would definitely return in a potential future trip to Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 3 nights at the beginning of Aug. and were thoroughly pleased with our choice of hotel based on the Trip Advisor reviews we read. We had a superior room - which wasn't very big, but was very nice. The washroom had a great shower with good pressure. The balcony was huge (bigger than the room). It was nice to sit out after a long day of sightseeing and relax before going out for dinner or to have a glass of wine before going to bed.. The hotel is right across from the Luxxembourg Park and we only went into on our last day in Paris - it is huge and beautiful - full of people doing all sorts of activities. Set aside some time to enjoy it. The hotel is in a fairly quiet area - you can never escape the whining of the scooters - but is pretty close to all sorts of restaurants and cafes. We also found the front desk staff more than helpful in answering all of our questions and Xavier was very patient in helping me sort out my WiFi problems. All in all it definitely deserved the high ranking that Trip Advisor assigned it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose this hotel because I asked my Parisian friend if she could live anywhere in Paris, where would it be- she replied near the luxembourg gardens & this hotel had amazing reviews. I stayed here with my sister for 3 nights to visit friends and we each had our own room. The rooms are charming and roomy enough; we had plenty of space for our luggage & closet space (it might be cramped with 2 people to a room). We found everyone at the front desk kind and helpful. The best part of this hotel is the location- right across from the Senat and the Luxembourg gardens. So we always felt very safe- even walking around late at night (there are always police around the Senat building). We loved the neighborhood- restaurants, bars, cafes, marches, shopping- everything you need! (At the end of our trip we stayed at the George V and really missed this neighborhood & the atmosphere). We walked to all the tourist sites very easily. At night it was easy to meet up with my Parisian friend and everywhere she wanted to take us was close by. Loved it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband said it took me longer to chose a hotel in Paris from various websites and guidebooks than it did to buy our condo in Boston! But my 'shopping' paid off - the Hotel Luxembourg Parc was wonderful. From everything I'd read about Parisienne hotels rooms are small - ours was not - it was charming. The bathroom was very clean and lovely in white marble with a fabulous deep tub and large overhead hot-hot shower, big white towels; the combination of the building's original heavy overhead beams made it architecturally dramatic. The front desk personnel were helpful and all spoke English. On a rainy Sunday afternoon after spending the morning at the Louvre and walking Paris all day we ate a romantic late lunch of lapsong suchong tea and crepes on Ile Ste Louis, we bought a bottle of wine and cheese on our way back to the hotel - the front desk made a blazing fire in the fireplace in the library, brought us some crusty rolls from the kitchen and we enjoyed a momentary fantasy of living in Paris - it was the perfect day - the perfect hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My two-night, three-day trip to Paris was loaded with expectations: being 6.5 months pregnant and leaving my toddler at home for the first time, this was to be the last time I could really relax, sleep well, treat myself and be on my own. I was keen to stay in a hotel (and an area) that was quiet and charismatic. And I was in the mood for a bit of luxury too. HLP has all this and more. The staff here are extraordinarly impressive, and strike the difficult balance of warmth and readiness to help with a respect for privacy. The hotel is just lovely - exactly as it looks on the website, clean, cosy and stylish. The charming rooms are spacious enough with very comfortable beds, and have fantastic marble bathrooms. I didn't try the breakfast as I thought it was more fun to wander up to Cafe Flore for coffee and a croissant. I will definitely stay here again, and I'm completely in love with 6th. By far my favourite part of Paris now. One tip - avoid staying in a room opposite the lift. I found it a bit noisy. Needless to say I was moved instantly, and with no fuss.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the moment we walked into the bright clean lobby and met the manager, we knew this hotel was going to be a great home away from home for 8 nights in Paris. We had a classic room (22) that faced rue Servandoni - very nice - plenty of room, great bed and beautiful, spacious marble bathroom. I lost my sunglasses the first day and mentioned it to the clerk the next morning, and he gave me a pair of his sunglasses that he was not using to wear! Great little bar - enjoyed drinks in the charming, book-filled library and in the really pleasant interior courtyard. They provide a computer in the library as well as free wi-fi. They provided helpful information, maps and local knowledge, helped with reservations and just made our stay a joy. Fabulous location on rue de Vaugirard - close to metros (ride the RER B to Luxembourg station only a few blocks from hotel - easy walk - Saint Sulpice, the Park, great dining and bars a few blocks away. This truly is a Four Star hotel - very well deserved. We hope to get back to Paris and will certainly choose the Lux Parc again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a nice hotel. We stayed here for two days in January and felt very comfortable. Probably the best thing about it is the location. Next to the fabulous Luxembourg Park, on the south side of the river. On the luxembourg side is a nice quiet district dominated by the Park ; other the other side of the hotel towards the river is my favourite part of Paris - full of narrow bustling streets, restaurants and high-end shops. The hotel is comfortable. Beds were very comfortable. Decor is ok - slightly grannified but nice. Don't expect original PArisian furntiture but it looked pretty good. Rooms are average size. We booked an Exec room which is the highest price room and it was "nice" but not outstanding. It grew on me. The service is excellent from everyone. Nice people, very helpful. Breakkfast again is nice but not brilliant. Be nice if they cooked omelettes or something similar like other hotels in Paris not to add a little something. Its help youself buffet. The tv is our room was on the blink but being very picky here. This is a nice little hotel run by nice people.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in the suite with the balcony. The balcony might have been bigger than the room. It was nice to be able to sit outside, problem is, there is no view. They have lattice work and tall plants blocking any tye of view, you can't even look out onto the street. So, I would advise against paying for the balcony room, after all, you are just across the street from the Luxembourg Gardens, so having outdoor space sn't that necessary (and it is Paris, you won't be in your room often anyway). I chose this hotel because it had a workout room, but upon arrival, I was told it was closed, despite my specifically calling them when I booked to verify they had a workout room. We requested twin beds, they had a full size bed. I asked for someone to change this, and it took all day. In the grand scheme of things, the room was clean, it is located just far enough away from the noise, but a nice short walk to the fun, and the breakfast was really good, despite the fruit that was rotting. Believe it or not, I would stay there again, now that my expectations are set...It is Paris after all.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent a week at Hotel Luxembourg Parc in February and thoroughly enjoyed our stay! I would describe the hotel as charming, clean, convenient and comfortable. It was my first trip to Paris, and the location of the hotel made it extremely convenient to walk to several of the must-see sites. It's located on a quiet street, and there is a nearby metro station. The staff was so polite and helpful. My husband had a bad cold, and they recommended the type of medicine to get and showed us to a nearby pharmacy. Cecilia even made him a special tea when we'd come back from sightseeing. We ate breakfast there almost every day because it was convenient with plenty of good offerings from yogurt, cereal, fruit and delicious pastries from Gérard Mulot, Patisserie to yummy fromage omelets! The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was beautiful and clean with marble and updated fixtures. We spent more time in the room than we normally would have due to my husband being under the weather, and it wasn’t much of a sacrifice due to the lovely accommodations. We would highly recommend this hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My trip ended yesterday, but a friend joined me for a week at the awesome HLP. From beginning to end, the staff responded with immediate and no request was too much and I asked a lot. My friend enjoyed early morning walks and said there were many places nearby for eating, shopping, etc. When I asked if I could mail back most of my belongings, and I had a box, within one hour it was out the door and arrived the day I got back! The hotel is so charming and the rooms are sweet and comfortable beds!! I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. I have been to Paris several times before and if you are looking for an oasis in the middle of the bustling city, this is your place. My room was #35, which faced the gardens and even with the street noise, it was quiet and roomy enough for two, altho I chose to stay in it alone. What a lovely view to sit and work at my laptop or step out of the immaculate shower that had a window in the bathroom to see the turning leaves. Special mention to the unbelievably hard-working and dedicated Fabienne, Xavier, and Royce. And the fabulous housing staff. If I have forgotten anyone, I send many apologies.</p></li>

The hotel is situated in the 6th arrondisement, right across from the Luxembourg Gardens, where the streets are quiet, clean, and lined with shops. The hotel staff went out of their way to accommodate us, including: finding us an unoccupied room so we could check in prior to the 3:00pm check-in time; calling restaurants to make us reservations; giving us directions to local attractions. Our room was small (typical for Paris) but well-appointed and lovely. The bathroom shower was small but elegant and the shower had great water pressure. I forgot to pack my toothbrush and was elated to see that one was provided in the room. We would definitely stay here again. This hotel is great for younger to mid-aged couples who are looking for a classy hotel with charm and friendly hoteliers. If you are looking for a large, bustling "Leading Hotels of the World"-type of hotel with valet service and a snooty lobby scene, however, this may not be the hotel for you. One last note: Be sure to have an after-dinner drink in the library, which is wood-panneled and has a beautiful fireplace.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ah Hotel Luxembourg Parc... This was the beginning of a two week trip to Paris, Provence and Lago Maggiore in Switzerland. Eight years in the planning. Hotel Luxembourg Parc did not fail to live up to it's expectations. Divine. Location perfect. Close enough to everything you want to see but far enough away from the tourist traps. And there are a fair few of those... Fabienne on Reception was a joy to interact with each day. When we first arrived she gave us the choice of two rooms. We went for the bigger one on the top floor and it was wonderful. Sunlight and fresh air from windows on both sides of the bed. We absolutely loved Jardin du Luxembourg. Not normally much of a garden lover it came by surprise. The garden is a wonderful oasis in a city full of concrete and it was such fun exploring it at different times of the day. Especially Friday evening around 6pm. Paris is a lovely city and we spent the perfect amount of time there. The only reason however that i would return to Paris in the future would be to revist Jardin du Luxembourg and Hotel Luxembourg Parc. It was the perfect start to a perfect trip. Thank you Hotel Luxembourg Parc!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found this hotel thanks to TripAdvisor - the reviews were so favourable that we could not resist booking here. We got an excellent rate by booking early through the hotel's website and treated ourselves to an executive room. This was beautifully furnished and overlooked the inner courtyard so was very quiet at night, although our friends, in the standard room opposite, overlooking the side street, also found their room very quiet and although it was smaller than ours, it was equally well-appointed. Service was fantastic throughout our stay, and one evening, when we came back with friends to have tea in the library, the staff rushed to light the fire for us which made it even more inviting. Our room rate included breakfast which set us up nicely for the day's sightseeing. Only the weather disappointed us, as it rained most of the time - the hotel thoughtfully provided umbrellas which could be taken from the lobby as needed. The evening turn-down service was a nice touch - no chocolates on the pillow but towels and toiletries were replaced and replenished, and the bedside lights were left on to welcome us on our return. Definitely one to revisit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Trip Advisor was right on target with the high ranking given to the Hotel Luxenbourg Parc. The location is the best...quiet, lovely and very close to major tourists attractions. My husband and I loved to walk in the gardens across the street in the morning before we started our busy day of sightseeing. We would sit in the sunshine on the green chairs and just enjoyed people watching. The recepton staff is very in tune with the patrons and were always happy to suggest a wonderful nearby restaurant or call for a taxi.. The rooms are beautifully appointed and the white marble bathhrooms are amazing. The housekeeping staff were meticulous and the rooms were very clean with plenty of fresh towels and gigantic showers with plenty of hot water. The breakfast was very delicious and a great way to start the day. We spent seven nights here with a party of eight. Each couple loved the hotel and were happy we had made this our home while in Paris. I highly recommend the hotel and please do not hesitate and take the advise of the concierge when asking for a restaurant recommendation. They know the best neighborhood restaurants in the area! This hotel is a gem!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 5 nights in this beautiful boutique hotel in May and it exceeded all our expectations. This is a lovely, small hotel with big hotel services and staff that could not have been more friendly and eager to please. We had a large room ( #34), by Paris standards, with separate sitting area, wardrobe/dressing area and beautiful marble mathroom with all the amenities. The bed was very comfortable with beautiful linens and the room decor was elegant. The reception area and small bar provided nightly libations before and after dinner, and great conversation with the very charming bartender, Laurent. He and the desk staff, Xavier, Fabienne & Lydia, provided excellent restaurant recommendations each evening and we weren't disappointed anywhere we went. The hotel is located in the heart of St. Germain des Pres, directly across the street from the Luxembourg Gardens, the Senate and just blocks from the Pantheon. It has a comfortable neighborhood vibe and we felt right at home from the first day. We have travelled to Paris many times over the years and this is, by far, the best hotel we have found. We can't say enough good things about it and hope to return again soon.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just spent 4 wonderful honeymoon nights in Paris at this lovely hotel. The employees at the front desk were very nice and super helpful with all of our needs. Our room was small but very clean, and this hotel is in a great location. Grab a coffee and take a walk through the park across the street. PLEASE visit Laurent, he tends bar and is only more than happy to suggest a great cafe, restaurant or jazz club. He was such a great man to talk to. We thoroughly enjoyed his company over a glass of wine each evening and I hope you will too! The breakfast was included in our rate but if we had been paying for it, I would have opted to go elsewhere. It's fine, just very simple for the money. Side note: We were offered help in securing a private car and tour to Versailles at 85 euros per person for 4 hours....Do yourself a favor, take the train (it's really easy and costs about $6), takes about 50 minutes to get there, then is a 5 minute walk from the station to Versailles. Spend the day, walk through the museum, and enjoy the grounds, they are spectacular. Wear comfortable shoes, there is a lot of walking and a lot of great photo opportunities...you can even have lunch and a bottle of wine on the premises. Enjoy!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Luxembourg Parc hovers around the top of Trip Advisor's list of Paris hotels, dancing with the number one spot off and on. That's not easy given the size of Paris and that there currently 1841 hotels reviewed here. This placement is well earned. The hotel is lovely, very clean, nicely decorated with lush interiors and a warm feel. We stayed in an Executive Room and the added space that gave us was welcome given we were in Paris for 7 nights. Our room's windows opened out to the courtyard and thus was very quite. The room had a nice tv, desk, mini-bar fridge, and was air conditioned. I wouldn't say the AC was icy cold but it certainly helped with the temperatures being into the 30C's almost every day we were there. The hotel is perfectly located, next to one of my favourite parks in the world Jardin Luxembourg, and only a few minutes walk from places you want to be, like Saint-Germaine, the RER, great shopping, restaurants and clubs. My only slight criticism would be the optional breakfast. If i recall it's about 15 Euro per person, the selection of items available is small and frankly you're much better off just walking to a near by cafe or brasserie and having an omelette or pastry and cafe cream for about half the price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiancée has been to Paris many times, and on this 30th birthday weekend trip, she said it was the best she has been to in Paris. By all accounts, the size of the rooms is biggest difference. We were in a superior double, overlooking the cobbled side street. Great location by the park. Close to St Germain de pres and metro stations. Mabillon is 7 minutes walking distance. Probably about the same for St Sulspice. Not sure what the 'garden/park view' rooms would be like, but I imagine you might only see the trees in the way, and the main road in between maybe a bit noisy. Although, the windows seemed to be well sound proofed. The staff were always friendly, efficient and helpful. The little bar and library are nice, as is the little courtyard area. The room was delightful. Clean, pretty and comfortable. Lots of lighting and storage options. Decent sized TV. Massive marble bathroom with great shower. Plenty of artwork adorned the walls, some with their own lighting! Had a perfectly nice continental breakfast at the hotel once. Reasonably priced, I think. Had 2 coffees and 2 croissants at a cafe near St Sulpice which cost 10 euro. So 15 euro each at the hotel for the usual pastries and meats and hot food on request seems OK. For a special occasion treat, it was perfect!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here for seven days in October 2006. Altogether it was a great trip and we will likely stay at the Luxembourg-Parc again in the future. Many positives for this hotel. Firstly, the location is great, right across from the Jardins Luxembourg and within easy walking distance of three metro lines and at least one RER station.(which goes directly to the Charles de Gaulle airport). Many of the sites on the left bank are within a 5-10 minute walk including Rue St-Michel, and even Notre-Dame. The hotel is also quite attractive. Our room, which I believe was an upgrade on the basic room, was not huge, but was very attractive and comformtable. The bathroom was very nice and roomy by European standards. The one slight downside was the service. When booking, we had asked for, and been told we would get, a room not facing rue Vaugirard (which is quite busy/noisy). We ended up getting a room right on that street and were told that we could not switch rooms due to the hotel being fully booked. Apart from that, the front desk service was just OK, with some of the attendants very helpul and others a little less so (for issues such as restaurant recommendations and taxis). Altogether, this hotel is to be recommended, especially for pleasure travellers wanting to explore the left bank.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Hotel Luxembourg Parc - tops for the Paris experience”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Luxembourg Parc is a great place to stay if you want to feel like you are truly staying in Paris. Its rooms are decorated in traditional French design and not like a cookie cutter hotel room you would find in a hotel chain room. Because of this, you’re going to pay a little more than you would for other hotels in Paris. If you are just looking for a place to sleep while in Paris this is probably not the hotel for you. If you’re looking for something to add to your Paris experience, this is definitely the hotel for you. The hotel is located directly across the street from the Luxembourg Parc. The park itself is a wonderful place to walk through and relax. The staff in the hotel all spoke English and were very happy to help us with any of our needs. While you can choose to have breakfast included with your stay (15 Euros per person), we chose to not to have this option and ate at a small restaurant that was close to the hotel (the combined cost for this was about 5 Euros). While our room was small as compared to a North American hotel room, it would be average for a European room. The room was very clean. The room had a great marble bathroom with a deep soaker tub. The hotel had one computer that had free Internet for hotel guests. The access to the nearest metro station was about a 5 minute walk away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were very impressed with this hotel from the moment we arrived. A good friend recommended the hotel, among a number of others, and we narrowed down our choices by the Trip Advisor reviews we read. We are so grateful to other reviewers whose feedback was accurate and spot on. The hotel's rooms are cozy but decent size. There was a sitting area and a bed area in our room, enough space to get back with some room to spare. The bed was extremely comfortable - not too hard, very soft linens, great pillows (and this is something that we have rarely experienced throughout our extensive travels). The bathroom was also quite nice. There was a lovely library where we meet our friends each night for drinks (both pre and post dinner). The front desk attendant made a fire for us each night and we were able to sit, drink and talk, play chess and listen to music. Of all the hotel's attributes, without a doubt, the most impressive was the staff. From the wonderful woman who brought us our morning cafe au laits and croissants to the fantastic front desk staff (Royce and all the others are great!), the service was better than any five star hotel you would find. They were responsive, informative, incredibly helpful, and friendly as well. We are already looking forward to our next visit in Paris and to returning to this lovely hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Location. Friendly staff. Best value for the money.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Luxembourg Parc in April 2009 based on the reviews shown here. Generally, I would say the hotel offers some of the best value in Paris. The location was excellent -- directly across the street from the Luxembourg Parc and very near the Blvd. St. Germain -- plenty of restaurants and cafes. The hotel staff were all very friendly and helpful and spoke excellent English (esp. Jacques). My only disappointment perhaps was that the rooms (and the bar area) were somewhat smaller than I had expected given the pictures. However, they were very clean, and the bathroom (where you spend most of your time anyway) was very nice. The hotel had a nice courtyard and downstairs bar area where people seemed to enjoy a drink or so everynight. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel as there were so many other options (try Gerard Mulot down the street for pastries!!!), but the breakfast room seemed very nice. There is also a very nice looking workout room downstairs. In the past we have stayed at the Hotel d'Aubusson which we enjoyed and which has a great location as well, (which I would give 4 stars to versus 3 1/2 for the Hotel Luxembourg parc). But the prices were around 370 euros / night versus 250 euros. So it depends what your budget allows. Nonetheless, I would definitely go back and would certainly recommend both to other travelers.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here based on the mostly positive reviews on this website. In terms of decor, luxury and attention to detail the hotel certainly did not disappoint. I had a lovely, good sized double room all to myself and it was cosy and warm in the evening when it got a little colder. I arrived on a Monday (a holiday) and staff were a bit thin on the ground, the lady on duty seemed a little stressed and kept saying she was on her own. There was also no room service available although there was a room service snack menu in the room (they should remove this if they don't actually offer their customers room service). Things picked up somewhat on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning when more staff were on duty, the guys who were on duty at those times were completely genuine in their willingness to be helpful. Full marks to them for their customer service. I also had a wonderful breakfast before checking out, so all in all the trip ended on a positive note. The location was perfect, very close to the Boulevard St Michel with all its amenities, Montparnasse tower and the beautiful Luxembourg Gardens (a must see). I would definitely return to this hotel in the future as the good outweighed the bad - they just need to watch it with some of their staff who need to be made aware that it is important to make sure customers are happy throughout their stay at the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this beautiful hotel in September, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We arrived a little early for the usual check in but were quickly and efficiently shown to our room. The room was quite a reasonable size, very clean and tastefully decorated with period furniture sloping ceilings and beautiful french fittings in the bathroom, The bathroom was marble and even though the shower was over the bath it was easy to use and the water pressure was good. The soap, shampoo and other products in the bathroom were french and of a very good quality. The staff were nice and very helpful. On the day we arrived we were tired and hungry and the receptionist directed us to a restaurant just up the street which was excellent. The location of the hotel was fantastic, just across the road from the beautiful gardens and only a short walk to Blvd. St. Michel and St. Germaine. Musee D'Orsay, the river Seine with the artists and souvenir sellers, Notre Dame and many other places of interest, shops and restaurants. The metro and RER train stations are only a short walk away and easy to use once you get the hang of it. Take the RER train to Versaiiles, it only takes about 40 mins and is a really interesting trip. The palace itself is unbelievable, you really have to see it and the grounds are huge. We really loved the hotel and wished we had more time to spend there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A 3 night stay at the HLP was just as expected - great A bit of a concern choosing the right hotel for parents celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary along with nephews & nieces but overall turned out to be spot on. Not cheap, especially given current Euro/Sterling exchange rate but not overpriced either. The executive rooms we received were all to a high standard and very comfortable. The only downside was a third bed did cramp one of the rooms a little. One of the rooms booked had a superb balcony - perfect for a gathering before & after an evening in Paris. Considering prices in the bar for a beer are over 6 euro's (average for Paris) - why not nip 2 minutes down the road to the shop & get a few of the same in for at just over 1 euro each. Reception staff were extremely pleasant and fortunately for a non french speaker conversed in the English language your average bloke from Nottingham would never be able to grasp. Not a wide choice of breakfast items but those on offer where of a high quality and adequately kicked the day off. Spot on location - most attractions by foot - direct RER from CDG airport to Luxembourg station only 5 to 10 mins walk. The park opposite the hotel is very attractive for a relaxing morning stroll. As for the hotel library as in some previous reviews - who spends time in a library when in Paris? Will be returning to the HLP on my next visit to Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located in the St. Germain area and within walking distance of the Siene, many tourist destinations, elegant shopping, and great restaurants and cafes, this boutique hotel has it all. The rooms are spacious, beautifully decorated, and include large well appointed marble baths that are very clean. Our room, number 35, faced the lovely Luxembourg Park and included three large windows that opened to let in the cool Paris breeze as well as the atmosphere of the city. Our room, on the street side, was a bit noisy at night but did not affect our sleep. The folks at the front desk, especially Fabienne and Christian, were friendly and very helpful with directions, recommendations, and reservations for dinning. We looked forward to their cheerful "bon jour" each time we saw them. They really made us feel welcome and went out of their way to make our five night stay delightful. One evening they made reservations for us at the terrific Procope restaurant. When we arrived we were ushered to a table for two in front of beautiful set of French doors overlooking the balcony. The hotel breakfast room, library and bar area were also beautifully decorated and staffed with caring considerate personnel. I can't say enough about Hotel Luxembourg and its wonderful staff. This hotel costs a little more but is a real value. We would definitely stay here again. "Merci" to Fabienne and the rest of the staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Hotel Luxembourg Parc Oct. 31-Nov. 7, 2008, and were most impressed with the accommodations and with the staff. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived, so Fabienne (at reception) served us delicious breads and coffee in the library. Her thoughtfulness was the norm for all members of the staff during our stay; in fact, we have never experienced such at any other hotel. They even allowed my husband to use the computer behind the desk to check e-mail several times while the computer (free) in the library was down. Our room (executive--#31) was lovely; the linens were luxurious; the bathroom was spotless with plenty of room for our toiletries. There was also plenty of closet and cupboard space for our clothes. The lobby is small but beautifully decorated. The breakfast room is also small, but we never had trouble getting a table. The breakfast came with our room (we booked directly with the hotel's own website), so we ate there each morning and enjoyed both the ambiance and the servers who were quite busy but also accommodating. The "library" is a small, beautiful room off the lobby. We enjoyed a glass of wine in front of the fireplace most nights. That was a delightful way to end the day. The location is ideal--away from the noise of the touristy areas, but close enough to walk to most of them. We loved our stay, and we have already highly recommended this hotel to friends who are planning a Paris trip in April.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the glistening green exterior to the elegant and sophisticated interior, this hotel makes your jaw drop with its beauty and style. The interior is reminiscent of an exclusive club, and every detail, such as the furnishings and furniture simply glow with quality. However, all of this pales in comparison to the quality of the service offered by the staff. You expect staff in a quality hotel to be profefessional and polite, but how many will lean on a personal connection to keep a restaurant open late just for you (Jules) - or who will track down a taxi that you were in to find and retrieve a lost camera (Royce). Paris was hot and very busy during our trip, but the HLP was an oasis that I looked forward to retreating to at the end of each day. Another strength of the hotel is its location - which is ten minutes walk from the Seine, but still away from the crowds, and offering a taste of a 'real' Paris. The stay was not without its incidents - for example I had asked for a room with a view of the Luxembourg garden, but was given a courtyard room, which was very disappointing as it was one of the main reasons I chose the HLP. Also, one of the shower handles broke off and couldn't be fixed for a few days because it was a weekend. However, these issues were overshadowed by the delights we found around every corner. The quality of the bedding, the beauty of the courtyard, the comfortable size of the room, etc. If you are thinking of staying in Paris then you should believe all of the reviews - this hotel is a rare find.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this lovely hotel in August (two couples) for a week. As with the other reviews we were more than happy with this boutique abode. The rooms were spacious and the bathrooms elegant. Everything is well presented. Fabienne runs a professional hotel but it still has a homely and friendly atmosphere. Fabienne is as elegant as the hotel! The staff from the breakfast room to the management were obliging with any request that we had. (My friend had to cut her ring off from a very swollen finger and Xavier was more than helpful - a thoroughly delightful young man) We ate breakfast there more than we expected as the choice was just what we wanted before we hit the pavements to explore Paris My husband and i loved being able to wander and sit in The Luxembourg Gardens and 'people watch'. St Sulplice is an amazing church as is Saint-Germain-des-Prés. The Musée National du Moyen Age is close by and I enjoyed seeing the tapestries there as I was reading Tracy Chevalier's 'The Lady and the Unicorn (2003)' when I was travelling. We walked everywhere and we ate at all the scrumptious restaurants in the area. The shopping in that part of Paris is varied from reasonable to expensive but it is all very chic. Our only complaint was that we wished that we'd booked more time there. Arriving on a Friday and then spending time in Paris until Thursday was not enough! We should have had two weekends. But this hotel did set the tone for the rest of our French/Italian holiday - just perfect. Thank Fabienne and all the staff at Luxembourg Parc.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not sure how to review this hotel. We booked on the basis that it had rave reviews from most other visitors. The hotel is in a great position and though we arrived after dark and left very early morning we still appreciated the position on the gardens. We changed our room for a position with park views and Xavier the concierge was very helpful with this. The fun began when we discovered that there was no hot water and after a long days traveling it was what we were most looking forward to. This problem could not be resolved in the short term so we went to dinner assured that we would have hot water on our return. This was not the case and I had a luke warm bath before bed. Problems did not stop there when my wife discovered hairs in the bed. We think this was a fault of the laundry service as they seemed otherwise clean. By now it was apparent that Xavier who was as charming and helpful as is possible, was the only member of staff in the hotel. He found us new sheets and a double duvet rather than the two very small singles and we made our own bed. I cannot criticise the service but it highlights a problem with the smaller hotels with skeleton staff when things go wrong. This would be OK but they are not cheap. We paid more at this hotel than we had paid last month for a night at Claridges with full breakfast and a bottle of champagne on arrival. Admittedly a special offer but they always seem available if you look. They gave us a 10% discount on our bill which was appreciated but though the hotel is very attractive, well decorated and well positioned, I don't think we will be staying at the Luxembourg Parc again.</p></li>

<li>We paid more at this hotel than we had paid last month for a night at Claridges with full breakfast and a bottle of champagne on arrival.</br></br></li>
<li><span style="background-color:#fffac8">Admittedly a special</span> <span style="background-color:#fffac8">offer</span> but they always seem available if you look.</br></br></li>
<li>They gave us a 10% discount on our bill which was appreciated but though the <span style="background-color:#557585">hotel</span> is <span style="background-color:#557585">very attractive</span>, well decorated and well positioned, I don't think we will be staying at the Luxembourg Parc again.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a wonderful hotel; small, luxurious, quiet, perfectly situated and charming. It is a short and interesting stroll to Boulevard St. Germain along boutique-lined streets. The Odeon Metro line is 5 minutes away and connects to all points of the city via Chatelet or Montparnasse. There is a wonderful neighborhood bakery near St. Sulpice, on the corner of Rue Mabillon and Guisarde, which serves freshly baked breads and pastries if you want to pass on the expensive breakfast at the hotel. For other daily supplies there is a supermarket on Rue de Seine, just beyond Boulevard St. Germain. The front desk staff speak English and are helpful recommending restaurants, local attractions and arranging transportation. By all means, take time to walk around the Gardens across the street and see the famous fountain in which children sail rented sailboats a la Madeleine. St. Sulpice, currently undergoing exterior renovation, is at the end of the cobbled alley that borders the hotel. Rooms are beautifully decorated and functionally outfitted. Double/triple glazed windows keep street noise to a minimum. The marble baths have generous counter space and excellent lighting. The interior designers have done a magnificent job of creating environments that are elegant but comfortable; unique prints and paintings (some artfully illuminated), high quality fabrics, wood floors with Persian carpets and comfortable furniture make a stay here pleasantly homey. There was no iron or ironing board provided, although there was same day laundry service (in by 10am, back by 8pm). With only 26 rooms, the Luxembourg Parc Hotel is a secret pied a terre for travelers to the City of Light.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently travelled to Paris with my 16 year old daughter. I chose to stay at the Luxembourg Parc based on trip advisor reviews and was exceedingly happy with my choice. We arrived from Amsterdam at Gare du Nord and used the RER line B to Luxembourg and followed the Luxembourg Garden fence the walk was only 5 - 10 mins pulling bags. We found the location wonderful, just far enough away from the action to enjoy a sense of relaxation and a really peaceful nights sleep. Our room for the five nights 326 was delightful with 2 windows and twin beds. One window look to the street Rue Vaugirard and the other to the internal courtyard. The beds and pillows were really comfortable - no complaints at all. The weather was very warm and the airconditioning worked a treat. The bathroom was great just the right size and always attention to detail from the room maid Gretchen who prepared our room for turn down most nights. We used the library and computer facilities and had breakfast at the hotel on one occassion for convenience and felt it was adequate but not great value. We had wonderful service in the evenings on our return from huge days sightseeing from Michele and Jules, thank you both for your kind and helpful approach, sightseeing and resturant tips. Can I recommend a creperie on Rue Cannette the 'clown creperie' not to be confused with one a couple of shops away. We tried both and the 'clown creperie' was the best. Eric Kayser on Rue Ancienne du Comedie near Odeon metro had the best croissants for a breakfast treat. We walked all over Paris until 11 or 12 midnight and felt entirely safe at all times especially in the area of the hotel. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel for a fantastic stay in Paris. Every aspect of our stay was perfect.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located in St Germain on the Left Bank and opposite the stunning Luxembourg Park, this beautiful boutique hotel has all you could hope for, for a romantic Paris stay. We were on our honeymoon and were delighted with this gem of a hotel. The rooms are beautifully appointed, with gorgeous Louis XIIII furniture and lush marble bathrooms. We actually stayed in two different rooms - we stayed for a week before heading to London for a few days and then returned to finish our Paris trip there. The hotel is in a great location - about 15 minutes walk to Pont Neuf and 5 minutes to the wonderful centre of St Germain, which is full of restaurants, markets, shops and cafes. Just across the road is the beautiful park, which is a great spot to relax or take a picnic. Lidia and the staff at the Luxembourg Parc were delightful - friendly, very helpful and a great source of information on the best places to eat or visit. Nothing was too much trouble for them and the stay was hassle free. The hotel has a lovely library and courtyard to relax in, and the breakfast option was great value, considering the quality of the meal - they will serve breakfast in your room if you request it, otherwise it is served in the gorgeous light filled breakfast room. The only negative was that our double bed was two singles put together (I know virtually all hotels do this) but they kept pulling apart which was a bit annoying. They need to secure them better. This was the only negative though - and compared with the excellent standard of everything else, it was not the end of the world. This hotel is great value for money considering the high quality of service that it delivers and the beautiful appointment of the hotel. I would stay there again without hesitation. Je t'aime Hotel Luxembourg Parc!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just returned from my first trip to Paris, and was fortunate to stay at this lovely hotel right on Luxembourg Garden. Thank you to all the reviewers on Trip Advisor, who helped me make a great choice. This hotel attracted me, not only for the consistently great reviews, but also the great location and the existence of a fitness room (to work off croissants and macarons!). My superior room was on the top floor. I had a window that overlooked the gardens and Rue Servandoni. I heard no noise of any kind, neither from the street nor within the hotel. It was a little oasis after a day of sightseeing. I slept like I've never slept before!The mattress was extremely comfortable with a spotlessly clean and cozy duvet. I took advantage of the deep tub daily. The breakfast room was cheery and bright. The offerings were fresh juice, three choices of cereal including muesli, yogurt, cheese and ham, a huge bowl of fresh fruit (not that gross packaged "fruit salad"), delicious fresh bread (also in loaf shape for toasting) amazing butter and many choices of jam, and a few choices of very high quality croissants/viennoisseries. It was completely worth the 15 euros. Coffee was served with hot milk if desired. We felt pampered. Madame in the breakfast room was lovely. There were also eggs with bacon/sausage for a little extra if desired. You could also have breakfast served in your room. The staff is what makes this place so special, with great suggestions and making calls for reservations, taxies, etc. The team of Laurent, Fabienne, Royce, Xavier, Jules and Michel were always courteous, friendly and professional. There are many wonderful bistros and cafes within a short walk. We actually never took the metro, because we walked everywhere (15 minutes to Notre Dame and the Louvre). We even walked to le Marais one day! I would highly recommend this charming hotel, and would absolutely stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from our wonderful stay at the Luxembourg Parc Hotel. I stayed there with my husband and parents. We had 2 superior rooms on the third floor, one corner room with a view of the Luxembourg gardens and one room with a view of the Rue Servandoni, which is a small side steeet. Both rooms were relatively noisy because of the very busy Rue Vaugirard, even the room on the side street. We all used earplugs, so it did not bother us. The rooms were wonderfully apointed. Very tastful decoration, very French. We absolutely loved our rooms. Inside the hotel was very quiet. It really felt like home to us. The staff bend over backwards to make your stay memorable. Really outstanding hospitality. One exeption was the rude woman at breakfast. We waited over half an hour for our first coffee and then complained at the front desk because she had disappeared and no other staff member was to be found in the breakfast area. After she returned and was made aware of our complaint she became very rude and we also did not get our eggs any more. The lady at the front desk was very apologetic and took the breakfast off our bill. We then decided to go out for breakfast on the remaining days. It is a pity that one woman sets a damper on an otherwise perfect hotel (there are many complaints here at tripadvisor about the breakfast service). BTW on our first morning there was a friendly young man serving the breakfast and this was really enjoyable. The location of the hotel is just perfect. The gardens are so beautiful and fun to walk in and people watch at every time of the day. The restaurants in the area are great, all in short walking distance of the hotel. Thanks to the lovely hotel staff for the perfect suggestions of places to eat and for making each and every reservation for us. We are already planning our next trip to Paris and could not imagin to stay anywhere else. We look forward to our next stay at the Luxembourg Parc.</p></li>

<li>One exeption was the <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">rude</span> woman at <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">breakfast</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>We waited over half an hour for our first coffee and then complained at the front desk because she had disappeared and no other staff member was to be found in the breakfast area.</br></br></li>
<li>After she returned and was made aware of our complaint she became very rude and we also did not get our eggs any more.</br></br></li>
<li>The lady at the front desk was very apologetic and took the breakfast off our bill.</br></br></li>
<li>We then decided to go out for breakfast on the remaining days.</br></br></li>
<li>It is a pity that one woman sets a damper on an otherwise perfect hotel (there are many complaints here at tripadvisor about the breakfast service).</br></br></li>
<li>BTW on our first morning there was a friendly young man serving the <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">breakfast</span> and this was <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">really enjoyable</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#008080">location</span> of the hotel is <span style="background-color:#008080">just perfect</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#808080">gardens</span> are <span style="background-color:#808080">so beautiful and fun</span> to walk in and people watch at every time of the day.</br></br></li>
<li>The restaurants in the area are great, all in short walking distance of the hotel.</br></br></li>
<li>Thanks to the <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1">lovely</span> <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1">hotel staff</span> for the perfect suggestions of places to eat and for making each and every reservation for us.</br></br></li>
<li>We are already planning our next trip to Paris and could not imagin to stay anywhere else.</br></br></li>
<li>We look forward to our next stay at the Luxembourg Parc.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My teenage daughter and I stayed here for four nights mid- October and were delighted with our choice to stay here (based on tripadvisor reviews). We were warmly welcomed by Zina who continued to be a great help on a number of occasions. She, as well as other staff members, were more than happy to assist with travel plans, reservations and directions during our stay. They would cheerfully greet us coming and going and were genuinely interested in our excurssions. Also, the cleaning staff were most pleasant and made the effort to converse. The hotel is meticulously clean and tastefully decorated with warmth and comfort. We had a corner room and it was very light and charming. The marble bathroom was large and bright with lovely products. My daughter and I had hot chocolate one night in the library and it was very cosy. In the breakfast room, I appreciated the availability of lattes, fresh orange juice etc with our breakfast. We particularly enjoyed the pain au chocolats , fresh buns and croissants and cheeses - the fruit salad was also very fresh and tasty. The location is indeed stellar and extremely conducive for those of us who prefer to explore on foot. You will discover the Sorbonne, the Pantheon, Notre Dame and St. Sulpice practically on your doorstep. However the Metro and RER were also close by allowing quick access to the Eiffel Tower and further afield. (A note of warning, deciding to get to Versaille ourselves, we were informed by the ticket seller only after we purchased RER train tickets from her for Versaille that the train line was out of service that day. Thus began a 2 hour confusing trek to get there with the Metro and other trains. This is not uncommon for train lines to be out of service so make sure before purchasing at the station or splurge for the hotel's package). There were many choices of restaurants nearby. Intimate Boutique shopping is close in St. Germain as are the more 'common' stores along St. Michel Blvd. We had a lovely stay and would highly recommend staying here.</p></li>
