Breakfast buffet costs 10.95 in lobby but it was decent and worth the money. Pool area attractive but a bit on the smaller side. Would stay there again. Booked through priceline and got a real bargain. Very happy. Just off on ramp for Disneyworld, which is about 6 miles away or so.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here the first week in December and paid about $55 a night for the room. I was a bit apprehensive based on the price, but had read good reviews - after all, how picky can you be for $55 a night.. well, this place was great. An awesome location, clean rooms, friendly staff. It is within walking distance of Sea World, a CVS and a very short drive to everything else in Orlando.</p></li>

We bought beach chairs and had to leave them behind. I would have liked to know that other guests would get use from them also.</p></li>

That will save you $15 on parking costs. You can even use the free bus to the location, although it isn't driving very often. The rooms are quit good. The people at the reception can use à little class for kindness. There are not very much people eating at the hotel. So in THE evening it 's a little boring at the hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We LOVED the location of this Hilton Garden Inn. You really can walk to SeaWorld from the hotel and we even had a great view of the SeaWorld fireworks from our hotel window! The hotel property itself was very nice and we also liked the area the hotel was in - newer and not as congested as some of the other parts of town. The only thing we missed was not having a free continental breakfast - but we knew that when we made the reservations and made due with some snacks we had packed and the free coffee and tea in the lobby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I liked the place!! Our room was very nice. The bed was quite comfortable, plenty of pillows & nice downy comforter. It was clean & showed signs of recently being re-done. The AC worked good as well as the mico, fridge & haridryer. Plenty of thick towels and toiletries. Room was quiet. Check in & check out was prompt and problem free. Guest laundry was a little inadequate though. Did eat breakfast in the dining room a couple of times. All though a little pricey, it was adequate and filling. I would surely stay here again</p></li>

Breakfast was lovely. Dinner not too great but we ate out mosts nights anyway. Pool more than adequate for the size of hotel. We have stayed in both The Rosen Plaza and The Renaissance and found this to be a far better hotel than either of the other two. Yes its smaller and doesn't have the "wow" factor that the other 2 have but I would def stay here again where I wouldn't at the other two.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a great place to stay on our trip to Orlando. The room was huge! There was a full kitchen, living room, seperate bedroom with jacuzzi tub and a shower stall in the washroom. It was clean and tidy. There is a great pool there for hanging out and the drinks are great. the only thing that sucks here is breakfast. Breakfast was $12 (which we thought was a deal for a hotel) however the service was poor, the food was cold and tasteless. We could've drove to the strip and got a much better/bigger breakfast for half the price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very nice hotel. Close to Sea World and other attractions. Front desk personnel very helpful. Rooms were clean and updated. Pool and hot tub very nice for kids. Breakfast was great (as are all at HGInns). Watch out for "free shuttle to parks" as they are contracted out to a separate company (they sometimes run really late and may try to charge you for the free trip). Hotel was extremely trustworthy as we left 14 DVD's in the room. A week later we contacted hotel and all DVD's had been retreived by housekeeping and returned to us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hilton for 3 nights. Check in was a breeze and the staff was very friendly and helpful. We only ate breakfast at the hotel and it was a buffet and for the price it was great. We were very happy. The room was wonderful and clean and we loved having a fridge and microwave. In the evenings there were fresh baked cookies at the front desk. Wonderful. We also loved the fact that we could walk to SeaWorld! We had a view of Kraken from our room! Our stay also included a $10 gas card which right now is wonderful. A wonderful stay for sure.</p></li>

The staff were friendly and service was great, but the food quality in the restaurant was below average. The major issue here is three things that would make it great; Air con that is not noisy ( apparently all of them are in the rooms) Better beds, we had to sleep in seperate beds Better standard of food for room service. One the up side I am sure that it is priced well, but the big school groups made for a nosiy stay.</p></li>

The hotel was being renovated but we were very unaware of any upset except for trying to find a laundry room open one day. Efficient but unobtrusivie staff and the hotel was spotless. Great time to visit the parks, still very hot but so much quieter, you can walk on to the rides instead of queueing all the time. Only downfall of whole visit is plagues of love bugs which seem to be worse at parks with water ie blizzard beach! Would go back in a minute and stay at same hotel, also great location on i trolley and lynx stops.</p></li>

Since we're from Montreal and didn't know the city at all Thiago the manager showed us about how to use the bus in the city and Joseph showed us where to party in downtown Orlando. The rooms are great spacious with a nice big flat screen. Had a great relaxing time @ the hotel.

Friendly and very helpful staff was able to get lots of packages from mail order for me. Very clean acommodations with enough space for large pieces of luggage. Location is very good. It's really walking distance from Sea World but be aware that it's quite a long walk as you have to cross the entire parking lot (not very nice after a entire day inside the park under 97F). At night you can see the fireworks show from your room if it's facing the park or from the hotel parking lot. Definitely will consider as an option when returning to Orlando.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed at this hotel from 08/09-08/15 and had a wonderful time. It was the friendliest and most helpful staff we encountered during our entire trip. (every other service-orientated places, rest. parks, etc most people were generally nasty). The rooms were great, we saw fireworks each night and could so easily walk to SeaWorld. The expedia concierge was also very helpful. Especially outstanding were our server William at Breakfast, Tiffani at Concierge, Raymond (I think - Night Manager), and the unseen faces of Housekeeping who were very good at leaving everything in order. They deserve 5 stars!!!!</p></li>

<li>It was the friendliest and most helpful staff we encountered during our entire trip.</br></br></li>
<li>(every other service-orientated places, rest.</br></br></li>
<li>parks, etc most people were generally nasty).</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#557585">rooms</span> were <span style="background-color:#557585">great</span>, we saw fireworks each night and could so easily walk to SeaWorld.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#911eb4">expedia concierge</span> was also <span style="background-color:#911eb4">very helpful</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>Especially outstanding were our server William at Breakfast, Tiffani at Concierge, Raymond (I think - Night Manager), and the unseen faces of Housekeeping who were very good at leaving everything in order.</br></br></li>
<li>They deserve 5 stars!!!</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is the second time I stayed at this hotel. It is very clean and the rooms are quite spacious. Its nice to have the added conv of a refrig, microwave and coffee service in the room. (they should add an in room safe). The rooms are nicely appointed with large 42 inch flat screen tvs. The pool is heated which makes its very relaxing after a long day. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone going to SeaWorld, Discovery Cove or Aquatica. Yes you can walk to SeaWorld!! (its a nice long walk, but doable). There is a shuttle if you dont want to walk. Stay here you will like it!! Staff was friendly and helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed for three nights and had an excellent experience. Helpful and knowledgable staff, clean room with great housekeeping, good breakfast with great service and a comfortable bed. Aircon was OK although I went for the 'chill the room when out and switch off during the night' technique to keep noise down. I also switched off the fridge at night as this was a little noisy too but these are minor comments about an overall fantastic stay. I would definitely choose HGI for any future business trips to Orlando. I chose Hilton Garden Inn based on previous experience with the chain and TripAdvisor comments about this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend surprised me with a trip to Disney for my birthday. We were both pleasantly surprised by how nice this hotel is. It was like being back home. We stayed in the 1 bedroom. They had a full kitchen with all the dishes, cups, silverware, dishwasher, and full size refrigerator, they even had a wine opener. They also had a very nice screened in porch to sit on and enjoy. The restaurant that was off of the pool area was not very good service or food. They are right across the street from Sea World so you could walk there. They are not far from Disney and plenty of restaurants to choice from. We will stay again if we travel to Orlando again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel deserves more than 3 stars that it has gotten because it was great. Rooms are very clean and large. Comfy beds and very clean linens. I am very particular when it comes to hotels and this is at the top of my list for Orlando. I would definitely recommend it and stay again. It has very nice bathrooms with Neutrogena products and marble countertops. Laundry room on each floor for convenience. Free coffee/tea in the lobby each morning. Also has a restaurant with great breakfast and kids eat free. Has a nice size pool as well as a kiddie pool. Free parking. I believe they also have shuttle service but you'd have to ask to confirm. Free in-room wifi.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived early before check in time but they let us check in anyway, very accomodating! The room was a good size, 2 double beds, had MW and refrigerator, very clean. We left our car at the hotel and walked across the parking lot to Sea World. So simple! We did not get to swim in the pool but it looked very inviting. For an additional charge there was a breakfast buffet off the lobby which was delicious. You could make your own waffles or have an omelet from the omelet station, bacon, sausage, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, pastries, just numerous choices. We will certainly stay here again! Every staff member we encountered was as nice and helpful as possible.</p></li>

Reasonably priced hotel, good customer service, ver helpful staff, good food, pool open until 10pm, room pretty basic but when if visiting the attractions then you only need the room for sleep! Quiet location with restaurants in walking distance. International Drive Trolley (bus) stop + Lynx bus stop on Westwood Boulevard, outside of hotel. Free shuttle bus to parks but I Trolley very convenient too. International Drive 15 mins on trolley with may fantastic eating places. Would recommend hotel as in walking distance from Seaworld and Aquatica. Orlando is one awesome holiday destinations. Will return and 'do' it all again! :)</p></li>

However, if you're looking for a nice, clean, reasonably priced hotel within 10 minutes of Disney, Epcot, Universal, and everything else, then this is your place. We stayed for 5 days while visiting Epcot and Universal. The hotel was clean and meet all our needs. There's a nice pool and hot tub at the hotel, we only wished it was open later than 10pm. The hotel has a small bar and a restaurant. The restaurant has a buffet breakfast that was a bit pricey at $12, but had a good quality food and a huge assortment of things to choose from. Overall our stay was fantastic at a very reasonable price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The location is extremely close to Sea World and Aquatica. The distance from Disney and Universal is just right that it wasn't inconvenient and cost of the room was enough to offset the 15 minute ride to those parks. On the surface the room appears clean. The only reason I doubt is because my son's allergies was worse (usual stuffy nose and itchy rash on face, which is unusual) inside the room. He was much better when we returned home. I am not too sure if the cause was an unclean room. The staff was very helpful, especially when I needed to find a 24 hour pharmacy to fill a prescription for my son. For the price and location, I would book this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed here many times and really enjoyed it. My wife loves Sea World and it is an easy walk from the hotel. There is a sidewalk that takes you right to SeaWorld's parking lot (we are both seniors and it only takes us only about 10 minutes to get there). Disney and Universal are only a short ten minute drive, and Aquatica and Discovery Cove about three minutes. The staff here is very friendly, you might even be greeted by Mike, the general manager, when you go down to breakfast. They have a very nice pool and spa, the rooms are always clean, and you get lots of towels. We have already booked for next winter. What I liked best, the staff, and being close to SeaWorld. The least, having to go home.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel staff was the best I've ever encountered. They had a problem, handled it, compensated for it (waived some fees AND gave our group a coffee/refreshment break), and EVERYONE was so kind, including the general manager, who personally apologized and asked if there was anything more they could do. They were more than fair. e.g. The banquet manager asked my husband's favorite beverage (regular Dr. Pepper) and he personally went out and bought him a six-pack. Almost everything was perfect, but you really know the quality of a hotel experience if there's a problem and they truly step up to the plate. I can't say enough about this wonderful property and its management and staff. Everyone made us feel very welcome and important.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this hotel because of its proximity to Seaworld. We were able to walk to the park in about 10 minutes. The front desk personnel were always friendly and helpful. The room is clean, well furnished and updated. Amenities included coffee maker, minifridge and microwave. We received rollaway beds for both of our rooms and weren't charged an extra fee (though they told us there would be a fee when we requested them.) The pool area was nice and the hot tub was comfortable. The bar service was quick. We ordered food from the restaurant via the bar and were able to enjoy it by the pool. We got one room at $44 through Hotwire and another at $120 via a AAA rate. I highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again without question.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Check-in: the hotel was ready for our late arrival with keys in the packet. They honored our request for a quiet room room on the highest possible floor. I just showed ID, signed, and got the keys. The whole procedure took 15 seconds. Room: room in excellent condition, very clean everything was working. Check-out: pressed a special button on the room phone, got confirmation and left keys on the desk. How easy, fast and efficent! Highlights: - fridge in the room - free highspeed internet by both LAN or wireless. I used it for my laptop (wired) and my kids for their iPods (wireless). - for a small fee added to the room price we got good breakfast for family of four. In Orlando there is number of good hotels but we've just found ours. We'll be back.</p></li>

My initial reservations were outside the block time needed to secure a special rate. I brought this to the attention of the staff and within minutes they left a kind and pleasant message on my voice mail stating that the price will be adjusted to reflect the discounted rate. This is just one small example of the many overwhelming acts of kindness the staff portrayed over the course of my stay. A heartfelt thank you to the entire staff but especially to Nour and Emilee who went above and beyond my expectations.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was in Orlando for a conference and found the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando at SeaWorld a great place to stay. The room was very comfortable (except for noisy airconditioning), clean, and well-sized (smoking is allowed in some rooms). Wireless internet worked flawlessly and you could even print for free (files sent electronically and you pick up at printer). Breakfast buffet was good and plentyful and there is also a pantry where you can buy meals to heat up in your room. What I enjoyed most was the friendly and helpful staff, who always greeted you with a big smile. It is a bit off the beaten track, but there is an I-ride trolley stop and a bus stop in front of the entrance and if you have a car, it is no problem at all (free parking). I would definitely stay there again!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We picked this hotel because it was close to Seaworld. It was an easy walk and after traveling two days in a car, it was nice not having to drive to Seaworld. Check in was smooth, and the staff was friendly. We had a suite and it was very nice and clean. The hotel was full, but did not seem busy. There seemed to be room at the restaurant and bar areas. We did not get a chance to use the pool and hot tub very long. Weather closed the pool. But the time we had by the pool was nice. The area was clean and the water in the pool was warm, and the hot tub was hot. I would stay here again. Probably a little pricey considering we spent most of our time at Seaworld and not much time at the hotel. So if your looking for just a place to sleep, someplace else might work and do less damage on your wallet.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here to visit SeaWorld with my grandson and found the location excellent and very convenient. It is also close to I-4 and International Drive. It took us about 15 minutes to walk to the front gate at SeaWorld although they offered a shuttle with a variety of pick up and drop off times as well as a shuttle to Aquatica. They have more limited shuttle times to the other major theme parks. We had a 1 bedroom suite which was on the small side but more than adequate for our needs. Check in and out was very efficient. Front desk were helpful in explaining benefits of staying there as they are a SeaWorld partner hotel including the quick cue passes. We cut our trip short and returned home early due to the rainy weather but will stay there again if the rate is the same on our next visit to Seaworld.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Hilton Garden Inn Orlando in jul2006 for 7 nights. It is a 3star hotel with a small but adequate pool, very friendly staff. There is a small restaurant on site which was well used for breakfast but most people ate out at night and we felt that the dinner menu was a bit limited. We had to call a doctor out twice while we were there and found this a very reassuring experience. This hotel is well placed for the i-ride which stops outside the hotel and runs the complete length of International drive.It costs a dollar each time you get on or you can buy a pass to cover a few days for next to nothing. It is very close to Seaworld and we actually walked there and back on the day that we went there. We would recommend this hotel for families,couples and the older generation. We would use this hotel again</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After a long haul flight from England found check in at the hotel very fast and efficient. Room was reasonably sized, very clean, well furnished and comfortable. Good view from the window with no noise, air con was quiet and enoyed a good nights sleep in a queen sized bed. Buffet breakfast was well laid out and enjoyable - no complaints! Sea World is a short 5min walk across the car park, Disney parks and Universal are all within 15mins drive at any time of day - all in all a central location away from the main I drive area which I feel has become run down over recent years. Would recommend for all age groups and families - pool is not massive but is sufficient to keep the kids happy - also doesn't bust the bank! Would I go there again - absolutely - clean, comfortable, central, reasonable rates - what more do you want!</p></li>

I've paid twice the price and haven't gotten as much for my money. The restaurant has a great breakfast, nice sandwiches and hearty entrees. I really appreicated this since I just wanted to chill out after my all day classes. When I wanted a change I walked one block to the CVS and picked up a frozen entree and some popcorn for the microwave. The airport shuttle came to the hotel, so I really didn't need a car. There was plenty of hot water, the bed was comfortable with a variety of pillows, and there were plenty of channels on the TV.Oh, did I mention the use of two FREE computers near the front desk? My meeting hotel wanted $6.00 for ten minutes! I think not! And the complimentary evening cookies were quite tasty! :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent 6 days here in Orlando on vacation. The hotel met our needs, we were rarely in the room except to sleep. The beds are not really that comfortable. Mid-stay the front desk called our room to confirm we were still there. Someone had checked out and given our room#. We thought nothing else of it until 4 weeks later when we received our credit card bill. We were charged 2(we were given 1 bill when leaving) separate times showing we had checked out then checked back in. One of the charges was only for 2 days, but was high enough to have been 2 nights at the Ritz Carlton! I had to call and get them to take the charges off! Overall the stay was okay, but go over your bill at the front when you leave! One more thing, the shuttle to the theme parks were so run down, but it was nice to not have to drive to Universal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was angst-ridden trying to find an affordable hotel for just a couple of nights so I could take my daughter to the Magic Kingdom. Now, Sea World isn't walking distance from the Magic Kingdom, but it sure isn't far, and the hotel has a shuttle to Disney with a limited schedule. We decided to drive and pay to park so we could choose when to come and go. The Hilton Garden Inn Orlando at SeaWorld was exactly what I wanted. A clean place for us to relax and lay our heads. The staff was really friendly, courteous and helpful. The hotel lobby was inviting and decorated nicely for the holidays. Our room was perfect for the two of us, and coming and going from this hotel was a breeze. There's a shopping center just two miles away, good for quick meals or groceries. I've stayed in some fine hotels in my day, and I really enjoyed this one.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is the perfect hotel if the purpose of your trip is a visit to SeaWorld. Seaworld is literally right behind the hotel. Of course, it would be just as good for just about anything! Our room was spotlessly clean and it was a great benefit to have a refrigerator and microwave in the room. We got an EXCELLENT deal through hotwire. We have paid more in Orlando for a room where we ended up putting a chair against the door at night! The staff was very friendly and helpful. When we got home my husband found that he had forgotten a pair of jeans. The staff was quick to return his message and confirm that they had found them and would ship them right back to him at no charge. They also helped to recommend a restaurant that was just what we were looking for. We definitely would recommend this hotel for anybody looking for a hotel in Orlando.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">All in all, very pleased for the price. Very pleasant in comparison to the other econo lodges / motels in the area, you actually feel homely in the rooms. Bed was great! Staff were very friendly. Location is excellent for Seaworld. It is a 10 min walk to the main gate, also from there you can get the shuttle to Aquatica. I can not comment on the food as I did not eat there (apart from the complimentary cookies they had in reception which were nice). The surrounding area is quiet at night, but not in a bad way, it's a little off the beaten track of iDrive, but I did not feel unsafe at all when returning at night. If you are looking to stay in this area then stay here, you will not regret it. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you need a nice safe, comfortable good value hotel in the area. I slept very well here which is the most important thing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked through Orbitz without a choice of room-type. Ended up with 2 double beds instead of the preferred King. After checking in I asked to be moved, but the front desk could not accomodate the request for the first night. The next morning we asked at the desk and they were very helpful and moved us to a King. The beds are very comfortable and the rooms/inside lobby was clean. The hotel overall is very safe and well kept. The pool is smaller than it looks online. It is locaated in the front of the hotel so there is not much privacy from the parking lot and people entering. The location is convenient - close to I4/Disney and truely right across the street from Seaworld. The trolley is outside the door and fast and convenient. The rate was good, but there are many many many hotels along I-drive to choose from. I know you could pay $20 more per night to stay at a place with a bigger/nicer pool if that is important</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked our stay from internet travel agent for about $100 a night for total 8 nights. Hotel is right beside Seaworld, which is very nice. Also shuttle service to Universal and Disney, timetables not necessarily very good though, best if you have a car. Hotel is very clean and pool big enough, jacuzzi not working properly though. Room had a horrible view (the ceiling of part of hotel), otherwise very nice, cleaned daily except for one day. Lobby area comfortable, so is the restaurant, which was little pricey. If you have a car plenty of places to have breakfast elsewhere too, also I-Drive trolley stops right in front of the hotel. Parking area big enough, and seemed safe. Easy access to I-4. Attraction tickets sold in lobby, particularly one guy especially helpful! Hotel reception staff was far from helpful and friendly, except for maybe 1-2 employees, most did not even say hello. Still, could consider staying there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a bunch of Hilton points to spend and reservations at Discovery Cove and tickets for Aquatica - where to stay? I checked the reviews here and decided to give this property a try. We were not disappointed!!! Everything was great from the location, friendly check-in (Steven), nice restaurant, great breakfast, nice rooms, good pool...great for a family. There were also some nice extras such as the "dive in" movie night. Plus, a visit from Shamu and the Seaworld staff on Saturday morning was a real treat for our son. Andrea at the desk, and William, Jose and Ashley in the restaurant made each day a pleasure. The drive to Discovery Cove was 5 minutes - Aquatica, maybe 7 minutes. We could have walked to SeaWorld - it was that close. A free shuttle was provided, but we chose to drive. We walked to CVS for anything we needed. The breakfast buffet was one of the best we've ever experienced. International Drive was nearby. Downtown Disney about 15 minutes.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in this hotel, with my family, from February 13th till February 20th. First thing that must be pointed out is that this is not an extra-luxury hotel, as many of the Hilton chain, are. There’s no frill, people to carry your luggage and things like this. But, it is an extremely convenient hotel, if you are looking for a 3-4 stars hotel for your family on holidays in Orlando, with a reasonable price (I paid US$ 55 per night. But up to US$ 90-US$ 100, I consider it a bargain). In fact, room and bathroom are spacious. There are two queen size beds in every room, so a couple with two children can be well accommodated. The room is very well equipped since there’s a fridge (a small one) and a microwave oven. Finally, and what is more important for me and my wife, the room, the bathroom and the hotel in general are extremely clean. So, I highly recommended this hotel for families who are looking for a very clean hotel with a good price, with no frill and with facilities for children.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was a breath of fresh air, it was easy to find having driven up from Cocoa Beach. The parking was easy, the desk staff were accommodating and friendly and you were made to feel welcome. We were tired from having spent the day at the Magic Kingdom in Disney and the staff were very helpful. Showing us where to grab good food, telling us details about the area and offering a great deal for Sea World as this hotel was a sponsor. Our room was huge and comfortable facing the sparkling and inviting pool and from the window you could see the closing fireworks of Disney so the location was fantastic. They gave us free 'quick queue' tickets for Sea World and a free shuttle bus to and from the parks, so we were very happy. Knowing that after a long day of enjoying yourself at Disney you could come back to a swim and a fab hotel room was perfect. Stay here, it's very good value, the staff are great and the location is perfect with the nice end of International Drive two minutes drive away.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here one night, June 30, with sole purpose of visiting Sea World and Aquatica. Walked to Sea World from here with no problems, but it might be a bit challenging with very young children unless they're in a stroller. Hotel is wonderful; has free parking. Neighborhood seemed safe. Hotel parking lot is well lit. Our room (king-size bed) was spacious and very clean; the bed was SO comfortable!. Loved having the in-room microwave to make breakfast, which we brought along since we're not huge breakfast eaters. Also, would rather spend the $11-$12 per person on lunch/dinner at Sea World. Used large desk in the room as our table. Hotel restaurant did look very nice--roomy, clean. Our room was poolside; pool was beautiful; closes at 10:00 PM so no need to worry about being kept awake by pool noise/activities after that time. Specifically wanted a hotel within walking distance of Sea World, and this hotel seemed to be the best value for what we wanted. Got a good price with AAA discount. Will definitely stay here again our next trip to Sea World.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived in Orlando a day earlier then anticipated as we were driving from Canada and had no idea that Orlando was a sold out town with many events going on from soccer games,bowl game events and marathon weekend. We started looking for a room and were turned down by many other big name hotel chains and their front desk personal would not even phone other hotels in their chain to try and locate a room for us. One hotel even try to scam us with a price for a room written on a piece of paper and slid across the desk to us. We were not that desperate so the search took us to the Hilton Garden Inn at SeaWorld. The front desk despite many numbers of people checking in took the time to phone around to their sister hotels and in the end were able to locate us in their hotel at the normal price!!!The room was clean/excellent bed, well equipped room and no charge for parking which many of the area hotels were doing just for this busy week of events. This hotel is in a great location to all major theme parks and shopping and excellent value for your dollar.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel on 23rd August for 1wk as the reviews were good enough for us to stay here. The hotel is a 'budget' hilton and it did not disappoint us! Room is very clean and met our needs for the duration of the stay. We initially had a room at the front of the building but asked the next day if there was a room at the rear facing Seaworld. Patricia at the front desk sorted this out for us with no problems at all. Unfortunately for us there was no fireworks going on in the evening at Seaworld for us to look out at! :-( We had the free breakfast buffet that had a good selection and the chef was happy to cook to order for you which is nice. The hotel even has a free film showing by the pool on seleted Friday evenings which is good. Even better as the hotel is a 'seaworld' partner, you can pickup free 'quick-queue' tickets for all the rides at Seaworld which is a big plus and the free courtesy bus to Seaworld & Aquatica saved us on money and time. Overall we enjoyed our stay here and there is nothing negative that I could say for the reasonable price we paid!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My children (6 & 2), the night we came home said, "I want to go back and sleep in our hotel room!" That sums it up! The hotel was in a wonderful location to SeaWorld, Discovery Cove, Aquatica and the bus from SeaWorld to Busch Gardens. It was also convenient to the trolley and public bus to go ANYWHERE and a CVS just in case you forget anything! EVERYONE was pleasant from the reservation coordinator (Nour), front desk staff (Patricia, Chris, Steven and so many others that greeted us regularly with a smile:), the restaurant staff (Gary, William, Suyin, Pilar and Guillermo!), a wonderful chef (Strose - who I personally miss his yummy omelets!), the maintenance staff, and the general manager (Mike). All of whom, knew us and called my children by name. The room was always very clean and spacious with a microwave/refrigerator...perfect when traveling with children, coffee available in the lobby at all times! :) Would definitely highly recommend this hotel. We are already planning our next trip to Orlando and we will definitely be staying at the Hilton Garden Inn - SeaWorld!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just stayed at the Hilton Garden Seaworld for 3 nights , and overall it was a great experience and would defintely stay again and recommend to others. I'll get my personal negatives out of the way first. Bathroom was a little on the small side , sink,toilet, and shower all in one space, and the bed was very soft. Both of these things though are based on personal preferences , and not the fault of Hilton. The bathroom was well kept and very neat and my wife claims if I had my way I'd sleep on a slab of concrete Putting those two little things aside , I'd rate this place as outstanding in every way. You couldnt ask for a better location. 2 minutes off of I-4, 10 minute walk to Seaworld( save the $$$ on parking ) , 5-10 minute drive to all Disney parks, Universal , and all attraction and restaurants on I-Drive All staff encountered very helpful and friendly. Housekeeping very efficient, room was spotless every day when we returned. As far as price , paid $90 for a two room,king bed suite, and believe me , I've paid a lot more for a lot less at other places. Used Hiltons on line site to book and was very efficient and easy to use</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is great. We didn't hire a car but didn't really feel we needed to. There is a free Shuttle service to all the parks which is handy and you can walk to Sea World - out the door and hang a right its about 10 minutes away. I-Ride stop is right outside the hotel and there's a trolley every 20 minutes or so which takes you up to the main drag of International Drive. A 15 minute ride gets you to the main hub where most of the restaurants and shops are. We only used the restaurant in the hotel a couple of times but we did get room service on a regular basis (too tired to move most nights!). Food was excellent (try the ribs) and the staff making and serving it were helpful and efficient. You can also order pizza and chinese to be delivered to your room if you fancy something a bit different. Reception staff were particularly helpful offering help and advise on the best shops, things to do and organising taxis when needed. We had a fabulous stay - peace and quiet but with easy access to parks etc. Ooh and if you get a chance go to Discovery Cove and swim with Dolphins - it was the better than all the other parks put together.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel due to its proximity to Seaworld. It was an easy walk to the park. They also have a free shuttle to Universal and EPCOT. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. I had to drag myself out of bed each morning lured only by the attractions I wanted to see! The pool area was small, but adequate. I only wish the hot tub was a little bigger. There is a nice little restaurant in the hotel that serves a nice buffet breakfast, and a varied dinner menu for reasonable prices. This is a plus as there are no other restaurants within walking distance which is honestly the only real complaint I have. The desk staff was very kind and accomodating. They were very apologetic that my room was not ready when I arrived to check in even though I arrived 2 hours early. They really did not owe me any apologies. They will let you store your luggage behind the desk if you are early for check in or if you need a place to keep it after you check out. I have stayed both at this Hilton Garden Inn and the Hilton Garden on International Drive, and would recommend both for those who desire a decent no frills hotel for a reasonable price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here at the Hilton Garden inn for a convention. The price was better than most over-priced hotels in the Sea World area or Orange county convention area. The food was very good for low to mid range hotel in the Hilton brand. We had bomb-scare-- presumably the same one as the other reviewers. We were not well informed about the situation except the sheriff located right across the street blocked our entry back to the hotel after leaving the convention center. We were hoping for a good night sleep. Nope... We were directed to go the Renaissance hotel next door. Here is where we found other Hilton hotel guest. We ate dinner at the hotel and the meal was compensated "Comp" by the Hilton garden inn. At first, they were told to only comp a drink, but we finally had them comp the meal which we would have expected from the Hilton brand. We also booked a room at the Renaissance for the night. The Hilton garden inn did remove the night we did not stay due to the bomb-scare. As a Hilton diamond member I expect problems while traveling on business. It is very unfortunate families or couples experienced this disruption to their stay in the magic kingdom.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed there for 9 nights. If you want a hotel location which is closed to Disney, this is not for you. But I like the location because it is in the middle of everywhere. It is only 20 mins to airport and 20 mins drive to Disney and 15 mins to Universal Studio. And it is right next to Seaworld. Some people walked to Seaworld parking lot and took the tram to the gate. But I would not recommend hotel's shuttle which run only twice a day. Hotel staffs gave us 6th floor and facing Sea World. I would highly recommend that. We watched firework every night. That was awesome. If you need self-service laundry, they only have that on 3rd and 6th floor. That is why I recommended 6th floor. So you don't need to carry heavy bag of laundry to other floors. The hotel lobby is small and forget about swimming pool (tiny). Staffs were friendly. When we checked out, I got problem with the bills. The staff was helpfull to resolve the problem. We have stayed in other Hilton Garden Inn before. I think this hotel room is a bit smaller than others and the paint is kind of dated. In conclusion, for the price I paid it was a pretty good stay. Don't forget to visit Village Inn for breakfast.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from our third stay at the HGI Seaworld and this trip just as good as thr previous. Prior to arriving we had phoned to confirm our booking and request two adjacent rooms over looking Seaworld so that we would be able to see the fireworks at night. Upon check-in we were delighted that our request had been granted with an excellent view from the 5th floor. This visit the price we paid was the same as last year but had the added bonus of including breakfast which saved us $50 per day (or $700 for the two week stay). The staff were fantastic, as ever and we were greated and treated with warmth. All of the breakfast staff remembered us from last year. The evening waitresses were fantastic with my young daughter. The food was great and reasonably priced. Mike Flatta, the General Manager was great and made the effort to talk to most guests but was genuinely nice as well. Rooms were clean. We had poblem with a blocked toilet that was dealt with promptly and efficiently. My only criticism would be that when the hotel is running at full occupancy, the restaurant can get a bit hectic at breakfast. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend the hotel to everyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I will definitely stay here again! I booked this room 8 months in advance and for 4 people we got a room with breakfast included for $115 a night! The breakfast was phenomenal - Quiche, eggs made to order, potatos, pancakes, fruit, bisquits and gravy, cereals, donuts, belgian waffles with any type of toppings and so much more. The food was excellent quality and the service matched. The waiters/waitresses were very friendly and provided great service. While the hotel was booked for the night, we never heard a peep from anyone in nearby rooms or in the halls. It was very quiet. In addition they provided free 'Quick Queue' passes for the rides at SeaWorld which we used in addition to free sky tower passes and the Flamingo paddle boats. I was so mad we tried to eat a meal at SeaWorld before heading back to the hotel and spent $60 on crappy food, where we likely would have had a much better meal here. They had a shuttle to SeaWorld, but you might as well walk. They only made one other stop on the way there, but this hotel is 1 small block away from the end of the SeaWorld parking lot. This also saved us $15/day of SeaWorld parking, a plus. All in all, I wouldn't look anywhere else next time I visit Orlando, I will book here.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel on the Hilton Honors website for 6 nights beginning July 4. Room size and accomodations were fine for the four of us. TV did not work when we checked in. We reported this to the front desk on our way out to eat and it was fixed by the time we returned. At night we had a great view of the Disney fireworks from our room. My concerns are with the housekeeping staff. The decorative pillows on the bed were stained, the bed spreads had hairs on them and the sheets which were suppposed to be changed every three days were never changed during our stay. There were four towels (with one really long blonde hair) and washcloths left the first day, four towels and one washcloth left the second day, four towels and three washcloths the third day and four towels and two washcloths left on the fourth day. We started a guessing game of how many washcloths would be left each day. One towel looked filthy when it was unfolded. The room was never vacuumed (a tiny piece of paper stayed on the floor the entire length of our stay). Three years ago we stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Universal and enjoyed our stay. Would have stayed there again but they did not have any non-smoking rooms available. I don't think I'll stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The good: Clean room with mini fridge and microwave. Free parking and wireless internet. Short drive to Disney World. You can see Sea World from the hotel - we didn't go to this park so I don't know if walking to Sea World is an option. Pillows of different thicknesses - doesn't seem like a big thing, but my wife likes thick pillows and I prefer thin. Also, no resort fees like a lot of the hotels in the area. Price is very reasonable based on room quality and breakfast value. For an extra $5 per adult, you get a full breakfast (lots of selection - made to order eggs, selection of fruit, make-your-own-waffles, bacon, sausage, french toast) - plus kids under 12 eat free. Breakfast was great and a good time and money-saver. Hotel has a mini-store with cold beer, other drinks, snacks, and toiletries. All of the staff is very courteous and gracious. Patricia - front desk staff from Haiti was a delight. Very kind. Gave my daughter a stuffed animal. The bad: The hotel advertises a heated pool. We tried using the pool, but the water was too cold and the hot tub was too hot, so we chose to leave the hotel a couple of days early and move to another hotel with an indoor pool (Ramada Maingate West). Hotel restaurant only available for breakfast and dinner.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We take mini trips frequently and this time we decided to stay at the Hilton Garden Inn in Orlando. It was probably the nicest hotel we have stayed in in the last few years and at a really reasonable price for Orlando. It provided free, timely shuttle service to all of the local attractions; Disney. Sea World, etc. It was exceptionally clean and the staff, from the front desk to the service people we friendly and made the stay a pleasure. Everybody went out of their way to give you great service. As an extra at night (if you have a room that faces Sea World) you get a free 20 minute 4th of July like fireworks show display during the summer months (don't know about winter). Sea World is less than a 1/4 mile away. Pool was large and kept up well. Walking distance to a CVS. Restaurant in the hotel and many close about a mile or two away. When trying to use the ration scale below if you hit excellent all of the dots blacken in from terrible to excellent. I assure you all of my ratings would be excellent except the kids activities which I am not sure about. So, if you see all dots blackened it should read excellent in all categories. No terrible experiences in this hotel. All in all this will be our first choice hotel in the Orlando area. We will stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Mr. Fatta, I wanted to take a minute to thank you for a PERFECT weekend at your hotel. I wanted to recognize Thiago Sobral for a grand-slam experience delivered to my newlywed wife and I. My wife and I were so surprised and pleased with the setup that you all arranged upon our arrival.

I am so grateful for the experience that these two gave us as I had no way to do it without their super kind efforts, creativity, and exceptional "Make it Happen" attitude.

The brand I most often frequent is the Ritz-Carlton. I even carry the Lionhead on my keychain. I only mention this to emphasize that despite the exceptional 5 diamond service that I have become accustomed to Thiago, and Chris are as good as any that I have encountered in over 10 countries, and our stay at your property could have been confused for a 5 diamond experience because that is what we got. Clearly upper management needs to be aware of the exceptional experience that these two created and then ensured that we had. With sincerest regards, JW</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed here with my family 3 times now in the past several years. This hotel is very clean, bright, comfortable, and convenient to SeaWorld/Aquatica/Discovery Cove. The rooms are basic, but have everything we need, including mini-fridge, microwave, small coffee maker. It has a small restaurant and a separate bar area, a pool, free parking (other nearby hotels charge daily parking fees), free internet, and you can buy tickets to any of the theme parks (incl. Disney, Universal, SeaWorld, etc.... in the lobby), which is way more convenient than doing it at the parks. The front desk usually has cookies for guests, as well as a free, quick coffee area so you don't have to go to the restaurant just for that. The room rates are fantastic considering the amenities. This hotel is also close to all the restaurants and smaller attractions (like museums & mini-golf) on International Drive. It's not walkable, but is a 5 minute drive. You can, however, walk to SeaWorld easily from here. Then from SeaWorld, take the park's free shuttle to Discovery Cove and/or Aquatica. If those parks are what you are there for, you will not have to drive at all if you don't want to. The hotel may have a free shuttle, we've just always walked, so I don't know. This will be our first choice for any return trips to Orlando. Highly recommend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I stayed at the Hilton Garden SeaWorld for three nights. As advertised, it is very close to SeaWorld. You can walk to SeaWorld if you want to, but with the temperatures in the high 90's and the threat of afternoon thunderstorms, we decided to drive to SeaWorld. However, the hotel's close location made it easy to go back and forth from SeaWorld to the hotel to take a break from the crowds and the heat. The room was typical Hilton Garden and was OK. The front desk staff were very nice and the restaurant staff were nice as well, although sometimes there did not seem to be enough staff in the restaurant. The hotel was very crowded, as would be expected. My one complaint which is not entirely the hotel's fault was the noise levels in the rooms. We could hear the family (and baby) next to us, and we could hear families coming and going down the hallways. We were awakened one morning before 7:00 AM by a family yelling to each other down the hall and talking on their cell phones. Maybe they could sound-proof the rooms more. As others have written, there are no other restaurants within walking distance; however, there were several within a mile of the hotel on International Avenue. Overall, I'd consider staying at this hotel again if I were going to SeaWorld. If I had to give it a grade I'd give it a B or a B+.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel for a 5 day stay. We were there towards the end of May. The lobby is open and feels so clean, they have a fish tank with salt water fish, an attraction/tourist desk where you can get information on the amusements around Orlando like SeaWorld or Disney World. They have a great breakfast spot, it's next to the lobby and breakfast is open from 6:30 to 11:00 AM. The breakfast is the best we've ever had at any hotel! They have waffles, which are amazing! There is sausage, bacon, eggs, pancakes, mashed potatoes, biscuits, bagels, so much fruit, cereals, donuts, and so much more! The wait-staff during breakfast is the same people every day and they are so nice! We had a King suite, there was a nice sized bathroom, which was very clean, a kitchen area that includes a microwave, mini fridge and coffee pot, the room has a flat screen TV and a desk. The bed is comfy but I found the pillows to be too poofy and too hard. The view we had was the SeaWorld parking lot/SeaWorld. The pool area is great, it provides you with a nice sized pool, great layout chairs, fresh towels, and music along with fountain jets in the pool that make a trickling water effect, the pool area is very relaxing. We had dinner there twice and it was room service style. The food is so good! One night we even had a brick oven pizza! We had a great stay and are looking forward to staying here again! Immaculate Hilton Garden Inn!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at the hotel and immediately things did not go well. They managed to mess up the reservations we had made online and thus had confirmation for (we had a reserved a king bed and they gave us two doubles)... ridiculous, but understandable that accidents happen. The desk clerk claimed the hotel was full and that only a few rooms were available, which would have been believable if the hotel parking lot wasn't more than half empty. Our only request was to not have a room by the elevator as the individual I was traveling with is a very light sleeper, the clerk assured us the room was far from the elevator. Upon exiting the elevator, there was the room... not just close to the elevator, but the CLOSEST room to the elevators. Upon returning to the desk to swap rooms, the clerk was very rude and unhelpful. We had to swap to the smoking floor to get a decent room, which was not preferable and definitely took away from the experience. The rooms are moderate at best... I've paid a lot less for a lot more (for instance one day prior staying at a Hyatt, the room had a mini kitchen, full sitting area with couch and 42" plasma HD TV). The AC was on high and extremely cold with the knobs broken off, making life in the room very unpleasant. Also, the drawer in the desk was installed upside down, rendering it useless. On the plus side, the restaurant inside the hotel was very good, the restaurant staff was extremely pleasant, and the manager of the restaurant was extremely polite and attentive.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn Orlando for three nights the last week of June for our mini-vacation to SeaWorld with our 4 year old daughter. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a very warm welcome by Patricia at the front desk. She was so lovely and extremely helpful the entire time, as were all of the other staff we encountered there! Honestly, I've never stayed in a hotel where each and every person who worked there was friendly, helpful and eager to take care of you. I am not exaggerating. We specifically chose this hotel because of its proximity to SeaWorld which was great (walking distance out the back, 5 minutes) and it was a suite room. The room was clean and comfortable and the King bed in the bedroom was superb! The only minor complaint which I really should have mentioned at the hotel, but totally forgot was the sofabed. Now, to be fair, sofabeds aren't great from the get-go but the sofabed mattress in the room we stayed in should probably be replaced. In any case, that is the only complaint I had. The food -- it was really good! And the staff in the restaurant top notch. We got a package with free breakfast and it was excellent. So many choices, you could even make your own waffles, which our little girl got a kick out of. Dinner was excellent too and again, the waitstaff so accommodating and friendly. I'm sorry, I really wish I could remember everyone's names because they were all wonderful. Truly, I cannot say enough good things about the place. We'll be back next year to go to SeaWorld again and Discovery Cove.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First of all I saw my first negative review of this property and I must say this hotel has the least negative reviews I have read in Orlando. True if I want to stay at a hotel with a $300 room rate it should have none at all. Here is the truth about this hotel. It has perfect parking and the fasted elevators I have ever used. The room has a great LCD TV and the microwave and Refridgerator are useful. The bed is comfortable and the noise level is perfect. The internet is up to Hilton standards and the GM, front desk folks, bartender, and very pretty slender dark haired server is very nice as well as all the restaurant folks. The food was very nice and had a great selection to choose from. The only complaint I have is the phone has some static and one needed a little adjusting to make it work. Not a big deal. The pool is very nice and has a very nice feel to it with the bar steps away. Now if you want noisy lobbies, lots of activity with tourists, difficult parking, and lots of traffic to deal with than there are lot's of those hotels to choose from. Also when a hotel is running 100% percent occupancy it will have some issues but even this hotel when it was full was running smooth. It was my 2nd stay by the way and they put me in the same room. A corner on the 7th floor... Get your room type confirmed before you get there. Book on the Hilton website and request what you want. Join the Hilton Honors club and I will assure you you will not have any major problems. And if you do the GM Michael will go out of his way to make things right. He is a true professional.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything about the reservation process went smoothly. I booked directly from the hotel a few months in advance, and everyone I spoke with from my first phone call to the last one before we checked in was friendly and helpful. I am employed by a company that partners with Hilton, and recieved a discounted rate, but from our stay, I would have paid any price for the room and service. Check-in was smooth. Our room was on the 6th floor and was very nice, we could see the roller coasters at SeaWorld. It was unusually cold during our stay, but the days it was warm the air conditioner worked promptly and effectively (which, during the summer anyone would be thankful for)! My husband and I are private people, so we kept the Do Not Disturb sign on the door most of the time. One morning we took the sign off the door at 11:00 and went to lunch, when we got back at 12:00 our room was cleaned and nothing of our personal effects had been touched. We did have one problem where our remote had gone missing after housekeeping had been there. When we called the front desk they had on sent up to us within 5 minutes. The location of this hotel COULD NOT BE BETTER! It was right off of International Drive, but far enough away that you couldn't hear the noise of the traffic. We bought seven day passes for Universal Studios, and the hotel staff told us a really quick back way to get there. We had a wonderful trip as a couple, and I am certain any family would have a wonderful stay at this hotel. the next time we return to Orlando, this is where we will be staying, no doubt about it!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice hotel, walking distance to Sea World *BUT*...”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this Hilton for two nights for the sole purpose of going to Seaworld. The hotel was very close to Seaworld and many reviewers stated that they walked there, so we were planning on doing that, and were glad to save the $10 dailly Seaworld parking fee. Hilton also offered a free shuttle daily to and from Seaworld. However... the hotel IS within walking distance to Seaworld, but the walk is not user-friendly. There are no sidewalk areas. We had to cross over and walk in along the side of a busy road and through the Seaworld parking lot. We did use the shuttle to get there the next day, but the return shuttles were very limited, and only come back at 5 and 7 pm (although Seaworld closes at 10 pm in the summer months because of nighttime shows/fireworks). So we found ourselves walking back to the hotel, at night, in the dark, through service areas/back parking lots of another nearby hotel, through dark parking lots and roads. It was very unnerving. The hotel should consider adding a later shuttle during the summer months to accommodate people who are going to Seaworld and staying for the summer night shows. If there were lit accesses/sidewalks, it would be different. The room was very nice and the beds were comfortable. The pool area was great, and the in-hotel restaurant had a breakfast buffet daily (although it is $12 per person.) The staff were very nice and very helpful. We would definitely stay here again, but would choose to pay and park at Seaworld instead of walking. I would review this hotel highly but encourage families with kids not to necessarily count on walking to Seaworld.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Best Hotel to go Sea World”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of 4 (our kids are 8 and 11 years old) went to Orlando to visit Sea World. We had a bedroom suite with 2 double beds in one room and a large living room. Each room had its own TV and you could close the door between the rooms. The breakfast was not included in our room rate but it was very good and well worth the price. Upon our arrival in the afternoon we went to the well equipped business center and bought our Sea World tickets online. If you buy your tickets at Sea Worlds website you get a second day for free and adult tickets cost just as much as child tickets (as of July 2011) Afterwards we got our free Quick Queue passes at the Expedia Travel Desk in the lobby and walked to Sea World for the evening. Quick-Queue (normally $29.99/person/day) is great if you want to go on the rides. Very few people had a pass so we got on the rides with almost no waiting time. (And over and over again) The pass also includes one complimentary ride on Paddle Boats and Skytower (another saving of ca. $10/person/day) As the Quick-Queue passes are for one day only we had to go to the Travel Desk in the lobby early next morning to get new passes. Sea World is very close. It takes only 5 minutes to get to their parking lot and then another 5 - 10 minutes to get to the front gate. It is great to be so close. We returned to our room in the afternoon to rest and went to the pool as well. We had early dinner at the hotel restaurant and went back to Sea World in the evening. With Quick-Queue passes for 2 days we had additional free benefits of over $280 for the 4 of us which makes this Hotel the best stay for Sea World.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed at the HGI in early May for 2 nights. I got a great deal through Priceline and was happy to learn that i was staying at this hotel. Rooms are very comfortable, the king bed is so big. It also has a desk, free wi-fi and wired internet, an ergonomic work chair, 25 inch TV, air conditioning, closet, iron and ironing board, microwave, minifridge, coffee maker, full equipped bathroom and Neutrogena amenities. It has no safety deposit box. Parking is free. Pool is nice and has a hot tub and fitness center. Free coffee and oatmeal cookies in the lobby each day. Shuttle to the parks and airport. A business center with printer and airline check-in kiosk is available free of charge. After i learned about my reservation, i contacted the hotel directly and asked for Nour, who gently and kindly assigned me the type of room i wanted. The hotel is in a very quiet area. It is in the corner of Central Florida Parkway and Westwood Boulevard, off I-4, very close to the Premium Outlets and Sea World is just behind it. Check in was a breeze, early check-in is possible depending on availability as well as late check out. I was able to get late check out until 1pm. Steven in the front desk was very helpful with directions, recommendations and more. On the check in moment, they give you a coupon for 2 bottles of water in their pantry and a 2x1 drink coupon in the hotel´s bar per stay. Breakfast was good, has sausages, eggs, biscuits, muffins, cereal juices, bread, yogurt, etc. It is a $10 buffet. All in all i had a pleseant stay. I would definitely recommend it to everyone and will be looking forward to go back again on my next visit to Orlando.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was my gf and mine's first trip to Orlando. We didn't know anything about the layout of the city or it's attractions. Luckily for us this hotel was conveniently located near everything we wanted to do. It's walking distance to SeaWorld, roughly 10-15 mins driving to two premium outlets (the ladies will love it), about 10 mins driving to Universal Studios, and about 20 mins to Disney World. The staff were very friendly, we asked a bunch of questions and they were very knowledgable and informative. We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and the staff there was more than accomodating. The food was excellent, though we only had (1) breakfast meal there. Their's also an expedia representative in the lobby to assist w/ attraction pacakages to the various tourist spots. Their's also a pool if you wanna just hang out and get a tan (provided mother nature is kind). Check-in and out was very easy and trouble free. Free parking and wi-fi came in extremely handy! The AC was awesome...we set it to high when we left and by the time we came back the room was super cold which helped to offset the hot weather during the day. The only knack i would have against this place...and it may be very crude so continue reading at your own discretion...is that the toilet's are not superb. You must hold down the handle for a complete flush. Maybe it's an energy cost savings thing, who knows. And there are no fans either...say WHAAAAAT?!! LOL, i'm sorry if it grosses any readers out there but i believe these two things to be very important on a vacation. But other than this over-sight (which i'm not sure how much everyone values washroom viability) our stay was excellent!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very Disappointing!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family stayed here for about a week for vacation at the parks nearby and to visit some family members who live in the Orlando area. Our check-in took two seconds, extremely impersonal...never used our name, never acknowledged our needs that were clearly in our reservation. Our room was horrible. Upon entering, one bed was shorter than the other height-wise. Throughout our stay the shorter bed was losing stuffing from somewhere, never did find the source. The other bed was just broken. I went to search under the bed to find a shoe and there was broken wood and little nails coming down. We had to ask for our rollaway that was in the reservation. We had to request extra towels, other than the for provided for our family of 5...everyday! Nobody ever caught on to that basic need. Also in the reservation. Due to our tight schedule we did not have the time to sit around our room waiting for all of this. The pool was nice and well maintained and the breakfast staff, in particular Juan was very accommodating. He always remembered our family. Another special person was our bus driver to Seaworld this past Monday morning...extremely friendly. Other than that, any staff we encountered put their head down or just ignored my family's presence. If you want a place to stay anonymous and are not too particular about your room needing some TLC, this is the place for you. If you are not looking for "service" you'll be good here. The location is good and the shuttle service to the parks is fine. There is a CVS which is right across and convenient. The saying you never get a second chance to make a first impression is so true. We had a more memorable stay at the Hampton Inn in NC...and we were only there 8 hours!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I recently visited Orlando for the first time in about 20 yrs for a bday trip, to visit Disney and Seaworld. We checked in about 5 pm on a thurs, a short 12 min or so cab ride ($37 bucks) and we were at the Hilton Garden Inn. Very clean, well air conditioned, CLEAN NEW hotel w/pool bar, and restaurant all there. I loved the aqaurium too, i found a dog fish in there that looked, well, like my dog i had to leave at home, so i made sure to say hello to this cute fish everyday!. The supervisor, James, at HiltonGarden Inn was an awesome guy. Very polite and cool to talk to, served us delicious drinks at the bar. I chose this hotel because of the free shuttle to disney (VERY VERY cost efficient because its FREE) and its literally walking distance to Seaworld, or you can also take a free shuttle just down the block. They pick u up at a bench right in front of the hotel pool. So helpful! Our room was on the 4th floor, Room 434, nice view of pool and palm trees so i could look down and check to make sure hot tub wasnt busy (oh yeah did i mention that previously? awsome hot tub for those sore feet from walking at disney all day!) . Our bed was SO COMFY, very nice sheets, room was simple but very nice. Free WIRELESS internet! yay! we also enjoyed room service for an early dinner. This place was the best. and we got a great deal ( on expedia.com) . Anyone staying in Orlando, looking for quality and comfort with a good deal and close to free shuttleand ofcourse Seaworld and Disney, you must stay here its better then any hotel in the area. for what you pay and how much free you get, you cant go wrong staying here. :) Its also a short ,13 dollar cab ride to International Drive, hotspot for shopping, amazing bars, nightclubs, and delicious places to eat !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have heard other reviewers say this but some of Hilton's best properties are NOT the on the highest end of their price scale..in fact I have come to love Hilton Garden Inn more than most full-service Hiltons! I moved to this hotel after staying at the Hilton Downtown Disney for one evening...originally had been moved to a nearby Hampton Inn that didn't work out so well. They welcomed me here for 4 nights and I was extremely impressed. From the moment I checked in with Brian, things were terrific. The room was large, with extremely comfortable beds, flat screen tv, fridge, microwave, and GREAT desk. Very strong wifi, and great AC. I am a Hilton Honrs Gold member so they included the breakfast buffet for me each day which was awesome. Heated pool and jacuzzi were excellent, and the hotel has on-site laundry, a 24 hour convenience area off the front desk with snacks and sundries, and a 24 hour CVS and 7-Eleven across the street. It is also within true walking distance to the Sea World entrance, even though it has free shuttles running. Parking at the hotel was free and I had no problems getting a spot. Lobby is nice with a great bar, and they have the nightly tradition of cookies at the front desk which was great! They also use some Neutrogena soap products in the room which were great! Note: the one thing I had to work around was the lack of safe in the room (I carry multiple computers), but the front desk had HUGE safe deposit boxes available and I stored my computers there when away and it worked out really well. I will definitely be back here...the value and the service offering are among the best I have found here. Disney's Magic Kingdom took me about 15 mins to drive to on I-4...but i was so easy with I-4 right outside the hotel (no lights once on I-4). Thanks to everyone working here for a great stay!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our fourth stay at the HGI Seaworld and once again we were delighted.We stayed for 21 nights in August. The room was spotless and we were given the seaworld view we had requested when we booked which meant we could see the fireworks each night from our window. The staff at this hotel are absolutely the friendliest we have encountered anywhere. Many of them recognised from our previous stays which was really nice. William, Jose and Pillar made breakfast enjoyable every morning - even when the hotel was at full capacity and the restaurant was really busy they made time to make us feel special. Christy was also great in the restaurant and bar in the evenings - nothing was too much trouble. Special mention to Mike and Gary for looking after us so well on our wedding anniversary -. Coming back to our room in the evening after a long, hot day at the parks to find a bottle of bubbly on ice and some cold beers waiting was an unexpected delight and truly appreciated. I think it is a testament to the way the hotel is run that so many of the team have worked there so long. There is a real family atmosphere amongst the staff and they really do go out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as they can. With the combined cost of flights and theme park tickets getting more expensive every year, we have to certain that we are going to have a clean, comfortable and enjoyable stay when we come to Florida. We can always rely on the Hilton Garden Inn at Seaworld to come up trumps every time. The hotel is not only great in every way but also exceptional value for money. With breakfast included in our room rate and the the complimentary Quick queue passes for Seaworld this hotel has got to be one of the best options for anyone looking for a central base in the Orlando area. We would recommend this hotel to anyone without hesitation.</p></li>
