<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel was nice, rooms clean and spacious, but a bit noisy. It is also a bit deserted. Checkin was a bit lengthy and prices of minibar a scandal. 4 EUR for a kit kat or bottl of water. We were served a buffet lunch (convention), which was really really boring. Even Wifi crazy - a mere 27 EUR/24 hours</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Got a great price via Hotwire, and knew what I was getting beforehand - this is the only 5-star hotel listed in the sub-area on Hotwire. Great location, good service, comfortable, modern rooms. Not much of a view, but you can make out just a hint of the sea. If you have a high room facing the sea, probably get a much better view.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We LOVED this hotel! I will say that our experience is as a 'gold member' of the Hilton Honors levels, so we were able to stay on the executive lounge level. That level includes breakfast, lunch, tea service, pre-dinner drinks/snacks and after-dinner service. The rooms were large and had views of the water from the top floors. We were there off-season, so the pool area was closed - but it would be perfect in the summer. Walking distance to the beach and metro stations.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here In May for four days. The staff was really nice and efficient (even though most of were trainees), the room was beautiful with an awesome view to the sea. We had a plasma tv, the breakfast buffet was huge and the staff really friendly. The only thing I could say as negative is the location, since it's a bit away from the center of the city. But that's not too bad actually. There's a shopping center across the street, and they offer a lot of different restaurants to choose from. It was a great stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We certainly made a good choice. Room was ready when we arrived around noon, which is always a plus after a long flight. Although it may not be "downtown", excellent location. Just hop on the underground and go wherever you want. It's easy to use and you don't have to speak Spainish/Catalan. Great shopping close by, an excellent Tapa bar next door to the hotel that is reasonable for brekkie or whenever. We could leave our luggage when checked out, until we were ready to collect it later in the day. Helpful staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location! The subway is very close. The hotel has a beautiful view overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. We were on the concierge floor and only had to eat lunch outside the hotel. Nice breakfast and refreshments at night at the hotel. The rooms are big and the beds comfortable. The only thing I had to ask for were washcloths. The staff was very accommodating. I kept watching the price online, and close to the time we were leaving they offered a B&B rate which was much lower than their pay in advance non-refundable rate.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have been to Barcelona 10+ times (mainly for work) & I don't even like staying at this hotel for work. If room quality is all you care about then it is a good pick (Hilton Barcelona has much smaller rooms - although closer to town & yes near another large mall) -- If you like chains I would recommend the Sofitel first (near everything you want to see) or even the W (which is on the port a little past town) --- Barcelona is full of great boutique hotels too, so this is definitely a place to consider expanding your horizons past the Hilton.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our room overlooked the sea, and was extremely comfortable. The breakfast is one of the best we have ever had, from the fabulous fresh orange juice to top notch ham and bacon to excellent baked goods. It's outside the tourist center, the better for sleeping! The metro is a quarter-mile walk at most, and got us everywhere fast. A bus to Plaza Catalan is right outside the hotel's front door, but slower than the metro. Our stay was during Holy Week, so there were no business conventions going on and we got a great deal on a rate including breakfast.</p></li>

We had an amazing suite with an incredible view of the city. The staff was fantastic in providing ideas for our brief stay in Barcelona and the hotel is a quick cab ride from the port and most major attractions. The outside pool is perfect for families with kids and we would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Barcelona.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As you would expect from an international Hilton, the hotel was in good shape with nice rooms and nice amenities. As I've also come to expect, after you add in parking and internet service and various other charges, expect to pay another $100/day. The hotel itself is located a 5-6k outside of the center of Barcelona, but is across from a decent mall and a short walk to the beach. Not a lot of interesting attractions or restaurants in the area, so I wouldn't recommend it if you're not going to a conference there--which appears to be one of its specialties</p></li>

At 235 euro per room, it's a mediocre attempt to provide luxury, with unfriendly staff, not above average amenities, ok rooms but with no touch of class. And if you are visiting Barcelona you most likely want to see the magnificent sights in the center, this hotel is at least a 30min drive from the center. It's in a non residential new area of the town, near the harbor that after 7pm you rarely see anybody go by. All in all...wouldn't stay there again</p></li>

It was out of the main centre of Barcelona but the subway was close by. It suited us as it was in a quieter area but close to the hustle and bustle if you wnated it. Near by was an amazing shopping centre - like England's main shopping centres. Restaurants near by were also fab. It has a swimming pool and it is very close to the beach so also ideal if you want to relax too. I would go back and stay at the hilton again. xxxxx</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Really enjoyed this hotel. We are long standing Hilton Honors members and have been to Hiltons all over the world. We really enjoyed our stay here. Rooms were clean and spacious(especially for Europe). Hilton executive level on the 15th floor - one of the best that I have ever been to. Staff at the hotel are very friendly and helpful. Hotel is not in the heart of the city, but i think, i enjoyed that better. Subway is amazingly clean and close, not a big deal to get around. Restaurants across the street were good. Shopping center across the way was interesting and nice to see.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and 4 friends stayed for 4 nights. The service held the same level all the way. From the friendly staff at the restaurant to the spotless cleaningladies. The rooms were good. Beds were good. The isolation of the walls must been something extra, because we did not here anyone else, although the hotel was full booked at that time. The breakfast was good, something for everyone. The weather did not allow us to try the pool. The shopping Mall across the street had all supplies we needed. You can allways find a taxi outside of the hotell. I cant find any negative to say about this hotel. I totally recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This very new hotel is located on the opposite side of town compared to its sister hotel the Hilton, only a block away from the seaside. There are public buses right outside, and a subway station underneath the very large shopping mall across the street, which is also home to many reasonably priced eateries. The hotel is an impressive, airy structure that lets in plenty of light. The rooms are spacious, upscale, obviously very modern, very quiet, with very large bathrooms. Service was very polished throughout. I strongly recommend this hotel unless being within walking distance of central Barcelona is a priority.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Hilton with my family. The only problem we had was that we booked two adjoining rooms but we were given two separate ones on the same floor because the hotel was booked. We stay on one of the concierge floors which gives you access to the concierge lounge. The lounge offers complementary traditional spanish breakfast in the morning and snacks throughout the day. Also bottled water, soda, and Spanish beers were complementary. The lounge has a large patio which has a gorgeous view of Barcelona. The rooms were very clean; the hotel seemed very new. The pool was clean and modern and I believe there may have been a lifeguard.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 nights prior to a cruise out of Barcelona. It is outside of the city but is near the Beach and a modern shopping mall across the street. Above and beyond public transport that is near the hotel, in the summer the open top hop-on-hop-off tourist bus that is popular in most cities has a stop nearby, so access to the city is easy. Its a modern, clean hotel and we got, connecting rooms with a view of the ocean at a great rate with a real breakfast. For a European hotel given the prices and room sizes that you often see, we could not have asked for more. Staff was great too, one of whom gave us a great tip for dinner at a small local restaurant.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is lovely, bright rooms and the pool area is fantastic. Across the road is a big shopping centre with plenty of places to eat and entertain yourselves. The metro is about a 5 to 10 min walk away and the line goes right into town. I can see that this hotel would be perfect for business travellers close to the convention centre, but not the best base for tourists wanting to be in the centre of town. We booked this as a mystery deal on Expedia with the the area being central Barcelona which I wouldn't exactly agree with. The parking was also for corporate rates at 32 euros per day I believe. There were limited free parking options close to 10mins walking distance away.</p></li>

The hotel staff were freindly and helpful. Breakfast was a variey of food from cold cereal to bacon and eggs. Rooms a large and very clean. Internet servces for a fee(did not use) The only dissapointment I had with the hotel is they do not offer transportation to and from the airport. Any other Hilton I have stayed they have a had a stuttle bus to get you to the airport. Overall I would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very helpful staff...they give everyone individual attention, which frustrates some who don't like to wait, but worth it! Can walk to the beach a couple blocks away, or easily scoot to the sites via the subway or other public tranportation. Large mall is directly across the street with good shopping and food options after a long day of sightseeing. Since we were there in early September when it's still quite warm, we also found the pool area a great way to enjoy a midday break. Only real complaint was the charge for the wi-fi access (12 Euros for 60 minutes, 25 Euros for 24 hours). This was by far the highest priced internet access we experienced on our trip, including Italy and France.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I guess I've been spoilt in Asia. Hotel staff in Asia are generally very courteous, proactive, helpful and always with a smile. Hilton Diagonal Mar staff often look busy, not smiley but will do the task if you ask them. We stay at the club floor where the club lounge has no free wifi (shocking), there's no turn down service each night. Club lounge is packed at most times with loud Americans - 3 nights in a row (different groups) want the whole world to know their life story. Great location if you love outdoors and shopping. Jog at the beach which goes a long way. Opposite the hotel is a shopping mall. To come back here again? Maybe not. Will choose somewhere closer to the city next time!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I thought: "Can't go wrong with the Hilton, in particular when it's at the beach". Well, it was not quite at the beach (Barcelona decided to build their highway right on the beach), needed to cross the highway to get to the sand. But, it was a great hotel. Good breakfast buffet, large room, modern interior, very friendly and international staff. I felt really comfortable in the room. The metro is about a 5 minute walk (crossing through the shopping mall across the street). Felt safe. Shopping mall had a Starbucks and Ben&Jerry's stand, various different style restaurants and shops. The metro takes about 8 stops to the centre (old town). All in all, it was a pleasurable stay at the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here on the 2nd leg of our honeymoon/vacation to Spain. The reception at check-in was lukewarm. The room was ok. There was mold on the shower head and water damage in the bathroom. The back on the remote control was broke and was taped on with dirty tape. I cleaned it with a handy-wipe and wrapped a hair band around it to keep the back on. We had loud neighbors and could hear all of their conversations when they came back from a late night of partying. The upside of the hotel was the location, directly across from a mall. The downside to the location is it is far away from all of the attractions from Barcelona. I would probably look for another hotel if I ever return to Barcelona.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel to sightsee after finishing a cruise. Although it is not in the typical tourist area, we found it very convenient. It is two blocks from the subway and 1 block to the stops for the hop on-hop off tours. We were able to purchase discount packages to one of these tours at the hotel which did save us money. It is across from a nice mall with a great grocery, handy for water & snacks. Our room was gorgeous with beautiful city views (the water views on the other side are amazing). The executive floor was well worth it as they had newspapers, delicious breakfasts, and and tapas and drinks overlooking the Mediterranean sea. Staff was helpful with directions and advice. We loved this property!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed a night at the Diagonal Mar Hilton before sailing out on a cruise from Barcelona - it was suggested by friends who always use Hilton hotels, and what can I say - I might be a convert. Reception was friendly and helpful - and instantly bi-lingual, without us having to use our poor pigeon spanish to be understood. The room was comfortable and well equipped, we had a great night's sleep, and the shower was lovely and powerful - something that I have had mixed luck with in tall hotels. We ate breakfast and generally relaxed in the premium lounge, which was available for an 80 Euro supplement - sounds like a lot as a supplement, but it's hard to stress just how nice the place was. I suspect we got our money's worth!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Diagonal Mar in September. Very friendly staff, clean and comfortable room. We ate in the main restaurant on our first night due to late arrival and although staff were friendly and the food was fine, I wouldn't recommend it as it was standard hotel buffet style and very little atmosphere. The hotel is some way out of town but cabs are easy to find as its on a main road. The Barcelona tourist bus also stops 200m down the road from the hotel. The main reason I chose this hotel over others was the pool. The pool area is nice with huge sun plaza and nice pool bar/cafe. The pool itself is pretty small but there were very few people about so we had it to ourselves most of the time. Would definitely recommend this hotel for a short break.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel staff was great at this hotel, and it's about 2 city blocks away from the train station. However, the rooms were definitely in need of a paint job and slight touch ups. For the price though, I really can't complain. Note though that if you are looking to be next to the Gothic area or downtown, this is not the place to stay. The other Hilton Barcelona is closer to downtown. Overall, it's a good and inexpensive hotel to stay in for the reasonable price. Gym: has it's basics but nothing fancy Restaurants near by: there are a few within 1 block of the hotel. There's also a mall next door that has a food court if you're into that Grocery store: at the bottom of the mall; great if you need to drop in for snacks or want to see what the locals eat!</p></li>

Hotel management was always present , including the General Manager, to greet guests to ask whether anything was needed. We really felt at home! The rooms were comfortable, clean and freshly appointed. All amenities, such as hairdryer, coffee service, iron were available. Ice machines were on every floor and readily available.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel's physical plant and service deserve a very good rating although the property is somewhat without charm and is not located for tourism. However, the "extras" and hotel charges were so obscene that a "poor" rating was obligatory. Internet is EUR 27 per DAY ($38.50). A local draft beer in the lobby bar is EUR 9.50 ($13.50). Small water from the minibar is EUR4.10 ($5.84). I was charged over EUR 19 ($27) to send a THREE page fax to California. Any computer access in the business center involved paying not only for time on the PC's but also per page printed. A typical "open a five page doc, print it, ask for a scan" was in the region of EUR 20 ($28.50). To be fair the staff were embarrassed and sheepishly asked me to "take it up with management as it is indeed too expensive."</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed there with our five year old son. We booked an executive room through booking.com, which gave us access to the executive lounge, which had lots of great snacks and drinks and a terrific 15th floor terrace and was well worth the added price. The hotel was immaculate. The staff were terrific. The breakfast is excellent, with a huge variety of foods. The pool was on the second floor, with a beautiful patio area. There is a shopping center next door with lots of food options, including a mcdonald's which our 5-year-old appreciated. The beach is a 5 minute walk away. We loved it. There is no question that I would stay there again. The internet is overpriced. Walk across the street to the diagonal mar shopping center. Any purchase, even a coffee, gets you a free 30 minute wifi card.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have been to Barcelona a dozen times, and have stayed in most of the top-end hotels. This is possibly the best, as long as you don't mind the location, far away from the Gothic Quarter and most tourist sights. Stayed 5 nights in a jr. suite. Spacious, great views over both the city and the sea. Extremely comfortable beds, chairs, desks. Good bathrooms with nice toiletries. Good pool, with a nice bar. Small gym, but I prefer running outdoors anyway. The main restaurant offers an outstanding buffet breakfast. Service overall is US-standard, and far superior to standard Spanish hotel service standards. The Executive Lounge on the 15th floor has an amazing terrace; watching the sun rise over the sea was a sight to behold. Also offers complimentary continental breakfast, and some decent tapas in the afternoon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice hotel, very near the beach (ten mins) Hilton breakfast, as always delicious and lots of choice. Rooms were spacious and clean. The pool is very nice, although 2 bottle of beer 18 Euros! What a rip off! The bars everywhere were quite expensive, but of course the rubbish euro rate at the moment. There is a shopping centre opposite. Allot of high street shops but they were about 20% more expensive than London! So don’t bother with shopping. Not while we have such a rubbish exchange rate. There are 2 tapas restaurants in the shopping centre, which you can see from the hotel. Very nice and very reasonably priced. The cost of taxis is pretty expensive too so we got the train from the airport which saved as a fortune. Personally we love Barcelona and this Hilton is pretty good too but only if you get a discounted price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">And certainly not at this hotel. Sandwiched between a rather large shopping mall and the sea, this is a Hilton in every way, likely catering to a rather upscale crowd interested in shopping. The rooms are spacious, the bathrooms large (by European standards), equipped with both a bathtub and a separate shower. The environs are indistinguishable from any other modern city, so the classical, folkloric attractions require a taxi ride. The airport is far away, but accessible by motorway/freeway. The hotel is not cheap to begin with. but in addition to the nightly rate, breakfast costs 24 Euros, Internet is 12 Euros for 1 hour, or 27 Euros per day - everywhere in the hotel, including the rooms. My take is, unless you absolutely must have the Hilton experience, there are less expensive places that provide comparable accomodations.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is located on the edge of Barcelona beside a very large modern shopping mall - not what you would travel to Spain for. To get anywhere to see the sites you need to take transportation. The Metro is within walking distance. The hotel seems to have its hands in your pockets for everything you might want. Internet runs up to 27 euros for 24 hours. The breakfast buffet is quite comprehensive but very expensive if not included in your hotel price. The rooms are large and well furnished but our door frame was significantly scratched up as were others on our floors. It looked like there had been some past break-ins or attempts with no effort to fix the damage done. If you are on an expense account and required to stay here then so be it. If you want to see Barcelona and are paying your own way this is NOT the place to be.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent two nights at the Hilton (mix of business and leisure trip). The location of the hotel is a bit out of town but all parts of town are easily accessible via the underground which is very near. As many people mentioned there is a big shopping mall opposite the hotel. Don't go on Saturdays - it is too crowded and noisy. You have a good selection of shops. We got a room with sea view which is nice. Overall the room was ok; not fantastic but good. We had some problems with our TV and bathroom washing basin. Everything was fixed within the hour we called reception. Breakfast was ok. Again not fantastic but you could find a good selection of fruit, bread, etc... Overall a fine hotel. A shame internet/wifi in the rooms is not free of charge... Try not to book directly with the hotel - via booking.com, etc... rates are more interesting. Cheers, Sara</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a new Hilton, at the east end of the Diagonal (there is an older Hilton at the west end). It is near the sea, just in front of the large shopping center "Diagonal Mar" (many restaurants, cinemas etc.). The hotel is a modern tower (23 floors). Well, it is a modern Hilton and everything is expected to be up to the name of the chain. I was particularly lucky to be in a corner room on an executive floor (21st). Since the hotel is at the east end of diagonal and I had the view to the town, I really could overview the whole city, see the Agbar tower, the Sagrada Familia, the Mapfre and Arts towers, the sea etc. Anyway the room was very large, with a large bathroom. Everything perfect. There is underground parking with direct access via elevator to the lobby. There are taxis just in front of the hotel and they take just a few euros for any destination in the town.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a large hotel located just outside Barcelona center although within easy reach to the city center and the beach. The hotel has great facilities and a very nice pool with pool bar and plenty of seats to relax and enjoy the sun. The room was very spacious and the service in the executive lounge was great. The executive lounge has a balcony with great views over the beach and into the city Centre. The room type was not available as requested when we checked in, we took another room with plans to swap rooms later in the evening when we returned after having dinner in town, we returned to find that the room was still not available and was told it would be available the day after, this was most annoying and the staff did not really seem to care which was disappointing when you spend a considerable amount of money to stay at this hotel. Either way I would return and did enjoy the overall stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall this is a great hotel, very spacious, friendly staff and nice and modern. It is not central but only €10 taxi from town so not a big deal. Across the road is a mall and square with several restaruants offering open air eating (Tapas far right is nice). Inside the hotel the rooms are standard affair modern hilton, the hotel is 1 block away from the beach. This is a business hotel rather than a tourist one. They do have a pool which is rarely used. They have parking underground at a cost. Unless you are hiltonhhonors gold you will need to pay for wifi. It is very expensive so if you need that cater €20 or so into the daily costs. bar is nice, table service, decent choice. not cheap but it is a hotel bar ;) Never eaten lunch/dinner there but do eat their breakfasts which are very good. I think it is very well priced. Free wi-fi & a slightly cheaper bar would have given it a 5th star from me. Irrespective of this I do choose to go back.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here in late August 2011 for a 3 night stop before a med cruise. We caught a taxi from the airport to the hotel which cost approx 30 Euros. The hotel is well maintained and the roof top pool is very nice. We found the mall across the street to be a great additon, and there are a selection of restaurants, as well as fast food places there, which was great as we knew we could get food on the doorstep if we wanted it. The breakfast buffet is excellent, with lots of choice. The reception staff were fast and although didnt give the an overwelling welcome- i have no complaints. We did ask the reception staff on two seperte occasions for local information and transport links, and they were VERY helpful (thank you) the Tram is a short walk through the mall and the door staff are very helpful in finding taxis should you need them. Whilst this hotel isnt right in the centre of the city, it's nice and quiet and public transport makes it easy to access Barcelona.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First, the profile pic looks nothing like the hotel. It is not that close to the beach and the beach is not that clean. Secondly, they charge too much for internet. The cheapest daily plan is 22 euros per day. Ridiculous considering other four and five star hotels offer it for free in Barcelona. They are located across the street from a decent mall but no major attractions nearby. You have to take cab or metro to see the sites. The breakfast was good with decent variety. The rooms were clean and spacious. Found it hard to believe they didn't have washclothes but neither did any of the other two hotels I stayed at in Spain. The staff was friendly but they were overworked. I think they worked like 12 hour shifts!! Far too much for such a busy hotel. They did the best they could but that Hilton could/should hire more staff. At the very least, they should hire a concierge (a real one) who knows the city instead of having the bell boys offer city suggestions when needed.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just stayed for 4 nights at the Hilton Diagonal Mar Barcelona. We had a very enjoyable stay there. We booked an executive room and were given a lovely corner room and could not have been happier. The location was very convenient to the Metro and there is a big shopping area across the street with some nice restaurants. The executive lounge was very nice and being Hilton Diamond I can tell you it was one of the better ones. The people were very informative and helpful. One thing I would like to mention. If you book the AAA rate, be sure to bring your card! I only had my card on an iPhone app and it did not show my name........They did accept it though. When we left the hotel it was 6:45 am and there was no bellman on duty and no place to get coffee or breakfast (there is some sort of coffee in the room). Everything opens at 7am. The desk clerk got our taxi and helped us depart. I would definitely stay at this property again..............great views and service</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a great stay at the Hilton! The room was a standard, non-club floor room on the 13th floor. We had a great view that overlooked the Mediterranean Sea and the hotel pool. Our room was spacious and clean, with a large modern bathroom. I really liked the power shower in the bathroom. The hotel itself is modern and clean. The staff is friendly and helpful, and nothing is too much trouble. The Indigo Restaurant serves great food and wine, and has excellent service. The hotel pool and sundeck opened while we were there - we spent some great time out there enjoying the beautiful weather. The food and drinks from the pool bar were expensive but very good. I highly commend the staff of this hotel. The only negative is that the hotel itself is a long distance from Barcelona attractions such as La Rambla, although there is a Metro station very close by. I did like that there was a mall right across the street, for all those little things you might have forgotten. All in all, I would go back in a heartbeat.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There is nothing wrong with the "hardware" of this hotel. The rooms are great, location also, across large shopping mall, near sea, great for families. It is the staff that may spoil your stay. At the desk, while you are helped, they answer questions from newly arrived people, walk away, pick up the phone and talk endlessly, and the seem not interested at all to help you. Simple questions like directions are answered with great reluctance if at all. They do not seem to listen well. I asked for a direction to a village that was 10 min drive away, and they printed me a direction of 165 km, without a correcting response to our remark that it was really a 10 min drive. We ended looking up the directions ourself at a paid computer. Breakfast for the more expensive rooms on the 15 floor was terrible esp in the weekends: crowded space, not enough choices, not enough food, and you had to ask for glasses and plates, as they did not put enough out. And all this for 400 euro per night! Waste of money, and i will never return.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'm a hilton Diamond member, I've stayed in dozens of hiltons all around the world. THis one was my favorite. The staff was so friendly to us, and after travelling so far to get there through the multiple airports and train stations - this hotel was a true reward for the haul. I stayed on the executive floor with my status/points, and the room was a gem. A huge view of Barcelona from a corner room with windowed walls on both corners, a great room, and the finest hotel bathroom I've ever seen. It had independent showers, and a window from the shower to see the city below. Wow! The executive lounge has a stunning view, and fine food. When I looked next to me at breakfast, I was sitting next to a formula 1 driver who was in town after the big race. The breakfast and drinks at the lounge rank among the top 3 I've ever had the pleasure of attending. The beach shouldn't be a consideration if you are staying here before June, and the attractions in Barcelona can be seen by getting on a tour bus stop nearby, or by just getting on the subway.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this as wanted relaxing city break. Last visit stayed at Hotel D'Arts - and this was as nice. Had an executive room - which I think was worth the extra money. Had access to lounge and terrace - overlooking sea with free rein on drinks and snacks. If you want a 'chill-out' weekend for rest and relaxation - where you can walk into Barcelona (about 40 -50 mins walk along sea front) at your leisure - this hotel is for you. We spent the daytime in the centre of Barcelona doing standard tourist activities, but didnt want to party the nights away. Highly recommend . Staff on front desk were excellent. Room (corner room - so views on 2 sides of room) was excellent. Sat in the bath and could see the sea. Gym is smallish and the hotel pool was chilly. But lovely clean beach - less than 5 min walk. If you fancy a chuckle - nudist beach short walk from hotel (you pass it if you walk on the beach itself into town). Visited at end of Sept 08 and had total sunshine all weekend. I want to work for Sanofi - see pic - what great office location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am a Hilton Honors Gold member and this was an award stay, paid with my points. But even if I had paid with my precious money I would still agree this is my best Hilton stay ever. Our (upgraded executive level) room was very clean and maintained that way the whole week we spent here. All staff members were very helpful, friendly and always with a positive "can do"-attitude! Complimentary breakfast and other executive lounge services/snacks/drinks were very generous. The only down sides with this hotel are the location (which is a little far outside the city center - on the other side is that the views of the mediterrainan are stunning) and the outrageous selfparking fee of 36 euros/day inside the garage. However the rental car company let us use one of their spots in the garage for free. Both thumbs up for SIXT Car rental which has a counter inside the lobby! Regarding the location can also be said that the subway is only 1-2 blocks away but that service ends at midnight. We will certainly stay here again when we return to Barcelona.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Upon arrival we were greeted with champagne and dessert in celebration of our honeymoon! The staff spoke English well and were eager to please. The hotel was booked by travelocity/AAA, so we got a bargain! The hotel was spotless, the breakfast was included in our stay and was our favorite meal; very hearty. My husband and I stayed on the 16th floor and our room overlooked the sea. We witnessed a breathtaking sunrise. Overall I could not have been more pleased with my choice. The inner city was very easy to get to by metro (Line 4, yellow) a short walk away, and the Bus Turistic was across the street which takes you everywhere (get a 2 day pass). Also, the Diagonal Mar shopping center is across the street which has the best gifts and a variety of food. The staff will help you with any questions. I would not recommend staying in the inner city because it all looked loud and crowded. If you are looking for a relaxing get away by the sea with very easy access to everywhere else, then this hotel is for you. I am a very happy visitor; you will be too!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Traveled en famille and on points just this past weekend. Upgraded to corner room on 21st floor. View to die for. Nicely appointed room; very spacious for the three of us. Bathroom was large, sep. shower and bath and bidet. I enjoyed taking a bath with views of the Med from the window. Lounge was wonderful as was service. Breakfast was more than filling with great variety. Tea time had an equally nice spread. We drove so we used the hotel garage. Ate in town off Ramblas (Taller de Tapas--great!!) one evening and across from hotel at Let's Wok (wow! talk about a seafood nirvana!). We drove around town with no problem; Indeed, I found hotel fairly well located. Metro and bus directly across street. Someone cut our tire on the first evening in hopes of ensnaring us in the Barcelona two-step scam of helping you only to charge you highway robbery or take your car off of you. Luckily we were only 2 blocks from hotel. Having French plates made us easy marks. Still love Barcelona and Gaudi. And the Hilton staff were incredibly helpful during this stressful time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">checked in quite late on Friday evening, requested a sea room and was given an upgrade to tranquil room with Sea View! Good Start to the weekend :-) Room very modern, spacious, bathroom again had all the facilites you would expect plus a tv mounted in the wall of the bath?! Buffett breakfast the next day was swift and efficient, plenty of choices but we did go down to breakfast on the Sunday an hour later and I guess so did most other people because alot of the food had ran out and my husband had to wait for things to be replenished. Great staff in reception. Taxi costs around 10 euros to go to Port Olympic - some great restaurants there. 15 euros or thereabouts gets you to Las Ramblas. The hotel is opposite a large shopping Mall - I bought some coke zeros for 78cents per bottle and water at 19 cents each and put them in our fridge (there is a space for your own items in the fridge which i think is good) Decent coffees and lunch can be purchased by the poolside - again staff very attentive and efficient. This hotel is great and I wouldn't hesitate staying here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was our seventh stay at this fabulous hotel in Barcelona. And it really feels a kind of home. It's a fantastic hotel to visit as a guest, but I think it is a good hotel to work in also. Because we meet many of the same nice members of staff year after year. They do their job with a smile and provides exellent service. It doesn't matter to us that the Diagonal Mar Hilton is located outside of the center of Barcelona. We can go outside the door and take the 41 bus into Placa Catalunya or the metro around the shopping mal to Urquinaona or another central stop. And a taxi back to the hotel is only 10€. We love the quiet area and the surroundings of the hotel with green parks and the beach. The poolarea makes the hotel a little more like a resort, and we love to have lunch in Brisa poolbar where the barbecuechef makes brochettes of seafood or chicken. Our favourite though is the iberian cured ham on tomatobread and icecold Chardonnay. Hilton Diagonal Mar has got all we need from the fantastic breakfast buffet until the nightcup glas of wine in Pistaccio lobby bar.We can't wait to go back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is 2 blocks from the beach, and across from a big mall and a park. I felt very safe walking in the area, even at night. Very generous space by the pool with lots of chaises and umbrellas and a lovely outdoor seating area on the other side of the bar. The room was nice, the bed comfortable, strange assortment of tv channels in English (cartoon network, natl geographic and fox). We were not told that the room came with breakfast for me (my husband was at a conference at hotel), so I missed out on breakfast for 3 mornings. The restaurant staff do not seem familiar with decaf coffee, twice when I ordered it, i got served a decaf espresso. The mall across the street has lots of outdoor dining options for lunch and dinner, and a 2 story store similar to a supertarget, with groceries on the bottom floor. there is also a movie theater in the mall, but I assume the films would be in spanish. I tried to use Starbucks wireless, free for 45 mn but could not sign on. Could have been operator error, but with the language barrier, it was not too be. Internet at hotel was 27 eu per day, ouch.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Even though I seen one very negative review, we were glad to have stayed here. While out in the newer surburbs, we liked the location as it afforded a look at a greater part of the city than if we had stayed in the center city. A very nice tram line stopped at the big mall across the street from the hotel and connected to the Metro. Also there was a Metro stop about 1/2 block the other side of the tram stop. Don't be shy about using the Metro (look into day or multi day tickets) the public transport is safe, fast and excellent! We traveled all the way from the airport via train and the Metro to the hotel. A word of caution - be prepared to do some walking and carrying luggage up and down stairways as the central Metro stations have very few elevators or escalators! Back to the hotel -- we found the staff very helpful and friendly. The hotel rooms are modern in style, quite nice, and the seaside rooms offer wonderful views -- the weather was too cool to attempt to go to the beaches, and we didn't learn if there are any bathing beaches in the vicinity -- the hotel is some 3 or so blocks from the sea.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I utilized my Hilton Honors points to stay at the Diagonal Mar for my honeymoon in May 2008. As a diamond member, the hotel provided me with a room on one of the executive levels. My wife and I were VERY happy with the executive lounge. We had a continental breakfast every morning and the lounge was open for cocktails and light appetizers in the evening. The lounge has a great view of the city. The rooms were not very large, but they were clean and well appointed in a modern style. We were greated by the Hilton with desserts and champagne in recognition of our honeymoon stay. The hotel is located just two blocks from the metro station. We just walked straight through the adjacent mall to get there. We felt safe walking there during all hours of the day and night. Although the hotel isn't located in the heart of the city, we didn't find it an inconvenience as the metro is fast and very easy to navigate. It didn't take long at all to get to our desired locations. It took me a year to acquire the points needed to stay there and it was well worth it for me. We were able to take a cruise right out of the Barcelona port.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic 4 day break, given to me by my wife as part of my big 50 celebrations. Not pre-arranged or ordered by my wife, however on the first evening, chocolate cake and bottle of champagne delivered to the room - nice touch. Staff could not have been more helpful. We had a junior suite, which had wonderful views over the beach - and just as importantly, we had access to the executive lounge. The qulaity of food and drink was impressive and it was a great way to start off your eveing relaxing in the lounge. Location of the hotel I think is very good. You have a nearby underground station - 10 min walk - which takes about 15 mins into the centre. We bought a T10 ticket - ie 10 trips - for €8.25: excellent value! Trains ran frequenlty and the whole system was easy to use. Opposite the hotel, you also have a great shopping mall: if you want to buy children's clothes, there are some very good shops inside. Plus there is a huge hypermarket. Take a walk along the beach and after 10 mins you will come across a superb restaurant, Boo's - definitely worth a visit. All in all, definitely recommend the hotel - upgrade to an executive room as well.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Excellent base for Barcelona”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I took a a party of fifty people to this hotel for a sports trip and the service given was excellent and staff were really helpful and polite. I have downgraded the location, not for the fact that it is bad, but because it is not a central hotel within Barcelona. However, the city centre is a short tram or metro ride away. It is near the beach and has a shopping centre directly opposite which offers restaurants and bars as well as shops. The rooms are spacious with comfortable beds and large bathrooms and some have a sea view which in March was not that great but would be better during the hotter months. They are well equipped with robes, slippers, mini bar and coffee and tea facilities. They appear to be equipped for all business needs. Included in our rates was an excellent breakfast in a well run restaurant. The bar prices were a little on the excessive side hence the 4 star value rating. Plenty of cheaper options elsewhere and the staff were more than happy to assist in guiding you to the better ones on offer in the area. All in all more of a business hotel but would highly recommend for a short stay in Barcelona just for a city break.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Word of Warning...... We just went to Barcelona. We had a lovely time except.... Hilton Diagonal Mar. We have always had great experiences at many other Hiltons but not this one. They totally tried to put our family out on the streets at 10pm at night. It took us 2hours to get our room which made it midnight. They tried to charge us a crazy additional amount just because we had a second child. Even though kids are suppose to stay free at Hiltons and kept saying it was a law in Spain. It all started when they looked at us when we walked up with jeans and backpacks and not suits or dress. It got worse when they found we were Americans. The next night they were giving other Americans trouble! We have never felt discriminated against until this hotel. We didn't have any other problems in the area except with that hotel. I still can not believe they didn't want to give us a room and tried to turn us away at 10pm with two kids. I was extremely disappointed with their desk service. I feel that they tried to take advantage of us and just wanted money. It was all about getting more money. I did not feel like they cared about our family in the least.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was worried as the hotel was out of the main city but the it only took a few minutes to reach the center of town on the metro (which was frequent and easy to use ) the only reason it took so long to get into town was that we couldnt help looking at the shops in the wonderful shopping center we had to walk through on the way to the station . The service was wonderful .Russel the concierge was very friendly and full of useful information .The front desk were helpful and made you feel welcome The breakfast was very good nothing missing ,it all looked very appetising , they do not advertise but you can order omlettes etc from the kitchen if you want and the tables are being cleaned all the time and all the staff were smiling and friendly We didnt eat in the hotel as you have so many restaurants to choose from over the road and some days we stayed in town Even when we went to check out and there had been a misunderstanding on our booking (from the front desk )and we were locked out of our room and when they opened it the room had not been done for our last night every one was so nice we didnt complain .

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel pre cruise and for a few days post cruise. What a beautiful property. The pool was gorgeous. The surrounding pool area was huge and relaxing. This might be my favorite. It wasn't closed in like many hotel pools with people sitting around looking at each other. If you wanted privacy or had loud kids (me) you could get away. The rooms were beautiful and spacious. The beds were heavenly!! That was some of the best sleep I've had in a hotel. What a bed!! The staff was very helpful. I even went to the pool grill to order a meal and the guy behind the bar said they were closing in 5 minutes but he would have the cook stay late and make something for myself and my three kids. The guy ended up staying about 1/2 hour later. The girl at check in was also helpful. The staff in the main restaurant where we ate for breakfast were so nice and really helped me with my Spanish. The location is okay. The mall across the way makes up for it but next time it would be nice to be near all the action. However, for cruises it was a good option as it was close to the peir. We had a great time and loved this hotel and for some reason I really loved that pool area!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Almost any discerning traveller would enjoy staying at this clean and modern hotel with friendly, helpful staff and impeccable service. However, it is not cheap and while you get what you pay for, there were a number of issues, admittedly minor, which we felt fell short of our expectations and indeed of the hotels own aspirations. On two separate occasions housekeeping staff entered our bedroom without knocking. This appeared to be more a case of bad manners rather than any institutional lack of training. The tea/coffee pack in the bedroom provides only powder milk. Surely a hotel of this standard could provide some form of liquid milk. Equally, amongst all the American, European and Asian newspapers provided free in the lobby, a British paper would not be too much to ask. Both computers installed in the lobby were out of order and although staff were aware of this, nothing seemed to be done about it. The plug in the bathroom sink would not stay down and the heavy blind on the bedroom window needs a pelmet type arrangement to keep out the early morning light. Hilton have a good product here but they really need to improve on these basic matters if they are to maintain their superior hospitality crown.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very Nice Hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed there one night before a cruise leaving from the Barcelona port and had a total of 3 rooms (if staying there before a cruise, I would recommend at least 2 nights there so you can have time to enjoy the city). The staff was very helpful and the hotel is very nice. It is not in the center of town, but you can reach the downtown area easily by bus or Taxi. The hop on hop off bus stops a half block down from the hotel and is a great value at 22 euros per adult. There is also a large mall directly accross the street from the hotel where you can find just about anything you may be looking for. There is also a supermarket there for anything you may have forgotten. The hotel itself is clean, comfortable, and well maintained. We found breakfast to be rather expensive at almost 25 euros per person and is not worth it. We had sandwiches and burger at the bar area in the lobby and enjoyed them, but they were also on the expensive side. However, it is our experience that prices in Europe tend to be high particularly with the current exchange rate to dollars so this is to be expected. Taxis were readily available at the hotel and airport and are metered. Barcelon is a great city. Overall great hotel. We would deffinetly return.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pre-cruisers be forewarned, booking early and getting a good rate may spell trouble ahead. We made advance reservations and prepaid for 2 rooms at this hotel to secure a May 27 pre-cruise stay. We were cruising on the Disney Magic and also paid Disney extra for the convenience of transferring our luggage from this hotel to the port, especially since one member of our party was my 84 year old mother. We had enjoyed 2 previous stays here and my husband is Hilton Honors Gold. When we reached the check in counter, we were pulled aside and told that due to a “system error”, the hotel would not be able to accommodate our reservations. Despite dealing with the embarrassment of speaking with both the asst. and gen. manager in a public lobby, we were told the best they could do was put us up in a nearby “beachfront 4 star hotel”. The "beachfront 4 star" hotel turned out to be a Spanish economy hotel on a busy street, a couple of blocks from the ocean. Our rooms were tiny, no view, no bellman, no coffee maker, etc. To add to our frustration, we saw others checking into the Diagonal Mar both before and after we were turned away. The manager offered to buy us dinner at the hotel as compensation; we declined because in our opinion, returning to the hotel after this experience would only add to our humiliation.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Hotel! Almost Perfect!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Barcelona Diagonal Mar Hilton for 5 nights. It's a great hotel. Here are the highlights: + Great friendly staff that speaks English well and eager to help. + The room is a nice size for European standards and is modern and clean + The bathroom is great with a seperate shower from the bathtub and is modern and clean. + Although some have reviewed that the location is not great- I disagree. It's 2 miles from the city center but still feels much a like its in the city. The city center is a quick subway ride away. It is one block away from the beach. + The mall across the street is convenient as it has a nice grocery store and a few decent restaurants. I just have a few suggestions that would have made this hotel stay perfect. They are: + The Internet is way too expensive. They charge 27 euros ($40 USD) a day! I have never paid so much for internet in NYC, Hong Kong, Paris, London, etc! Internet should be free but if you do charge- it should be $10 to $15. It's shockingly expensive! + The pool beautiful but it is ICE cold. I like cold pools- but it is so cold, you can not swim. I suggest they heat it during the non-summer months + Also- since they advertise the hotel as being next to the beach- I think the hotel should offer beach towels to their guests. That would be a really nice extra.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “great hotel but not near tourist attractions”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is my 2nd stay in Barcelona. Barcelona is a city where there are limited rooms on the weekends so if you are planning a trip with children I suggest that you book your family rooms well in advance. I stayed here 1 night with my extended family of 10 -children ages 7-10 prior to a cruise and really enjoyed our stay. However, this hotel is not near the main tourist attractions so you have to take the bus or metro. This is a lovely hotel not far from the beach and right across from one of the nicest malls in Barcelona. There is a metro & bus service 2 blocks away along the Diagonal Avenue. The beach is close enough to walk to and there are several interesting parks along the way. This entire area is being developed and seems to be the "new Barcelona". We used Hitlon rewards points and were able to upgrade to larger rooms which included the business lounge and free snacks & breakfast. Otherwise breakfast was quite expensive and if I had to pay for breakfast, I'd go across the street to the mall which had several nice restaurants & a grocery store (lower level). The rooms were clean and beds comfortable. Check in and out was fast and the employees were very friendly and helpful. The staff in fact was exceptional. This is not the cheapest hotel in the area but probably one of the nicest. I would stay here again. bbeerbower</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here 4 nights in July and I'm sorry that I'm only posting now because the hotel was fabulous. Having stayed at other hotels in Barcelona city center (reviews to come), I much prefer staying at this hotel and commuting in. Rooms: Wonderful plush beds and fantastic down pillows. Satellite tv with a good number of English channels. Only complaint is reception was a bit fuzzy. Bose stereo system is a bonus. Bathrooms: Excellent. Separate showers and soaking spa tubs equipped with TV. Full size hair dryers and a wide range of toiletries, including conditioner. Pool: Again top notch with tons of loungers on the deck, friendly staff and full bar/restaurant facilities. Gym: Small given that this hotel is geared towards conference goers. Wifi: Overpriced and a shame, thankfully my company has a service where I can access it gratis. Downside: There really are no restaurants in this area but the short trip in still makes it worthwhile; and if you're in need of some snacks head to the basement at Alcampo and stock up on wine, cava, olives and jamon. We got a fantastic deal on priceline and extended it because we were so pleased. So many other hotels that we stayed at in Barcelona had thin walls, hard beds and were overpriced. Overall the size and quality of the rooms coupled with the amenities of a Hilton make this a perfect hotel</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for a short weekend getaway in February. This was not our first time in Barcelona and we decided we'd like to stay closer to the sea (even in February). Our room seemed larger than a typical european room, it had full-length windows along 2 walls of our room and had a great view of the sea. Hardwood floors, desk, lounge chair, bath and stand-up shower. Complimentary bottles of water in the room were a definite bonus. The staff were also great and friendly. They suggested some wonderful restaurants for lunch and dinner. The exec lounge was one of the nicer lounges we have been in. They offer cards and some board games if you want to relax outside of your room. It also has a large balcony where you can enjoy your breakfast, afternoon tea or even cocktail. They even offer blankets if the weather is a bit chilly and you want to stay outside! The beach was in walking distance. You can easily walk along the path to Port Olímpic where there are lovely restaurants, etc. Across from the hotel is a large mall with movie theater, restaurants and many shops. The metro stop is also easily accessible from the hotel (we liked cutting through the mall) and will take you directly to Las Ramblas. We would definitely stay at this Hilton again and can't wait to go back during the summer months when we can spend more time on the beach!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family stayed at the Hilton Diagonal Mar for two nights in July prior to our cruise on the Disney Magic. When we arrived at the hotel around 10:00 A. M., the front desk clerk told me that they could not accommodate our family of three in one room, so they were offering us two rooms (at no additional charge) instead. Another wonderful surprise is that the rooms were ready! Since we'd just flown in on a red-eye flight, we were grateful that we could freshen up in our rooms immediately. The hotel is not in the center of the activity in Barcelona, and that was fine with us. We liked the location, and we took the hop-on, hop-off tourist bus (which has a stop across the street) to access much of the city. The shopping center across from the hotel is nothing particularly special, but it is a convenient place to eat dinner or to pick up last-minute necessities. My one complaint with the hotel is the excessive charge for Internet access. I did not use my computer while we were there, simply because I refused to pay for what I considered exorbitant rates. I am a big believer that major hotels should offer free wifi. The hotel is clean, and the staff were friendly and helpful. The daily breakfast was one of the most amazing buffets I've ever seen! We're still talking about how good it was (especially the fresh-squeezed orange juice). I would recommend the Hilton Diagonal Mar.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel definitely merits its 5* grading. We arrived after a cruise and found our room ready for us to check into before 1000. It was a deluxe room on the 13th floor and had views of both the city and the sea. It was plenty big enough for my wife and I, with a large clean and high quality bathroom, a very, very comfortable bed and a sofa, desk and entertainment area in front of the window. We heard no-one else once we were in our room. They also provided us with a 1400 checkout and the opportunity to use the fitness suite after our last afternoon of sun worship at no cost. The breakfast was well cooked and the service was great. The variety was impressive. The pool has a decking area around it which fills up rather early in August but is surrounded by a much larger paved area which is great for those who only want a sunbed. There are 6 outdoor showers to provide essential cooling whilst tanning. Outside is a shopping mall with at least 25 different food outlets. There is a range of other shops on the three floors there. The official tour bus stops outside the hotel and allows you to access any other part of this sprawling city. €21 gets you a full day pass, but if you buy from the Hilton you get a discount. La Rambla can be a €10-15 taxi ride away, but if you want to go there and pay 50% more for everything, you would probably be better staying in a hotel right in the city centre.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent 5 nights at this hotel 24th to 29th August. All staff very friendly and welcoming. Room on 11th floor spacious and comfortable and you get a dressing gown each. Hadnt thought we got breakfast in the deal we got but on arrival found we did and this was definitely a highlight! Lots to choose from and kept you full up all day. On arrival at the Airport bought a T10 ticket which gives you 10 journeys and can be used by 2 people, you dont need one each! Caught the overground train to Estacia de Franco where the line finishes anyway. A short walk round the corner from the station takes you to the Metro and you can then get a single tube train to El Maresme Forum which is about a 400m walk from the Hilton Hotel.Trains very clean and very efficient. We bought a two day ticket for the open top bus tour at 26 euros each.This was a great way to see all the sights.There are 3 different bus routes so you have to get off the bus to change routes but there werent huge queues. The Hotel is close to the beach and in the mornings we jogged along the beach front with many other joggers and it takes you all the way along the 5 seperated beaches. Hotel pool area and gym very nice indeed Hotel was full of both tourists and also quite a lot of business people on some bonding team event but this meant the pool area during the daytime was quiet and relaxing. All in all a lovely stay, being outside the main hustle and bustle of the town centre was ideal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel for a conference being held at the CCIB which is right next door. You DO have to walk outside to get from the hotel to the conference center but even in the rain it was not bad as the two are really close to each other. Had room service once for dinner and it was great. I did have to dial the room service folks 4 times before someone answered the phone. I had breakfast in the concierge room on the 15th floor a few times and also in the regular restaurant on premise. Both were free. The amount of breakfast choices in the restaurant was terrific. The concierge breakfast was not bad, much smaller room and less selection but very quiet compared to the restaurant. Everything in my room worked fine and the bed was comfortable. I used the business center and it was fine. I need to send a package back home to the US and the lady working there was very helpful. I had a few times when some of the elevator doors would not close all the way and you had to open and close them a number of times and sometimes use your hands to force them to go together so the elevator would move. I also had to use a key card to access my floor and sometimes had to put it in numerous times to get it to go to my floor. There is a mall across the street from the hotel and it had a lot of choices. Unfortunately I only had a little time to explore it. The food court looked quite extensive. I would definitely come back to this hotel again if I were in this area for business.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved everything about the is hotel, we were using Hilton points and were upgraded to an executive room with free Internet and use of the executive club facitities so cannot comment on what it would be like to stay without these benefits but we thought it was wonderful. We have stayed in other Hiltons and this one compared very well. I have read that other people thought the staff unfriendly,everybody we dealt with was very friendly and coudn't have been more helpful, one of the receptionists offered to take my postcards over to the post office for me. The beds are the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in, I normally look forward to going home to my own bed after a holiday but not after staying in a Hilton bed. We found the food at breakfast was just fine you donget told that they are closing at 10.30 sharp but that is fair enough if not people would be coming in alll morning. The location will not suit people who want to be in the centre of the action but is is nice to come back and be away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre,the transport links are very good and we found the metro was ideal to get to most places, the trains are very punctual, have air conditioning and you can use your phone,they certainly put the London underground to shame. We never felt unsafe and used them even late at night. The tourist bus routes are great and the green route runs past the hotel with a stop just down the road.we would come back without tomorrow if we could.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 5 nights in November as I was attending a conference next door at the CCIB. If you are to ever stay at a Hilton, join the HHonours club as it is free and you get little upgrades which are handy. The check-in was quick and easy. The chap who booked us in spoke excellent English and was very polite. He even turned someone away who pushed infront of us! I liked that :) The room I had was very nice on the 12th floor. It had two single beds (fine as I was a lone traveller) and flat screen TV and a view of the port / sea. Don't be fooled by the photographs on the Hilton website - the hotel is a fair few metres form the beach...there is a big road to get past first! The bathroom was big and clean with nice towels, two dressing gowns and slippers. One thing that did put me off was someone had graffitied the word DEATH on the architrave in the bathroom. This kind of shocked me when I noticed it at 1 in the morning after a few beers! Hilton - please sort this!!!! On one day the hotel lost all water / water pressure, which meant I had an awkward shower! The hotel did apologise with a letter and box of chocolates which as ok Worst thing about the hotel is the prices. 24 Euro for breakfast is a con, 27 Euro for internet access (which was rubbish) and 7 Euro for a beer. Extortion! The shopping center across the road is really good, loads of restaurants and shops - enough to please everyone. All in all a good hotel - I'd definitely come back, but not to pay for breakfast or use the internet!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a very enjoyable 5 day (4 nights) break at the Hilton Diagonal Mar with my partner and her 18 year old daughter Efficient and very friendly service, very comfortable inter-connecting rooms on the 7th floor – excellent gym and pool area – returning to the pool each evening after a day walking around the city was very enjoyable. Good location out on the fringe of the city – the area is well served by bus, metro or tram all within a short walk of the hotel – there is also a taxi rank directly opposite the hotel. Very large shopping complex across the road with an assortment of cafes and bars – most of the eateries here though are very average (and the service desultory at best) apart from the pescado which we found to be quite good. We particularly enjoyed returning to the hotel lobby late at night for a pot of tea and a nightcap or two before hauling ourselves off to bed – they must have had only one teapot in the lobby bar with no lid although they did do their best (much to our amusement) to improvise using drink coasters, saucers etc – on our fourth and final night the barman rummaged around and triumphantly found the missing lid (rather spoiling our fun). Late check out was arranged for us at no extra charge – all of the staff without exception seemed to take a pride in creating a welcoming and friendly atmosphere. One word of warning (and something the concierge mentioned to us) – be careful when out and about – we caught a pick-pocket brazenly plying his trade in the check in queues at the airport – although Barcelona is a great city to wander around you do need to exercise a bit of street sense and be careful with your wallet, passport, phone, camera etc</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had an excellent stay at the Hilton Diagonal Mar. We stayed for 6 days total in August 2009. The staff was attentive. The rooms and amenities were great. We even ate one night at the restaurant, which was quite good. You need to know what you are getting. If you want an old school hotel in the middle of the action or the Old City, this is not the place. If you want a modern American style hotel with great service, great rooms, a pool and close to the beach, this is your place. Traveling with kids, we found it a nice respite to get some space from the pace of the city, but still be very close to everything. You are not in the heart of Barcelona. You are six metro stops away from the City Center-- a 12 to 15 minute Metro ride. The Metro is an easy 5 minutes from the hotel and runs every 4 to 6 minutes. Or if you prefer, all attractions are a 10 to 12 euro cab fare. The beach is 2 blocks-- the closest you will get in Barcelona. It is not the most popular, central or trendy beach in Barcelona, but it is a nice beach. BTW, the picture is not of the beach; it is of the pool. The fitness center was small, but adequate. This hotel was great for a longer visit to the City if you want some down time, a pool and proximity to the beach. The staff is helpful. The modern mall across the street is great for families with kids who sometimes want comfort food or experiences. However, I would still stay here if traveling just as a couple because the accommodations were that good. It is even better if you are upgraded as an Hilton Honors member. We also found a real concierge at the hotel who was knowledgeable, but the rest of the staff was very helpful as well. We would definitely stay again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stay in a lot of Hiltons and the Hilton Diagonal Mar ranks in my top 2 or 3 worldwide. We stayed 5 nights on a mix of business and pleasure. Rooms: super clean, very comfortable beds, not as much hallway noise as many of the other Hiltons get, nice bright furnishings. Our view from the 23rd floor was stunning as we were facing the Sea. Didn't want to ever close the blinds :) Service: desk staff is extremely helpful, as is the concierge. They also speak English, Spanish and Catalan, among others; no matter what you speak, you will find someone at this hotel who speaks it. Bar service: keep in mind you are not in America any more. This is not a ding at the hotel at all. They do it different in Spain than we do in the States. Do not go expecting American-style service. If you sit in the bar area, someone will serve you, and they will be polite and helpful, but it won't be as fast or overly-bubbly as you're used to in the US. Food and beverage choices: you're in Barcelona. Go eat somewhere else. The menu is 80% the same Hilton menu you will find all over the world, and the same quality. There is nothing wrong with it. But if you're in one ofthe great food cities in the world, go explore and try something you've never had before. The 15th Floor Executive Lounge is well worth the upgrade charge if you don't get it free from your Hilton status. It has a very large wrap-around deck which is great for cocktail hour if it's not too windy; self-serve bar after 5pm or so; smoking is allowed on the deck AND it's windy enough that if you're a non-smoker, your smoking neighbors won't bother you; very nice selection of snacks during cocktail hour and great breakfast. Definitely recommend this hotel!</p></li>
