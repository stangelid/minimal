<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is in a very good location, just off a main street in central Amsterdam, on a quiet canal street. It is a 3 star hotel which may account for the stained carpeting, thin towels, and some snooty reception staff. The breakfast, although a reasonable price, was consistently out of items, had stale pastries and funny tasting eggs. Some of the rooms are tiny, so try to request a large room, if the staff will indulge your request.</p></li>

The Triple room we had was comfortable and warm. if you use the hotel just as a base then it is fine, anything else not so good.</p></li>

No coffee making facilities supplied free unless you wanted to pay 10 euros per day which was two coffee/tea cup allowance.

With that in mind having stayed there in February 2005 i can say that the staff were very friendly and the rooms clean and appropriate for the level of the hotel. It is close enough to Dam Square and walking distance from the station depending on age. The breakfast was adequate for a three star hotel and there was enough food. I would stay again if i could not find a good deal on a 4 or 5 star hotel.</p></li>

For a 3 star Euro hotel the rooms are huge, the views of the canal (Herengeraacht) outside are atmospheric, the location, despite being very quiet is a pleasant 10 minute stroll to Dam Square, and only 5 minutes to Anne Franks House.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Rembrandt Residence & would not hesitate to stay here again. The location was perfect. The hotel staff were very polite & welcoming. They did everything they could to make our stay comfortable. Our room was excellent - very clean & had a lovely view of the canal. My parents had stayed here a few years ago & also couldn't fault it. Breakfast was buffet style and there was plenty of it. Rolls, cereal, cheese, eggs, juice etc. My only critisism was the cigarette smoke smell in our bathroom (??) and also in the bar area. But that's something about Amsterdam you won't change!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed with my daughter at this hotel for a short city break in Feb 08. It is a great location about a 3 minute walk from Dam Square. We felt very safe even walking back at night, The hotel was clean and friendly and our room was fine not at all small as others have said. The breakfast was excellent and you could even have cooked if you wanted. There was a big selection of breads,cheese, cereals, juice, and fresh fruit and yoghurts. We would definately recommend it and would stay again. Eat at the argentinian restaurant as you walk to Dam Square best steak I've ever had and really friendly service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just back from a great weekend in Amsterdam. Read the reviews before we went and have got to say most of them were spot on! Took other reviewers advice and asked for a room on the third floor. Was a really helpful receptionist on duty and she gave us room 309 Thank you Christina! It was great. Very warm - it was minus 10 outside- beds were very clean and the most comfortable I have slept in. It also had a lovely canal view and a very clean, modern bathroom. Also tried the breakfast it was great. Yes it is an old hotel and could do with a face-lift but it was excellent value for money and very central.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On the positives: position is good for exploring the city. Rooms are of resonable size. Lots of negatives: very shubby, smell of smoking throughout. Buffet breakfast is not much at all. Lifts do not stop on the same level for many rooms and all the luggage has to be dragged on the extra steps. Usual car access to the hotel was impossible due to the canal repair works, hotel did not care to contact customers in advance to suggest access from the rare, nor there were any signs on arrival. No air conditioning. Staff was just neutral. Overall: it is no more than 2 star hotel. Negative, would not stay again.</p></li>

Staff on reception were friendly and allowed us to swap our two single beds for the double room we had requested. The room however was very small, barely enough room for our two suitcases. We may have been able to overlook this if we had a better view, but sadly the courtyard in all it's concrete glory, was all we could see.... Breakfast was nice and simple, breads, cereal, juice, fruit and two choices of egg. Whilst we had a pleasant stay we won't be rushing back for the $300AUS per night we shelled out for this hotel...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good points: Excellent central canal-side location. Large comfortable room over-looking canal. Reasonably priced booked through Alpha Rooms. Receptionists arranged taxis. (Incidentally, beware of rip-off taxis at the station: we were charged â‚¬20 for the short trip from the station to the hotel). Bad points: The decor is very tired and the whole place could do with a complete overhaul. The breakfast buffet was reasonable on the first (Saturday) morning but by Monday morning they seemed to have run out of most things. I would like to think that there are better hotels for the same money and equally well located.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for three nights in June. Great location just a short walk from anywhere really. The staff at the desk were very friendly and provided us with a map and tips for all the local sights. our first room didn't have a shower only a bath as it was on the top floor with low ceilings. We asked to be moved and were dealt with efficiently but had to sacrifice the view for a room with a shower. The room was basic and very dated furniture but clean and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was nice. There was no real bar in the hotel. If you're looking for a good location and no real luxury then this is the place for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in the Rembrandt Residence Hotel in Amsterdam for 4 nights, and we loved the hotel. The room was very clean and tidy and was cleaned every day. The bathroom was a little small, but very clean. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The small lounge area in the foyer was comfortable and pleasant to have a drink in. The hotel bar hours were peculier to day the least, it opens at 5.00pm and last drinks are at 10.40pm, but once you get to know the times it works very well. The breakfast was excellent, plenty of food and really nice, cheese, meats, eggs, etc. Great coffee!! I have no problem recommending the Rembrandt to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location just off Dam square, there are lots of shops, restaurants & tram stops all within easy walking distance. The room was a comfortable size but had twin beds, this is very common & we usually just push them together but this room had a table fixed between the beds! i explained the situation to a member of staff, unfortunately they couldnt do anything that evening but the following day we were moved to a very big room with a double bed & amazing canal veiw, it was very nice. I have been to amsterdam many times & this was my second stay at the Rembrandt, in my opinion this is a very good 3* hotel compared with many others in amsterdam.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very good for Dam Square, Anne Frank house and Westerkirk all only 10 min walk. We had a canal facing room which could be a bit noisy, but after walking round the city all day, didn't stop us from sleeping! Advise doing both day and night canal trips to get the best of both. If going to Keukenhof do the ALL day trip as you will need it, we booked from UK, noticed that in Amsterdam a lot of the trips there were only advertised as 1/2 day ones. We did have to pay a 50 euro deposit at the hotel when we checked in, but that was returned in full and we didn't have to pay the city tax (don't know if that was because we checked out very early in the morning)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I choose this hotel for my friend to stay in as our apartment is close by. Rembrandt classic, on the herengracht, centrally located, should be great. Nice outside exterior. Unfortunately that is where it ended. As the price was very low and the pictures were so good, we should have been suspect, but anyway. The room was clean enough, but old design, not comfortable beds, just enough to survive, and it wasnt' going to be used very much, just to lay the heads for one night. If you are needing a cheap last minute, this place can go for under 50euro in a good location, so if you are needing something without the thrills and fancy wrapping, it would be ok.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In the heart of it in old Amsterdam. We walked everywhere as there was no travelling but it was also very quiet. We got a cheap deal for 99 Euros so we weren't in the best room. Out the back overlooking the coutryard. However the room was clean and basic. Staff were friendly. Nice old building with huge beam a foot thick. Breakfast was expensive and we found it better to eat at the little cafes (the only drawback is lots of places didn't open until 11am). No fridge so we couldn't eat our own basic meals but this wasn't a huge drama. Cheap wireless internet for us to connect to so we could continue running our business. We were very happy with our selection.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for four nights, fantastic stay, hotel was clean and the staff more than helpful. The room was adequate not over large but fine loads of hot water fantastic baths every night which is essential because the amount of walking during the day one needs a hot bath at night. The room was very clean and modern only thing missing a kettle but that's not unusual on the continent. This hotel is in a fantastic location just right as Amsterdam is a place for walking. Had a great time and would really recommend this hotel, pity the bar closes at 10.30 ! not to worry so many bars nearby. Amsterdam is certainly worth the trip a truly beautiful chilled out city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this last minute through laterooms.com and paid â‚¬84 inc. tax for a double room. Arrived at a busy time of the day (1pm) with people checking in and out all at the same time. Had booked a twin because no double was listed on the booking form, but the very busy receptionist offered us a double anyway, which was good. Room was a small double overlooking the back of the hotel - clean but fine for what we wanted. Unfortunately, there is not much in the way of sound-proofing and we were awoken to the sound of someone throwing up continuously and very noisily, which wasn't pleasant! Location is brilliant - by an attractive canal and close to the town centre and Dam Square.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Rembrandt is convenient for all popular sites in Amsterdam but it was costly and offered a very cramped room. Impossible to get out of bed without banging into the wall mounted TV. Rooms were clean and warm, breakfast was fine. Paying by credit card became an impossibility. My original payment was not accepted so had to use my debit card, then the hotel requires a refundable deposit on arrival, of 50 euros. Again the credit card was rejected. It was obvious that some visitors were asking for rooms to be changed. Since we were there for two nights only we decided to tolerate the tiny bedroom and bathroom. In the uK this hotel would have been half the price we paid, - or even less.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. While the furniture in public areas and in the rooms is a little outdated it is still a descent 3 star hotel if you visit Amsterdam. Upon check-in we were asked to pay an additional city tax (which is common) and a cash deposit for further expenses. As we did not use any extras at the hotel, this was refunded promptly in cash. The hotel is located on a quite road, right by a typical canal. The dam square is about 5 min walk away. All main attractions like the Anne Frank house, Red light district etc are close by and within walking distance. The train station "centraal" is about 25 min walk, so I would recommend a taxi when you have some luggage.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel for six days. Hotel is in a great location on the Herengracht. Five minute walk to Dam Square, Anne Frank House, Red Light District. 15 minute walk to Central Station, but there are various tram lines by the hotel that run every couple of minutes. The hotel is very basic, and that was great for us because we spent almost no time in the room; too busy exploring the city. The room was small but the bed was very comfortable. The room was clean, bathroom was basic as well but clean. Service was prompt and friendly, in all we were satisfied with our stay. Bottom line - great base for exploring the city and it's main attractions. Very basic amenities, but clean and comfortable :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Rembrandt with my mom for a mother-daughter weekend trip to Amsterdam. The location is very centrally located and easy to walk to all the action but it is in a quiet area along one of the canals and boarders the beautiful Jordain area. Stepping out of the hotel directly onto a picturesque canal was exactly what I envisioned. Although some of the rooms have views, ours faced an inner courtyard which made for a quiet and peaceful stay. For the price (we didn't want to spend hundreds of Euros per night just for a place to sleep), and the location (convenient and yet quiet), I would definitely recommend the Rembrandt and would consider staying here again next time I visit Amsterdam.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For this trip to 'the dam' we wanted to be a bit more central, and we hit jackpot with this hotel. Right next to a canal, its around 5 mins walk to Dam square, and the same to Jordaan or the Nine Little Lanes. Leidsplein and other more interesting parts are also just a short walk away. The hotel itself is ok, it has a grand entrance hall with a reception desk staffed by smiley staff members. The room was quite small, but large enough to cope with for just a few nights, but as the city was so close we hardly spent any time in there anyway. The staff were helpful, offering advice about what to see and do, and happy to look after cases after we checked out and went to get some lunch. Would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is located near the Anne Frank house and is also an easy walk to the Red Light district and the Leidesplein area (even in the cold!). We booked a room for four and had two double beds in one large room, with a sitting area and small table/chairs and couch. The shower was nice, but did have quite a lot of mildew on the walls. We didn't take breakfast at the hotel, but the bar area was decent, and the common areas are all well kept. Our big "find" was the vending machine selling beer, which we thought was very nice. This hotel would be quite difficult for anyone with disabilities to maneuver around, with lots of steps on all floors. Overall, good location, decent price, not the most updated room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel for four nights in August. The hotel has a very good location. One can easily walk to Dam Square, the Anne Frank Huis and Centraal Station. Trams are 3 minutes away. The public areas and rooms are clean. Otherwise it does not have much going for it. The rooms are relatively spartan. The room I had was a single. It was 10'x12'. There were no drawers. There was no desk. There was a single arm chair. The bathroom sink had only a small counter. The food available at breakfast consisted of unappealing eggs, dry cereal, juice, coffee and breads. The bottom line is that the hotel does not have much in terms of amenities. If I go back to Amsterdam, I would probably look to stay someplace else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Three of us stayed at this hotel for two nights we arrived at 1pm and were checked in quickly and efficiently. Our room was on the first floor with three large windows overlooking the canal. It was a lovely large light room with two single beds and a double sofa bed. It was very clean and the beds were comfortable. We rang reception for tea and coffee and a tray was brought to our room within minutes. The breakfast was amazing, cereal, fresh fruit, yoghurt, toast, fresh coffee and all the usual cooked english breakfast items. It was as good as any 4star hotel. The staff were all polite and smiling and the public rooms were spick and span. You must visit a pancake house and hire a bike, quite an experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked through easy book . com but the booking got a little confusing when 2 people cancelled. Arrived at the hotel after an earl y flight and explained to the receptionist that we were a bed short on the booking but she said it would be ok , on returning to the hotel at the appropriate time a different receptionist was quite vehement about the error and was going to charge an extra 150 Euros for 3 nights.But the manager passed by and sorted it out for us , made us complementary tea and made sure we had our rooms on time. We throughly enjoyed our stay at the hotel .It has clean rooms and a pleasant convenient location just one of the rooms seemed a bit noisy and warm but i would definately stay there again .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Returned today from Amsterdam. The hotel is perfect for central Amsterdam just 5 minutes from Dam Square. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. The room we had was enormous and very clean. We were in a group of 8 (4 rooms) and each one was very clean and spacious. If you haven't been to Amsterdam before, its worth ringing the hotel before travelling and asking them to organise a taxi from the airport. We wasted a good half hour trying to find one when we landed. The only downer is no tea/coffee making facilities in the room, so we would say take a travel kettle and a couple of cups with you if you like a cuppa! We would certainly go back to this hotel and recomend it for location cleanliness and the friendly staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fairly good location - reasonable distance from the many tourist attractions in Amsterdam and in a reasonably quiet location - not too much noise from outside. Very small room although it was very clean. Breakfast was extremely average - bread rolls, cheese, cold meat, scrambled eggs, etc. Quite expensive for what is offered. Staff helpful & friendly. We arranged to fly to Amsterdam on Queen's Day (something to do with Royalty, not to be confused with the excellent Gay Pride celebrations!) so the Rembrandt Residence was all we could get as so many hotel rooms were already booked. We have stayed in other hotels in Amsterdam that offer far better value for money and are in nicer locations. We won't hurry back to Rembrandt.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed on the Rembrandt for 5 nights on April 2007, and the experience was really wonderful. We had tremendous luck regarding the weather - sunny most of the time, and it didn't rain for the our whole stay. The hotel was extremely well situated, a few block from the Dam in one direction and from Anne Frank's house in the other. You can also walk to central station from there, though it would be like a 15/20 minute walk. It was a really nice place, quiet at night and a few steps from the crowds during the day, and our room faced the channel (ask for it !). Nice rooms (fair size), pretty clean and a very good breakfast, plus a really great staff. I will come back to Amsterdam (love that city!), and definetely will stay on the Rembrandt again.</p></li>

We booked 3 rooms for our family and there was a range in sizes, but all the rooms were clean and comfortable with ample storage, TV, radio and everyone on staff were very nice and helpful. The location is excellent right on the canal and close to the Jordaan, Anne Frank House, Dam Square and we walked everywhere. Lots of restaurants nearby, too. We asked for a high floor and view and for 2 of the 3 rooms we got what we asked for. Considering they were fully booked, this was great. The other room was the largest, very spacious, so we were not disappointed in that either. All in all, it is not the Pulitzer, but we really did enjoy our stay. We would recommend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very good location. Unfriendly, uninterested personnel, dirty old rooms - bedsheet etc. were all right though. Breakfast the level of youth hostels, with instant coffee from automates etc. Worst the noisiness: my room was very small, and the huge air conditioning machinen (or something the like) in the inner yard right behind the little window as well as a powerful air conditioning in the bathroom open all the time made it unpossible to sleep at all. The situation was not helped by the wide open space under the door to the corridor - light and every single sound, travellers speaking and shouting etc, came profusely in all night. The personnel was not interested to find me another room for another night - just shrugged at my notice that the room should not be used.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visited Amsterdam last week with my boyfriend, and we wanted some where safe and centerally located to stay and at a reasonable price! â‚¬178 for 2 nights is a great deal for a 3 star hotel, considering the price of some dodgy hostels! The hotel is about 15 min walk from central station take a taxi for â‚¬10! Dam Square, Madame Tusads, Red light district are all only less than a 5 min walk away. The hotel is safe & clean, rooms are decent sized with all mod cons, if you are just looking for some where clean, central and rather cheap this is the place! Staff are helpful and friendly! No air con in rooms is a disadvantage, we had to keep window wide open 24hrs, as room was so warm! Weird smell in some corridors! But i would recommend this place & would stay ere again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel roomes look nothing like the website shows. Staff were extremely unhelpful, even when our en suite ceiling started leaking! We called several times and no one came to sort out the problem, finally we went out for the day. To top if off when we got the bin to catch the leak there was a dirty tampon in it (obviously emptyin bins before next guests arrive is not a priority). When we did come back we then were put into a room with 2 single beds. Freezing cold room as an air vent was stuck open. On the day we left, even though they state they have a luggage room they would only look after out bags till 2pm (our flight was at 10pm). I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I will add photos showing the difference between the room we stayed in and what the website shows, i will also show the leaking ceiling.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in a single room for a couple of nights. Check in was friendly and the location is really good. Easy walking distance to most places and close to trams/buses for others. Room was small but clean. It was on the ground floor just off reception which was a bit weird. Indeed there are two rooms which are basically located at the corner of the reception area! Would not have wanted one of these. However, I had no problems with noise during my stay. Everything in the room worked fine and there is even BBC 1/BBC 2 on the TV! The room rate I got was less than 50 euros which was cheap. Breakfast was 8.50 euro extra for a decent buffet spread inc eggs and bacon. They have a luggage room also. Because of the cheap rates and being amsterdam there were quite a few young people around partying but they caused me no problems. Overall for the price it was a good stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in late August. Unfortunatley our arrival coincided with the last three days of a week long garbage strike and a Tall Ships festival. We took train trips out of town to The Hague, Delft and Haarlem until they had cleaned the town. The hotel is in a good location for sight seeing and taking the tram. The room was clean, but as we had an inner courtyard room we heard conversations through the windows at night. There was no air conditioning, no hair dryer, no iron. There is a rack in the bathroom to hang up wash. There are also lots of places in the room for your belongings. Breakfast was good, but not excellent. The staff was very helpful. O'Reilly's restaurant serves good meals as does The Luxemborg. Most of the other restaurants in the area were very pricey. There is a large grocery store by the tram stop. Anne Frank's house is just a few blocks away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel as one of lastminute.coms Top secret hotel package. Dont fall for this one its just a con! There is no benefit in booking this way and last minute dont give a stuff once you have booked their customer service is TERRIBLE! The hotel itself was average the staff were very nice and helpful, although their idea of a room with a view is looking into a dingy courtyard. The pay television didnt work and contacting reception required some figuring out as the telephone had the wrong number listed. The room was on the top floor and still had Anne Franks furniture in it. Tiny bath with only a shower attachment in a room with a coombed ceiling made having a shower a challenge. No Hair dryer and no power anywhere near a mirror. Too expensive for whats on offer.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in the Rembrandt Residence from Boxing Day 2004 for 3 days. We had asked for a canal view and we got it, looking out over Singel Canal. The room amenities were basic, they were cleaned everyday and it was a great base to investigate the city. There is loads to see and do within walking distance. It's about a 15 minute stroll to Centraal Station along the canals. Our only complaint was the standard of the breakfast - very poor choice and very little of what there was. Not worth paying any extra for! Cold scrambled eggs, 2 or 3 cereals, a few semi-fresh rolls and about half a jug of orange juice, not to mention the coffee. And there was absolutely no point in arriving after 9am as the room filled up very quickly and there was a really long queue! Not whatwe wanted to do first thing in the morning, and frankly the food wasn't worth the wait. So we ate out the last 2 days we stayed there and it was much better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was a bit concerned having booked this and then reading some bad reviews but on the whole the hotel was good. Our room was on the 2nd floor and the doors definitely banged shut! Also we smelt "weed" on our floor, despite the notice in the room saying you'd be fined 100 Euros if found smoking in the room. The room seemed clean enough and so was the bathroom, and we got new soap and shampoo every day. Depending on who was on reception determined whether you'd be helped or not! We wanted to check in our flight on line, but the computer printers were "broken" and the reception staff said they'd probably be "too busy" to help me print my boarding pass, so I went into town (difficult to find an internet cafe open). We had asked for an extra pillow which never arrived, despite asking twice. We gave up and used a rolled up towel! It's such a shame - we stayed there a few years ago and it was a great hotel. It is now owned by a Spanish company.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent 2 nights at the hotel 20th July 2007 in a double room with breakfast. The room was 111 and was adequate for our needs, although the room could be considered small as the double bed was against the wall at one side and the bathroom was a bit tight - but how long do you spend in your room? However the room and bathroom were very clean and towels changed each day. Good TV , but no tea and coffee making facilities but not a real problem as there are plenty of bars and coffee shops nearby. Breakfast was very good with a large selection of hot and cold foods, in a lovely sunny room overlooking the canal, with excellent service from the staff. The hotel reception staff were also very good and very helpful booking trips, and providing directions. The hotel is in a very good location, near to Dam Square, Anne Franks House, Canal Boat Trips, Red Light District and the main shops. There may be cheaper hotels but this hotel has LOCATION LOCATION.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me an my partner stayed here for a few nights not long ago. When we booked, the website stated "standard double/twin room". We are aware that usually this means that you end up with two twin beds just pushed togather but we were pleasently surprised to find a very large double. In fact i would have said it was more like king size! Fantastic! Also very very comfortable! The lady at reception told us we were in room 25 which is "a very nice room". This room was great! High ceilings, tall windows, chandelier etc. all very grand, perhaps a little too grand for us but for what we paid we were very happy with it. The location of this hotel is great - on a nice quiet canal but only a 5 minute wak from Dam square, brilliant for shops and restaurants. the ony thing we felt was missing was a mini bar in the room! maybe we i'm being a little picky though! we didn't really mind using the vending machine under reception! All in all a very nice place to stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was a godsend to stay at, although it wasn't the easiest hotel to get to via the tram (we parked at one of the autoparkades by the Stadium). A taxi can get you to the front door, however. We shared a large room with another couple and the room was spectacularly large, the beds were wonderfully comfortable and we had a lovely view of the canals in front. The room ended up being quite affordable ($125 per night, per couple) but we booked through hotels.ca. This location is wonderfully central to much that you would want to do in Amsterdam and we cannot recommend this place more. The staff were very courteous and knowledgeable. Some of the floors, however, can be difficult to navigate for the elderly or the disabled since there are many levels and stairs throughout, so if this is a concern, please be careful about which room you get. The breakfast, however, is way too expensive but there are some decent bistros nearby (though even these can be tricky to find).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A friend and I decided to pop over to Amsterdam for the weekend in Jan and found this hotel on hotels.com. Got it for a decent price. It is centrally located close to a lot of tourist destinations. The stay was decent...you get what you pay for. The hotel is a bit dated which is expected for Amsterdam. The room was somewhat clean but looked tired. We had two single beds and sheets on one of them had stains on it but those were changed. The washroom also looked dated...the shower curtain was too small for the tub so the water always managed to get on to the floor. The toilet was ready to break into pieces if you tried to use it. Overall it was mediocre nothing amazing, nothing terrible. I would recommend the hotel to others only if you want something to sleep at, nothing amazing. If I were to go back I'd probably try another hotel just because this one seemed very depressing. Our room was on the first floor. Try to get something higher up because you have a lot of people walking by late at night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel last minute for a weekend break. The hotel is very centrally situated close to attractions and tram lines. We had a triple room which was much larger than i expected and clean. The hotel could do with some general maintenance such as painting the walls and doors. The staff were very helpful and friendly. we didn't eat in the hotel as 8.5 euros each for breakfast seemed a lot. Only complaint i have is that unfortunately we required a doctor during our visit and even after telling the reception staff we had European health cards we were provided with a doctor who insisted on being paid. we were told to reclaim in the UK but having returned home we found out we should have started the claim in Amsterdam and that we may have been sent a private doctor who would not be covered. (he was also completely useless, took no medical history and gave us unsuitable pills cut off a strip with no information about them) All in all a good place to stay for a couple of days as long as you don't want luxury.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Greeted by a surly young female receptionist who allocated us a room that we did not book, she refused to re allocate to another room however the manager stepped in after hearing the altercation. 1st night woken at 5.00 am in the morning by next adjoining room hold a drinks and drug get together. It took 3 complaints to the nignt porter before the hotel staff did something about it. Exactly, the same thing happened next morning only when I argued with the hotel staff they should call the police did they bother to do anything about. Poor customer service of the lowest standard. The breakfast was a joke vastly understaffed in the restaurant I felt sorry for the 2 guys attempting to clear 30 tables as well as ensuring enough cutlery and food was available to guests the food slectoon was minimal and sometimes looked like it had been around for sometime. This hotel is being run on a shoestring and would not recommend it for location and customer service. The hotel was clean however it could not make up for the very bad points.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was a little noisy with the passing people on the canal but not to the point of keeping us awake because people maybe loud but they move past fairly quickly. The problem was the hotel and it's uncaring staff , with delivery/ collection times at 6.30am -7.15am directly under our window. I know deliveries have to take place, but when they are laughing shouting and having no concern for their residents I find this appalling. We asked for a canal facing room and I had read a few reviews that mentioned passing noise, we can live with that. But this was just total disregard for their paying guests. If you are considering this hotel either ask for a room on the fourth floor or away from the loading bay. Have no other complaints, it was clean ,breakfast ok, apart from having to queue like cattle going to milking to get a seat in the breakfast room (that was because we were late, because so tired from delivery disturbances). If you have booked this hotel contact them by telephone and request room away from loading bay. Ruth Clough Manchester</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We've just come back from a 2 night stay in the Rembrandt Centrum and it was a very pleasant stay we booked a triple room with two double beds and was given room 326 which faced the canal and was a very good size with a sofa bed as well as the two doubles, our radiator wasnt working and we were offered an alternative room or an electric heater, after seeing the alternative room we decided on the heater, as the room was in the attic of the hotel with very little head height and not acceptable if you happen to be taller than 5'8" (room 422), staff were friendly and helpful and as mentioned in other reviews the location is very good only minutes from the hussle and bussle but such a nice quiet street. We booked a non smoking room but it is obvious that guests flount the rules as there was a smell of smoke in our room and some burns to the carpet. The website we booked through advertised tea and coffee making facilities, they are available but at a cost of 5 euros a day. I would have no hesitation of recommending this hotel and would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel as a through lastminute.com It was one of those secret stays where you never get to see the name of the hotel until you've paid in full. So having taken the plunge we looked online to check out the hotel. We were quite impressed with the location and appearance of the rooms. But on arrival we were surprised to see that the photos online were nothing compared with that in real life. If you're a non-smoker I wouldn't reccomend this hotel as the lobby stinks of smoke coming from the lounge area. The rooms are tiny and from what I've read from other reviews, I see the dodgy central heating in the bathroom will never work. The walls are very thin and our hotel view was just like that of a prison. But there were good things about this hotel. The staff were very helpful. The bathroom was so clean you could of eaten your dinner off it. Shame about the poor plumbing works. ie no cold water. We noticed that it costs 600 euros per night if you walked in and asked for a room. If you want 4 or 5 star hotel, I suggest you stay in Dam Square.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Location was quite good, only about a 10 minute decent paced walk to the Dam (Amsterdam Center). We arrived a little later than expected (7pm) because we missed our flight in London (chalk that up to slow security), and when we got there we were informed we had been upgraded to a Canal view room (which made the morning view amazing!) from a standard double. While the price was a little higher than we would have wanted, upgrading us made it quite a bit better. The hotel staff spoke perfect english and were fairly helpful when we were asking information. The hotel was clean, but with the room, I would have liked if the heaters could have been turned up a little more (but it wasn't too big an inconvinience). The room was decently sized, but not big (but nicely sized for two people to have their suitcases open and still not having to step over them) If in Amsterdam, take the Free Walking tour (the end point is quite near the hotel, so its convinient if you get lost). Overall a good stay, and recommended (although book earlier than we did to get a better price).</p></li>

We booked a "canal-view".What a joke.The room was a broom cupboard.The double bed was pushed against the wall otherwise we couldn't get into the room.I lost the "flip the coin"to see who sleeps against the wall and had to climb into my side of the bed via the bottom.the windows only opened app 5 cm as the curtain rail was in the way.The bathroom was very smelly,the whole room had a dirty yellow colour and extremely drab.I wouldn't have minded,if we'd booked a cheap hotel,but 397 GBP for 4 nights is not cheap. The reception staff did offer us another room and we moved.It was much bigger,but no canal view ,infact we had a view into other peoples rooms and the reception from which the noise of loud talking,laughing staff was hugely annoying from 7 am til 12 midnight. The excuse we got from the staff to the reason why we couldn't have a room in the new tract with canal view was that we wanted a non-smoking room. I was completely gobsmacked ,that we couldn't have a nice room just because we were non smokers.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently returned from staying here for just one evening. Its location was great if you want to be slightly out of the craziness of the city centre, but only a 5minute walk to Dam Sq, 10min walk to Red Light District and the coffee shops. The room was clean, really nothing special..just fine! Found the staff to be quite rude. Not too friendly. They didnt have our booking in their system when we arrived and we were marched off to a waiting room without much explanation as to what was happening. Then we had to hand over 50euro as a deposit which wasnt mentioned at any point during our booking. When we got the deposit back, 3euro had been taken off for 'city tax' Err, cant say I have heard of this before!? And the day before we were assured we would get the whole 50euro back? Still on the plus side we were allowed to check in early, and they held our baggage for us after check out the next day. We booked on Trivago, and got it for Â£45, for that price, the hotel is great! But I would be a little gutted if we had paid anymore. Make sure you request a canal view also! We didnt..mistake!! All in all, it was just OK!! Enjoy your trip!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed one night - November 18, 2011. I was a bit nervous after booking this hotel for my boyfriend and I, because of some mixed reviews on this site, but after we arrived, I realized I'd made the right decision. It was one of few hotels that allowed only one night's stay. I booked the room for only 74 euros. 10-15 minute walk to Amsterdam Centraal Station. In the middle of the negen straatjes! Great shopping area. The room was a good size, not huge, but bigger than we needed. The hallways definitely smelled like marijuana, but to be honest, it didn't bother either of us. It's to be expected in the city. Our room was non-smoking and there was no smell inside. Linens were crisp and clean. The bathroom was nice, and a few toiletries were provided. There was a TV (although we never turned it on). And best of all, when we got into our room, we opened a window/door to discover that we had a small balcony! After we walked onto it, we realized that we were lucky enough to get the only balcony in the hotel, and as far as we could tell, the only one on the street. They safely stored our bags after we checked out the next day, free of charge.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked a single room at this hotel. On my arrival at noon, I was told that the check in time was at 2. No problem. I went to have lunch, when I came back, the checkin lasted half an hour, even though I was the only guest. Then they gave me a key and sent me to the room. The key did not function, came back to the reception, they gave me another key. It did not function neighter. Then they gave me another room saying that, it is very common for them to have this lock problem. When I entered the room, I realized that the room was not clean at all. There was a footprint on the bed. All the materials on the bed was from the middle age, for sure. The room does not have an AC, and as tiny as a queen size bed. As I was supposed to stay overnight, I did not change my hotel. If you do stay one single night, and do not intend to sleep in park, this hotel can be an option. Otherwise, it is better to stay in the station. The station will be quieter for sure. It is impossible to have a good sleep in the room as all the noise outside seem to occur in your room. By the way, If you want help from the reception, find Marian, the rest of the staff is like guardians.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent central canal-side location, just a very short walk to dam square - the centre of activity. Service very friendly throughout and cleanliness seems paramount. Room afforded plenty of space if a little basic (we didn't have a view) but all facilities fine. Breakfast (self serve) was certainly more than adequate with plenty of hot & cold food without restriction on amount! The surrounding area has plenty of different little shops to explore with eclectic tastes but watch out for the ubiquitous cyclists - at least they generally had the wit to ring their bells to warn you of their speedy arrival (from apparently) all directions! Liked? - All of it. Disliked? Canâ€™t really answer this one; nothing to say apart from keeping your wits about you when potential surcharges (city tax and breakfast charges) are mentioned - or subtly requested. We had booked with a travel company that included B & B and were prepared to pay the obligatory 'city tax' i.e. 5% of the accommodation charges but the final bill was discharged without any extras - perhaps we were, as ever very friendly in our approach and that helped? Thoroughly recommended for the price we paid!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having booked with Last Minute.com we were a little apprehensive as to what to expect. We flew with KLM - really impressed with the overall service - on the ground and in the air. The hotel is basic but very clean and overlooks a canal. Decided not to go for the breakfast in the hotel but had room service a few times and that was fine. We used the train from the airport to the hotel - both times - the train was on the platform and straight through - it takes approx. 20 minutes - train fare 16 euros return for two people - a bargain! From the station, we took a taxi - a little expensive for such a short journey - 1.9kms - charged 12 euros going to hotel and 10 euros back to the station. The location of the hotel was good if you don't mind walking - only minutes away from the main Dam square, Anne Franks House, Museums and Boat Trips. Eating out is about the same price as in the UK - don't expect a cheap meal out and you won't be disappointed afterall it is a city. The only thing I would say is that if you like a cup of tea or coffee, there are no facilities in the room. You can buy them at the bar or order in your room up until 10.30pm. Overall, a good city break for a couple of days.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I requested a non-smoking room, a high floor room and early check-in. The room was not available until 2.30pm. We were assigned Room No 4 on the ground floor. The room was a non-smoking room, however there was a constant odor of tobacco and alcohol on the corridor, especially in the mornings. I understand requests cannot be always guaranteed. I presented the hotel voucher at check-in. We completed the usual hotel details, authorisation of my credit card was requested, left our luggage and returned at 2.30pm. The receptionist who assigned us Room No 4 insisted that breakfast or city tax was not included in the booking. She was very rude and did not offer any apology when I referred to the hotel voucher and drew her attention to the booking details. As we were catching an early flight on Monday Dec 28th we checked out before 6am. I met the same receptionist who presented me with a bill for city tax and breakfast. Again I made reference to the hotel voucher, she shrugged her shoulders, returned to the computer and said city tax is never included in a booking and demanded â‚¬7. All other staff were helpful and friendly. Amsterdam is a wonderful city! We will be back soon but we certainly will not be staying at the Rembrandt Classic Hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I normally do a couple of mini cruises to Holland in the winter using P & O Ferries from Hull to Europoort & then onto Amsterdam for the day before reurning to the ship in the evening. This time we decided to stay over for an extra night to sample the night life & I couldn't have picked a better hotel for its location, comfort and service. We checked in on Friday 20 January 2012 one & a half hours before we were due to and there was no quibble from the friendly receptionist. Room G25 was fatastically spacious with a walk in wardrobe and very modern en suite with a king size divan that could have slept 4. The main room itself was airy with a high ceiling beautifully plastered & painted,which gave the appearance of a drawing room. This room was at the rear of the hotel, which afforded us peace & quiet, though being canal-side I can't imagine anyone having problems at the front either. The hotel has been given 3* status,which is well deserved. I booked the room for 71 Euros for the night and enjoyed a very tasty and varied breakfast for 8.50 Euros the morning after. The staff are courteous and efficient and the hospitality second to none. I would recommend this establishment to anyone & hope to do a return visit in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just came back last Monday, and after the shocking reviews regarding bed bugs, I must say - nothing alike. The hotel is very nice, breakfast was very generous, but arriving during the rush hour might result in waiting for a new bottle of water, or more croissants for 10 minutes. Another problem other people found was the size of the room - make sure not to get a twin room, since for some reason the took rooms that were supposed to be single rooms, ans shoved a big bed (well, not that big) in them, the result is extremely crowded. - request for a double bed, and you'll get a larger room with a normal size of a bed. The hotel is located 3 minutes from Dam square, so you get a great location for a night out (both Dam and Spui are within a short walking distance), most of the touristic things are also withing a short walking distance, and almost all tram lines reach the Dam, so you can basically get anywhere in the city very easily. Rooms are clean, and nice. for a three stars hotel we got everything we've expected and more. The staff - well, except for one receptionist that seemed to have a mental problem to really be helpful, all the rest were amazing, and did anything they could to help and explain.They also have a wide variety of languages spoken, which could be very helpful.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from spending three nights at this hotel. Had a twin room on the first floor with a view to the canal. I paid a few extra euro for this prior to going, but you might be able to a deal on the phone. The room was clean and roomy enough, but the bathroom was a bit on the small side. No air conditioning and the weather was very hot, but had no trouble getting to sleep as most of the days were spent walking and sightseeing. Breakfast was perfectly adequate, with the usual variety of rolls, cold meats, cheese, eggs, cereal, fruit, juice and tea and coffee. There is a full concierge sevice at which you can book trips etc. There is a bit of work going on outside, but when I was there it was a distance away from the hotel. However, there is an amount of sand from the work outside the hotel and the footpath is of a temporary nature. Have to say this did not detract from our enjoyment. The hotel is in a very quiet area with a few cafes nearby if you fancy a late drink. It is only a five minute walk from Dam Square, and not that far from the Flower Market and Anne Frank house. I would recommend the Rembrandt Residence to anyone looking for a reasonably priced (for Amsterdam) hotel. Finally, there is an excellent restaurant about five minutes to the left down the Herengracht. It is called 'De Admiraal' where you can enjoy a good meal away from the crowds.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Rembrandt classic hotel from 23 - 26 March 2012. Our twin room was fairly small but as we planned to be out for most of the day, more than adequate for us. No great view, but again, that didn't really matter. The beds were clean and comfortable. The pillows were a bit on the small side, but OK. Bathroom was clean and had shower over the bath. Plenty of hot water and good quality complimentary toiletries provided. Buffet style breakfast was good. Plenty of choice and always some hot choices as well as the usual croissants, pastries, cakes, fresh fruit and cereals. There were always scrambled eggs and the hotel seemed to alternate between very well cooked smoked bacon and small sausages, The quality of the coffee at breakfast was rather poor, however. We found the staff to be extremely helpful, providing us with city maps and writing on them so we would recognise landmarks - this was really good as Amsterdam is easy to get lost in. The staff struck a good balance between politeness and friendliness and invited us to ask them if we had any queries. This hotel is away from the main tourist squares, which is actually a good thing as this means it is quiet in the evenings, while still being only a few minutes' walk from decent bars, cafes, restaurants and coffee shops. The hotel came at a great price and I will definitely stay there again if visiting Amsterdam</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is rubbish. We stayed for two nights after seeing it on hotel.com. We had to put up with a broken showerhead and a terrible breakfast. This we could deal with but the worst was the fact that we were bitten by bedbugs. When I complained I was told that I must have brought them into the hotel with me!!! The manager was patronizing and insincere and absolutely refused to acknowledge that there were bedbugs in the room, even though he'd already admitted there'd been 3 cases of bedbugs reported this year alone. He said that it takes two days for the bites to become visible and that I need to wash all my clothes so I don't infect the next hotel we stay at. I was floored and explained that we had already had our clothes washed the day before and that I was wearing new pyjamas. I also showed him my bites that had appeared that morning as a result of scratching all night. He said that they were old marks! Whaaat?! I expected some compensation, even a discount off breakfast, I would have been happy with that. But to have absolutely nothing but excuses and insulting comments made the whole stay in Amsterdam very disappointing. They advertise that the rooms are normally 400 euro and discounted to 160 euro but the rooms are rubbish and definitely not worth 400. This is simply a ploy to make people think they are getting a bargain. It certainly fooled me. I do not recommend this hotel at all.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “OK, but look out for the mice!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'll start with the good things. First, this hotel has a great location in easy walking distance of good restaurants, historic sites and tram stops. The staff is very friendly and cordial and it's reasonably priced. On the downside, the interior of the hotel has a slightly run down look to it. The halls smell of smoke and the beds are way too squishy. But the biggest problem is with rodents. Yes, there are mice in this hotel. I was there in late March, early April this year with two of my friends. Long story short, they were coming out through a hole in the wall behind a dresser. I suspect that rather than plug the holes in the wall, they just put the dresser in front of it. Whatever the case, I complained to the manager and he acknowleged the problem but didn't have another room to put us in. Instead, he offered me towels which I used to jam between the wall and the cabinet to keep the mouse from entering the room. The mouse didn't like that! He scratched and squealed for about an hour, making it impossible for me to sleep. Finally, he gave up and retreated back into his hole in the wall. Another problem I had was that the underside of my bedcover was sprinkled with nasty unidentified stains. I complained and the staff replaced them, but this should not have happened in the first place. All things considered, it wasn't a bad place but the thought of sleeping among rodents disgusts me and I won't be going again.</p></li>

<li>I was there in late March, early April this year with two of my friends.</br>
<span style="background-color:#f032e6">OTHER</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Long story short, they were coming out through a hole in the wall behind a dresser.</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 0.998&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>I suspect that rather than plug the holes in the wall, they just put the dresser in front of it.</br>

<li>Whatever the case, I complained to the manager and he acknowleged the problem but didn't have another room to put us in.</br>
<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 0.972&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Instead, he offered me towels which I used to jam between the wall and the cabinet to keep the mouse from entering the room.</br>

<li>The mouse didn't like that!</br>

<li>He scratched and squealed for about an hour, making it impossible for me to sleep.</br>

<li>Finally, he gave up and retreated back into his hole in the wall.</br>

<li>Another problem I had was that the underside of my bedcover was sprinkled with nasty unidentified stains.</br>

<li>I complained and the staff replaced them, but this should not have happened in the first place.</br>

<li>All things considered, it wasn't a bad place but the thought of sleeping among rodents disgusts me and I won't be going again.</br>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Fab Four Recommends Rembrandt Classic Hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Travelled to Amsterdam with husband and close friends. Flew Easyjet and booked hotel through Easyjet website. As it was only a 3 night stay we were not too worried about where to stay as long as cheap and cheerful. We definately came up trumps. There is nothing bad to say about this hotel whatsoever. Breakfast was excellent, and so much choice, lots of fruit, even bacon and scrambled eggs. All linen was spotless, pure white towels, very spacious rooms overlooking the canal, very quiet location but only a 5 minute walk to Dam Square, Anne Frank House and a Canal Bus Stop. The Canal hop and off bus is a must. Takes you to all the attractions and a very good commentary on the way. Once you buy your ticket it last until 12 noon the following day, well worth it. We had to take a trip into the Red Light District as did most tourists. As a female I have to say I did not feel threatened and saw no bad behaviour. Another must trip is the Henniken Experience. It cost about 15 Euros each but it is a fun trip with a couple of free samples of Henniken. You can email videos of yourself to friends singing or just a happy wish you were here video. Great fun!! Amsterdam is very expensive so make sure you are prepared to spend a little - shops are the same as almost everywhere, but hopefully if you are on a short trip the attractions will keep you busy. Will definately go back, perhaps early Summer whereby you could sit outside the bars and people watch.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">ROOM WAS BAKING due to hot water pipes running through the room, it was so hot I was sweating so opened the windows and had a noise group of people staying in a room opposite making AN ABSOLUTE RACKET till 04:30am, the noise is not the hotel's fault but the reason for me having to open the windows WAS. I woke up very hot and thirsty at 23:50 and asked the person on reception if I can buy a bottle of water from the bar, which was directly opposite reception, despite there being no other customers to deal with, the answer was "no, the bar closes at 11pm", which I found very dissapointing. Worse still was he neglected to say there was a vending machine in the breakfast area, which I noticed the next morning. The receptionist during the day (young lady) was very helpful, the night receptionist person was very unhelpful and made no effort at all to help or show any endeavour. I was there late September, DONT EVEN THINK OF STAYING HERE IN THE SUMMER WITH THE ADDED HEAT. JUST DONT!!!!! Otherwise, the bed was OK (just) quite springy and old. Normal hotel TV channels. Old decor but ok. Clean enough. Breakfast was ok but will not meet most people's expectations due to choice. Bath was fine but toilet has very little space, Im 5 '9, 65Kg and was ok but if youre on the large side you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE TOILET as its between the wall and bath. Everything else ok, but the negatives were in just too important areas. Mainly the bread oven like room and old bed matress.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a nice hotel on herengracht which means you are based on "the nine streets". If you want a nice clean comfortable hotel away from the masses and louts around dam square this is one for you. The area is much more atmospheric than that area and cleaner and more peaceful with plenty of lovely restaurants and funky bars.It is on the edge of the jordaan which is the nicest part of the city.There are also lots of vintage clothes stores and independent boutigues and shoe shops The hotel is clean and has everything you need ( but no internet room/cafe if you want to pre check in on line) it is not glamourous or anything but the rooms are a good size for amsterdam where the hotel rooms as a rule are small. The bathroom was spotless as was the bedlinen and towels etc. We were given the canal view we asked for and we found the staff helpful and friendly. This is a non smoking hotel in line with EU Law so the smoking smell mentioned by another reviewer is not an issue any longer. They will also lend you an umbrella if it is raining which is nice. I would not bother with breakfast in the hotel as there are plenty of cafes nearby check out teh lovely Pancakes! pancake house which is on Berenstraad only a 5-10 minute walk away instead. You can book on their own website and this was a lower price as the prices I found with the usual internet providers so it is worth checking out their own website to see what price they are offering All in all I would really recommend this hotel for location and service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading some reviews on here we were a little worried about going to this hotel. However we were pleasantly surprised. We arrived at around 11am and were able to check in early which was a relief as we were shattered!! The Customer service was very good, the staff all seemed very friendly. The room was quite small and could of been a bit larger for the amount of money we paid, however it was clean and comfortable. The nets and curtains were quite a disgrace if im honest...didnt close properly and seemed dirty and had a lot of holes....a let down for the room. The bathroom was clean and there was a good shower!! There was some noise to be heard from our room, not sure if this was because we were right by the front desk/entrance?...noise from people and working..ie drills!! but it wasnt too bad. Also the printers were not working at the internet station...we needed these to print off our boarding passes! wasnt told this until we had put our money in to print!! However we were able to use the check in desk computer because of what we were printing....but no sign of a refund for our lost money in the printer :-( Also they add on city tax to the total cost of the stay, which wasnt loads, but not at all mentioned when booking so be sure to take a little extra, we paid an extra 10euro..also make sure you have change or exact amount for the total cost of your stay as we were not allowed our change until we left???? not sure why?? Overall a very good hotel in a lovely area, about 10 mins from leidseplein and dam square!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel during the recent IBC. My room was ready before 14h00. I'm sure the staff saw that after 11 hrs flight I was tired and sweaty. They were very friendly and helpful, and I really have to mention the night sstaff(vincent_ from brazil) was excellent from giving me tram tickets to organizing an itenary for me to follow so I could see something of amsterdam while working. The breakfast was excellent especiallyand the poffertjies and the brealfast staff was cordial and friendly. From the overworked porter/barman, to the cleaners and the front of house staff (edward and vincent(I hope I have the names right) I was treated and a friendly manner. For a single woman travelling for business it made me feel safe and welcome in a strange country. The room was great on the 4th floor spacious and very clean. And the best of all was the location.it was so close to everything that I could fit work and pleasure in. Do not miss the tapas bar in spuy street excellent for dinner. Enjoy this interesting city. I loved my stay. I will definitely come back and i will definitely stay in this lovely hotel. Having stayed in other hotels in europe, this is up to par with 3star and a very comfortable stay. I read reviews of the hotel before i went and can honestly say dont read the bad ones, none of the horror stories happened to me. I can imagine if you havent stayed in europe before you might expect something different. Bear in mind this is 3 star therefore you wont receive 5 star ammenities, but you will receive 5 star treatment from the staff. Treat them with respect and you might receive the same.Thanx</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I flew into the Amsterdam Airport and took the train into the Central Station. From there, it took about 15 minutes to walk to the Hotel. We could've taken the bus, but we figured we'd be able to take in more of the atmosphere by walking. Very easy to find. Check in was smooth. Everyone spoke excellent English. Front desk staff was very friendly and courteous. Upon bumping into them later, they remembered my name. Asked for a room with a view and got one. Room had a faint bit of smoke but not like a Motel 6 or anything like that. Very high ceiling, which made the room seem a lot bigger. But it was a decent size in its own right. Our room was on the ground floor and right above the back door, so when the staff went out for breaks, we'd get loud conversation and smoke (when our windows were open). Granted, it only happened in the late mornings and afternoons and never at night. We only noticed it when we slept in or when we came back to the hotel for an afternoon nap. Didn't have the hotel breakfast, but there's a nice organic restaurant a block or two south of here. One of the other reviewers mentioned it. Forgot the name, but it's quite good. Try the omelette. And even when they were closed, we headed west and found a pub-like place that had great food despite looking a bit dark. Location is excellent. On a quiet street but extremely close to Dam Square. The Anne Frank house and Westkirk are also within close striking distance. We just walked everywhere, as central Amsterdam is quite compact. If we can find a good deal online again like we did this time, we'd definitely stay here for our next visit.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “No shower, naked man sleeping in my room”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In 2006, I had a great experience at this hotel- but, back then, it was under the ownership of people who cared to keep up this hotel. No longer the case. I checked in after a long night of traveling and was given a room on an upper floor. Looked fine, until I went in the bathroom. Due to the sloping of the ceiling on that particular room, there was no shower- just a tub and a shower head about 2 feet off the ground. It's Europe, and that's fine- except I'm 6'1" and had I known I was getting a room without a proper shower I'd have booked somewhere else. I politely asked the front desk if I could be changed to another room that had a full shower and was told they were entirely full. A few minutes later the attendant returned to the desk and said he found a room with a shower, albeit a single bed. That was fine with me (even though I had paid for a King room) and I went up to the room to go to bed. No sooner did I open the door did I see a sleeping, naked man in the bed in front of me. Luckily I didn't wake him or there would be another terrible review of this hotel from HIS perspective. This should have ended it- but the attendant insisted that because the room was booked through a third party, there was no getting out of paying for my stay. I quickly booked at another hotel- who would stay there after that? To this day they have not issued a refund to the third party vendor, GetaRoom.com. Exactly who do you think you're fooling when you 1) try to sell rooms that have no showers as full-price rooms and 2) give out keys to rooms that are already occupied? Will we not find out, and worse yet post this on TripAdvisor?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked 1 double room through the hotel's website. Because of a connection failure on the time of the booking, the system booked 2 rooms without me realising so, even though I received 2 confirmation e-mails. Actually I though they were for the same room. So when we arrived they gave us 2 rooms, I told them it was a mistake, in the begining they were saying they can't do nothing about it but finally they agreed to cancel the 2nd room. Then we went to our room which was very small with a semi double bed , no way a double room and view of a interior yard. We could barely fit in! So next morning I asked from a very polite girl at the reception if it was possible to move to a bigger room and even pay extra if needed. She gave us a penthouse ( 4th floor ) canal view room without any extra charge! The room was nice, comfortable with a bathtub bathroom and beautiful view of the canal and the city! The room was clean every day and the breakfast was good and had a variety. Staff was mostly polite and helpful. But the best part is the location! The hotel is located on a beautiful and quiet canal but still just 5 minutes walk to the Damrak square! All the main attractions are within walking distance, for 6 days we didn't use anything but our foot, not even a bicycle! And at the end of every day we had a nice sleep, no noise or something. Overall is a good choice if you get one of the good rooms, which are the ones with a canal view and if on the 4th floor even better. I would go back if it was for the same room, I think it was 422 but not sure, or similar but if it was for something like the room I got at first, I would look for an other place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a charming, 3 star, canal-side hotel in central Amsterdam, a few minutes walk from Dam Square and therefore, most of Amsterdam's tourist attractions. First impressions of the hotel are favourable. The foyer/reception area is very pleasant and the staff are both friendly and helpful. There are approximately 75 rooms, spread over 4 floors - the upper floors being accessible by elevators. Our double room on the 4th floor was reasonably spacious with double bed, bedside tables, wardrobe, dressing table, occassional table and satellite television, with the option for pay-as-you-go private channels, should the regular fare not be to your taste!! The bathroom was small, comprising of wc, washbasin and bath with overhead shower. There was a plentiful supply of piping hot water all day long. Towels, toiletries and bed linen were refreshed daily. Being on the top floor of a traditional canal side building, there were two wooden beams which intruded somewhat into the room space. I presume that this would be the same in all of the rooms on the top floor, but this is a part of the character of the building. Canal-side rooms have french windows which open out and overlook the charming Herengracht Canal, so, if you have the option, I recommend you request a room with a canal view. The room charge included breakfast, which was served in the pleasant breakfast room at canal level. It was a typical continental buffet-style breakfast, comprising of the usual, cereal, yogurts, ham and cheese, scrambled/boiled eggs, fresh fruit, a variety of breads and fruit juices and coffee/tea. More than enough for the average person! If you are intending to visit Amsterdam, I recommend you sample this hotel which is good value for money.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just back from 2 nights in the rembrandt classic and was very pleasantly surprised. We paid â‚¬40 each per night excluding breakfast. The room (326) was very big for amsterdam, the beds were really comfortable with lovely pillows. The building itself is quiet old and the decor is a bit dated but for the price we paid we would absolutely stay here again. The room itself over looked the canal and there was a safe box for no additional cost. We were able to check in early and found the staff helpful, they even brought a bucket of ice up to the room for us to chill our own wine and rang around various restaurants to make our reservations. We did have a bit of trouble checking out though as we were told that our credit card was only authorised and payment had not gone through.. after a bit of arguing (we had paid on arrival) they agreed that the payment had in fact been processed. Location is excellent and we did not hear any noise from either any other rooms or from the street. Anyone visiting Amsterdam should beware the taxi drivers.. If they think your a tourist they will try to rip you off.. should only cost about 7.50 - 10 per trip around the city centre.. we had 2 separate taxi drivers trying to charge our group â‚¬5 each! Rembrandtplein is great for nightlife even on a Sunday when things are generally very quiet and is about 5 mins in a taxi. The only downside about this hotel was that we could not smoke and had to go down 3 floors to stand out in the blustering wind as there was no smoking area given that it is an old building. Free wifi for 30 mins with charge after that but we could not actually get the internet to connect, possibly due to the bad weather. Cant wait to come back again and will stay in this hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Rembrandt Classic Hotel in Amsterdam for two nights in June 2011 to attend a conference. This is a decent little hotel in a fantastic central location in Amsterdam for a good price. The hotel is located by a river, amongst cobblestone streets and traditional Dutch buildings. Amsterdam is an interesting city, and has a real personality of its own and is quite a pretty city. I arrived in Amsterdam by car and had no idea what problem parking was. The hotel had no parking but they offered a great solution for me: hotel staff arranged a type of valet service. A parking attendant came to pick up my car and took it to a garage outside the city. And when you want your car again, you just call and wait for about 20 minutes for them to bring it back. A brilliant solution to local parking problems! This classic Dutch building has lovely exteriors but is perhaps not in the best shape on the inside. The reception area felt a little less updated than my room, which was clean and fresh. Check-in could perhaps have been a bit more efficient. The interiors of the hotel was fairly basic North European hotel-design and perhaps not the most inspirational, but the location was great and its a fully decent hotel. My single room was on the first floor, small but not cramped, comfortable, qiuet, and had two lovely tall classic windows and a comfortable bed. Breakfast was included in the rate and was modest but sufficient. Be prepared to orient yourself in Amsterdam and bring a map and your hotel address once you leave the hotel, because its easy to get lost amongst all the waterways and roads if you have never been to Amsterdam before. Would I recommend the Rembrandt Classic Hotel? Yes. You get a small rate for an older hotel in a great location where you'd probably pay much more in other hotels. And the staff is helpful too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Rembrandt Classic Hotel was an interesting choice. When I checked in 3 employees were at the desk while 6 customers waited to check in/check out. One of them disappeared to the back room, one decided it was time to check and fill all the staplers. So after about 40 minutes, I got checked in. The room was very small, (about 1/3 of the size of most cheap chains in America) The windows were old and there was a constant breeze coming in and even with the heat cranked up, it was cold. They brought up a space heater which did the trick. The staff are very friendly. The breakfast was pretty reasonable at 8.50Euros. When the employee brought up the space heater and came to check the room out, he just used his key and came on in (even with the Do Not Disturb on the door) he never knocked or anything. I thought it was very rude and disrespectful to a guest to not at least knock first. Once you learn the hotel location, everything is a 10 minute walk, so no need to ride the trams. Even though the room was small it was clean and comfortable, and the bed was even a good night's rest. Overall I would recommend Rembrandt Classic Hotel, just don't expect American type service from the employees and don't be afraid to ask for an extra heater. (Ice is also available, but it takes about 10 minutes for an employee to get it for you.) oh, by the way, the room doors slam shut on a spring action, so it's not uncommon to hear doors slamming all day and night as people enter/exit their rooms, so if you're a light sleeper this might be a problem. When I was awake and didn't know what was going on, I just thought some kids were being disrespectful, but all of the doors seem to slam the same way. This property is not handicapped accessible. There are about 12 stairs up to get into the hotel, however there is an elevator once inside. Disabled travelers be advised.</p></li>
