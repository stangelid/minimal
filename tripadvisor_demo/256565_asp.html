The internet tariff was so expensive (11$ one hour, 22$ a day), that we can think that Australia was an under developped country.</p></li>

Cross the street was the Hyde Park, within walking distance to darling harbor (about 20 minutes), to Sydney Opera House and Circular Quay (about half an hour). Since we have a car, and it was very convenient for us that this hotel could provide a parking spot. Parking in Sydney was NOT easy. Simple breakfast was also included.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel was a good price, conveniently situated on free bus route, across the road from train station, easy walking to monorail, all of attractions in Botanical Gardens. Only provides basic breakfast (cereal, toast, fruit & juice) but suited us as we did not want to waste too much time on breakfast, but get going and explore. You will need to be able to put up with some traffic noise ( mainly sirens ).</p></li>

(we have a Holden Astra, I couldn't imagine parking one of those large 4 x 4). However, if you don't mind a bit of manoeuvring, hey free parking. The second criticism would be the sun coming through the curtains, but for early risers that wouldn't be a problem. The Hotel a little old fashioned but clean, central and good value.</p></li>

For the price of $176 per night for a deluxe room for two of us, this is hard to beat in Sydney. We had read about some rooms being noisy - the 7th floor was OK.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You really could not ask for a better location in Sydney. Pretty much everything you might want to see is within easy walking distance, and you are right across the street from a great park, which is essentially contiguous with the Botanic Gardens. The room was very comfortable (being from the USA, I am generally not used to hotel rooms with kitchens, so I always consider it a bonus), the bed was great, and it had a little balcony with a nice view of Hyde Park. Also the free parking garage was a great bonus.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location of the HPI allows for easy walking to CBD attractions. The staff were very helpful and didn't hesitate allowing an early check-in after a 15 hr flight. Stayed at the start and end of a month long trip on the 10th and 12th floors. Noise not a big issue and the kitchenette was a huge plus. The only downsides: Like most hotels in Australia you must pay for internet, and the beds were a little firm. Overall, the Hyde Park Inn is good value compared to other CBD hotels, and we wouldn't hesitate to stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for 6 nights in this hotel, very good value and good location. Breakfast provided in your room, this saved going out and finding somewhere to eat in the morning. The hotel is on Elizabeth street and the free bus 555 runs past it down to circular quay. Very noisy outside the hotel and lots of shops and cheap eating places nearby. Our room wasn't made up on 2 days, luckily we weren't messy people so tidied our own room up ! If you stay here make sure you look out of the window at dusk to see the bats flying past</p></li>

Housekeeping not that good, towels not changed even when left in the bathtub, but that said really nothing to complain about.

The hotel is good basis to explore the city, the hotel is quite central and opposite Museum railway station. Staff is ok, not overly friendly but still service-minded. No complaints.

However, there are very many places very nearby. We had a superior room in the fourth floor. The room was very big and had a small kitchen in it. There also was a sofa. All in all very comfortable and quiet. The hotel is close to the Museum metro station and can be very easily reached from the airport. The staff was very helpful.</p></li>

Our room had a very workable kitchenette and a view to Hyde Park across Elizabeth Street. The room was quiet in spite of the location. The bathroom was 'like new'. Not a lot of frills, but great value for the money. One must reserve well ahead of time as word is spreading about this reinvented hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for one night in a deluxe studio. My room faced Hyde Park and it is a stunning view where you can see all the way to the heads in the Harbour. Room was clean and comfortable with its own small kitchen, table and chairs, couch and two beds. Bathroom was a little small and outdated but very clean. Would highly recommend if you were staying in Sydney for a couple of days or weeks as it is walking distance to the harbour and on the edge of the cbd and with the kitchenette it is perfect for making your own meals and saving a little money :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just stayed with my two daughters for three nights at this hotel. Such a great location. Clean rooms, great breakfast (more than enough each day). Yes once again you do hear the traffic a bit but I used cheap ear plugs and heard nothing & my girls slept though each night no worries. The reception staff always answered any questions we had and were more than helpful and always pleasant. I would highly recommend this hotel and for the price well worth it. I don't know what anybody would want more from a hotel. I will stay for sure when I next return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location is wonderful with the museum train stop right across the street. There is a monorail stop fairly close by at the World Square. Our two-bedroom unit overlooked the ANZAC memorial in Hyde Park. It was a bit noisy and hopefully the renovation will include thicker windows. Given the location in Sydney, the price was great for us. The front desk were friendly although a bit weird about using their "business center" computers for internet access. The laundry was located on the ground floor, but not easy to find. It was an enjoyable stay here and I would return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hyde Park Inn is a great place to stay, as it is so close to everything that Sydney has to offer, We were on the 7th floor and had lovely views from our Balcony over Hyde Park and beyond. Check in was handled well by the 2 male staff on duty, who were pleasant and helpful. Unfortunately, we didn't receive quite such nice service from the female staff on checking out. We didn't get asked if we had enjoyed our stay, or if everything was ok. Looking forward to seeing bathroom refurb next time we visit as they are badly lacking in shelving of any sort to put toiletries on.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great room - one queen and one single bed. Cooking facilities and en suite. Reasonable rate. (We stayed here having extensively reviewed Trip Advisor). Only criticism is there isn't a communal area - lounge or bar or dining room - though there is an adjacent and adjoining restaurant - so no real chance of interacting with other guests. Also a wonderful pasta bar a few doors up the road - delicious ready made meals to be taken back to the room and heated in the microwave. There was a very small lounge, smaller than our bedroom, where we could rest having checked out. However it was perfect for our needs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The family rooms in this hotel are outstanding! I traveled with my three children and we each had our own bed (one slept on the sleeper sofa). Plus, each room had a kitchnette. Breakfast is basic: cereal, choice, toast, diced peaches....but enough to get you started for the day. It is directly across from the Museum city rail (train) stop so very easy to get to. We walked to the Opera Hosue from here but it is a good walk probably 30-40 minutes. In addition, the staff was excellent. They helped with arrangements and let me print off plane tickets for free from internet room. You can't go wrong staying here with a family!</p></li>

Also if you do choose to use this hotel make sure that you get the quote in writing as they charged us almost $50 a night more than was quoted on the phone.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel faces the beautiful Hyde Park. Walking distance to Chinatown (10 mins) & Pitts St Mall (10 mins). Very near to Museum subway station. Try to get the deluxe room, which has slightly larger kitchen & nicer furnishing. The good thing about this hotel is that it provides breakfast (cereal, bread, milk, juices, etc) in the frig for guests to consume. So you can slowly eat your breakfast in your room while enjoying the beautiful view of hyde park. The only problem we encountered in this hotel is the car park. It has limited lots & you need to reserve them while doing your booking with the hotel. You need to check-out by 10am.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed there with my parents. Excellent Location right in front of the Hyde Park Anzac Memorial. All the local attractions are close by, walking distance to Sydney Tower. Room was big enough. Had requested for a smoking room - which we got (very hard to find them these days). B/F is nothing grand, but then it serves the purpose. Our room had a small kitchen with all the amenities to cook your meal. The hotel has recently undergone renovations earlier this year. View from the room was just awesome (we were on the 12th floor). Staff were very friendly, and were able to help us with everything. Underground car park available on site.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were a little unsure about staying at this hotel as we'd read some mixed reviews, but its location and good price was the determining factor. We found the staff to be extremely helpful, and nothing was too much trouble for them. Having heard that we'd been ripped off by the taxi driver who drove us to the hotel from Sydney Airport - they arranged for a taxi driver they knew to take us to the airport at the conclusion of our stay. Our room was spacious and clean and had a good view over Hyde Park. The hotel is ideally located for the harbour and opera house, and some excellent Asian restaurants can be found just behind the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed for one night with 3 of my children, to attend a performance at the opera house. The room was a great size, and immaculate, with everything we needed, plus an amazing view!! The breakfast provided was a great touch, as I was on my own with the kids it made our stay so much easier, and the servings were definitely adequate. The location was great, and made it so easy to get to circular quay, and I didn't find the noise to be that disturbing. We were in floor 14, but I had the balcony door open about a quarter, and all 3 kids slept soundly. I loved that there was a DVD player too, as the place we stayed last year did not provide one.</p></li>

The rooms are quite spacious with a queen bed and a single bed. There is a kitchenette with a fridge, microwave and electric stove. The room was very clean and tidy. We had a view over Hyde Park. Traffic noise was noticable but not disturbing. We were on the 8th floor. The staff were very helpful and friendly and the car park is definetly not made for large cars. At present they have refurbishment works taking place. We were warned about this before we booked but we did not have any problems with this work taking place. We will be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this hotel based on Tripadvisor reviews and we were not disappointed. We had the deluxe suite on the tenth floor overlooking the park. The kitchen had a nice view overlooking the park and there was a small balcony (good for watching the fruit bats at night). We had no problems with noise except for a few sirens at night. Breakfast was enough for us- toast, juice, cereal and fruit cup. A newspaper as well. We were in walking distance of Darling Harbour as well as the Opera house. There was also one of those free 555 buses that passes by but we did not use it..My only complaint is that I had a bit of a problem getting the right temperature in the shower. I would highly reocommend it and will stay again.</p></li>

Incredibly quiet, but lack of free wifi was annoying, although this lack was common throughout Australia. There is a pasta takeout place a few doors down. We picked up dinner, moved the chairs to the balcony and had a great dinner one night. Although they provide some basic breakfast supplies, we found Cafe 255 a few doors down had free wifi and good food, reasonable prices and great service. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

View over Hyde Park nice. Museum Station virtually across the road. Breakfast ample and good plus saved us having to go find breakfast each morning. Room cleaned daily. Huge benefit for us was washer/dryer facilities as only had 20kg baggage allowance - and you know us girls!! Stored our baggage until early evening on the last day for us no problem. All in all we couldn't have picked a better place to stay whilst in Sydney to get married and wouldn't hesitate to reccomend the Hyde Park Inn to people.</p></li>

We were upgraded to a larger room with a kitchen, sofa and table & chairs which we really appreciated. The room was nice and quite roomy - the decor was a bit tired but they were in the process of updating the rooms on the lower floors at the time. It was too noisy to have the window open long but the air con made it nice and cool anyway even though it was boiling outside! the staff were really really helpful, felt really well looked after. The location was great and we were able to explore the whole city on foot from kings cross to darling harbour. There was no bar or restaurant but there was so much on the doorstep in didn't matter in the slightest. After so long away from home we really appreciated the kitchen area and sofa to relax!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed there with my friends after a conference. The hotel is conveniently situated close to the metro station, restaurants, cafes, Chinatown, QVB, Hyde Park, coach stop for tours etc. All are within walking distance. We could walk back safely from restaurants or Chinatown after dinner without need to go through small streets. We booked 3 rooms, one for 3 persons, one for 2 and one single room. The rooms were slightly outdated and the lights were a bit too dim. Kitchen facilities were available and we could prepare our own breakfast, which was actually very good for us. Rooms were quiet despite close to various spots mentioned above. Staff were generally helpful. Most importantly, the price was very reasonable and we all think it worths all the $$ that we paid. I would recommend this hotel given the very reasonable price and quality.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed one night in a two bedroom apartment. Location excellent - lots of great restaurants nearby, park and train station across the street (note there is no lift at the station and a lot of stairs - if you are 2 people, it's only $20 more to take a taxi vs train to the airport). Lobby is modern however rooms look outdated in particular the bathroom. Rooms, bathroom, and kitchen were all very bland looking with the furniture, lighting, and decorations. Bed was comfortable, shower low pressure. Second bedroom's AC started making a very loud noise just before bed and had to be turned off. Satellite wasn't coming in properly on TV in living room. Nice to get continental breakfast in fridge for the following morning - breads with butter/jam, cereals, fruit cups, and OJ/milks. Reception staff were very friendly and helpful. It's a comfortable place to stay in a great location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed 4 nights and chose the hotel for 2 reasons. The location is Elizabeth St ,across the road from Hyde park and Museum station,only 15 mins by train from the airport.It is about 10-15 mins walk to Circular Quay or one train station.It is not far to walk to Central station (one station) or Chinatown. The free city loop bus 555 goes past and is great but has limited hours. I also wanted a studio rather than a hotel room.There was one single bed and one double bed,a sofa and chair,small dining table and a kitchen bench with microwave.It was a very comfortable room but the only negative was very uncomfortable (hard and irregular) beds which need replacing.If the beds were comfortable I would have given 5 stars.Parts of the hotel are being refurbished so maybe they will get new beds.They provide basic provisionsfor a light breakfast that can be supllemented from the large Woolworths supermarket nearby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in a family room which had 3 single beds and 1 double. The kitchenette was perfect, had all we required. Check in was fast - they provided maps and details on bus stops etc... Every question I asked (where is closest supermarket etc) was always answered with a smile and then they marked it on my map for me. Bfast was provided in your fridge (bread, spreads, cereal, fruit, milk) - it was more than we needed, so we used the bread to make the kids sandwhiches for the day. Free laundry facilities were very handy, especially when travelling with young kids. Only thing that would have been good, would be baths in the bathrooms - a bath for the kids and for the parents tired muscles after sightseeing would have been great. Highly recommend the place - will definately be back. Rooms were good value for central Sydney. Position was great - close to darling harbour, china town, museums, circular key etc.</p></li>

Booked parking, told it wouldn't be a problem, then when we arrived at 7.30 at night, found we had to park over at the Marriott, and walk back in the dark and the rain...not happy jan. Carpark is way too small, i could barely fit my Corolla in the carparks. Staff were rude at the front desk, even though i had already paid and they had my credit card details, i still had to leave a cash deposit. Room was noisy because of the renovations.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were a family of five, traveling to Sydney for vacation. We wanted to stay in one room, i.e. an apartment-type room. Hyde Park was well able to accommodate us. Even with three beds in the room it was reasonably comfortable for us. Everything was VERY clean. The continental breakfast was much appreciated, as well as the kitchnette set-up that allowed us to have small meals or snacks in the room. The beds were very comfortable, and we all slept through the night the first two nights. Once we were over our jet lag however, the street noise started to be a problem. There is a fire station one block away, and they seemed to be particularly busy one evening. I thought the location was great; very central. The buses make getting around Sydney very easy. The staff was very nice, and happy to help with all questions. We utilized the Laundry room and the Business (computer) center; great features to take advantage of.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in a family room on the 14th floor overlooking Hyde Park room 146 was excellent. Continental Breakfast supplied cereal,milk,juice,fruit,toast and spreads really good value rooms cleaned daily by excellent staff the reception staff could not be faulted will definately stay here again. I have never stayed in a hotel where i could say all the staff were of the highest quality well done guys they went out of their way to make you feel welcome I arrived on an early flight and was taken to a day room with tv,couches,tea/coffee whilst waiting for my room thanks again. Free carparking was a bonus as was the breakfast so we didnt have to rush around in the morning looking for somewhere to get something to eat. Small kitchenette but enough to do what we wanted. The view overlooking the park and harbour was nice to view when you wake up in the morning.Visited Sydney with 4 young adults but the room was still spacious.</p></li>

The only small issue is the carparking.You need a smaller car and not be worried about handing over the keys.Forget the car and use public transport during your stay.We got continental breakfast, a carpark and a newspaper free in the deal.Past visits do count.Renos are happening at the moment,we were warned but heard nothing during our time there..We have stayed on various floors in similar rooms.All have been quiet and clean.Lifts need room passes to work but the staff are attentive and watch the front entrance against walkins.Great spot,great value.We'll be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I don't understand the good reviews, unless the other reviewers have already stayed at a renovated room. There is a renovation program in progress (through mid 2012) that is sorely needed. The rooms are large but drab and the soundproofing is really bad -- the very busy traffic on Elizabeth street is very loud in the room even though we stayed on a high floor. The beds are quite old and not very comfortable. There is no WiFi at all and wired internet did not work and had to be purchased -- for this rate I would expect complimentary WiFi. Also it is not possible to book a non-smoking room! We got a smoking room even though we had requested non smoking three months in advance. There was only a slight smell of smoke, but still. There is also no safe deposit box in the room. The location by Hyde Park is great, and we liked the complimentary do-it-yourself continental breakfast that it delivered to the fridge in your room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">this is one of the few hotels in sydney that could fit our family of five into one room for a reasonable price. it is located right across hyde park and the museum subway stop. the hotel and the rooms were very clean and had basic ammenities. we had one large room with 2 single beds ,a couch bed and a double.it all worked out well. the breakfast that comes with the room included some boxes of cereal,cookies,little cups of orange juice,little cans of fruit and cartons of milk. there was small balcony i enjoyed a bowl of cereal on while looking across hyde park. there are a huge number of restaurants around the corner with everything from japanese,korean,kebabs,italian,burgers.there are also a number of cafes as well as a great breakfast spot just a 1 minute walk away called cafe 255 or something like that. there is also a handy 24 hour 7- 11 next door. overall a great stay and great location with easy access to tourist areas and eateries</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent 5 nights at the Hyde park Inn in Sydney. We loved it here and would definately stay here again. The price for these serviced apartments was extremely reasonable and they have a small kitchenette with microwave and fridge etc. Iron and ironing boards are provided in the room, the room is large with very comfortable beds. Staff very accomodating and they even have a guest lounge which we used as we had a late flight in the evening. If you are staying here and coming from the airport, then get the train its alot easier. You basicaly have to get off at Museum station which takes about 15 mins, its about the 5th stop. When you walk out of the station at Museum then you will see the traffic lights, cross at the lights and turn right, you will hyde park inn sign just a few minutes walk. Very easy. Hotel was centrally located and you can walk to the harbour in about 10 mins. Cant fault the hotel was lovely and would stay here again.</p></li>

We had a standard studio room on the 3rd floor which is nice and roomy, with not only the queen bed and single but also room for loinge chairs, a small kitchenette and a table, Contrary to previous reports of road noise due to Elizabth street being a busy street, the double glazed windows more than effectively cut out any traffic noise. The hotel had also advised me that renovations were occurring and that there may be noise during the day from about 9.30am till 4pm daily. (mon-fri)..

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic, clean, convenient hotel that provides extras that all other city hotels charge big dollars for. We had a family room (1 queen and 2 singles) and it included a kitechenette, flat screen TV, air con, big bathroom and very comfy beds. Parking was already booked out so we were given a voucher to park at the marriott across the road and it was free - very rare in Sydney city. Location is fantastic. We were in Sydney to see a show at the Opera House and as this hotel is directly across the road from the Museum train station, we caught the train to Circular Quay. Took max 5 minutes and cost $3.60. Price included a light continental breakfast that consisted of bread, cereals, juices and tinned fruits. The only thing I could fault this hotel on would be the noise. Elizabeth St is very busy, especially in the mornings with all the buses so best to keep your balcony door closed and take ear plugs if you are particularly sensitive to noise at night.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “HYDE PARK INN, SYDNEY - GREAT FAMILY HOTEL”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed there last year during our trip to Sydney and Melbourne. What attracted us the most was the room came with 2 queen beds and a daybed. So, it was perfect for family of 5. Very central in Sydney and they have a convenience store downstairs. Absolutely great for those with family (like us) or friends wishing to stay in the same room and save money. Taking up 2 rooms is costly in a city of Sydney, so this was perfect for us. We bought food and got them heated up in the microwave and there was a small dining table, and kichenette, so it's really very convenient for those travelling on a budget. Breakfast was juices, milk and break and fruits in the mini fridge, which was more than enough for the 5 of us. So for the price paid, we are very happy. Plus they are just infront of of the train station exit. We arrived Sydney late at night and took a train conveniently to Hyde Park. Toilet was very clean with good showers. We are happy to have found this gem.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 5 nights in August, in a family room on the 10th floor. The family room consisted of one room, with 4 beds and a small kitchen area with a dining table. The room had a nice view, overlooking Hyde Park.....the location was ideal, walking distance to most of the sights, close to shopping and transportation. (We did not have a car so I can't comment on the parking). Room was clean and comfortable. We booked via wotif.com and the rate was very reasonable. Staff was helpful and friendly. Did not hear much noise from the street below (given that we were on the 10th Floor) and appreciated the laundry facilities as well. Kitchen facilities included a microwave and cooktop - the hotel is a short walk from several supermarkets, and that made it easy to stock up with groceries for our stay. I did not use the internet here, but preferred to take the short walk early in the morning to the nearest McDonald's for the free wi-fi. Would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Really great hotel. we had a family gathering and had the 2 family deluxe suites - one at each end of a corridor. Rooms very clean, serviced every day and clean bathroom. I had read reviews about the noise but we were only on the 5th floor and it wasn't a problem unless you had the balcony door open - very soundproof at night. It is in the middle of the city people! Great location, great views and the 4 kids played football in the park across the road (accompanied!). Close to all transport - including the mono rail. Aust Museum just across the park. restaurants/cafes nearby or you can order in. breakfast lovely - again we had seen a few neg comments but was fine - not huge - but fine. The only complaint was the hideously tight carpark - very, very hard to negotiate! I wouldn't recommend the suites if the parents want some private time - totally open plan! The staff were very helpful and arranged a late checkout for us. I recommend this hotel and would stay there again</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 2 nights. On business in Sydney and needed basic cooking facilities. We booked a double and were allocated a large room (one queen, 2 singles and a divan). Room was clean and the bathroom had recently been refurbished so was lovely and new. New carpets too. There was a small balcony overlooking Hyde Park but when the door was open it was fairly noisy but very good double glazed windows and door resulted in very low noise inside room when closed. There was some work going on refurbishing rooms in the floor above us but we were warned about possible extra noise at the time of making the booking. It didn't bother us at all. Great value as the room included a basic breakfast (juice, bread for toast, cereal and milk, fruit) as well as car parking (although the carpark was very tight). Location is good too. Reception staff seemed nice although apart my checking in and out we didn't have any contact with them. Not five star but it's clean, well positioned and quiet. Very good value for money. We'll definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">1) The location was perfect. Right in Hyde Park (about 8-10 blocks from the Harbour) and next to the free bus that takes you directly to Circle Quay. There was even a wine festival at the park across the street when we arrived! 2) The staff are pretty helpful, not the friendliest, but know how to direct you around the city, give you maps and highlight areas to visit and the best method of reaching them etc. 3) The rooms I found very large - with 3 beds, a small couch, desk, kitchenette and large marble bathroom. The beds were pretty comfortable as well. I found the hotel (aside from the lobby) very clean and well kept. 4) Breakfast was provided daily. This was a great help to the budget. Breakfast included: cereal, milk, toast (white or wheat), fruit juice, diced fruit, coffee and tea. It was more than enough to fill you up - although not everyone likes that for breakfast, it was perfect for me and my group. 5) There was a restaurant on site, but I never went - there are too many other great places in Sydney to try...I suggest going elsewhere.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good, clean and secure hotel for a central location at a relatively good price. Great location right opposite Hyde Park (as the name suggests!); however traffic noise could be a problem for some light sleepers. Breakfast is basic (bread, juice, yoghurt, etc) but an added bonus in my eyes and better than nothing. There are lots of food stores nearby (7-eleven next door, and Woolworths only 10mins away) so you can't complain really. There's a bottle-shop about 4 mins away too. Good kitchen area if you like cooking in your bedroom (not for us really). We chose this hotel for a 5-night stay over NYE and it was perfectly fine. We had a friend to stay one night, so the extra single bed was great for it. Sure it's not going to win any design or quality awards (you'll have to pay top money for this in Sydney), but for the average tourist or business traveller it is absolutely ideal. Having read other reviews it seems that you need a room overlooking the park, but think that there must be only one or two rooms on each floor (17 from memory?) that this applies to.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked a Family room on booking.com for a reasonble price for three nights. The room holds a maximum of 5 people (queen bed, 2 single beds and a sofa bed. However, we had 6 of us 2 adults, 2 teenagers and 2 small children, 3 on the queen bed and the rest on the single beds! The room was very spacious, the bathroom was abit tradtional and the plasma was great! It gets abit noisy with traffic, sirens, etc. so, leave your door and windows closed at night! The staff were great!! The check in time is 1pm, however, we had an early flight, so we arrived at 8am. Luckily, our room was already prepared, so we were able to check in!! The location was fabulous its only 2 streets away from george st, museum station is right across the road, and only minutes from sydneys attractions!!!! The downside was that you have to pay $11 an hour to use the internet which is ridiculous! BUT, there is 2 internet cafes on liverpool street just 2 MINUTE walk, (EVERYWHERE INTERNET $ 1.50 an hr AND BLUETOOTH -24hr $3.00)!!! I would recommend this hotel for families! the rooms are GREAT!!!! LOCATION IS EXCELLENT TOO!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Gem in the city apart from parking”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The lobby is very small like any 3 star hotel, but this hotel got roomy guest rooms unlike your average motel. In addition, the morning park view is absolutely charming, though it's a bit noisy at night (understandable as it's right on Elizabeth Street). If you choose to live in the city, I am assuming you don't need to go to sleep at 9pm. I didn't notice if the hotel has a restaurant or not. There are a lot of nice restaurants around and walking back to the hotel after dinner is just perfect exercise. Bedding is comfy and linens are clean. Toilet is as clean as any 3 star hotels. Probably they need a patch up in a few years' time. Good Foxtel channel selection is available - which would be an advantage if you're into less Aussie mainstream sport such as soccer. Staff are professional not overly friendly. Underground parking is available but space is very tight. If your driving skills aren't great then better leave the car at public carpark nearby. You'd know what I mean when you see all the scratch marks on the walls at corners. I was very happy with my stay and looking foward to return during City to Surf!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “"Loved The Hyde Park Inn"”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved my 2 week stay at the Hyde Park Inn, and will definitely be back when I am next in Sydney. Great location, great room, and pretty good service overall. I had a deluxe studio on the top floor, with great views of Hyde Park and St Maryâ€™s Cathedral. Itâ€™s a bit noisy even that high up if you have the balcony doors open, but closed no problem, I managed to sleep well and I am a considerably light sleeper. Location was excellent, walked all over, 15 mins to Kings Cross, 15 mins to Circular quay, Chinatown is a 5 min walk away, and of course right near Town Hall station which will get you to any destination in the metro area. Breakfast is simple but adequate, and is supplied daily, toast, juice, coffee and cereal. If you want anything more substantial youâ€™re in the heart of the CBD so there is unlimited variety of cafes to eat breakfast at. Servicing of the room was good, daily clean. I would recommend this hotel to any one visiting Sydney, for the price, location and quality of service; itâ€™s one of the best in Sydney. Check it out. Thanks to Trish for taking care of my reservation and Suri for his attentiveness to my needs.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for a 2 night stopover en route from NZ to UK. Even on the 2nd floor, the good windows and efficient air conditioning meant that the traffic on Elizabeth Street was not a problem and location is excellent for buses and trains as well as having a nice outlook onto the park and being an easy walk to shopping, eating and attractions. The standard studio included a double and a single bed, cutlery and crockery for 3, fridge, convection/microwave cooker, toaster and kettle, armchair and settee, table and dining chairs and plenty of room for bags etc as well as ensuite shower room - overall very comfortable. A big plus is the provision of the makings of a continental breakfast in the fridge - cereals, milk, fruit salad, juice, bread,butter and spreads as well as the normal tea and coffee. We also welcomed the lack of high priced "mini bar" offerings - we resent the attempt in so many places to tempt or trick you into spending over the odds on stuff left in the room. Here, everything there was part of the deal. Great! Altogether a very satisfactory place to stay in Sydney if you are happy with comfort and convenience without pretention.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Hyde Park Inn on a business trip and found it to be one of the best. I was greeted by great staff, found the room very comfortable and spacious, and was especially impressed that the place wasn't very noisy, despite being in the centre of the most raucous city in the country. The room had something like a kitchenette, but without a hotplate, which I found odd. It was otherwise well-equipped, but of course without a hotplate there's not much you can cook. Breakfast was very much a no-nonsense affair. The hotel provided milk, cereal, bread, orange juice and packaged fruit (awful stuff, but the rest was nice). Being able to prepare a very simple breakfast in my room saved me a lot of time and fuss, so I loved this arrangement. The television, while a little on the small side, came with a few pay TV channels, and I was especially grateful for the movies. My reservation, which was made by my company, had been cancelled, which was no fault of the hotel's, but staff were more than accommodating and extremely helpful about getting the mix-up sorted out. I was very impressed with their professionalism. Overall, I was really impressed with my stay in this hotel, and would be happy to come back!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for one night only on a special of $192 a night for a large studio room, on the 4Th floor, which was a lot larger than most deluxe hotel suites - the bathroom was new with a very good shower and no fogged up mirrors! The compact kitchenette had everything you could need and the included breakfast products were of good quality and enough for two adults. The room had 2 double beds, TV, VCR -, lounge area with couches and coffee table, very spacious!Even though the location is on a busy road, we heard nothing all night once the windows are closed - the air conditioning was brilliant ( it was a hot and humid night), being absolutely quiet while we slept.We heard no noise from other rooms or the hallway despite our floor being quite full. Check-in and out was quick, simple and efficient. Our only issue was the cleanliness of the bedspreads having really obvious stains on it (photos included), and there being hairs ( not ours) in the bathroom from the previous guests - these were easily spotted and were a disappointing sight.But we would stay again. The hotel isn't 5 star and doesn't boast it, but I would give them a solid 4. if they attend to the little cleanliness issues, they would be a solid 4.5.</p></li>

The hotel is easy to find, provides an underground car park space if required, and will store luggage for customers if it is not check-in time. The room we had was on the 7th floor; it was a large room with a double and single bed, a small kitchenette and a dining table. I think most rooms have a balcony and these look out onto a road and then past that, Hyde Park. The room and bathroom were both clean and the kitchen had most basic requirements to make simple meals, or eat take-out in the room. A basic breakfast of a couple of pieces of bread and some cereal is provided each day to the room for the following day. Right outside the hotel there is a free 555 bus that you can get on that loops round the whole city very regularly - this was very useful. The only negative to the overall value of this hotel was the noise level. The hotel is right next to a very busy road, the traffic is very loud until about 2-3am with buses, taxis etc. It is quiet between 3-5am and then starts again with the daily commuters for work. The windows offer NO noise reduction at all, and we really struggled to sleep without ear plugs (which aren't provided). So overall a good value hotel if you are a deep sleeper, or have your own ear plugs!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place is terrific - has a small kitchenette and brings you breakfast food the day before. You can easily stay with young kids in the Deluxe room. We have a 3 year old and 1 year old, and with the baby cot and extra single bed (in addition to the queen size) did great! We bought cheese, fruit, pasta, and veggies and did our own lunches, snacks, and dinner for the kids. They give you bread, jam, honey, butter, fruit cups, milk, cereal, and orange juice every day for the next morning's breakfast, and we ended up making a LOT of grilled cheese sandwiches in the convenient little kitchenette. Our kids did not like to shower before, so we were worried that we did not have a tub, but they did great in the shower - playing in there for 20 minutes at a time! The only "hardship" was getting the kids to sleep and having some time for ourselves, but once they did fall asleep we could watch movies from Netflix with the internet cable connected to our laptop (though internet is $60/night). The laundry machines are free, bring your own soap ($1.10 AUD to buy here). Location is superb, right across from the park, and walkable to many things, including Cook and Philips Aquatic and Fitness Center where we took the kids one day for a fun swim outing. Have fun at Hyde Park Inn!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I can't say anything better about this hotel! If my mom didn't want to leave, that's how good it was!! (mom's a super clean freak and very picky with hotels). We booked a Deluxe and requested for upper floors as I've read reviews about the noise. The room could actually sleep FIVE! There was a queen, two singles and a day bed. The washroom was spotlessly clean :) Kitchen was well-stocked, there were only three of us, and we certainly didn't need that much food ^^. The hotel is located right smack opposite Hyde Park, with the Museum station right by there, the free Sydney shuttle bus just a short walk (around 1 min) away from the hotel doors, and the bus to Bondi beach around Museum station. Internet service available just round the corner at a very affordable price! If you enjoy walking, all the attractions are not far to walk to! ;) There's also a 7-Eleven just a couple of doors away, which was God-sent for extra milk or juice, or if you are up in the middle of the night feeling hungry ;) We were given off-site parking for the first two days and basement parking for the last day... off-site parking is only about a block away. Basement parking was sooo tight but we survived! ;) If we ever come to Sydney again, there's no question that THIS would be the place where we'd stay!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Perfect hotel for family of four”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed her 3rd-7th December this was our first hotel booked over our 4 week stay. Hotel was easy to find and clean. Rooms were large and had kitchen area. Breakfast was free and found each day in fridge. We were on the 3rd floor over looking the park. (couldn't see the park as there was huge trees in front of the window) The road outside the hotel is busy and you can hear noise from the traffic but it didn't keep us awake at all. Rooms were cleaned daily. There is a free landry you can use which was a great help. The only problem we had was on the day we left we needed to get a taxi to Darling habour to collect our hire car and the hotel said they couldn't book one as it was for only a short distance the reception guy went out and stopped one on the street they couldn't fit 4 people in and 3 suitcases. So after 15 minutes or so of stopping cabs and being told the same thing the reception guy just walked off and said nothing!!! My husband went in to ask what we should do but they were less than helpfull. Such a shame when we had such a good stay. After about 30 minutes a cab did stop and take us all my daugher had a suitcase on the floor under her legs!!! We would use this hotel again. But would of liked free internet or at least if paying for it a reasonable cost rather than it being so expensive to use.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent lots of time researching our stay in Sydney as we had only ever stayed without our three kids (15,12,10) Hyde Park Inn turned out to be a great choice, the rooms have been tastefully refurbished and ours was situated on the 11th floor so traffic noise was not an issue. The kitchenette was very capable with a twin hotplate cooktop and microwave etc. The continental breakfasts were supplied to our room each afternoon and were more than ample for five of us, in fact we always had some left each day. The position with the Liverpool Street Monorail Station 5 mins walk, Museum Rail Station 1 min walk and internet cafes everywhere was good also. We also prebooked a car space (no charge) and the Staff were always friendly and helpful. Darling Harbour was a pleasant walk as was the City Centre. Just a note for families, if you want to travel on Monorail etc get a day or multiday pass, ours only cost $54.00 for a 3 day Light Rail / Monorail pass (they let us have the family 2 adults 2 kids pass even though we have 3 kids) One thing to remember if you are going to Taroonga Zoo, TAKE YOUR OWN FOOD! paid a small fortune for our food there and had to throw it in the bin, discusting. The Zoo itself was great beside that though. In all we had a great time and will stay at Hyde Park Inn next time for price, comfort and convenience.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having backpacked my way round the world many times I know that Christmas can be either brilliant or terrible when away. My wife and I were fortunate to travel the world for 11 months during 06/07. As this was my wifes first real experience of 'back packing' I decided to dig deep and book us into the hotel over Christmas and New Year - 06 in to 07. The staff at the hotel were brilliant, always helpful and friendly, that included everyone from the genuinely lovely cleaning staff to the various managers we encountered. We had a two bedroom suite and having booked well in advance I managed to get a very good deal. It had a well equiped kitchen, air con, balconies with excellent views, comfortable bedrooms, clean bathrooms and to top it all the hotel staff had put a full size, decorated Christmas tree in the room - a really nice touch. After a lot of hard, rough, travelling to come across this type of 'luxary' was fantastic - that combioned with the easy nature of the hotels staff helped to make our stay very, very memorable. We stayed there for a further 4 days in April 07 as our trip drew to an end. From a travellers point of view the hotel is not cheap, but if you are able to cut back in other areas and dig a bit deeper in your pockets it really is worth it for a special occassion. Would I recommend it, without doubt - enjoy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I found it very difficult to find hotels in Sydney that would accomodate more than 3 people in a room. I was very happy we booked this hotel. I booked a deluxe family studio (1 queen and 2 single beds) through the hotels website and requested a room on a higher floor due to previous reviews about traffic noise. We got a room on the 9th floor overlooking Hyde Park which is the highest floor for that room category. I'll admit, the traffic noise was a little loud (mostly from sirens), but we did need the a/c on at night, so we kept the windows closed. When the hotel makes any future renovations, I hope they will install more sound proof windows. We found a little take-away pasta place that had a great selection and good tasting food. And with the little kitchenette and the mini-breakfast provided, we were able to save some money on food and eat healthy instead of eating out all the time. Coming from Canada, Australia is very expensive! If you turn right exiting the hotel, the pasta place is right at the corner. Another good (inexpensive) place to shop for food is Woolworths. There is a free "green" bus that stops just outside the hotel which will take you directly to Sydney Harbour, but it is a nice walk if you decide to walk at least one way. We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would highly recommend it. The staff is very friendly and efficient.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fourth time staying at this smaller boutique hotel. We were 2 couples this time, and stayed for 6 nights in one of the upper floor, 2 bedroom, one bathroom (full bathtub and separate shower), newly renovated, suites. For $302- Aus per night, we felt that, given location, size of suite, furnishing and finishes, that we received great value. Had originally planned to stay in Meriton World Tower, but with negative Trip Advisor warnings of late night partying, and their no-cancellation policy, we decided to return to tried and true. Spectacular unobstructed views of Hyde Park from our two balconies. With sliding doors closed and quiet split air conditioners running, we did not notice an over-abundance of noise that others have mentioned. However, noise might be more evident in lower floors. Much upgrading and refurbishment has taken place over the past few years, and room renovation now seems to be at an end. However, prudence dictated that the 2 elevators (basic interior but worked fine) be renovated last, and it seems that now is the time for this to begin. One elevator was down when we visited, although given the smaller size of this hotel, it never posed a problem. However, be aware that one of two elevator renovations is likely now in full swing, and you might want to ask about this when reserving. Staff always pleased to answer questions. Would most definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and my family wanted to spend New Year's Eve in Sydney, but we had only one month in advance to book a hotel. After a lot of research, and finding out that most of the places in Sydney were already booked out, I call Hyde Park Inn and to my surprise they still had a studio apartment available. Being NYE, the prices were more expensive than usual, but I was just happy to have found a good place to stay and enjoy NYE with my family in Sydney. With respect to the quality of the hotel, we were very satisfied. From the beginning the staff was very friendly and helpful. The studio apartment had everything we needed (1 double bed, and 2 singles), TV and a small kitchen with a fridge. They also provide breakfast! They bring it to your room one day before. Breakfast consists of orange juice, diced peaches and pears, slices of bread, butter, peanut butter, jelly, milk, cereals, cookies, etc. It is very nice and tasty! The beds were comfortable and we could sleep well at night. It was a little bit noisy, since the hotel is on Elizabeth St, which is a major street in the Sydney city area. We were in the 6th floor, so we could hear the cars. But nothing uncomfortable. Nobody complained about it, and we could still sleep well. Housekeeping is reasonably good. But there was one day that the person servicing our room didn't put much effort to make our beds. But that was not a big deal. Overall, i would definitely recommend this place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for a long weekend in a deluxe room. The fairly spacious room was renovated in neutral tones - but not sure about the bathroom, although it was fine (shower only). There was a kitchenette. The problem was NOISE. Sydney is a bus town and the hotel is on a MAJOR BUS ROUTE, so from early in the morning there is traffic noise, which made taking in the view of the park from the balcony unpleasant (we were six floors up) at any time except late at night. On our final morning (a Monday) there was hammering and banging from 8am on the floor directly above us, which made staying in our room and having a leisurely light (and they really do mean "light") breakfast impossible. When we phoned reception and made the (quite reasonable) request that the noise/vibration should cease until after checkout time their response was that the website says there are renovations going on. What it actually says is: "As this is a soft refurbishment disruption to guests should be minimal. Working on one floor at a time this work will be finished in late 2007" - not sure what they define as "minimal". It was a small thing, but I had a blister sore on my heel and got a bit of blood on the bedsheet, which wasn't changed. Not a big deal, but it shows lack of attention to detail. Otherwise, the location is good (in CBD and close to Oxford St) and there's coffee opposite in an outdoor park cafe, which you'll probably need after the (lack of) breakfast.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I rated "very good" for Hyde Park Inn because of the following: 1) Great location. Restaurants, cafes, public transportation, chinatown, QVB, park, etc. everything you'd want is within short walking distance. And yet, surprsingly, it was not as loud or as busy as some of the other main streets. 2) Family friendly. When I was doing my research on hotels I found that most of the hotels in Sydney only allow two people to a room. Some allow three. There were only a handful which allowed a family of four or five to be in one decent size room. Hyde Park Inn also had what I really needed in terms of bed configuration - a double (or queen, I can't recall) for my husband and I and a single for each of the kids. 3) Breakfast and kitchen supplies. We liked having breakfast supplied in our own kitchen so we can have it whenever we choose to. It was simple but adequate. The microwave was great because when the kids were too tired to go out, we brought food back to them and they could warm it up. 4) Staff. Helpful and friendly. And now for the not so great points: 1) Bedding linen. Old and shabby coverlet, not very clean looking. Extra sheet over blankets would be nice. 2) Bathroom. Shower stall should be renovated. No proper shampoo, just a kind of liquid soap for body and hair. 3) Hot water. It runs out if you are in the family rooms because each unit comes with its own hot water heater. By the time the 4th person takes a shower, it will be cold.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">To all of you poor ostracised smokers out there, this is that rarest of gems, a hotel which has smoking allowed rooms - in fact, the whole of the 13th floor - but so well done there's not a whiff of smoke anywhere!. I stayed here for 4 nights in a de -luxe studio on the 13th floor for $159 per night. The room was lovely, smart and very clean, with an excellent bathroom and well equipped kitchenette and flat screen T.V. The beds (1 queen and 1 single) were comfortable, and there was a great view over the park and across to the bay from the balcony. A very basic breakfast was included - 2 slices of bread, cereal milk, juice, fruit + jam, and a morning paper. However, I was quoted $14 for an extra breakfast if a friend came to stay for the night, which was expensive, as was the internet at $11 per hour. There are several food stores just around the corner (and a couple of internet cafes for $2 per hour), and a good selection of shops and cafes at the world centre a few minutes walk away. Museum station can be accessed just around the corner, so you don't have to cross the street, and is only 2 stops from the airport and 2 from Circular Quay . The staff were unobtrusive but very pleasant and helpful, soon sorting out a theatre booking I'd messed up, and the hotel laundry was free to use. The only downside to my stay was the traffic noise, unavoidable even at this level, but Sydney has to bee the noisiest city I've stayed in - beloved of boy racers in souped up cars.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Yup it's loud, but no problem with the aircon on. Would stay again.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Clean, fresh kitchen. Room furniture/kitchen looked almost brand new. Breakfast handy and just fine (OJ/fruit salad individual tubs, 2 slices bread each, individual cereal packets, good quality tea/coffee packets) - so you can go straight out without hunting down breakfast. Bathroom, clean fine. Road loud, but I like fresh air, so it's nice to be able to open the sliding door in the evening and enjoy the city hustle. No noise from other rooms - but maybe because aircon cancels it out too! Asked for and received high room - wow they respect email requests - that's a first! 14th floor, views to the entrance of the harbour, nearly, but not quite to opera house, ah well! Bed comfy. With air con on, the road noise was no problem (2 x light sleepers) - only occasional siren, not as bad as someone said. Used one ear plug first night, then did not bother. With air con off, hmm would have been not so good, so maybe a winter issue? Staff efficient, knowledgeable, friendly enough (not overly - more professional than effusive) but never rude. Surprised to be eye to eye with flying foxes out of the window! Buses to Bondi around corner, buses to Circular key very close. Take note of other poster's instructions for accessing the train station with luggage. 15 mins airport on train. NB: Free bus stops 3:30pm week days. If you want to be at circular quay 24x7 - it might be a bit far to walk. Shopping areas close, Darling harbour close, Korean, Japanese, Chinese areas close. Tip don;t go to Chinese restaurant frequented by non-Chinese - there really is a clue there.. Charged $3 pp for a single pot of Chinese tea WTF!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Best Valued Hotel in Sydney CBD”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed with my parents and aunts in a deluxe family room. The room was big enough for 5 of us and also there's still spaces to put our luggages. It was nice and clean, with towels and soap in the bathroom. The room was like you would expect to be in a 4-star hotel in general. Breakfast was good. It was not much, but enough. Two breads, milk, and processed fruits for each person. The breakfasts were put inside the refrigerator and added everyday when they clean up the room. There were also butters and jam (Thank god they gave us strawberry jam and some peanut butter, instead of vegemites). There was a kitchen equipped with cooking tools. We used to cook eggs and bacons for breakfast. Hence, we had a big breakfast for maybe $3.00 per person, instead of $15.00 like in any other hotels. The good thing about this hotel is that it is cheaper than any other 4-star hotels in Sydney CBD. Really great value for such price. The breakfasts were complementary, you don't need to pay more for breakfast. Also you can get a parking space for free, although I have heard that it was not very spacious). Complementary newspapers are sent to your room every morning. The location was great. Darling Harbour, China Town, and many other interesting places are easily reached by foot. Train station is just at the corner of the road. Makes it easy to travel from and to airport. There were some unpleasant experience from the room service, like a couple of spoons are still dirty in the kitchen and they didn't refill the soap in the bathroom. But those were not very disturbing. I still feel enjoyed staying at this hotel. Really great place with great price. Definitely will stay there if I visit Sydney again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Stay for families in Sydney”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We (2A - 2C) stayed here just after Australia Day in 2012, in one of the Deluxe Family Rooms. We chose the Hyde Park Inn (HPI) mainly for the price and the fact it included parking. As an ex-Sydney family, the idea of being right on Hyde Park for the weekend was the icing on the cake. We were in one of the rooms which has already had the bathroom refurbishments done, and it has been completed to a very high standard. We didn't notice the noise from within the hotel, and only minimal noise from outside, so the assumption is the reno's are working well. The room had a queen bed and two singles, as well as a standard size round dining table and a nice little kitchenette - don't try to cook a banquet, but perfect for breakfast and preparing food for the day ahead. The included breakfast materials (4 different cereal packets, 4 little fruit tubs, 4 bits of bread, 4 * 600ml milks and assorted spreads) actually managed to make almost everyone happy. Everything else we needed was quickly grabbed from the Coles supermarket in World Square (about 200-300 m) The local area is great for those visiting Sydney and not wanting the car. We walked to Luna Park, via the Rocks and Harbour bridge and returned via the Ferry to Darling Harbour and walked back from there. There are two supermarkets and a wide variety of shops, cafe's, restaurants and entertainments in the immediate area. There are a number of excellent coffee shops, and I would recommend a morning flat white from the cafe behind the entrance to Museum Station across the road in Hyde Park. The area is safe for travelers who take normal city style precautions, and we enjoyed our return to the hotel by foot from various spots around the city late each evening. One of the best for families we have found.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading the Trip Advisor reviews of this hotel, we knew this is where we wanted to stay and we weren't disappointed. We arrived early in the morning after a 14 hour flight from Los Angeles and unfortunately our room wasn't ready till 1pm, but we were offered the guest lounge where we could rest. We had asked for a room with a balcony on a higher floor and were on the 12 floor with a lovely view of the park. We stayed for 5 nights and an additional 2 nights at the end of our Australian trip; 15th floor. When we returned, we were treated like old friends. Yes, it was quite noisy, but Sydney is a busy city and it wasn't a problem, especially as we slept with the air conditioner on and therefore closed the windows. The room was basic, but very clean and comfortable. Housekeeping left extra towels when we asked for them and the front desk staff were very helpful. Loved having the kitchenette, which was very well equipped and we always had breakfast in our room. Having breakfast left in the fridge every day was a treat, although we also bought extra food from Coles Supermarket, which was just a 5 minute walk away. The pasta place at the corner looked great and there's lots of coffee shops. The location is fantastic for buses and trains - Museum Station right across the street and Central Station a 15 minute walk. We could actually walk to nearly everywhere from the hotel and were only 10 minutes from Chinatown for great restaurants. We loved the free show from our balcony each night. There's a large colony of flying foxes (huge bats) living in the Botanical Gardens and every night at dusk, they all take off and fly right past the hotel and down Elizabeth Street - I have no idea where they end up, but it was fun to watch. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a reasonably priced hotel in Sydney that is close to transportation, all the tourist sites, supermarkets, restaurants, etc.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My two teenage children and I shifted to the Hyde Park Inn after spending a week in unsatisfactory accommodation elsewhere. From the moment we entered the lobby the experience was a complete contrast to our previous one. The staff were friendly, helpful and keen to oblige. They insisted on helping us carry our bags to the room, and popped in a few minutes after we checked in to ensure everything was okay. The room, with kitchenette, was very well appointed, tastefully decorated, comfortable, very clean and beds were quality. The bathroom was lovely, and exceptionally clean with all the necessities provvided. We had an upper level room with balcony, and loved being able to pop out to absorb the city atmosphere. After the first day the city noise became quite soothing, almost 'background' noise. Having a continental breakfast provided was a bonus, with cereal, toast, fruit and juice, a more than adequate start to each day. As we stayed a week we cooked some basic meals in the room and found the utensils provided to be adequate. There is a Coles and number of seven elevens just moments away to provide any supermarket needs. The flatscreen tv and free movie channel was a bonus for the end of day when needing to unwind. Having family I utilized the free on site washing machines and dryers, and despite being peak tourist time I never had to wait to access them. I was further impressed by the level of security and 24 hour reception, which many places I've stayed has lacked. Traveling with teenagers, and being a woman, this gave me an added sense of security. The location was perfect for staying in Sydney. An abundance of restaurants are within a small radius of the hotel. All the major city attractions were a short walk away, and for those who are unable or not wishing to walk, there is a fantastic public service network at the doorstep. At no time did I feel unsafe in the vicinity of the hotel at night. I highly recommend the Hyde park Inn and will be using it again.</p></li>
