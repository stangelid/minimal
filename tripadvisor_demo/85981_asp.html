The transportation was very much like the buses for the Disney Hotels and took us where we needed to be.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Decided at the last minute to spend the July 4th weekend in Orlando and found the Holiday Inn had reopened after a big renovation. Wow! This property is, without a doubt, the nicest hotel on Hotel Plaza Blvd. Had some initial trouble booking but the staff took care of all the details even calling us back to confirm everything. They went out of their way to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Bed was great, friendly staff.....that's about all I can say. Woke up to take a shower and had lukewarm water at best. Toilet never seemed to flush completely without several attempts. I made the staff aware in which I got the following reply with a smile: "Sorry about that." Let's just say that I thought I'd give this hotel a chance, but will never make the mistake again. At $129/night, I expect a little better.</p></li>

The rooms were nice, clean and comfortable, the staff was friendly, and the location was great.

Rooms we very clean, quiet, well maintained. The staff were awsome. The bus service was very good for a non-disney resort. Always on time, helpful and friendly drivers. We had a tough time getting to Typhoon Lagoon after 11:00am(but that was it). Had great sleeps in the nice beds. I would recommend this hotel anytime.</p></li>

The staff was pleasant, though some appeared to be quite inexperienced. The biggest problem was the bus service to/from the parks - different answers on scheduling depending upon whom you asked. Location near Downtown Disney was a real plus. Would stay here again if I was on a budget - and, who isn't?</p></li>

The hotel room was spacious with a comfortable bed. The bathroom had a shower which could use a good cleaning with clorox to remove black discoloration from the tile (couldn't tell if it was mold or just stained).

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 7 nights at the Holiday Inn. It was clean, comfortable, and quiet. The hotel has undergone some major renovations and everything was new. The pool area is small but well maintained. The shuttle service is excellent. They arrive on time and run continuous until the parks close. It is a close walk to Downtown Disney and other restaurants that are a little less expensive. We will definitely stay there again. Just remember when you go to Disney, you spend very little time in your room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel had a great location on Disney property without paying the high price. The rooms were very clean and the staff was helpful. Pool area was nice with plenty of room for everyone. Parking is a bit hard to find and annoying to pay $10 per day. Always hot water in the shower but the pressure was lacking and the same goes for the toilet. I appreciate a quiet flush from a but it could barely even get toilet paper down. No major problems. All in all it was a good a hotel and we would stay here again.</p></li>

Great location, only a few minutes to Disney, and close to Crosswinds Plaza, which features a 24 hr grocery and wide array of places to eat.. Hotel offers a nice breakfast, and kids eat free. We enjoyed the heated pool, too. The Disney Store on-site sells the park tickets. A small store offers quick, pick up to go items like cereals and yogurt parfaits.Great value!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed for two nights. This was the best overall deal I could find in downtown Disney. Other reviewers were right about getting a room away from the highway. We chose a poolview room and it was perfect. Nice and quiet. The pool was very clean and so warm! Hottub was nice, too. We had great drinks in the bar at a really good price. The best thing, though, was the breakfast buffet. Not your typical buffet; the chef's eggs made to order were awesome. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. We will definitely return.</p></li>

On arrivial I ended up with a low floor room right on #4, the wrong direction. Check your reserviation and there is different costs for different rooms. Front desk staff took care of the problem the best they could. Ended up with 2 queens not 1 king. Great breakfast!! Close to the park at half what Disney would charge you. Also the business center is closed. I had to use the front desk system to check e mails.</p></li>

We used the pool and thought it was great. We used the daily shuttle service to the Disney parks it came every 30 minutes as promised we never waited to get to the parks. We ate in the restaurant once and it was great my daughter ate free which was a bonus. The beds were so comfy and we had a great nites sleep after a long day at each Theme park.</p></li>

The bus service was great it ran every 30 min. so waiting was never a problem. I have to say the most pleasant and friendly staff I have encountered. The hotel is in a great location and the pool is perfect for both seniors and children with the zero entrance. We did have dinner in the restaurant one evening the food was very good as well as the service. The rooms were large, very clean and comfy. Management can be proud of their great staff!!!!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel appeared to be new and is actually located in a great area. The breakfast and the pool were great. I wanted to love this hotel, but I just couldn't. We constantly had an issue with the towels and bedding. Almost every towel that we were given was soiled with old stains. Housekeeping did replace them with different towels, but this issue occurred daily! The same thing occurred with the bedding... I brought this to the attention of the hotel management, but they did not seem too concerned. Not sure if I will be returning to this hotel in the future...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a GREAT experience holding our conference here. The staff was a pleasure to work with before, during, and after our meeting. Throughout the conference the facilities were kept clean and staff responded quickly to and graciously to our every need. If something unexpected came up or we needed to make a change, they were more than happy to help in any way that they could. The rooms were a nice size with a good size balcony and the beds were so comfortable! Made it difficult to get up and work in the morning, but not a bad problem to have :-) Thank you Holiday Inn for an enjoyable stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I sponsored my family's annual Family Reunion 16-19 June in Orlando. It happed to be the 20th anniversary of our family reunion and wanted everything to be perfect. After checking out hotels for weeks, I decided on the Hoiday Inn- Walt Disney Worl Resort. The hotel has been remoled and looked great. The rooms were specious and clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. Ashley, Marty and Kathleen from the sales and cartering departments were extremely helpful and cooperative. Their willingness to help with food and room pricing made it possible for me to have a larger family turn out. Everyone had a great time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This turned out to be a great choice for us, a family of 4. The staff was super friendly and helplful. The rooms were very nice and well maintained. After a long day at the parks it was nice to go back to a well cleaned and comfortable room. The heated pool was a great relaxer for the kids. The restaurant had a delicious breakfast buffet. We didnt have to worry about parking at the parks, the shuttle takes you to each park. Very convenient. We would definitely stay here again (and we've stayed at Disney resorts the other 2 visits to Disney World). What a great way to save a little money--you'll need it in the parks!</p></li>

Stayed in room with King size bed, enjoyed layout of room with love seat and ottomon facing the TV, enjoyed granite in the bathroom and glass in shower. The fitness center is very nice with new equipment and faces the pool. I actually stayed at the Buena Vista Palace Hotel & Spa for 3 nights where my business event was originally scheduled which was double the price and was no better than the Holiday Inn. Plus, with the Holiday Inn, you do not have to walk for days from the parking lot if you do use valet.</p></li>

I was really blown away about how everyone seemed genuinely cheerful and happy to go out of their way to make our stay pleasurable. when you're traveling with small children, as most people going to Disney World are, it really makes a big difference to be surrounded by friendly, helpful people. Also, the pool is really, really nice. the rest of the hotel is fine, nothing special as I said, but clean, comfortable, and serviceable. I had no complaints at all.</p></li>

We were very impressed by the Holiday Inn, the hotel newly remodeled, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The pool was heated and great for little ones with the zero depth entry. The room was very roomy, larger than Disney's moderate priced hotel rooms and also quite a bit cheaper as well. The hotel and room was very clean and had no problems with housekeeping. The free bus service to Disney attractions was a plus. This hotel is definietly giving Disney World's hotels a run for there money. After staying here we will definitely be back and will not stay in Disney hotels.</p></li>

There is a charge, however, to use the computers for online access which is 3rd party owned BUT if you bring your own computer then its free, they have wi fi and free ethernet connection in the room. We brought an entire baseball team to the hotel for a tournament at ESPN Wide World of Sports and they were accomodating in every way.

This high standard continued throughout our stay. The hotel is clean, modern and welcoming. The restaurant serves great food at great value with kids eating free.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel specifically because it claimed to be "steps from Downtown Disney" and while it is one of only 7 hotels in the area, you probably won't be able to walk to Downtown Disney. It's quite a distance away and you'll have to cross a very busy road and navigate a huge parking lot - better to just drive and park closer. And if you're going to do that, then you'll want to stay somewhere nicer than this Holiday Inn. There's nothing exceptional in this hotel and as a budget friendly option you'll see plenty of school groups staying here, with the associated noise and commotion in the common areas. I was expecting something nicer, would not stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great spot! Kella at the front desk will work hard to make sure your stay is a great one! Stayed in a room with a view of Downtown Disney and Pleasure Island, well worth it. Great facilities, personable staff, and wonderful service! Stay & enjoy. Travel Tips: 1) Self-parking is $10 while valet service is $16; don't go cheap and just splurge for the extra service. You will support the valet staff that work hard in the Florida heat, and at the same time, you'll get a great level of service for just a few dollars more. Travel Tips: 2) Be sure to join PriorityClub; this way you'll earn points and might eventually qualify for some upgrades and premium services.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was in Orlando for a Conference and had the opportunity to stay at the Holiday Inn on Disney. It was a pretty nice hotel and had been recently updated. The bed was very comfortable and the room was a nice size. One complaint I did have with the room was that the bathroom vanity was very small, making it difficult to put all my things on the counter without knocking them over. The pool and hot-tub area were very nice and really warm... The pool temp had to be in the 90's with the hotub well above 100. One weird thing that happened during my stay was that 2 of the 3 elevators broke down for a day, making it a little hard to get to the room during certain times of the day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family of 4 (2 adults/2 teenagers) stayed here for 4 days. We didn't spend any time during the day at the hotel as this was a theme park vacation. However, the room was very large, clean, and comfortable - perfect for a family of our size. Our room had 2 queen beds with comfortable quilts, bedding, extra pillows, etc. The bathroom was a good size, clean, renovated. Big screen tv, mini fridge. The lobby was basic, simple, typical Holiday Inn. We didn't use the pool, but it looked like a very nice, clean, large pool area. My only negative comment is the $10 parking per night, (but we knew this in advance). Very quick drive to Disney and Universal. Down the street from Downtown Disney.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We live in Tampa and wanted to see Cindy Lauper perform at the House of Blues in Downtown Disney. Traveling back home at te wee hours of the morning after parting and drinking didn't sound right. We stayed here at the Holiday Inn because it was just five minutes from Downtown Disney and at that time recently remodeled. It's always cool to stay at a brand new place. The lobby looked great and the rooms were fantastic. We got two connecting rooms with pool view. So we saw Cindy Lauper, went back to our rooms and crashed, then next day we spent the day at Downtown Disney again (yeah we like it). I will be coming back next summer. This was a much nicer hotel than the Dolphin Hotel near Epcot.</p></li>

Although we are Disney Vacation Club owners, we decided to stay at the Holiday Inn - in Walt Disney World Resort after reading about the recent renovations. I have to say that we were not disappointed at all with our choice! The hotel is immaculate and the staff is terrific. Albert at the front desk was extremely nice, our bartender John made a phenomenal martini, and manager Christine could not have been any more helpful. Our room was clean and spacious with a nice view of Downtown Disney from our balcony. All of this combined with the location and value make this hotel hard to beat!</p></li>

This was perfect; newly renovated with modern updates, within walking distance to the Marketplace, and Disney park shuttle service every hour and half hour had we gone. Upon checking in, we were upgraded to a room with view of pool at no extra charge. The cost was very reasonable. We were impressed with our clean, updated room and with the renovations, the hotel looked brand new. Our room had a nice-sized balcony with chairs, LG tv, safe, refrigerator, and free wi-fi. I could definitely see us staying here again, especially when we bring our kids. They will enjoy the huge pool for sure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are looking for an extraordinary hotel, pretty close o Magic Kingdom and other parks, superb guest services and excellent value, Holiday Inn at the Walt Disney resort is the answer. A beautiful lady named Chryrstel Mattli took care of me at the checking and I think she probably is nicest person ever encounter in a Hotelâ€¦I was certainly a +5 star treatment. The Hotel has it all, excellent rooms, services, etc. but the best was the bed! I was having problem with my back and after only one night sleeping, my back pain was gone! I am not exaggerating; I just wanted to take the bed with me back home. I highly recommend this Hotel to anyone that after a whole day of walking, wants to be pampered and rest like a king.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The management must be pretty confident of getting good reviews as they stapled a card to the invoice with a link to tripadvisor.com! The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff was the highlight of this stay. We were there for a week so took advantage of the hotel's "free" breakfast offer every day. The omelette guy's cheerfulness was infectious. The restaurant was open in the evening too for typical hotel food but nicely prepared. We skipped the valet parking and self-parked just a few metres from the back entrance; very convenient for our pool-view room. There is a Benihana restaurant close by in the Hilton for those wanting a different dining experience, giving an easy 5-minute walk back after a glass or three of wine.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everyone was super friendly and we had a great stay. Arrived in the morning and they allowed us to check in at that time. Took the free shuttle bus (they run every 30 min) to EPCOT so we could enjoy the food & wine festival. We had the downtown disney view and could see the fireworks from our balcony which was pretty nice. There's a nice little bar in the lobby and a restaurant where we had breakfast. Your choice of either a full buffet or continental. The only bad thing was the coffee but the buffet was great and lots to choose from. You could easily walk to Downtown Disney from here. There's several HI in the area so make sure you get this one on Hotel Plaza Blvd. It was completely renovated a year ago. Pool and game room too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location, very friendly staff, pool, clean rooms everything was great. Walk to Downtown Disney shopping and Restaurants or take shuttle every 1/2 hr. Parking is extra, as with all I guess. One of the reasons it won't get a 5* rating. Restaurant in hotel itself is ok, food was very good, waiters were very nice but slow and very unexperienced it was like it was they're first day on the job, every one of them. The restaurant is open and kind of feels like your eating in the Lobby. Another reason no 5* from me. Also we went the Labor Day Weekend and once the crowd left it was great. The pool was practically all ours. Pay a couple bucks more and get pool view, it's worth it. But when all's said and done, I would definitely stay there again next time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel is located just outside of the actual Disney Parks, but is extremely close. They have a complimentary shuttle sevice that runs every 30 minutes that picked us up at our hotel and dropped us off by the Downtown Disney area of the park. The shuttle makes several stops along the way at other hotels, but they do it quickly, so it was not much of a hassle. Our room was very clean and seemed newly decorated. We enjoyed the extra special bed linens. Rooms have balconies, flat screen t.v. and the normal amenities that most hotels have these days. The staff was helpful and friendly. We only stayed one night, but we felt it was a slightly better value than most of the actual Disney hotels and we were still close to everything. We would definately stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I selected this Holiday Inn based on Tripadvisor reviews and I'm glad that I did. This hotel was the rendezvous spot for our group of 11 before we hit Wilderness Lodge and Disney World. After a 2 day drive for some in our group, this hotel was just what we needed in the way of comfort, cleanliness and quiet rooms. The staff members we encountered were very helpful. Some of the past reviews complained about the cost of food at the hotel's restaurant, Palm Breezes, but we found many restaurants nearby that gave us other options. Another surprise was the close proximity of Downtown Disney, which was within walking distance. For my 5 grandchildren, the swimming pool was the best feature. After 2 days of rest and relaxation at this Holiday Inn, we were ready to tackle Disney World.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel last when it was a Courtyard by Marriott and was closed down for years by a Hurricane. It had just changed names to Holiday Inn. It has been completely gutted and rebuilt inside. I have to come clean and say at the outset that we stayed across the road BUT , and this is a big but, we have been using the hotel for breakfast and evening meals + the bar as it offered far better facilities than where we were staying. The staff (knowing this) have always been rally welcoming and cannot be faulted. There is free WiFi (for which we were give the code) + when we asked we were given a key card to a room to look round. The reason we have not been staying there is simply that our tour operator does not yet offer this hotel. It is a short walk from Down Town Disney. Highly recommended.</p></li>

We were apprehensive when when we made the reservation at first but when we arrived, we were very much elated with not only the cleanliness of the hotels surroundings but also the rooms itself. The staff could not have been any friendlier. We always go to Disney the last week of the year to celebrate New Year's and have always stayed at Disney Resorts for its convenience and treatment. Holiday Inn; at 1805 Hotel Plaza Blvd., outdid themselves. I hope that they maintain the same quality throughout for next year as well because we will definitely have that location on the very top of our list. We had 3 other couples that were with us and stayed at other locations within the Disney surroundings and all agreed that by far we had made the best choice overall.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On arrival the Valet was very pleasant and informative. Reception staff were great and check in was quick and easy. The car park is designed so that you are never far away from the hotel so parking was quick also. The rooms were well fitted with a nice bath, fridge, safe, coffee machine and LCD tv. Our balcony overlooked the pool. The pool was very clean and is open til 11pm. Perfect for some relaxation after the parks. Breakfast was good and there was a generous selection including a cooking station for eggs, omelettes and waffles. The staff were pleasant at breakfast but not over friendly which I would expect within a hotel that is in the Disney resort. They seemed more business than pleasure. The shuttle bus to Disney is great and runs on the dot, no messing around. We would definitely return. Try get a rate that includes taxes, parking and breakfast. That's where the value is. We will return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is a great value with a great location for Disney World visitors. It is within quick walking distance of Downtown Disney and the shuttle comes every half hour to go to the parks, running from an hour before they open to an hour and a half after they close. The hotel was clean and the pool was great. Front desk and valet staff were wonderful! The only disappointing thing was the restaurant. After we checked in we decided to grab a late dinner ( around 8pm). We went to the restaurant and were seated promptly, but that's where the promptness ended. There were only 2 other tables occupied in the restaurant but it took forever for our order to get taken and for our food to arrive. The menu is very limited as well. We stayed 3 days but only ate at the restaurant that one night do to the super slow service and staff. There are plenty of other restaurants close by to go to instead of the hotel one.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 5 nights in Dec 2011. Room on 12th floor with king-size bed was comfortable and clean. While our interactions with hotel staff were mainly at breakfast, we found the staff friendly especially the chefs at Palm Breezes Restaurant who made good egg omelete and waffle. Breakfast is same everyday but covered the standard range - fresh fruits, cereals, bread/pastries, pan cakes, yoghurt, sausages and bacon...Our business interactions took us away from the hotel whole day so the comfortable bed and pillows facilitated good night sleep. About 15 mins of leisure walk to Downtown Disney. Regular shuttle bus available from hotel to the Disney locations. Singapore friends found good buys at Lego shop in Downtown Disney- significant savings compared with Singapore prices. We had corporate rates so value-for-money stay at Holiday Inn. It was one of the coldest week in Orlando so didn't try the swimming pool.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved this hotel. We had 2 interconnecting rooms with Disney fireworks view. The rooms were clean and comfortable and recently refurbished. The balcony was great to sit out and watch the fireworks. Its a great location considering Orlando is so spread out. There is no such thing as being close to everything in Orlando. So this hotel suited us fine, as it was close to Disney parks with free well air-conditioned bus transport to all Disney parks every half hour. The buses were on time and easy to use. The restaurant has kids eat free all day every day (one child free per paying adult) so this made prices very reasonable. The breakfast buffet has everything you need to get you through a big day at the theme parks. Plenty of other restaurants in the same general area. We thoroughly recommend families to stay here for value for money and location. If we return to Orlando, we would not hesitate to stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Holiday Inn- Downtown Disney last weekend for a short getaway to the Magic Kingdom. The hotel is a nice, no frills, hotel with bus service to the Disney theme parks. It is within walking distance to Downtown Disney, which is a real plus. Was were able to get our 2 bed room for $99 a night. The price was right but the room was not very clean. You could see dust on all the surfaces throughout the room. But the worst, was the bathroom. The shower curtain smelled of humidity. So much so that we had to close the bathroom door at night to be able to sleep without the nasty odor. We would have called and complained, but by the time we got into our room (pass 11:00 PM), I doubt that they would have changed the shower curtain for us. The only other disappointing thing about the hotel was the $10 per night/per car parking fee that we were charged. Not sure why it is necessary to charge a premium for parking?</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here in June for two nights during our Disney stay and it was great! We normally stay atthe Hilton but it was booked and too pricey for what we wanted. So we decided to stay at the HI..much to our surpise it was recently renovated and very updated.The room that we had with a king bed was nice and spacious and the bed VERY comfortable. The only downfall I will say is that the bathroom was very small. We were able to walk to Downtown Disney in about 10 minutes and we took the shuttle both days (no charge) to Disney which is very nice. There is breakfast buffett that my husband got one AM-but it is rather pricey for my liking. But there is a small little shop where you are able to get fruit and yogart, pastries etc. for more a reasonable price..Overall the hotel is really nice and great value for being a Disney Resort hotel. Would def. advise to stay here and would plan to again in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I normally stay at the Hyatt Grand Cypress, which never disappoints. However, due to the room type we prefer being unavailable, we checked out other options and stumbled on The Holiday Inn in the WDW resort. What a find. We reasoned that a close location, that offered comfortable, clean accommodation, with a decent breakfast, would be ideal, after all we were not looking for a hotel that provided other services, due to the nature of our visit i.e. to visit Disney World. A search on TripAdvisor provided us with this option and a King size bed in a room over looking the pool was available. That's it - the hotel was everything we hoped for - and more. You can't fault it - and the staff were just great. The Hyatt Grand Cypress is still a very good hotel but for pure value and more than adequate facilities for this type of stay, the Holiday Inn offers twice the value in real terms. We will definitely be back.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My younger brother and I live overseas. We were visiting Orlando for the first time on vacation and chose to stay at this hotel. It was worth every penny, the shuttle bus services were very convenient (and free). They stop regularly at the hotel so we took it to Downtown Disney the following night from arriving and saw a movie then again the following day to the Disney theme parks. The staff was friendly and informative, especially the waitress who served us dinner (and remembered our order from the night before) as well as the bartender. It was easy to arrange for transportation to and Florida mall (the taxi service they booked for us was very comfortable and straight forward). I was antsy before arrival but everything turned out perfectly, the only "downfall" was that the menu didn't have a vast selection but that wasn't a problem. We told our mom that we'd definitely want to stay there again if returning to Orlando.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in this Hotel in May '11 with my wife and son. The Hotel is nice (not very friendly ONLY proffessional) people at the reception. One expects to see some smiling faces after a tiring flight ! Well the rooms are great and so is the pool. Most importantly, the restaurant is an absolute farce considering it's a 'Holiday Inn'. Their franchise in Mumbai has much better food with a larger variety ! N friendly staff. The choice of food is very poor, not even 5 Pasta dishes, no Continental, Chinese, and NOTHING for the vegetarians ! I think not many hotels consider vegetarians particularly Indian travellers who are today one of the biggest spenders compared to the Americans themselves ! The waiters in the restaurant will ONLY give you good service IF they are happy with your tips. God forbid if you leave a Dollar less, be prepared to be royally ignored the next day EVEN if you call out to them. Do I smell Racism here ? Hotels round the world can learn a lesson or 2 from Indian hospitality.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got home from our Disney trip with our 11 year old daughter. This hotel was awesome!!!! I would highly recommend this hotel!!! From check in to check out, we were impressed with the staff, the cleanliness, the room, the food, the pool and the bar etc. Our room on the wing looked out at the beautiful pool from the 5th floor. Our daughter ate for free, the coffee was great and the made to order omlette station was superb. What I think impressed us the most about this hotel besides the aforementioned was the friendliness of the staff. Edwin, Freddie and the other waiters and waitresses from the restaurant are the best!!! Alex in the bar was awesome too!! It is a very modern yet elegant hotel that has the shuttle service to all the theme parks and the water parks. I had never used Trip Advisor in the past until choosing this hotel. We are so glad we read ahead and made the decision to choose this hotel. One final note, the beds were awesome and so were the pillows, I slept better at the hotel than at home!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was pretty good. We arrived the Sat. after Thanksgiving and checked out just this morning. The decor is just okay (I actually find it ugly) and the rooms are small but they serve the purpose. The pool is very nice and heated, nice hot tub as well. If you want to stay in the Disney area and you are able to get a good rate, this hotel is worthwhile. The day of arrival we called to the front desk for extra towels and they arrived within 5 minutes. The room was very clean, but the housekeeping did not do such a great job on a daily basis (the powder my husband spilled on the bathroom floor still remained after they had cleaned.) We only ate at the hotel for breakfast. If was very convenient. The breakfast buffet is expensive, but worth it if you choose one of the options (hot or cold) over the entire buffet. Make sure you ask for the waitress "Que." She is a bubbly, outgoing server who does her job well and goes out of her way for you! FYI: If you don't already know, you will be charged for parking, $10 per night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 2 nights for a Disney trip, and had low expectations of a Holiday Inn. We were delighted to find that the property is newly rebuilt (just a couple of years) and everything is very lovely, new, fresh, and clean. The room was not enormous, but fine for our family of 4, and it was helpful to have a fridge. The bathroom vanity was a little small with 4 of us, but it was okay - and everything was spotlessly clean. There is a parking fee ($10 for self, $16 for valet), which other posters complained about, but it's totally worth it: the location is excellent, with free transportation to the Disney attractions, and Downtown Disney is an easy 10-minute walk. There are no other "resort" fees. The breakfast buffet (not included in our rate, but kids eat free) was fantastic, fresh, widely varied and included an omelet station, and the service extraordinary and attentive. Every single staff member (valet, front desk, housekeeping, etc) was friendly and helpful. There's a lovely pool & hot tub and decent fitness room. We would gladly stay here again!</p></li>

I am happy that I had my family with me. Initially, I had difficulty trying to book my room online due to the website being down. The hotel manager, Danny, assisted me over the phone with my reservation. Very nice man. I was impressed with the friendliness of the entire staff, along with their great service. The rooms are spacious, clean, and quiet. Beds are super comfortable. Chose this hotel because my family and I were spending two days at the Disney parks. Shuttle busses run every half hour to the different parks, with pick up right at the lobby. Unbelievably easy and what terrific value!! We ate dinner in the restaurant one night, and the food was very good. Breakfast is superb. Full buffet and a chef that will cook to order for you! We enjoyed the full size pool one afternoon, and it was not crowded. Overall, this was a very, very good experience. Felt like home. I also want to mention that the Priority Club Rewards program is fantastic. Thank you Holiday Inn!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for 10 days in Feb. Our flight was late and I was crabby but from the moment the valet met the car I was soothed. We got an upgrade without even asking to a pool view room. Everything in it was clean and fresh. The bed was so comfy. The room safe was large enough for our laptop and other sundry electronics.There was a microwave and fridge. We used the fridge for drinks mainly as there is so much good dining in the area and in the hotel too. We had purchased the bed and breakfast package. The buffet was excellent with a wide variety of foods. The omelette /waffle bar was great too. I loved the Mickey waffle. It was a terrrific way to start the day for your trip to the parks. We usually had dinner at Disney or Downtown Disney but we did eat dinner in the restaurant one night and it was really good. We used to stay at another hotel on this street but this will be our "go to" hotel from now on. When the staff ask you how you are they mean it and really seem invested in your stay so you can enjoy it. I can't say there was any part of our stay I didn't like.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall, this is a fine place to stay. It's just average - nothing overly glitzy or standout about it, but it is in a convenient location (they say the walk to Downtown Disney is 5 minutes, but it's probably less than that and the complimentary shuttles are a bonus). However, I just wanted to give folks the heads up that if you pay extra for a balcony room with view (of pool or Downtown Disney), they also consider a ground-level patio to be a "balcony." So if you truly want a "view," you must talk to someone before you get there to ensure that you are getting what you want. They did change our room, after putting us in a room with a patio, but first tried to convince me that it was the balcony that I had paid extra for. Other than that, I agree with what other reviewers have said about the breakfast - it's overpriced for what you get. $9.95 for the continental buffet, which you get for free at most places (like a Hampton Inn, for example). The food is generic (had one lunch and then breakfast each day there). The pool area is nice and our room was VERY quiet - we slept like babies.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is perfect for a Disney trip right in the centre of all parks and downtown.If you are looking for a clean modern hotel this is great.The room on the 14th floor overlooking disney is great. What makes this hotel is the friendly waiters and really friendly door staff.Not forgetting the really friendly breakfast cook. The pool is also the best-really warm even on a cold day. We have only 2 complaints which are minor that would make 5 star opinion.Room 1408 air con was noisy most of the night(we did inform the hotel twice) but the problem not sorted. The second is not the hotels fault.They give you a card for a restaurant called Jonnies hideaway which was the worst restaurant in 18 days. The staff here are ignorant and aggressive just looking for huge tips.We spent 200 dollars plus for 2 adults and 2 kids in less than an hour.The waiter could not bring bill quick enough and once paid just wanted us out. I would use Bull and Bear for a quality meal a little more expensive but by far superior. Def use this hotel for a disney holiday.Best value all round/the kids eat free(under 12)</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We needed a place to stay one night before getting into our villa. I searched for something near the airport and then started surfing around. I found that this property had recently been reopened after an expensive rehab! They sparred no expense. The colors, decorations, carpeting, fixtxures, etc. are out of this world. What even made it more attractive was they had a great deal called the Family Quest Package. It included one night plus 4 tickets to Disney Quest (which are at $41.37 per adult)-the rate on the room was $129.00 plus a $10.00 parking fee (which I think is silly) but it included 4 tickets which comes to just over $160.00. We have been wanting to take the kids there for years. The pool is clean and big. Zero entry with a bubbler fountain at the entrance. Sprinklers at various sides of the pool. Towels at the pool. We had one slight mishap at check-in but front desk went above and beyond giving us $20.00 in food/drink vouchers! I didn't see a need for them to do that but again, very good service. I would recommend this place to all. They have shuttle service to the Disney parks but we didn't use it.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We checked into the hotel early before rooms were available. Planning the day at Disney, we checked our bags until a room was ready. After the day we got back to the hotel about 11 pm and was given a room, the bags had not been put in the room so we brought them up ourselves (no big deal, but not good service). We needed a third bed because our daughter's boyfriend was with us and when we requested a cot we were told that the hotel does not do cots. I requested a second room and since none was available, I slept on the floor (I was brought additional bedding). The next day I called Priority Club and was told to speak to the hotel manager. I was told that he would deal with the problem or I could transfer to another Holiday Inn property nearby that could provide a cot. I went to the front desk and asked for the manager and was told that he was busy and not available. I wrote my name, room number, and cell number and asked that he call me when available. I never received a call. When I returned that night I had to pay for a second room to avoid another night on the floor. I have never been contacted by the manager.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed Feb/March 2011. The room is very clean, and bus to Disney parks on time but the service here is very poor and not to Disney standards. They won't change traveller chq's, or order you a taxi, the porter have to order the taxi and they must have a link with this small company who have dodgy cars and drivers, they couldn't even fit the cases in the car on the wait to the airport. Had to wait 30 minutes to get a drink in the bar. Although they mention they are a Disney partner hotel the service is not to Disney standards and they don't have Character breakfasts as advertised, and the Disney shop closed, so not great for the children. If you like swimming just a point if you have children no lifeguards at all here, and parts of the pool are deep. Overall depends on what you want but this is by far the worse service I have had in any hotel in any country and would recommend you stay somewhere else where you can easily get same or better room and hotel quality but with good service as you don't want little bits of bad service when on holiday. Final point if your in a room facing the road you hear the cars all night, so not so quiet.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for two nights as my wife and I came in a couple days before our cruise departed. We wanted to take in some of the Disney vibe before hitting the Bahamas. I will say that I was a little disappointed in this hotel. After reading the other tripadvisor comments I was expecting greatness, not mediocrity. Upon arrival I asked for a room with a Disney view. Although I'm a Priority Rewards Club member, they told me it would be an extra $30 a night for that room so we declined. What we got was a small room with no balcony and a view of a parking lot. I've stayed in many hotels either in or just outside of Disney, and the room we were in at the Holiday Inn is probably the smallest we've stayed in. In addition, the bathroom offers very limited space. I will say that the beds are comfortable and the overall decor of the room is nice. The hotel offers little visual appeal for Disney enthusiasts. If you want the Disney vibe, I would suggest going somewhere else. If you're looking for a good location inside Disney without the Disney ambiance, then this may be a good option. The location of this hotel is what sells it, but other than that it's pretty average.</p></li>

The reviews were very good but I was still afraid of what I would find. I feel compelled to write this review for all those who are concerned with the cleanliness of the hotle they stay in. From the moment we walked in the hotel was bright and clean loking with the most personable of staff. The halls were clean as was the dining area we passed as we walked to our room. Again as I opened the door I was afraid of what I would find .t I was blown away!! The room was absolutely immaculate. The bedding was clean and fresh and new looking with not one mark of any sort on anything. I undid the beds to inspect as I always do and the sheets too were immaculate. The bathroom was spotless as were the towels and cloths. The carpeting in the room did not have one stain on it and I had no problem at all allowing my daughter to walk barefooted which I normally don't let her do in hotel rooms. I cannot recdommend this hotel enough, our stay was PERRECT and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again on our next trip to Disney.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Yes, pick this hotel for your Orlando stay!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After carefully looking at various Orlando hotels online and reading all the reviews, I chose this Holiday Inn for my stay. I booked it through Sam's Club and got a great deal on the hotel and car rental. All the good things that I read about this hotel are true. The whole place is very, very clean. The staff is very friendly and took care of any issues we had immediately. My whole family loved the pool which always an ample supply of towels. There is a hot tub too! The hotel is close to all the attractions (the theme parks, outlet shopping, places to eat and Downtown Disney is just a ten minute walk away). Internet access is free (wired or wireless). My son's 15-inch laptop, with a little twisting and turning, just fit in the room safe. There is, however, a $10 per day charge for parking, so keep that in mind. The morning breakfast buffet we thought was a little pricy at $15 per person, so we just ate there once. The food, however, was very good and the service was excellent. I thought the beds were super comfortable (I like a firm mattress) . My husband and son thought the matresses could have been a little softer. We just loved our stay and if we return to Orlando, we will definitely stay here.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great new renovation”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I are gay and we were in Orlando for Gay Days, the weekend when 50,000+ gay people descend on Disney and the other theme parks. Folks may not know that this is probably the largest attended group event in Orlando every year. This Holiday Inn was full with mostly gay men, who can be the most discerning (fussiest?) travelers on the planet. Well, we only heard very good things all around. The pool area is nice, the food in the restaurant was good, and the staff very nice. The new renovation is very good. Rooms are more basic and big than posh, but who hangs in their rooms with the theme parks outside anyway? The only hitch may have been slow elevators, but remember the hotel was packed and the pool was busy with parties from morning til late night - boys were traveling the elevators constantly. So there was a lot of activity that the new staff handled very well. We paid $8 a day for parking, no big deal, but that may have only been for our event - check with the hotel ahead. It's only a few minutes walk to Lake Buena Vista so location is perfect for Disney. Highly recommended and we hope the Holiday Inn is a host location for this event next year. Progress has come a long way with most major hotel chains now fighting for this business. Kudos.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Hotel and Location but very expensive Internet”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed with my wife 14 days in the Holiday Inn. You can get free buses from disney each 30 minutes, tha't a plus cause the taxi is about U$ 40 a round trip to go to the parks. Loved it because the buses was not very full and I could often find a seat to me and my wife. I think its not good to use the buses in the vacations because they probably will be very full and you'll have to be standing up. Im sure you won't find anything better in this price range (if you doesnt use the internet). My big complaint about this hotel is the internet. You can use it free in your room, if you bring a nettbook with you because the room only have a RJ45 connect. There's no wi-fi. I had to use the internet near the lobbly. It's a safe and closed room that you can open with your room card. If I remember, its 1 dollar for each 4 minutes, but the system doesnt work correct. When you remove and insert your card or log in or out you loose 0,25 cents. The real thing is you'll spend about 1 dollar for 2 minutes. If you need to use the internet a long time maybe its gonna be better to get a more expensive hotel with free internet. I stayed in Ramada Inn when I was in Tampa and payed half the price of the Holiday Inn with free Internet and free Continental breakfast. Sorry for my poor english.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very nice property.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for one night to see a concert at House of Blues in Downtown Disney. Very clean, well-kept property. Both days we were there, numerous members of the maintenance crew were busy with various tasks from washing the baseboards in the hallways, to touching up paint. Not enough hotels keep up with basic maintenance like these days, so this was nice to see. We had a small snag after we checked in (we arrived at our given room with our luggage to find it was still being cleaned). A member (supervisor, perhaps) of the housekeeping crew immediately made a phone call to the front desk, and escorted us to another comparable room and let us in. Keys to the new room were delivered ten minutes later. This would have earned the hotel a 4-star rating, but the keys were delivered with $30 in comp certificates for the bar/restaurant/snack shop...5-star rating is restored. Nice to see a management staff that knows how to take care of snags when they happen. The room was nice; balcony overlooking the pool and very clean. Had a late dinner in the bar after our concert that night, which was good--above average for a late-night menu in a smallish hotel. I would definitely stay again if in the area. Great value for a hotel within a short walk to Downtown Disney, and a good alternative to the giant resorts.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It is very apparent that Holiday Inn did their homework on what Orlando travelers presently want in a hotel. The renovations were current, fresh, whimsical and classy. The staff were professional, the rooms were clean and fresh, the television was modern/flatscreen and the decor was tasteful. The breakfast buffet was a pretty good deal. You could order cooked-to-order omelets with endless coffee and juice for $9.95 or you could order the complete buffet with bacon, omelets, pancakes, muffins, fruit, cereal, etc. for $14.95. The fitness center was fully equipped with machines that mirrors some of the top gyms nationwide. It also has a mounted television and VERY cold spring water. The game room is small but equipped with well-functioning, fun games. Disney's shuttle service runs every 30 minutes from early in the morning until 90 minutes after the Disney parks closes. Keep in mind that after picking you up, the shuttle will stop at other Downtown Disney resorts such as Hilton and Doubletree. On the down side, we went inside the business center and there was a fee of .25 cents per minute to surf the web and .75 cents per copy if you need to print something. We immediately walked out after reading this considering this is the only hotel that I can recall that charges to use the business center. No wonder it was always empty.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Convenient and better value than Disney World Hotels”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Mum, sister (18) and I (19) stayed here for two nights. The staff were invaluable helping us with the free shuttle to the nearby Orlando Premium Factory Outlet (be warned there are two different outlets on the same road with different stores, but an hour apart) and information about Disney World. Downtown Disney is approx. 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. Buses to every park can be caught from here and is quite lively at night. The rooms were spacious, clean, amenities were easily accessible and plentiful, including free wifi throughout the hotel. For example, mum had a bottle of wine but forgot an opener and it took less than 5 minutes for someone from the front desk to come up with one and offered to let us borrow it for the night. In addition, the beds were like clouds, so beautiful and soft. Breakfast was lovely, the buffet was about $15 and had most things from tropical fresh fruit to cereals, hot stuff and an omelet and mickey waffle plate. Given we were not travelling with small children we appreciated the slightly more contemporary/ business/ family feel to the hotel. It was very civilised and relaxed which is refreshing when going to Disney World all day. Wish we did not transfer to the Disney World Hotel after staying here for half the price, and will definitely return for the entire duration of future trips to Disney World.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our first stay at this newly renovated and re-opened Holiday Inn, which is located on Disney property. It is very convenient to Disney attractions. Downtown Disney is a 2-minute car ride/10-minute walk. To our surprise, the hotel provided free Disney buses to all theme parks. Each night we returned to a spacious, comfortable and tastefully decorated room. The beds are among the best hotel beds we've ever slept in. And it's quiet: no kids running down the hallways at all hours. The front desk staff was very welcoming, friendly, and consistently helpful. Our room featured free Internet (wireless in the lobby; a connector is in the room). We also enjoyed the refrigerator, coffee maker, microwave, and flat screen TV. The outdoor hotel pool is huge. Our only criticisms were minor. First, the hotel charges $10 per day for parking. When we asked why, one of the managers told us that since Disney owns the building and the land (it's actually on Disney property), Disney requires the daily parking fee. Second, the hot water dribbled out of the sink faucet in our 8th floor room. The shower, however, was perfect and produced plenty of hot water. When we are not able to stay in a Disney-themed hotel, we will return to this Holiday Inn. The convenient location, quiet, comfortable room, friendly staff, and free buses to the theme parks won us over.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for 6 nights here as our flight cancelled due to UK ash cloud. Decided to stay at a Holiday Inn as we are Priority Club members and were so happy that this is the one we chose. We walked in to the hotel to check the rates and found it a little expensive, however as we are Platinum members we were given a discounted rate and upgraded to a fantastic room on the top (14th) floor - everyone wanted a room on the 14th floor ! Great view of the pool and Downtown Disney and not much noise from the nearby road. Staff were all friendly and efficient and this hotel really felt like a home from home for us. ALL staff were always friendly and courteous and made us feel very welcome. Lovely pool with great restaurant and bar - Matt is the best bar tender an Orlando ! Easy walk to Downtown Disney and also Crossroads in the other direction - didnt really need the car at all. We had a problem with noise one night from the next door room which kept us awake but when we cpmplained to the manager he was very apologetic and gave us $60 vouchers for the restaurant and credit our Priority Club with 25,000 points - how good is that ? Thank you Edward Lopez !! Overall this was a fantastic stay - do not mistake this hotel for any of the other Holiday Inns in this area as this one is by far the best. Thanks to all the staff for making our stay brilliant - keep up with the good work, we will DEFINITELY be back</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I decided to add a day to the beginning of our vacation and booked through Hotwire, not knowing exactly what I would get but trusting the Trip Advisor rating that was shown. I booked for 12/19. I was very pleasantly surprised after finding out where I had booked and the great reviews of the hotel. Upon arrival, the young man at the parking booth was very helpful. He appeared to enjoy his job and even kidded me about having to park "across the street" (we did not really have to park across the street). There is a $10 charge for self parking. At check in, staff was very professional and helpful. The hotel was very clean and bright with several amenities to enjoy. The room was clean and comfortable. The beds were very comfortable. They even gave you a choice of using a firm pillow or a soft pillow as both were on the beds. There was a microwave, mini-fridge and coffee maker. There was also a flat screen tv. We did not experience any internet connectivity problems. We were in a 2 queen bed room on the 12th floor.The hotel is within walking distance of Downtown Disney. There are a variety of restaurants on the main road before turning onto Hotel Plaza. Check out was easy and staff was pleasant and cheerful. I was allowed extra time to check out as a was running a little behind. My children wanted to know why I only booked here for one night. I guess that means we will be booking a longer stay here next time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We took a family vacation for a few days at Disney parks and selected this hotel based on reviews from this site. We're very glad we did. From check-in to check-out I think they were the friendliest and most helpful staff we've ever encountered. A fantastic value for the price. We arrived about 11AM and they already able to get us into a room. We walked to Downtown Disney (about a 10 min walk) where we had lunch, did some shopping and exploring, ate dinner and returned. When we returned to our room it was missing a TV remote, the front desk had someone at our door within 5 mins with one. We took the shuttle to the Disney parks each day, which worked out fine except the bus schedule was a bit erratic but we never waited longer than 1/2 hour at the hotel or parks. Be aware however that you'll have quite a walk to the park entrances from where the bus drops you off. The breakfast buffet in the hotel was excellent as was the pool area, workout room, etc. Rooms were cleaned well every day. Two more examples of the great service include the assistance I received when I wanted to print our return flight boarding passes. The other was when we were leaving and the shuttle company sent the shuttle to the wrong hotel. The staff was extremely helpful in checking into the issue and getting a dedicated shuttle there for us so we didn't miss our flight. If I have to go to this area again for business or pleasure I would definitely select this hotel again and would highly recommend it to any friends and family.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family stayed here from March 9, 2012 thru March 18, 2012 and had a great time. Since we stayed more than 7 nights, we were offered to pay $10 more at booking and that would include daily breakfast and kids under 12 eat for free. The breakfast in the Palm Breeze restaurant was buffet style with made-to-order omelets and Mickey Mouse waffles, fresh fruits, pastries, yogurt, toast, bagels, cold/hot cereals, bacon, sausage, potatoes, eggs, pancakes, french toast, and corned beef hash. It was a great deal for us. Our server most days was Edwin and he was great. (We also had dinner here one night and it was good too) In fact the entire staff was helpful and very friendly from valet to the check-in people. The room was clean, nice and the bed was comfy. We stayed on the 12th floor and never had a problem with noise. We did not have a car so the free shuttle worked very well for us. The hotel was the second stop on the "A" route which serves 4 hotels so even though it was Spring Break, we always had room when the bus picked us up. Two buses come every 30 minutes beginning 1 hour before park opening and then 1 1/2 hours after parks close. One bus runs to EPCOT and Animal Kingdom and the other runs to Magic Kingdom and Hollywood Studios. It was a 5-10 min walk to Downtown Disney and if you walk 15-20 minutes in the opposite direction you'll find a grocery store and many other dining options. It's also close to Universal Studios, we just had to schedule a separate shuttle for that. I would DEFINITELY stay here again!</p></li>

<li>We stayed on the 12th floor and never had a problem with <span style="background-color:#A00000">noise</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>We did not have a car so the free shuttle worked very well for us.</br></br></li>
<li>The hotel was the second stop on the "A" route which serves 4 hotels so even though it was Spring Break, we always had room when the bus picked us up.</br></br></li>
<li>Two buses come every 30 minutes beginning 1 hour before park opening and then 1 1/2 hours after parks close.</br></br></li>
<li>One bus runs to EPCOT and Animal Kingdom and the other runs to Magic Kingdom and Hollywood Studios.</br></br></li>
<li>It was a 5-10 min walk to Downtown Disney and if you walk 15-20 minutes in the opposite direction you'll find a grocery store and many other dining options.</br></br></li>
<li>It's also close to Universal <span style="background-color:#f032e6">Studios</span>, we just had to schedule a separate shuttle for that.</br></br></li>
<li>I would DEFINITELY stay here again!</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I do not often post on Trip Advisor but had to share my thoughts about this wonderful hotel. My 14 year old daughter and I spent 3 nights at the hotel and could not have asked for more. Over the past 10 plus years we have stayed at one of the onsite WDW properties. I stayed at this hotel for a business trip in September and given the positive experience I had decided to give it a try for a pleasure trip. I am so glad I did. From the moment I checked in I felt welcomed. The employees were kind, professional and made sure that all of our needs were met. The hotel, including the rooms is clean and modern. The room is well appointed and offers a microwave, fridge, safe and coffee maker. We had a balcony and it was so nice to sit outside and relax. The beds are very comfortable. The hotel has a lovely pool that never seemed too crowded or noisy. You could order drinks or food if you desired to. We did eat breakfast at the restaurant 2 days and got a to-go breakfast at the take and go area. They offered yogurt, cereal etc. It was perfect. My biggest worry prior to staying was the shuttle service to the parks. This turned out to not be a problem at all. The shuttles were reliable and once you knew the times they would come you could plan accordingly (get there about 5 -10 minutes prior to be safe) and it was no problem at all. We always had a seat and while the trip to and from the parks varied timewise it was never extreme or problematic. The walk to Downtown Disney is not very far at all. There is nice path to walk on and it took no more then 10 minutes. I can not say enough good things about this hotel. It is evident the employees (from the valets, to the front desk, to the housekeeping staff, to the restaurant folks) love working at the hotel and their happiness shows by the way they treat their guests. I will be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Have just got back from 7 days there and an excellent stay as others have said below. Nice big rooms (recommend Disney Downtown views - worth the extra mullah) and toiletries (barring the rather odd smelling bars of soap - gel is much nicer I think). Little to add to these reviews really: the bus works very well on the half hour to the different parks and stops just outside the hotel door. Takes a somewhat roundabout route to get to and from the parks, which makes coming back all that more tiring - but hey it IS free. We ordered food from Garden Grocer.com and I highly recommend them - they worked very well delivering all the essentials just before we arrived and the fantastic reception people put everything in the room and fridge for when we got there. Nowt like Florida Orange juice after a day negotiating the IBERIA airline's innate incompetence (avoid them like the plague travelling to the US from Spain - they have shall we say a rather fuzzy awareness to put it mildly about what passports are valid entering the US). Had the room service breakfast been a bit more imaginative and permitting selection (bagels??) we would have eaten from that. Just used the GardenGrocer food and the coffee machine (lovely filter coffee provided) and we had breakfast done and dusted. We ate once in the restaurant and thought it excellent value but clearly needing a bit more publicity to get the punters in. Special mention to the lovely Chrystel who managed to get us back to the hotel after Gatwick's inability to clear snow in two days meant that on our first attempt in early December BA pocketed all our fares money (and the equally deplorable Gatwick Sofitel the overnight room money) as we were unable to get to GWK for the outward flight. So we tried again but avoided BA - it worked! Also used Quicksilver taxi service Orlando airport to the hotel and back and they were excellent too.</p></li>
