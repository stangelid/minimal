La Greppia restaurant nearby is excellent.</p></li>

My husband, daughter (age 12) and I stayed for 3 nights. From the gracious courtesy of the staff, to the delicious treats at breakfast and happy hour (both included in your room rate) we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Our rooms were lovely, spacious and immaculate. We would definitely return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect I can honestly say that I have never stayed at any hotel where the staff have been so helpful and friendly, they cannot do enough for you. The hotel itself is immaculately clean and my room was a good size.The hotel is about a 20 minute walk from the Ponte Vecchio, however there are plenty of buses that run from outside of the hotel and the walk itself is lovely as it takes you along the river.</p></li>

We were encouraged by other reviews.We found hotel full of character, in a great location with helpful friendly staff. Our only criticism is that the bathrooms, although absolutely clean, are looking slightly dated and lack the character of the rest of the hotel. But that would really be our only criticism. Immaculately clean everywhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lovely Hotel We had a great stay at Hotel David in early July, 2007. The location is a bit out of the center, but the front desk will draw a very good map of the different busses that stop out front. Our room was beautiful and spotless with an amazing bathroom. We enjoyed the evening snacks and wine, and loved the breakfast each morning. The two restaurants recommended by the front desk were wonderful. Would highly recommend the Hotel David.</p></li>

The room was huge and very confortable. Upon arriving they directed us to a laundry mat down the street. They made reservations, recommendations and generally made uus feel at home.An evening cocktail time allows guests to chat about the days events, visits, etc. in a homey lobby. Would I visit again.....You bet.</p></li>

All the staff were friendly - the people at the reception, the cleaning ladies, the staff in the breakfast room. In addition we got excellent advice about were to eat, what to see and they also made a great effort to book the tickets we wanted. In the afternoon they serve free beverages and snacks. And the price must be the lowest in Florence for such a great hotel.</p></li>

The staff was courteous, polite and very helpful. The breakfast was great and at night they had wine and appertives. I liked that the we were out of the hustle and bustle of the main city of Florence but it was just a 20 minute walk away or 5 minute bus ride. The Hotel was very clean and beautiful with a nice little garden. I highly recommend this Hotel.</p></li>

They have free wifi and free happy hour with wine and lots of really good snacks. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. They went above and beyond on every occasion. Parking is included.

Well furnished, felt like a country inn although just over the Arno river, a short bus ride from the centre of Florence. Books and magazines, a real sitting area for guests near the reception desk, and a very pleasant ending to a day's sightseeing with wine and aperitifs at 6:30. Comfortable beds, spacious room, parking on the property. We would definitely stay there again.F  A, Vancouver</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Delightful experience Perfect location across the river, very clean and well maintained. Old world charm with truly exceptional service. Late one evening we had a minor medical problem and the staff contacted a local clinic for us, arranged a taxi and helped us track down a prescription. The breakfast was perfect, the courtyard garden the ideal place to have coffee and plan your day. Close to everything but away from the buzz of the inner city. We truly had good fortune to have discovered Hotel David.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect Hotel David Just returned from 4 nights at the Hotel David and we can not fault it.The Hotel is spotlessly clean and the staff are very helpful. At 6.30 every evening they serve complimentry wine and aperitives, which are delightful.One piece of advice the rooms have no curtains/drapes but they do have electrically operated shutters and you have to hunt for the switch, oh and do use the mosquito killer supplied in your room I didn't the first night and got bitten twice.Stay at this Hotel it is wonderful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">loved the area we only spent 2 days in Florence and Gabriele, the proprietor, of Hotel David was extremely welcoming. the Boutique Hotel has all the charm of Florence. the room was an excellent size for us and our 2 children, aged 14 and 10. the bathroom looked recently rennovated with a great shower. we really felt at home. breakfast was in a lovely little room just down the corridor and that was plentiful. Ponte Vecchio was only 10 -15mins away by bus and so to was the Piti Palace. i highly reccommend Hotel David.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Unfortunate booking For those thinking about staying at Hotel David, please make sure you get a cancellation code if you do need to cancel. My wife and I were unable to keep our booking and asked Sister Constantine, an Italian friend we were staying with, to cancel for us. She did so and assured us that everything was fine but the staff at Hotel David still charged us for the night we cancelled. We discovered this after we arrived back in Canada. When we return to Italy we will most definitely not be booking at Hotel David again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Charming hotel with great service Lovely hotel in a good location - I enjoyed being away from the crowds and the walk along the river each night to return to the hotel. The staff were wonderfully helpful - nothing was too much trouble - good choice at breakfast, clean and comfortable rooms and free internet access. Even though my room faced the busy road I did not experience any problems with noise. Would highly recommend this hotel for those who wish to get away from the crowds at the end of the day and stay somewhere with a more personal touch.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Exceptional Guest Service This hotel is a true delight. It is a quaint, 500 year old villa that was converted into a hotel fifty years ago.It is within walking distance to the main tourist sights. About a twenty minute walk.A breakfast buffet is served in the morning and it consists of fresh, homemade baked items. Appetizers/beverage is served in the evening in a very cozy sitting area. There are many tour books and art books to browse through.I cannot say enough about the friendly, polite, helpful staff. They were wonderful.The Wilson family. Seattle, Washington</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our favourite hotel in Italy!!!!! A wonderful hotel with very friendly staff, a fantastic buffet breakfast, free internet, large rooms, large bathrooms, free car parking and a lovely reading area where you can borrow a newspaper or book. The location isn't central, but the centre of town is only a 20 minute walk away which we found pleasant and safe. Great value for money. Our favourite hotel in Italy!!!!! We visited in late November and had no problem seeing the statue of David, so if visiting in low season, I wouldn't bother paying more to prebook your tickets.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Enjoyable visit from Hercules, California This is a charming hotel located away from all the tourist attractions but close enough to walk into the centre or take a bus located across the street. Our room was charming and clean and the breakfast was quite good. The staff was fabulous. Helpful in giving good places to eat and helpful with getting transportation to train station and from airport. A good restaurant was Gigi and even better was Beppino.Both were recommended by hotel staff.Both are in walking distance. I would absolutely stay at this hotel again if in Florence.</p></li>

We were two adult couples and shared a quad room. This hotel is great. Others have said it is too far away but I think it is nicely located. There are some nice restaurants very close. Gigi was especially good. I like the Hotels common area's which are large and outdoor seating too. They have a small bar to get drinks along with in room mini bar. The staff is really nice and helpfull and everything is very clean and well maintained. We would all stay here again for sure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Thoroughly enjoyed the Hotel David! My wife and I recently spent 5 nights at the Hotel David, and it offers a great value. All front desk employees are very helpful and speak fluent english. While the hotel is not in the center of Florence, the Hotel David is in a quiet  beautiful residential area and we were able to walk to the Ponte Vecchio and Piazza Michelangelo within 18 minutes. The hotel itself is more like a bed  breakfast than a traditional hotel, but it was very comfortable and very clean. And if you rent a car, it has on-site parking. Overall, we recommend this hotel.</p></li>

The family room was comfortable and spacious and the staff were extremely helpful and welcoming. Breakfast was good value and was a good way to start the day. We also found the location to our liking; a short bus ride away and away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre. All in all we felt at home and relaxed and this greatly enhanced our holiday. Other useful information is the presence of a fantastic deli around the corner who make delicious sandwiches on request for days out etc. I would strongly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect position Dec.18/2007We spent 3 weeks in Italy with our adult children and rate Hotel David as one of the best 'finds' of our trip. The staff were courteous and helpfull, the rooms comfortable and spacious and the breakfasts excellent. We enjoyed the 'happy hour' as it gave one the opportunity to meet other guests. The hotel is positioned on the banks of the Arno at the foot of the Piazza Michelangelo. It is easy to get to from the station and a pleasant walk into the centre of town. We don't hesitate to reccommend the Hotel David and will certainly stay there on our next trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Little Gem Part of the allure of this hotel is that it is slightly out of the center of Florence, but still in a great location. Many different public buses are within a block of the hotel and can take you anywhere in Florence, including directly to the train station. If you perfer to walk, the Ponte Vecchio is a 10- 15 minute walk along the Arno river. We stayed in a spacious, bright, well furnished, quiet double with a lovely bathroom. The staff is very helpful and free internet access is provided. The hotel has a comfortable public sitting room and terrace, serving wine and simple snacks in the afternoon. The breakfast was excellent.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful friendly Hotel For a 3 star Hotel this is absolutely top notch. We had a fantastic 4 night stay covering our 30th wedding anniversary. Gabriele and his team were extremely welcoming and helpful and even left a bottle of wine in our room to celebrate our special day. The happy hour out on the terrace each evening is a really lovely touch and all the food including breakfast was well cooked and very tasty. We would recommend this Hotel to anyone even those who can't walk too far as there is a very good bus service into the heart of the city. Rooms were lovely and clean with a huge bathroom and air conditioning both excellent and quiet.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel David - bravo, bravo, bravo Just returned from 6 nights in Florence at the Hotel David - chose hotel based on reviews on TripAdvisor and Venere.com - was not disappointed. Spotlessly clean, large rooms, baths. Very helpful staff. Good Italian breakfast - great capaccino - early evening snacks - dry cleaning/laundry - 24 hour turn around - my husband is not a walker, but did the easy down hill 10-15 minute walk to Ponte Vecchio almost daily. Taxi service and bus service super close. Nice family run Trattoria L'Orologico across street . Lovely park right across bridge. Just wished we could have stayed longer! Would definitely recommend and return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A quiet, refreshing retreat Our daughter found this little gem in an out of the way and quiet area of Florence. When we came to visit her in Florence we found Hotel David to be extremely accommodating, and most attractive, clean, and comfortable. Our breakfasts were unlike anything we had imagined: wonderful coffees, delicious pastries, hot quiches, fresh fruit, cereals, something for everyone. In addition, evenings held a pre-dinner cocktail hour of wines and hors d oeuvres, each night different. The setting of the hotel is garden-like and quite attractive, kept spotlessly clean, inside and out. We found the hospitality much, much more than our expectations, and the hotel staff to be unequaled.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lovely, just as promised! Out of the four hotels we stayed in this trip, we both rated Hotel David as the nicest. We were warmly greeted upon arrival, and shown up to our lovely room overlooking the garden area. The room was spotless, as if we were the first ones to use it! The breakfast was very tasty, and the complimentary wine and snacks were a welcome treat in the evenings. We thought the hotel was ideally located in a quiet area, but close enough to walk to the historical sites. Be sure to take the bus to the top of Piazza Michaelangelo, the best photos can be taken from this area which is quite close to the hotel. All in all, this was a real find, and we would surely stay there again. Enjoy!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent hotel to stay in Florence This hotel was chosen by the Tripadviser as the best hidden gem in Florence and we took our chance. I would like to say thank you because this was a great boutique hotel and it made our stay excellent in Florence. It is 15 minutes walk to Ponte Vecchio, but your route is to walk by the Arno river, therefore it is great. People are very helpful and friendly. It has a beatiful small garden where you can have your wine when you come back to the hotel after your dinner.The very important thing is that the rooms and the bathroom are extremely clean. It is a house with around 20 rooms and with a very lovely lobby. Thank you thank you thank you... Definetely recommend to everyone...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel in Florence We stayed in a double room with private bathroom. The room was very spacious with a private balcony and very clean.This hotel is located on the other side of the Arno river, about 20-25 minutes walk to the major attractions in Florence but the bus stops right in front of the hotel and it was extremely easy and convenient getting around.This is not a touristy area of town so if you are looking to get away from the crowds, this is the place for you. There are some very good restaurants in the area as well.The breakfast was adequate.The happy hour in the evenings with wine and snacks is an added bonus, as is the complementary internet access.Overall, a great stay. I would definitely return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel!! Loved everything about this hotel!!!!!! The staff was helpful and extremely friendly. They greet us with a bottle of wine on our bed for our anniversay..nice touch. The room was nicely decorated comfortable, spacious and clean. They had a happy hour every evening out on their backyard that was just lovely with food and wine. The hotel has a great location in Florence too. We were able to walk everywhere. I wasn't sure what to expect since I did this trip all online but I was so pleasantly surprised with this place. I would recommend it in a heartbeat. If you get a chance get a reservation at La Giostra too. Somewhat expensive..... but sooooooo romantic and the food and service is excellent.Michelle-St Louis, MO</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic My family and I stayed here for 3 wonderful nights. We were in the middle of a 25 day trip through Europe. Of all the places we stayed by far the Hotel David provided the best overall service and accomodations. The entire staff is very service focused. The room we had comfortably housed my family of 4 and the atmosphere was incredible. It felt like we were staying at someone's home. Good breakfast and the light snack and drinks in the evening were great. Met lots of other people. Also they provide free 10 mins of phone service each day. This was great for the kids as they called their friends each day. Internet access was also free. Staff was very helpful with tour and dinner arrangements. Overall just a wonderful experience</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a great hotel We selected Hotel David through TA and we were not disappointed. From the moment you arrive you are made to feel welcome. Our room was delightful with a comfortable bed and very clean.It was the extra things that made the hotel exceptional. they provide internet access for free and when you arrive you are given your sign on for the period of your stay. They also have a happy hour each evening from 1800-1900 where they provide red and white wine and 'nibbles'. This was a great way to share travel tips with fellow guests and contributed to the overall friendly atmosphere of the hotel. The office staff were always friendly and helpful. Hotel David was our first impression of the Italian hotel hospitality and we were impressed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect Location! The Hotel David was perfect for us! It is not located in the city center and is a bit of a walk from all of the attractions, but this is what we loved. It was great to have a small quiet place to come back to after a crazy day full of sites. The location on the other side of the river was perfect. We enjoyed our daily walks along the river. We also found that the restaurants and bars were way better on the other side. Located right by the Piazza Michaelangelo, which offers the best (free) views of the city! The staff was great! Very helpful with all of our needs. And it helps that they provide free internet. Rooms were bigger than avg. and nicely decorated and kept up. Will definitely be returning to Hotel David in the future!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic Hotel, Great Location We spent one night at Hotel David and to be frank I wish it could have been longer! The hotel feels more like someone's house with its antique furniture and homely decor. Ideally located to the south-east of Florence it is a 20 minute walk into town however the area is well-serviced by buses for the less energetic.Our room was clean, cool and felt very cosy. Aside from the fantastic staff, it is the little things that Hotel David does so well. Nice touches such as the free internet and 10 minute phone call really set it apart. However the best feature has to be the 'aperitivo' on an evening where guests can sample free wine and nibbles in the garden,I hope to return to Florence again and would not even consider staying anywhere else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good Value We booked our stay at Hotel David based on reviews from trip advisor. The staff is very friendly and helpful in recommending restaurants. Each restaurant they recommended was wonderful. We also had not made reservations at the Accademia to see the David and they were able to make them for us when we arrived. This was so helpful as we did not have to stand in a very long line at all! We did miss the afternoon snacks because we were still out touring Florence everyday at the time, but breakfast was delicious. the walk from the hotel is not bad at all, and we were probably able to see more of the city walking back to the hotel everyday than if we had stayed closer to the center of town. The only part of the hotel that we did not like was the bed. It was very hard and did not sleep well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel David - a pearl in Florence We stayed at this small boutique hotel in August 2004. which was situated along the Arno River a short walking distance to the city center. Two young men ran the hotel in an exceptionally efficient manner. They were helpful and courteous and tended to all of our needs and requests. They couldn't help us enough. The rooms were immaculate and appointed in lovely period furniture with wood floors. Breakfasts were lovely. Bathroom had a nice shower. There was a lovely garden with refreshments served in the early evening compliments of the house. It was a peaceful place to relax after a long day of sightseeing. We paid 90 euros per night. An incredible find. We would definitely stay there again. I would highly recommend this hotel for people who want a lovely sleep for a great price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Gem After a 3 week tour of Italy, my husband and I look back at our three nights at the Hotel David as very special. We found the hotel charming, with attractive, comfortable rooms, a pleasant sitting room, and a garden. Also, it is well located. All points of interest in Florence are easily accessible by bus or within walking distance for the more able-bodied. Breakfasts were delicious and ample. We especially liked the wine and appetizer hour in the evening, a pleasant way to relax after a day of sightseeing and an opportunity to enjoy the garden and chat with other guests of the hotel. Most outstanding of all was the service. The staff were helpful in every respect. They assisted us in planning each day and directed us to good restaurants. In all, this was the very best hotel in which we stayed during our trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Deserves Its Ranking This is a great little hotel. The service was superb, our room clean, suitably large, comfortable and quiet, overlooking the back yards of adjoining homes. Breakfast was pretty standard for Italian hotels, served by friendly staff who made Lattes on request! The hotel is not downtown but is a twenty minute walk from the city core. You can get a bus right outside the door that will take you to the Ponte Vecchio. From there it is a short walk to the main atractions. The hotel booked our reservations at the Uffiziz and the Academia. Reservations ar an absolute must if you do not want to stand in a line for hours. There is an Internet site. The hotel has a happy hour where you can meet some of the other guests in the salon. Very nice. The hotel is moderately priced and really deserves it high Trip Advisor rating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent hotel, the reviews were right! I picked this hotel based upon other reviews and I was not disappointed at all. The hotel is situated about a 15-20 minute walk from the main/busy area of Florence. I enjoyed being away from the super busy area and loved how quiet it was in the afternoon. My room felt more like a bedroom than a hotel room, something I liked very much. The bed and linens were comfortable, the bathroom was squeeky clean, and the staff were incredibly nice and would help me with any questions I had - and also helped me order pizza delivery! The staff also gave great lunch and dinner recommendations that were not the super touristy places to eat. The hotel has a nightly 'happy hour' with small snacks and wine. Also, the hotel's selection of reading material was great when I finished the one book I brought with me.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved, Loved this Hotel I loved this Hotel. I could have stayed here for several weeks. The location is on the other side of the Arno River away from the tourist areas - we liked this as we could walk around and feel like 'locals'!There are 2 buses that can take you into the center of Florence or to the Ponte Vecchio bridge in 5-10 minutes.This Hotel is a Villa converted into a 25 room hotel. It really did feel like a home. There was a great downstairs sitting area and a nice garden area. In the evenings, they have a Happy Hour with snacks, wine, juice- nice touch! Best of all... free Wifi! The room we had was huge, by European standards, with beautiful Renaissance-style decorations. The linens on the bed were so comfortable- I'm still trying to find out where they buy them! :)I would definitely stay here and recommend this place again and again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the David Hotel We just returned from an 8 night stay at the David Hotel. We found the staff to be incredibly helpful, warm and friendly. They had many helpful ideas on where to go and helped us plan our time in Florence. The rooms were cozy and elegant. Loved the linens. The breakfast was surprisingly complete. Again the staff was very helpful and accomadating. The evening wine and snacks was a nice touch.They have a wonderful travel library and novels available to guests. It is surprising not to find this hotel reccomended in travel books. I cant imagine a better place to stay in Florence. It is a 15 minute walk to many of the sites downtown, but there is a bus and the walk is beautiful along the Arno river. We liked being in a less busy congested area. Also there are a number of good resturants in the neighborhood of the hotel and a good laundermat near by.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved this hotel We booked this hotel after reading previous good reviews on tripadvisor.com. We stayed 3 nights and we weren't disappointed.Although the hotel is about a 20 minute walk from the Duomo and other major sites, the distance actually works to it's advantage, as the hotel really does feel like an oasis after a day amongst the bustling crowds. We generally walked to and from the city but on a couple of occasions we caught buses, which was very easy. The hotel sells bus tickets and the bus stop is just around the corner.Our room (#4) was very big by Italian standards and very clean. However the one thing that set this hotel apart from others was the friendliness of the staff and the general homely feeling they give it..there are even complimentary pre-dinner drinks and nibbles in the garden/lounge, which is a really nice touch.We would definitely recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is the place to stay! Hotel David was great! We stayed there with our 2 teenage daughters in a large room with 4 beds. The bathroom was big and very clean. The beds were comfortable and the air conditioning worked very well, which was important when we were there in July! Florence is SO hot in the summer! The hotel itself is lovely and filled with books and games in the lobby, and the grounds are beautiful to sit in in the evenings. The breakfast was a nice assortment of cold items, and there was plenty of coffee and fruit, which we really appreciated.Our girls enjoyed being able to access the free internet, and Hotel David offers each room 10 min of free calling to many countries, which was a bonus for us. We liked having the secure parking for our rental vehicle, as well.We would definitely stay at Hotel David again, should we ever be fortunate enough to return to Florence!</p></li>

I had a balcony that overlooked a post card perfect scene. The staff were so very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was excellent with quiches and a wide assortment of yummy food (definitely way above the standard breakfast at other hotels). They have a wine and appetizer hour each night and I met some lovely people. Travelling alone I was hesitant to join, but was so glad I did. The 10-15 minute walk into the heart of the city was fantastic. each day I took a different route and experienced a little of the local scene away from the major tourist draws. I am going back to Italy in May with my fiance on our honeymoon. I would have stayed at Hotel David in a heartbeat but it was all booked up!This is my favorite hotel I've ever stayed at in any city!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Absolutely Wonderful! Hotel David was such a wonderful place to stay. The staff seemed to truly love their job of making our trip the best it could be. They were so extremely helpful and had great recommendations. Our room was very large with a nice sized bath (certainly by European standards). The breakfast was one of my favorites. We really enjoyed the free wine and appetizers offered in the garden each evening. It gave you time to sit, relax and get to know the other guests. One of the best ammenities though was the free 10 minute call home each day and free internet. Since I have little ones it gave me one more time to check on them and keep us all at ease.While it is slightly outside of town, that was never a problem. We enjoyed the walk several times and used the bus the others. The bus stop is right outside so it was very convenient. All the extras of this hotel make it certainly worth it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">hotel david the best The Hotel David was recommended by my sister who stayed there two years ago and loved it. My daughter and I stayed there this July and were not disappointed. It was definately the best place we stayed on our entire trip. The staff were excellent and most helpful, going above and beyond the call of duty. They even downloaded our photos onto a disk so we didn't have to buy a new memory card. The food at the breakfast and the happy hour in the evening was really good and abundant. I am a good cook so I appreciate quality in that area. Our room was spacious and beautifully appointed with a great ensuite! The hotel is on the far side of the Arno from the main action but very walkable. We took the bus in one day which was very easy, but walked most of the time. Everyone I talked to while socialising during the happy hour were equally impressed and said they would definately come back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Away From the Crowds The Hotel David is located across the Arno outside of central Florence. Since Florence is packed with tourists in October, the location is ideal for getting away from the throngs of people. Conversely, one has to use public transportation (comfortable and readily available), taxis (expensive), or walking to get to the city. We love walking and went into Florence a variety of ways, through the Ponto Viecchio or via Santa Croce, and got to see the city up close. One warning: transporation gets real spotty after 10PM (even cabs) so be forwarned. The hotel itself is comfortable, tasteful, and a little homey. Staff are especially polite and helpful. The room was large and comfortable. There was free internet access. Breakfast offered a wide range of excellent choices. Located in a neighborhood - as opposed to a central city business district - exploring the nearby streets was interesting.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent with Helpful and Friendly Staff My wife and I stayed in the Hotel David for three nights last week. The hotel is well situated about 20 minutes walk from the Ponte Veccio and is served by frequent buses to the centre of Florence (5 - 10 minute trip depending on time of day).The hotel is comfortable, clean and has lots of character and fantastic bathrooms. A buffet breakfast was included in our deal and had a variety of food to suit all tastes. There was also a happy hour in the evening (not sure if it is every evening, as we only availed of it once) with complimentary wine and snacks.The staff of the hotel were most accommodating and helpful. We arrived very late at night and were welcomed and checked in with the minimum of fuss. Staff at the reception desk helped us with transport timetables, directions and bus tickets, and arranged taxis when there was a short term bus strike. Highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Perfect 10 Our adult family of 5 stayed at the David from 12/29-1/2. It was a flawless vacation and we owe it all to the Hotel David. The staff was patient, kind, and accomadating. We changed our check in date (very last minute) and they were flexible and patient as we bumbled through our maze of mind changing plans. The staff at the front desk was consistently friendly and directed us to wonderful restaurants, laundry facilities, and museums. One tip, don't bother going to the nearby gym. They kept us waiting for 20 minutes while they (supposedly) looked for someone to take our $ and get us into the facility. We gave up. Excuse me for digressing. We stayed in Rooms 11 and 15. They were both spacioius and attractively decorated. The bathrooms were upgraded and spotless. The daily breakfast were delicious and the lovely lady incharge was a very hard worker. I would only return to the Hotel David upon a return visit to Florence.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Soooo Great! This was our best hotel in Italy. Great character and charm and the best people. I chose Hotel David thanks to great reviews here and I was not disappointed. Our triple room was spacious and clean, the hotel itself was beautifully kept - the owners just seem to care about the details. Breakfast was much better than average - based on our other 4 hotel stays. Happy Hour provided free wine and snacks and they even made a special dish when my daughter could not find something without cheese or milk in it (lactose intolerant). The only down side to staying here for a short stay is that it is a good walk from the center of Florence - but I loved being on the other side of the river. We had great weather, but a rainy or cold day would have made the extra walking a bummer. If I only had a night in Florence, I might opt for something in the heart of the city - just to keep it easy - otherwise, choose this hotel - you will not have any regrets.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">a memorable experience We stayed in Hotel David on a 3 night break in Florence, it is a fantastic hotel. We chose Hotel David based on the Tripadvisor reviews and it was even better that expected. The staff and owner were so helpful, nothing was too much trouble and everything possible was done to make our stay memorable. The happy hour is also a great idea for meeting other guests; we sat every evening and discussed the day鈥檚 events over a glass of wine and aperitifs beside the beautiful Christmas tree. The weather was very cold and clear but the hotel was always warm and welcoming after a day sightseeing. The hotel is very clean and comfortable and a delicious breakfast is served with a smile every morning. We enjoyed the walk along the river to the town and up the hill behind the hotel to view the city.A great experience and we would recommend Hotel David to all who do not want to stay in an unwelcoming box. Hotel David should be No. 1 on Tripadvisor.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Stay at the David! We stayed at the Hotel David for 3 days in December for our Honeymoon and we could not have been more pleased. We booked it from the reviews here on trip advisor and were glad we did.The location is great although it is about a 15-30 miniute walk from the center of the city which can be a little tiresome at the end of a long day but there are plenty of taxi's and there is a taxi stand right in front of the hotel for those that would like to skip the walk. It is removed form the tourist hustle and bustle which is a plus and the service is 5 star all the way. They helped us book our tours and trains and handled all of our requests. The breakfast is good and the rooms are spacious and clean, as are the bathrooms. We give this hotel our wholehearted endorsement and recommend it to all who may be considering it!!PS-Check out the trattoria Gigi right down the street from the hotel for some great authentic florentine cuisine...DELICIOUS!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice hotel with great service  Lots of good things to say about this place: free breakfast, free happy hour with hors dourves, free long distance calls using their Skype connection, free use of their internet-connected laptop, plus a very friendly and helpful staff ! The rate was very competitive. The room itself was large by European standards, very clean and had a comfortable bed. The room furnishings were quite ordinary. Noise from the street and/or rooms above could be heard (people walking on the wood floors, not voices)...not overly loud but enough that our sleep was just a bit disturbed. The location is a bit far from the heart of Florence (20 minute walk),  buses run frequently but with their schedule also take about 20 minutes. So, it's entirely 'doable' to stay here and enjoy Florence, but a place in the heart of the city would be more convenient. Overall, I would recommend this place as a clean, comfortable, affordable place to stay, with a very friendly and helpful staff !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we loved Hotel David October 18, 2006We have just returned from a wonderful 6 nights at the Hotel David. We found it on Trip Advisor and could not have been happier. It is just off the beaten track of very busy and touristy Old Florence...a 20 - 30 minute walk to the Ponte De Vecchio. There is also a bus just steps from the hotel that takes you right to the bridge if you are too tired to walk, Our room (#24) was absolutely beautiful and spacious with all the modern comforts yet old time charm, Comfortable bed, air conditioning that actualy really works, an in room safe and large bathroom.The hotel is immaculate and very well maintained. Add to that free internet, free parking, a lovely breakfast and even a 6:30 wine reception every evening in the cozy sitting room.The staff were wonderful and helpful. Make sure you have them book your reservations for the various art galleries and museums ahead of time to avoid the long lines.We are picky, but we loved this place and will definietly go back.Great Value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A very special hotel We had a lovely stay in Florence, with the hotel playing a large part in our enjoyment. The hotel staff were always friendly and helpful, helping us to find out bus times for day trips and booking our tickets to the Uffizi (if you're going, it's best to request this in advance as we had to wait 2 days  go at 16:15). The staff couldn't have been more helpful, and their perfect english made things very easy. The location is about 25-30 minutes walk from the city, but buses stop very near the hotel and only cost 鈧?.20. The only reason that I haven't given 5 stars is the distance from the city and the fact that there is no hotel restaurant. The breakfasts were always great  well stocked - yoghurt, baked goods, croissants, cereal, etc, and the daily evening aperitifs were a lovely touch. Our room was large and very clean, with a fridge and air conditioning. The bathroom was also very spacious. There is also free internet use. All in all, a fantastic choice of hotel - I'd definitely recommend it highly to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent inn on quiet side of the river My wife and I stayed at the David Hotel for one night in September 2006. We were relieved to reach the relative calm of Florence after spending three days in Rome, and we were even more relieved to find that the positive reviews of this hotel ring absolutely true. We were greeted with genuine warmth and escorted to our room on the first floor. The room was outfitted with a canopy bed, a small desk, and a large hutch/dresser. The bed was firm and comfortable. We enjoyed the fifteen minute walk into central Florence, which provided spectacular views of the Ponte Vecchio.In the evenings the hotel provides wine and light appetizers in the very pleasant lobby. Breakfast is on the second floor and consists of cold cuts, bread, yogurt, coffee, tea, and juice.We were very pleased with the friendly, personalized service, and although the location is outside of the central tourist area, we enjoyed the surroundings and would undoubtedly choose the David Hotel again if we are ever fortunate enough to return to Florence.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Wonderful Hotel! My daughter and I stayed at the Hotel David for seven nights earlier this month and couldn't have been happier. The location afforded us respite from the city center and every morning we explored areas of the Oltrarno on our walk across the river (about 15 minutes).The staff was, without exception, friendly and helpful. Our first night,feeling too tired to venture far for dinner, we were directed to a local restaurant/pizzeria (La Greppia), where we had a great meal (fantastic pizza). Gabriele, in particular, helped us with a number of issues. When we traveled to Lake Como in the middle of our stay, we simply left our large suitcases at the Hotel.The rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. Breakfast is served in a light-filled and charming room, with a variety of both hot and cold dishes and many beverage choices. Cappuccinos are made to order. Free WiFi in the rooms was an unexpected bonus and there's an available computer in the lobby.I highly recommend the Hotel David to anyone looking for reasonably-priced and memorable accommodations in Florence.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">2nd time even better! Well, what can I say that has not already been said. We ( 6 adults) were here 2 years ago in 2006 and this hotel was perfect, now we just came back from our second visit of Florence and Hotel David (8 of us) and it was even more perfect since they now also allow a free 10 minute phone call to Canada daily. We stayed here 4 nights and when Michele and the owner Gabriele saw me they recognized me right away. They, along with Chiara, Sabrina and the breakfast ladies are just the best hosts anyone can ask for. We love the location because it's in the residential part of Florence and is close to many beautiful restaurants and a Rosticceria which is just around the corner. We purchased wonderful take out food at the Rosticceria and brought it back to the Hotel to eat it in the garden and the front desk gave us plates, glasses, forks, knives, serviettes to eat with. Now that's service! This hotel is spotlessly clean with large rooms, large bathrooms and beautiful balconies overlooking Piazza Ferrucci. I'm already dreaming of returning in 2 years time again, I can't wait.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Amazing Customer Service My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at Hotel David from June 5th through the 11th. From the moment we walked in the door we were treated like family. We were greeted by Chiara and later met the owner Gabrille as well as additional staff Maria and Francesca (please excuse spelling errors!). I had alerted the staff of some specific food allergies I had upon making the reservation. Within 5 minutes of checkin the staff made me aware of their knowledge of this. They not only had done research to seek out local restaurants where I would be able to safely dine but they had purchased gluten free cookies and gluten free frozen pizza which they prepared for me during their nightly happy hour! The staff consistently went above and beyond what was expected of them and made every moment of our stay enjoyable. We had a beautiful room with a patio which overlooked their beautiful and well kept patio (Room #1). The hotel was very near 2 bus stops and within walking distance to many sights. We'll definately return to Hotel David if/when our travels lead us back to Florence!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Keep the Location In Mind The hotel was nice, I would just caution fellow travelers about the location - it was too far to walk to the historical core multiple times in a day. For instance, running back to the hotel to take a nap or drop off packages, pick up or drop off a jacket or umbrella was not really practical and was time consuming. I thought the walk would be no problem and would be enjoyable along the river, we're young 40's - but the reality was that you are walking along a road with lots of noise and exhaust fumes and you need your energy to walk all around town once you get there. (In addition to walking, we did take the bus many times, but at night it stopped running pretty early like 9:00 or 10:00.) If I had a car that I needed to park for my stay in Florence - then I think it would be a fine choice. But, for myself, I now have a new travel rule, which I picked up from this trip to Italy, (from stays in Sienna, Lucca and Florence) if you are only there for a few days and have no car, stay in the city center and within the town walls, even if it costs more or is a less desirable hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic Deal in Florence First rate. The is a classic, old hotel... with a comfortable lobby and excellent staff (that speak fluent English and were more than happy to get reservations for museums). We stayed in Room 11 (on the 3rd floor) which is a corner room facing the front of the hotel with a terrace (and en-suite). The room was spacious and the bathroom was fine (though only a shower). The breakfast was good. This is a really fantastic deal for Florence (84 Euros). The only drawback is the location, but this really isn't a serious matter. It is a 15 minute walk to the heart of things (maybe 20), but it's a nice walk along the Arno toward the Ponte Vecchio... and there are several easy-to-catch buses that frequenty come and go if one wanted to do that. The hotel is in a quiet neighborhood on the south bank of the Arno and a bit east of the old part of the city. There aren't a lot of restaurant options in the area, but most go to the heart of the old city anyway. Again, the distance is probably what allows for the price of the stay, but we (age middle-50s) had no problems at all with the location.A great deal in a fine establishment.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the ambience We enjoyed 3 nights in this hotel. Our room was very roomy with charm - old character., the bed very comfortable , a safe is in the room, the daily cleaning was perfect. Quiet at night and well air-conditioned. It feels more like someone's house with its antique furniture and homely decor We also found the location to our liking and away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre. The hotel is about a 20 minute walk from the Ponte Vecchio, however there are plenty of buses that run from outside of the hotel and the walk itself is lovely as it takes you along the river-tickets at reception. One of the best things about the hotel is undoubtedly the staff, attentive, warm and friendly at all time, extremely helpful from the time you arrive to when you leave.Breakfast was good value and was a good way to start the day. All in all we felt at home and relaxed and this greatly enhanced our holiday. Another feature was the happy hour where they provided nibbles and soft drinks or wine which was a lovely idea and a chance to chat to other guests.The Hotel also includes in the room rate the free internet, and free Skype calls. All round a good experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great stay at the Hotel David I read many of the reviews on TripAdvisor before planning my trip to Tuscany and took a chance on the Hotel David. My boyfriend and I were not disappointed, it is a wonderful little hotel that is off the beaten path. The hotel itself is charming and has a comfortable sitting area on the ground floor where you can relax. As long as you don't mind walking a bit (15 Minutes) to get to the center of Florence where all the sites are, you won't mind staying here. The staff was extremely helpful (they recommended some good local restaurants near the hotel and the Palazzo Pitti and made reservations for us too). I noted that many people said their rooms were large - I will note that our room was quite small (Room 8 I believe), smaller than I would have hoped but it was not something to really complain about because it was immaculately clean and the bed was comfortable. The breakfast was quite good for one that is included. I think one of the biggest selling points of the Hotel David is that it is very quiet at night, you don't get any of the nighttime traffic noise that you would get at a hotel in the historic center and therefore are pretty much assured of a good night's sleep.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The perfect hotel - The groom's parents, London. We have just returned from a 6 night stay at Hotel David, when our son got married. Where do we start? Friendly, professional, genteel, great ambience, top quality service, cleanliness, car parking facilities, an airport meet and greet service, outside space, great location - in a word, PERFECTION. What is more all this is achieved at a very competitive price. Our family occupied more than a dozen rooms over the week and we all had the most wonderful time.The owners and every member of staff were exceptional and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was a leisurely experience - we were never rushed. a lovely array of choices in particular local specialities and cakes. The complimentary aperitifs in the garden each evening were an absolute joy. On the morning of our sons' marriage pre-wedding drinks were arranged to start the day - it was just like being in our own home.Well done, Hotel David. You deserve the highest praise we can give you and more. There can be no better hotel in Florence and we thank you for a beautiful family experience and wish you every success - we will certainly come again.Don't change a thing you have got it just right - YOU ARE THE ULTIMATE HOTEL</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From an American living In Italy I must say that the Hotel David is really a very comfortable hotel with large rooms and bathroom. We had a triple room and were in room 15 and found the room to be exceptional. Very clean, comforable beds, high quality linens, and everything was in order. The rooms are sound proof so you don't hear your neighbors, nor the outside traffic. We were there over all Saints Day weekend so the city was very crowded, but the hotel is in an area with lots of beautiful trees and right next to the Arno River.The staff is wonderful. Both ladies were very helpful with restaurant reservations and suggestions as well as very socialable and friendly. The breakfast is very good and constantly restocked by the kind young lady that brought us our coffee. My son, husband and I liked the small aperitivo they had in the livingroom area and my son even had the chance to play chess in the beautiful livingroom area of the hotel with another child guest he met during our stay.I highly recommed this hotel as you will not at all be disappointed. All the reviews are accurate and worth reserving at the Hotel David ! Fantastic stay !! Grazie Mille for everyones input at Trip Advisory as this is the reason we choose this hotel..</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Another Recommendation for the David!! We chose the Hotel David for our stay in Florence due to the wonderful reviews on TripAdvisor and were certainly not disappointed. In fact, it was one of our favourite hotels throughout our travels. We enjoyed the peace and quiet of the residential area in which the hotel is to be found and the short walk along the river to and from the centre of the city. There is a bus stop across the road from the David which goes directly to the train station, which we found very convenient. Our room was large, impeccably clean, tastefully furnished and had French doors that opened onto a small balcony. The staff were always friendly and helpful, more than happy to accommodate any question or request. We were recommended the nearby GiGi Trattoria and we had a wonderful meal. We can also highly recommend the Rosticceria around the corner- perfect for a picnic lunch! The staff of the David organised advance tickets to the Accademia museum which saved us a lot of time waiting in line. The breakfast selection was extensive, delicious and served with a smile- a great start to the day!We will definitely return to the David on our next holiday and would recommend it to anyone looking for a charming and serene haven in Florence.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Great Choice We booked the Hotel David based on the terrific reviews on Trip Advisor and were thrilled with our choice. The hotel was just as we expected and the service was excellent. The staff is very helpful and friendly and made us feel right at home the moment we arrived.The breakfasts were varied and plentiful with delicious cappucinos made to order if desired. The evening happy hour was an added bonus and our kids really enjoyed that time to help themselves to snacks and play in the little garden area.The room (quad) was quite spacious for the 4 of us, with air-conditioning that worked well. We also appreciated the automated shades that allowed us to sleep in a few mornings. The free wireless internet was helpful, as we were able to stay in touch via email throughout our stay.The location is about a 20 minute walk to the city centre...maybe took longer as we were with an 8 and 10 year old...and it was very hot. We did take the bus a couple of times and that was a good option. One night we did find it quite difficult trying to find a bus or even a taxi to take us back to the hotel later in the evening...I am not sure if the busses ran that late.All in all, a great time and we would definitely choose the Hotel David next time we visit Florence.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic Hotel We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel David. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We were able to have them assist us with booking a reserved time at the Uffizi so that we did not have to wait in line for tickets. On our second day the staff helped us book a horseback riding excursion in the country. It was the best part of our stay in Florence! The website is listed below. www.horseridingintuscany.com. After riding, included in the price was a fantastic wine tasting a lunch at a local resteraunt in the castle. As for the room at Hotel David, it was extremely spacious and clean. The rooms really are sound proof as we were not able to hear the busy road outside our room. The water was warm in the shower and the complementary breakfast was lovely. The hotel is definitely off the beaten path but we prefer that, a 15 minute walk and you are in town. They have bus service outside not far from the hotel but we did not try that so I can't comment on how well it works. You must try the Fagioli resteraunt just in town, the staff will give you directions. It's amazing, home cooking by a family who has been in business since the 60's. We ate there twice! We would recommend this hotel to everyone. We had a great time and were extremely comfortable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hidden treasure in Florence Staying at the Hotel David made our 6 day break in Florence every bit as memorable as visiting the Uffizi, the Duomo or Michaelangelo's David!! The hotel is an oasis of tranquility about 15 minutes walk alongside the Arno to Ponte Vecchio. High ceilings, marble floors, pleasant gardens all create the ambience of a Renaisance mansion. The staff were very pleasant and helpful - they will book train or bus tickets for you or recommend a local trattoria, which is popular with the local population and offers much better value than those in the heart of the city centre. Our two rooms were spacious with enormous beds, air conditioning, large bathroom with both bath  shower. The lounge is a great place to read the tourist guides, newspapers and magazines that they provide or even play chess!! WiFi is available throughout and you can use the hotel's PC in the lobby. They even give you one free ten minute phone call worldwide each day. The buffet breakkfast was everything you could want, fresh friut, cereals, fresh bread, boiled eggs etc.The hotel is not in the city centre, but if you can't manage the walk you can catch the bus ( D Service) outside the door to the Ponte Vecchio, which runs regularly till about 9.00pm. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very Nice Little Hotel - Recommended We stayed in the Hotel David for 4 nights in August, having already had a few days in the Chianti area. The hotel is located on the edge of the city and what could be a nice walk into the centre of Florence can be a bit of a chore when it is 38C, as it was when we were there. However the hotel staff pointed us towards the bus stop just across the road where the small tourist buses run up to the Ponte Vecchio. They were also able to supply a map of the route and multi-trip tickets so no hassle with my non existent Italian.The David is a nice little hotel, the rooms are clean and the breakfast is very good. In the evening there are free snacks and wine in the garden, which is a nice touch and a chance to meet the other guests.However the best thing about the hotel is undoubtedly the staff. They are very helpful from the time you arrive to when you leave. The period when we were in Florence was the time when many of the restaurants close for the summer. However the staff not only suggested good places to go but also volunteered to phone and check that the restaurant was open and make a reservation. What is more when we returned they were keen to know if we enjoyed the meal etc.All in all I can thoroughly recommend it as a great place to have a relaxing stay in Florence.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Great Suburban Hotel in Florence We just finished a 15-day tour of Italy, including a 4-day visit to Florence. The Hotel David was our home in Florence, and we were very happy with the hotel and the service they provided us. This hotel has a suburban, out-of-the-city look and feel to it-which I think is one of its assets. It's about two miles from the Ponte Vecchio, the Uffizi Palace, and the other cultural focuses of Florence, and is in the quieter and much newer western suburbs of the city. There's a delightful garden that surrounds the hotel which quiets and softens the place, and the ambience is small, rural, country inn. While there is some three-lane traffic about 100 yards away, the general mood is restful and quiet. We used the D-bus-a local people hauler with a stop just outside the hotel- to commute back and forth to the Ponte Vecchio bridge, and this made access to downtown easy and quick. Accomodations were bright, clean, quiet, and comfortable. The front-desk staff, and the dining room staff were all very helpful, friendly, and full of great tips on the local sites and entertainment. I feel they all went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and welcome. The breakfast provided daily was very nicely presented, tasty, abundant, and filling. We definitely reccommend this hotel! We found it a welcome respite from the crush of tourists and crowds, and a great place to get some rest after a hard day of touring the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A pleasant surprise! My family and I (wife, 17 year old son and 70+ year old in-laws) spent 2 nights at the Hotel David last week. During our Italian vacation, we stayed in Milan, Rome, Florence and Venice and we found the Hotel David to be the best hotel of the bunch!The hotel is on the southern side of the Arno River, so you are a little away from the heart of Florence, but it was very easy to get around as a taxi stand was just outside the hotel. The hotel sits on charming lot with a small, shaded garden terrace just outside the main floor. There is another elevated terrace on the back side which is much sunnier. The lobby area opens up to a very comfortable living area with books, magazines, newspapers and a chess board. The entire hotel is decorated beautifully and its overall charm makes you feel very comfortable.The rooms were spacious and very clean. The bathroom was surprising large with a nice high-powered shower. The beds were comfortable and the linens were clean and soft.For the price, this was an absolute gem. But the best part of the stay was the very friendly and helpful staff. Every member of the Hotel David staff was extremely welcoming. They made us feel right at home and even went out of their way to ensure our room was fine -- they allowed us to look at a couple of room choices before we settled in.If you want a small, charming, clean, quiet and comfortable stay in Florence -- choose this hotel. Once you arrive, the staff will make sure you made the right choice!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Charming hotel with charming staff Well, what can I add to all the great reviews of this hotel? It really is charming and the staff are a delight making the stay even more enjoyable.The hotel is beautifuly furnished with laminated floors and half-marbled walls and staircase. The upper walls are white-washed and charmingly decorated with all sorts of painted animals and insects adding a touch of humour. A buffet breakfast sets you up for the day and there is a happy hour laid on by the hotel from 7-8pm with free wine and nibbles. No restaurant, but you don't soak up the cuisine and ambience of a city you visit by dining in the hotel anyway.The hotel is located on the Piazza Ferrucci which is on the south bank of the Arno, east of Ponte Vecchio. I recommend 3 ways of getting there until you get your bearings: by taxi; by bus D that goes back and forth between the train station and Piazza Ferrucci or simply by walking east along the south bank of the Arno until you reach Piazza Ferrucci. Don't do what I did on arrival which was to get to the start of the Via Michelangelo at Piazza Michelangelo and then find the hotel is right at the other end of that road!Florence is beautiful, especially if you're a fan of Renaissance art like me. It's like walking back into the 16th century with all the medieval streets and that's particularly reflected in the hotch-potch condition of a lot of the architecture, such as the Ponte Vecchio which appears in so many photographs but is really a bit of a muddled, propped up shambles. All adds to the charm though. Enjoy!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great stay at Hotel David! We stayed at Hotel David for 3 nights in early July. We were extremely pleased with the hotel. The location was great: a bit off the beaten path, but within 15-20 minutes walking distance to Ponte Vecchio.The rooms were quite large and nicely appointed. Both of our rooms (a double for us, and a triple for our 3 kids) each had a balcony, with chairs, which we enjoyed. Breakfast was wonderful, and they were re-filling plates and pitchers even as breakfast was supposed to be closing. The evening 鈥渟nack鈥?was also a very nice touch, served in a lovely garden. We had a car, and it was wonderful to be able to park right at the hotel.The only issue we had was with the locks and keys. The doors can only be locked and unlocked from inside the rooms, with the key. Without thinking, we locked the door of our kids鈥?room and took the key with us. We did this in other hotels, which made it easy to wake them up in the morning, without banging on the door (they鈥檙e all heavy sleepers!). However, it turns out that they could not get out of their room! This could have been a serious safety issue. In fact, we locked our own room and, out of habit, removed the key from the lock. Had there been an emergency, we might not have been able to get out of our own room as well. The simple solution is awareness of the issue and to always keep the key in the lock. We mentioned this to the staff as we departed, and they were very receptive to the issue. I鈥檓 very surprised that we were the first to raise this issue.I would stay at Hotel David again without hesitation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent Choice Like all the other reviews, we found the Hotel David to be excellent. The Hotel is a 20 minute walk, along the river, from the Centre but we found this to be no problem. If you don't fancy the walk, several different buses can be caught from almost directly outside the Hotel. On arrival, we were greeted warmly, with our cases being carried into reception. Our bedroom was spacious, quiet, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The Hotel offers complimentary drinks and nibbles in the early evening which was the perfect way to start our nights out, before wandering to the Centre to enjoy the wide choice of restaurants and bars available. We particularly liked the excellent-value little Trattoria Cibreo on 122r Via de Macci. Very enjoyable with a most helpful waiter, willing to translate the menu into English. There are a couple of restaurants local to the Hotel but its well worth going to the Centre in the evening, as the choice is much better. Also nice to see the Duomo and the other amazing landmarks after dark, and without the day-trippers. As two women travelling alone, we felt quite safe walking around the city at night. Common sense with carrying bags etc., must prevail at all times. For a local drink, we would also recommend bir Bacco on Lungarno Ferrucci, just around the corner from the Hotel David. Very pleasant atmosphere with charming bar Staff. Good experience.Anyone looking for accommodation in Florence, with beautiful surroundings, very caring, friendly Staff, good choice of breakfast and every whim catered for, could do no better than the Hotel David.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fabulous Boutique Hotel Stayed in the Hotel David for two nights while on our 3 month around the world odyssey. We weren't disappointed. Decided to stay here after reading TripAdvisor reviews and as time had proved again and again - we were pleased and delighted with our choice - all thanks to the reviews on TripAdvisor. We would describe the hotel as a small 'boutique' hotel with extremely friendly and helpful staff and wonderfully clean bedrooms and bathrooms (and amazingly spacious for european standards). Our room (I can't remember the actual number but it was on the ground floor) had an amazing four poster bed which was ever so comfortable and luscious! The breakfasts were lovely but we can't comment on the 'happy hour' as we were never around at that time to take advantage of it. The walk into the centre of Florence and to the Ponte Vecchio was a nice 20 minute stroll away from the hotel and was always an enjoyable experience, especially so at night when you see all of the lights reflecting off the river. The very helpful and friendly staff were always on hand to assist whenever needed (be that for restaurant recommendations or how to get to such and such). Highly recommend staying at this hotel if you are ever in Florence and highly recommend the use of TripAdvisor when deciding on where to stay wherever in the world you may be. It was indeed the best 'tool' we used when we did our 3 month trip (and the reviews and recommendations were always spot on - I know we wouldn't have had as great a trip as we did if it wasn't for being able to choose such great accommodation).Liz and Ian, Melbourne, Australia.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the Hotel David Just returned from our first trip to Italy. We spent 5 nights at the David at the end of May and found it as good as the reviews suggest or better. We had arranged for the hotel shuttle to meet us at the airport after our long flight and were greeted by the welcoming smile of the young owner. He runs a most efficient,immaculate hotel with helpful staff and extra touches. In the comfortable and spacious common areas, furnished with lovely antiques, there is a generous collection of guide books and interesting magazines for use of the guests. Internet access was welcome, and we enjoyed breakfast in the bright room run by a cheerful young woman.There are cheerful modern wall frescoes in the hallways. We were in room 11, a double on the 2nd floor with a big balcony with flower boxes overlooking the garden and screened by trees which provide complete privacy. Unfortunately they don't protect from the constant traffic noise. Those motor scooter drivers can get amazing decibels out of their machines! The minibar was kept replenished, the linens changed daily, and we got used to the flat, no-pile towels which actually dry you very well, kind of like blotting paper! Although the hotel is a bit away from the heart of the action, we found that an advantage and hopped on the D bus to get to and fro or walked. There are only two nearby restaurants, and at the one we tried, Trattoria l'Orologio, we were served by a supercilious creep wearing electric blue glasses. He was just too cool for the likes of us! We did find two other pleasant restaurants in Oltrarno - Osteria del Cingale Bianco, and Casalinga. We would be happy to stay at the David again and recommend it highly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We can't wait to go back Let me add to the rave reviews! We'd booked thro' venere (where you can read lots more) and notified on booking that we were travelling with relatives aged over 80. The e-mail had been noted and they had been allocated double with bathtub with shower on same floor as breakfast room, while we were in the triple above (shower only). Large, light rooms with parquet floors. From the moment of arrival onwards all the staff were friendly and helpful, on one occasion even looking up (unasked) curent opening times for the cathedral and printing them off for us.They also have a good (multilingual) stock of guidebooks for you to consult, as well as Int. Herald Tribune, Italian papers, and news magazines.We liked the walk along the river to ponte vecchio with skyline of duomo and towers to accompany you.We only took bus once to get to Accademia in time to join queue to pick up reserved tickets. We'd stayed in Oltrarno before ( at Hotel Boboli, which we would NOT recommend!) and liked being away from the tourist bustle. We ate 3 nights at the trattoria L'Orologio across the road (next to bus-stop): good choice for lighter supper or full meal. Food very good, service less so! The last night we walked to Gigli (recommended by hotel): slightly more expensive (mainly full meals). The free parking had been a major factor in our booking (we'd toured Tuscany and Umbria and kept the car to do day-trip to Pisa/Lucca and to get back to airport) as it saved us 100 euros compared with other hotels. The hotel in the event exceeded our expectations for a 3-star by miles: it features in a guide of hotels with charm and it's clear why. A final image: a crackling fire in the salon on a freezing February evening (and all those nibbles while you enjoy it).</p></li>
