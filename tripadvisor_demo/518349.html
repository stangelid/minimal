<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a gorgeous hotel with beautiful rooms. Breakfast is also good - take advantage of the free cava! The roof terrace is also great to check out the views and the hotel is near the metro station. My only caveat is that the rooms aren't greatly soundproofed, so ask for a room higher up to avoid street noise.</p></li>

Your Kobi wifi login sytem is ANNOYING! Constantly having to relogin each device a few times a day with a cyptic username and password. Get rid of it. also avoid room 115.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is nice and design. free wifi. close to metro station. The price I got did not include breakfast but we went there for the first breakfast. Good but 18 euros per person is way too much, as a result we did not use anymore. Girls at check-out very nice and eficient. Nice touch is the DJ at night, a shame there was not may people enjoy-it. Beds are too hard, very unconfortable.</p></li>

The hotel itself is modern looking and clean. One very odd feature is a glass bathroom. There is a mesh seperating screen in the room but it really does not do anything to help the fact that you can be seen in the bathroom/shower by whoever you are sharing a room with.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Silken Diagonal Barcelona was a must stay. Its a great hotel accoss the street from a huge mall with a starbucks! It was also 2 blocks from the metro (aka subway system). It was a great location. The hotel staff was great. no problems. Just be careful as they didnt mention that all their rooms have a see through shower, bathroom area. It is completely see through and that is the style of the hotel.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stylish hotel within a stone throw from the subway station. Interesting elevators and nice decors in the room. Everyone was friendly and couldn't do enough for you. Loved the contemporary design. Couldn't believe we were in Europe when we paid only 120 euro a night high season for this kind of quality. You can't even get this in Asia anymore. A couple of minor issues. Free internet but it hardly work in the room. the glass door by the tub is a bit small so the floor gets all wet after shower.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 6 nights, it's a brilliant hotel. Only a couple of minutes from a metro and tram stop, the shopping centre opposite has a square with small restaurants which are all really nice and expecially good for cheap breakfasts. The rooftop deck, bar and pool are great, drinks are pretty reasonable and it's nice to sit up there in the evening. Rooms are fab, we had a 'standard' room on the 4th floor but had a great view, the glass bathroom and electric blinds make the room that bit different from a normal 4* hotel.</p></li>

It's fantastically positioned to get to any part of the city by tram, tube or taxi. Rooms have great decor and spacious, great bar and a cool pool on the roof. No complaints at all except for the glass bathroom wall without any form of partition was a bit dodgy if your with your mates, no matter how much you like them!? Was nice to go to the roof top pool and watch some models doing having a photo shoot! *Great Bonus* Good complex across the road with lots of food places and shops.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The neighborhood for this hotel is under construction and buildings that remain show signs of blight. The walk to the Metro is dirty and graffitti is everywhere. The hotel itself is very modern but very dark. The lobby motif is dark simulated wood, brass, and silver discs. The hallways are dark shades of black brown and grey lit with purple fluorescent lighting. Rooms are also ultra modern and there is no ambience. Very disappointing stay-also a language barrier with hotel staff-we spoke english and knew no spanish-they spoke spanish and knew very little english.</p></li>

Not knowing the city, we chose by hotel rather than location - and were pleasantly surprised. A striking building, the hotel has a great cocktail bar, relaxing restaurant and - the best bit - a rooftop pool! Whilst not in the best location (we were a subway stop or two from where we'd ideally have stayed), there's still loads to do locally - shopping, bars, restaurants etc. 10/10 for the hotel... 8/10 for the location. The old "if we could just pick it up and move it" review...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You'll never get lost staying at this hotel as it is located directly next to the Akbar Tower, a new trademark and iconic image of Barcelona. The view as you walk or drive up to the hotel at night is just eye-popping, and it always helps you find your way home. We got an amazing deal on the hotel as well, likely because it is really not centrally located next to the tourist sites. That said, the metro is right next door and very easy to use. And, that's why the hotel, though sparkling and new, isn't that expensive. Extra points for the cool rooftop sunning area with the plunge pool and bar. Very fun.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A frequent business traveller to Barcelona 22@ area, I spent 1 night in this hotel located on Diagonal, next to Glories and the shopping center (15 mins from city center by metro or tramway). My room was clean, modern,a typical modern design hotel. Bathroom with glass walls (which I expect can be inconvenient for some people). The shower wasn't working very well. Nice roof-top swimming pool and bar area (actually more appropriate for having drinks than for swimming). Good breakfast and good restaurant, with an excellent-value lunch menu. In my opinion, maybe not the best option in the area, but still a good hotel.</p></li>

But once we got to the floor our room was on we smelled the sewer in the hallways, our room was a sauna, and the front desk could not get the AC to work or put us into a new room. We called down multiple times only to be told no technician was on sight and to turn it off and then back on and give it 20 minutes. We gave it 8 hours and it still wasn't cooler! The rooftop pool is also smaller than you assume from the images provided. But otherwise it is an awesome place to layout, see the city, and see the ocean.</p></li>

On a safe street. nice friendly staff and free PC use in reception. Only complaint was bed is very hard did have sore back after first night. luckly for us hotel not busy but could hear person next door taking shower and putting down black out blinds but so tried from all day sightseeing didn't notice after the first day. Pool is tiny (fit 3 people) so don't expect much but sight from roof top is nice view.</p></li>

Quite big double room, with glass window all over the wall and a very comfortable king sized bed, It was cleaned every day.The hotel is right next to the Torre Agbar, metro station Glories, bus stop and tram stop. Very helpful personel and clean environment. We had a serious problem with the heating due to the fact that the sun is all day in the room through the glass wall. They have a window roller blind but it is not enough. Unfortunately we did not taste the breakfast because it was quiet expensive (18euro/person) but just crossroad there is a big mall with supermarket and lot of choices of fast food.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is amazing! When we arrived we were upgraded to a suite which was just incredible! the living room, dining area was huge with great views of the city and cathedral, the bed was surrounded by ceiling to floor windows with electric blinds, there was a jacuzzi bath and a wetroom shower. The whole hotel was ultra modern, sheak and stylish with pod chairs in reception and a nice bar in the entrance. The location was just fine there is a tram right outside and you can easily walk to Sagrada Familiar in about 10 minutes. There was so much to do in barcelona but it was hard to tear ourselves away from our room as it was so brilliant!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel for price - very modern, very friendly and helpful staff (english speaking), hotel is opposite a tourist bus stop, less than 5 minute walk to the metro station (Glories), 20 minute walk to the closest beach and opposite a large shopping complex (great for a quick breakfast). We had an amazing view of La Sagrada Familia from the bedroom which exceeded our expectations. We loved the bedroom design and how the bathroom walls were transparent (suitable for couples). Cocktails were great on the rooftop, but don't expect to swim in the pool. This hotel is ideal for a short break to Barcelona, staying in a great location just outside the busy centre.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a hotel with great style and wondeful service.It's right next to the spectacular Torre Agbar and in view of Segrada .. so drinks and food on the rooftop bar as the sun goes down are quite an experience. Breakfast buffet is perhaps the best I have encountered - the range of fine foods is extensive. It's 3 or 4 stops from the Ramblas and has great access to teh Metro. Good shopping across the road with access to ATM. And the city tourist bus also stops outside the hotel. The young woman runnning the business was extremely helpful when I needed some help with documents. What more can I say? The hotel was a perfect home for 4 days in the wonderful city..</p></li>

Other rooms on higher floor had no view of tower but bath as well as shower. 3 minute walk to metro and same for tram . Great access for public transport. Brought breakfast in shopping centre opposite as not good vfm in hotel. Cocktails gr8 and all 9 euro. Cabs cost an extra couple of euro if called by reception. Really loved this hotel. Tiny pool closed but great views from rooftop terrace. Will definately stay there again. 15 minute walk to Sagrada</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It´s definetely an hotel that stands out for its design. The blue light in the bar gives a cool atmosphere right in the entrance hall. The big windows and the glassy wall in the bathroom, the corridors designed with diagonal lines, the round panels covering the ceeling of the restaurant ... lots of effort focused in details that impress those who appreciate decoration. Located close to Agbar tower, at night you can take very nice pictures from both buildings. The staff was not really warm, but OK. The windows are soundproof so no sleep problems. Close to the shopping mall, very handy ! Close to subway station. Tour bus hop on and off stops 5 meters from hotel, very good !</p></li>

We both loved the hotel, very modern and clean. Has a lovely roof top sun deck with a bar and a pool (was a bit small). It was just a few minutes walk from Glories metro station a great way to get around the city. Not much going on in area around hotel but there is a shopping centre just across the road with shops like H&M and Pull and Bear, there is also a big super market which is handy for breakfast or a snack as food in hotel abit expensive for 2 students! Also only a 15min walk to beach. Would recommend and would love to go back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Personally I enjoyed my stay at Silken Diagonal. The hotel isn't the cheapest, but our room was spacious, clean, comfortable, looked cool with its modern decor and had everything we could possibly think of needing. A/C functioned properly and I couln't hear any noice from the street either. It is a four* hotel, so you do expect to find certain amenities, yet I still was positively surprised to find bathrobes and slippers placed in the bathroom. I suppose we had somekind of a superior room, but maybe the same things are available in all rooms. Only downside I can come up with is the location. Allthough Glories metrostation is very close, I would prefer walking distance to center and sights. Nevertheless, I recommend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just came back from 2 nights at Silken Diagonal. Nice hotel with good location. Easy acces to public transport (tram just across the street). Large shopping mall also across the street. Rooms were standard size (probably 'small' for Americans), but modern and clean. Free (but slow) WiFi for browsing and e-mails. Nice rooftop terrace (10th floor) with a tiny pool and bar. Great location to hang out after work and enjoy the views of the town. Like someone already posted; corridors are dark with blue lighting, which is somewhat odd. Probably the architect watched to many StarTrek movies or so. Overall, it was a good hotel; you get what you'd expect from such a hotel and I would definately stay there again when visiting Barcelona again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The stay at Silken Daigonal was great. This is my second time visiting Barcelona and I found a cool place out of the bustle Ramblas. It's a cutting edge 4 stars hotel with very nice linen, nice amenities and free internet access in the room. Very cool interior design, not only in the bedroom, but all over. Their rooftop has a small pool but a nice bar to have a drink and some "Tapas"during the evening. The hotel is located just beside the Agbar Tower, there is a shopping mall accross the street and a subway station 5 minutes walking. You still have the tram and a taxi stop in the street beside. So it's very easy to reach the Ramblas, or Paseo de Gracia, or Example. Just to give an idea, a cab from Example to the hotel costs around 10 Euros.</p></li>

<li>The hotel is located just beside the Agbar Tower, there is a shopping mall accross the street and a subway station 5 minutes walking.</br></br></li>
<li>You still have the tram and a taxi stop in the street beside.</br></br></li>
<li>So it's very easy to reach the Ramblas, or Paseo de Gracia, or Example.</br></br></li>
<li>Just to give an idea, a cab from Example to the hotel costs around 10 Euros.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Can't really fault the interior of the hotel, but if you're away with friends wanting to experience the party lifestyle, then this hotel isn't for you. Handily located to the metro station but four stops away from the centre with no real trains running past midnight, which isn't practical if you're on a night out. As the hotel was so far away it wasn't worthwhile returning to get changed for dinner so had to stay in the centre all day, every day. The surrounding area of the hotel was pretty grotty with no late night amenities and completely inappropriate see-through bathrooms - which can't possibly appeal to the majority of their clientele. Reasonably priced but I would have paid more just to have had the convenience of staying in the centre of Barcelona.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We liked this hotel - I stayed with my 13 year old son for 5 nights - it is a modern hotel and in a good location - although not walking distance to town it is very close to the station and very easy to use the metro service. I did not at any time feel uncomfortable travelling around from this location and there is a shopping mall opposite. The beds were very comfortable and the rooms were nice and modern - the only negatives were the glass wall between the bathroom and bedroom - not great for mother and son - and the small (and I mean small!) pool - think plunge pool rather than swimming pool!! But it was nice to have the option of a cooling dip on the roof. Oh and the bar on the roof near the pool was lovely of an evening for a night cap with great views.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for three nights, and found this hotel to be clean, the rooms to be well equiped, apart from no kettle. It cost approx 30 euro from hotel to airport. The quirks of this modern hotel is that the lifts take some getting used to, and if you dont like being naked in front of your partner the bathroom would not appeal to you as it has glass walls. Also it is a bit confusing when you are trying to be quiet going for a midnight pee in the dark and banging into the glass!! Close to good transport links and a mall across the road to avoid paying for hotel priced breakfasts. Barcelona itself was a joy to visit with lots of things to do/see but for me was a visit to the footie ground was the highligght simply stunning. I would go back and use this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was far from the airport but you can get the blue bus (#1) at airport to center of town for 5 euros and then take taxi from center of town to hotel for additional 8 euros. Hotel is across the street from mall and grocery store so this is convenient. Tour bus picks you up in front of hotel and train station is near hotel. If you walk 2 blocks east and a few blocks south, you will find many nice restaurants and nice neighborhood. Hotel staff was very nice and helpful. WARNING: IF YOU ARE STAYING IN ROOM WITH SOMEONE AND YOU NEED PRIVACY, DON'T BOOK HERE. ROOM HAS SEE-THROUGH BATHROOM SO OTHER PERSON CAN COMEPLETELY SEE YOU TAKING A SHOWER- THERE IS NO PRIVACY. SOLUTION: WE PLACED MATTRESS UP AGAINST THE GLASS WALL PARTITION THAT SEPARATES BEDROOM AND BATHROOM/SHOWER FOR PRIVACY.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is not in the busy city centre but the metro is a 3 minute walk away and will bring you direclty to the centre of Barcelona. If you want to shop there is a shopping mall across the street with also some dining facilities. From the rooftop terrace you have a nice view over the city. The swimming pool is on the small side, not good for doing laps. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and some have a nice view of the Agbor tower, Sagrada familia and the rest of the city. The only thing missing in the room is a coffee machine. The breakfast buffet has plenty of choice and also a small diet corner. Downside is that it is every day the same. If you want you can also dine at the rooftop bar. If you don't want to stay close to the centre but not in the hustle and bustle of it then this is a very good choice!</p></li>

The service was impeccable, with all the people (from the lobby to the restaurant and room service) being very nice and polite. We stayed in a corner room, which we loved (the light coming in in the morning was perfect - the shutters work wonderfully to keep it out if you prefer). We stayed for 5 nights and was no more and no less than what we needed. In front of the hotel you have a shopping mall where you can shop or eat if you like. 100meters away you have a metro station which takes you everywhere in Barcelona, so the location is also perfect, allowing you to be in a quiet place (away from the noise and confusion of the center) and still be close enough to major attractions in the city (ten minutes from Sagrada Família or Picasso Museum).</p></li>

We asked for room with some nice view and at the end they gave us the main steet room..Nevermind the room it self was fine but you could se some bits and pieces which were not in the best condition plus signs of previous leakage from upper floor (i could understand that after having a shower - it is hard to keep the water going inside the tub). I really liked the idea of glass bathroom although only ok for couples ; ) The service was not bad but the reception staff just was not really interested, so that was bit surprising.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My brother and I stayed at the Silken for five days NYE 2012. We had a wonderful time. The Silken is a beautiful hotel and is centrally located. The hotel rooms are very modern and nice 7 out of 10. We did have an issue with the heating the first night but the maintence staff jumped right on it, The glass shower was a little disconcerting but we managed. Directly across the street is a mall with numerous retail stores, restaurants and a grocery store. The first couple days we took cab rides around the city until we learned how convenient the bus system is in Barcelona. The #7 bus has a stop across the street from the hotel and takes you directly to Las Ramblas the heart of the city....this is where we spent most of our time during our stay as there is so much to do in this area of the city. I highly recommend this hotel....I would go back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed with friends in early September in a standard room. The room was really well designed - spacious and modern with a rainwater shower and comfy beds. The roof terrace on the 10th floor was stunning, with 360 degree views of Barcelona. The pool was very small, more of a plunge pool really, but nice enough to cool off in after sunbathing. The pool bar serves sandwiches during the day ranging from €8-€16 and drinks from €3 for a glass of wine through to €9 for cocktails. Location isn't particularly central, but the Glories metro station is only a 5 minute walk. We walked to the Sagrada Familia in about 20 minutes. Service was polite and professional - and we were given a complimentary check out at 1pm which was nice. We paid about £110 per room per night which was good value - I would definitely recommend this place for a short stay in Barca.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very well designed modern hotel that provides for a relaxed comfortable stay. Rooms are spacios (stay already twice here) and very well lit. Windows allow a perfect view - one side onto the Torre Agbar and other side towrds the see - you can see the towers of hotel arts and Mapfre. Convenient location - opposite a shopping mall, another mall (Diagonal Mar) a few tram stops. You can easliy reach the Barceloneta beach by tram T4 - stop outside the hotel entrance (10 min ride). Top floor terrace with a pool and a bar has a relaxed atmosphere and amazing views (on nearby Torre Agbar, Sagrada Familia and as far as Tibidabo). Minibar prices overpriced, so bring in your own drinks from opposite supermarket. Next to hotel you will also find a seafood restaurant Gran Mariscada - reasonably priced and good quality and just a few steps from hotel entrance.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights from sun 13th April to the 16th. On arriving the hotel seemed very modern and stylish. It is very unusual and stylish but a little tired. The electric blinds in the surrounding rooms could be heard from our room and I agree that the building work going on outside is noisy BUT. . . . it has to happen so....!! The bath didn't work properly and flooded the floor and that was the same for the shower even though - they did look very stylish (just badly designed/constructed). I would say this hotel was of 4 star design but would probably only be 3star in the UK. We stayed in room 416 which was smoking and both of us are non smokers (only rooms left) which was very noticeable every day even with leaving the window open. The view was amazing from the roof terrace and even though it is a little out of the way you can access the Metro from a short walk.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is very stylish and up to date. We didnt stay in the hotel much with it being a city break we were only there to sleep. The rooms are very spacious and have massive windows that are in place of the outsie wall. By that i man where you would normally have your outside window in the wall, there was no wall it was all just window! There are huge electric blinds that cover the window giving privacy. If you stay at this hotel make sure your not shy around who ever your staying with as the bahroom doesnt offer much privacy with the dividing walls being seethough not frosted glass. We didnt have any food or drink at the hotel but did look at the menus. If you wish to eat or drink at the hotel make sure you've got a couple of quid! Not far from the hotel convieniently is a shopping area with several food outlets, supermarket, shops and an all you can eat chineese. Very nice hotel, is however a little expensive.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a realy nice hotel with excellent staff. Very polite, even when you are asking for directions to the same place 4 days staright!!! We stayed at this hotel for a total of 6 nights and had an excellent stay. Rooms were adequate in size, see-through glass in the bathroom was tres moderne!!! However not very appropriate when traveling with your fiance and your daughter. Very awkward for showering, but we made the best of it. The location is great, not entirely in the middle of everything but not far off either. We easily traveled by subway and tram to all over Barcelona. It is also walking distance to the mall and Gaudi's famous cathedral. Restaurant was pricey as was the room service. But check out the breakfast buffet. I think it was 15EU but well worth it and a great way to start the day. I would definately recommend and return to this hotel. I think we paid on average 120EU a night and it was well worth it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 6 days at the Silken Diagonal Hotel. Although the hotel is not located in the center of Barcelona, the Gloriés Metro Station is just a five minute walk away. The staff is very friendly and helpfull. Breakfast is served from 7 tot 11 AM. You have a lot of different things to chose from. Even cava if you want to. The rooms are spacious and look nice, although some handles in the bathroom were hanging loose. On the top of the hotel is a swimming pool. But in reality it is much smaller than it appears to be on the internet or in folders. Be very careful when you leave your room. Make sure everything is locked in the safe or your suitcase. A poloshirt was stolen from our room. Although the staff talked it over with the cleaning service, we never saw it back. Hotel Silken Diagonal has the potential to be an excellent hotel, but some minor annoying circumstances made it for me to be just a good place to stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Five mates and myself have returned from a weekend break in Barcelona where we harboured ourselves at the Diagonal. When you first step inside you are hit with the modern interior and beautifully laid out bar. The staff all very friendly and accommodating. Rooms very modern although for 6 blokes the see through showers were something of a revelation. Oh Gareth!! Erotic if you are on a romantic break but for 6 beer loving lager louts it wasn't something we overly enjoyed! Only disappointment being the pool. What pool? Oh... is that it? It is incredibly small. It couldn't realistically fit more than 3 people in there without you feeling very cramped. The photo's do well to enhance the actual size of it but when we first saw it in the flesh we burst into laughter. It was pathetic. Again, a very modern shape but could've done with being at least three times the size! All in all, a very good stay at the Diagonal. Would go again.</p></li>

Water drips from the roof onto decorative metal plates outside your window, making it sound like you have a drummer outside your window. I ask the desk to move my room and they stated that every room had the same problem. Hotel managements response was to give out free ear plugs. Both times I went to the front desk to complain, other guests were also at the desk complaining. I could not fall asleep in this hotel while it was raining, and actually checked out of the hotel and into another one at 4 AM, just to ensure I did not need to spend another night in this hotel. Aslo, when I checked in, there were dirty towel in the bathroom, bottles in the cash bar that had been opened, emptied and the caps put back on the bottle, and the maids left dirty cleaning clothes on the desk. Avoid, especially if you want to get a good night sleep, unless you can guarantee it will not rain during your stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My rating is based on the value for money which was great. 4 star hotel, modern and funky design for the bedroom and bathroom. I have to say parts of my room were a little bit shabby. Rusty crack in my bath and paper coming off the ceiling - not a big deal but not great. Also to note the house keeping service - knocking on my door on both mornings at 9am, which was a tad early! Also the hotel staff weren't incredibly helpful or friendly and arranging a taxi through them was a bit of a pain as they would forget and leave you sitting there until you enquired when the taxi would show up! The hotel is based on Avenue Diagonal, a long street known for shopping and business. I would advise anyone wanting to stay nearer the centre of town to not stay in this hotel. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel but it does take around 10 minutes to get you to where you want to be. All in all an ok stay - think ill try somewhere else next time.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice hotel- bit overpriced”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Positives: Good location. 2 minutes walk from Glories metro stop which means you can get from the hotel to the heart of the city in about 15 minutes. Also has a shopping mall and supermarket directly opposite the entrance so it's simple to pick up anything you need during your stay. Staff are helpfull and corteous without bending over backwards for you. Hotel is clean and modern and housekeeping is high quality. Comfortable beds and great showers, great after a day spent trecking around the city. Negatives: Not too many. I would say the price is around 30 more than they should be charging for this type of hotel but this seems to be common in Barcelona. If you're in a double/twin room make sure it's with someone you don't mind seeing you naked because the bathroom/shower walls are glass! Thankfully the toilet is behind a door. Tip: There's a doorman in the lobby called Dima. Speak to him about a transfer back to the airport when you're checking out. It's worth it.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed for three nights in the Silken Diagonal. The location itself is central but not in the city center. It's close to la Sagrada Familia and close to a metro station, so that works well. It's a very designish hotel but form definitely does not follow function in this case. E.g. the rooms are not carefully built, typical aspects of comfort like a coffee maschine or water boiler are missing, you don't find the tissues, showering waters inevitably the whole bathroom etc. Breakfast is OK but too expensive when not included in the room rate. I recommend everybody to cross the street as there is the gorgies shopping center with a food court and a lot of cafés over there where your breakfast will be fine and at a fraction of the hotel costs. I had a gin tonic at the hotel bar not careful enough to ask the price before I ordered and being charged 11,00 EUR for it blew me off. That's why I definitely decided to let you all know that this hotel experience is disappointing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a beautiful four day Valentines break in Barcelona. We stayed in the hotel Silken Diagonal as this appeared well recommended on trip advisor. However, word of warning to future travellers .... pack plenty of pain killers for your inevitable bad back should you choose to stay at this hotel. The hotel really needs to take on board the need for comfortable beds for city break travelers, for a four star hotel they need to make some changes to the quality of beds they are offering. Also we specifically requested a double or kingsize bed but had to push two single beds together!! Another point to mention, specially for us Brits who love our morning brew , there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room which we found most suprising for a four star hotel!!! As for Barcelona , this is a vibrant and diverse city and well worth a visit , bus tour is deffinately recommended. Final word of warning...watch out for the very experienced pickpockets especially along the la Ramblas!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 nights before our cruise with Celebrity! On Arrival we were very impressed with foyer. The hotel was buzzing with young men and realised there must be an event being held... Rooftop party...music blared for most if the weekend and the noise was disgusting through the night. Doors were being slammed and our rude ignorant neighbours held their own private party all night. Walls are paper thin so we could hear all the conversations and also the mechanics of electric blinds! The bed was very firm and the room was ok. Plenty toiletries supplied. The breakfast was excellent and we also had an evening meal which was lovely. We wanted to go in the swimming pool but could not get near it for young people drinking! On leaving the hotel for the port our pick up with A2B transfers did not turn up. However the staff on reception were useless in helping us as their English was hopeless!! We did flag a taxi down on the main road. Location is ok if you don't mind using the Metro.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is located in the new business quarter 22@, right next to the Torre Agbar and with really nice views of it from the roof terrace with its minute pool (no way you could actually swim there). There's a metro station nearby, the tram stops right in front of it, and there's a big mall across the street. So, you're out of the city centre but transportation options a good. It's a stylish hotel with many brown elements - that also make the dimly lit corridors really dark. The rooms are also furnished with modern design furniture. The windows cover one whole wall. But design was obviously more important than quality. It's next to impossible not to flood the bath room while taking a shower. Part of the equipment could need some maintenance. Breakfast is good, offering all the standards. What I really disliked was the unfriendly staff. They seem to thing that smiling is none of their business, and also talking is restricted to the strictly necessary. All in all, I'd say it's overpriced.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very good location: 3 minutes walk to the nearest Metro station at Glories, and a bus stop for the Barcelona Tour Bus right opposite the hotel. The Metro system also provides access to the railway network too. There are also tram and bus stops within a couple of minutes walk from the hotel front door. Finding the hotel underground car park caused a bit of problem the day we arrived. Parking is also 18 Euros per day. I left the car at the hotel and used the excellent public transport system instead. Clean room and well laid out. No coat hooks or pegs however, even in the bathroom, so outdoor jackets will have to be hung in the wardrobe. The front-line staff at the reception and the dining room could look happier, and try smiling at the guests occasionally. No information on breakfast or dining room times is verbally communicated by reception staff either, so be sure to read the information folder in the room. However, I would recommend a stay at the Silken Diagonal, and would certainly consider booking again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is very clean, modern and in a good location. It is situated in a 2 min walk to the Glories Metro station on L1 (red line). To get to the hotel, after you exit the metro train, take the right exit of the metro station, turn left when you get out of the station, walk up the steps and turn right. You will see the tall 'gherkin' looking shape building and the hotel is just right next to it. Therefore, although the hotel is not situated in the heart of the old town/city, you can still get to it easily via the metro trains which is very handy. It really is only a 10 min ride to the center of barcelona. The hotel itself is really clean and spacious and modern. The only thing to look out for and be aware is the see through bathrooms in the rooms. If you are staying with a group of friends who aren't comfortable in seeing each other naked, then this hotel probably won't suit you as the bathrooms in each of the rooms are pretty much see through. Apart from that, this hotel makes for a very comfortable stay.</p></li>

We decided to leave our bags with the hotel in a key-coded room, they had a padlock on them but by the time we got back and retrieved our bags, both our mobile phones had been taken.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got back from a weekend in the Silken Diagonal. It's not exactly in the tourist centre of Barcelona but is a very quick metro ride, and the metro is 2 min away. The hotel is of modern design, not exactly cozy but smart. I'm sure the roof terrace would be nice in the summer and when it's not raining. When we arrived there was some confusion as we had booked with a special offer but the message hadn't got through. First we had a room without a nice view which wasn't what we booked so we then moved to one on the other side. Both these rooms were ok but a bit small and the furniture was a bit shabby. Then we got a phone call from reception and they moved us to a suite up on the 9th floor, which I guess was the one we actually booked (or perhaps an upgrade, not sure). Anyway, it was lovely - a corner room with great views and both a bath and shower. I would recommend booking one of these. The rest of the stay was great, just the place to retreat from the rain! There is free wifi with a code from reception.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Unusually styled hotel, which is what made me book this in the first place. Decor sums it up on entry. Very dark and the roof looks fantastic. Staff smart, speak good English and were extremely helpful with the questions I asked them. Great location to stay if you are staying as a couple. Room is clean, Modern and spacious and the view of the Sagrada is fantastic. Perfectly placed opposite an open air shopping centre with a Carrefour placed bang in the middle, so we bought our Breakfast and Lunch from there and kept it in the fridge, few restaurant/bar type places here too for a swift Cerveza. Within 2 minute walking distance to Tram/Metro and Bus stop. Easy job on the train from the Airport. Get the train straight to El Clot and it's one stop on the Metro to Glories. The guy below does have a point on the banging though. It rained on our last night and we heard a banging noise of some sort. Luckily one of my ears was blocked, so I turned over. Great hotel though and were thoroughly pleased we got our value for money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent one night at the Silken Diagonal before getting on a Mediterranean Cruise leaving out of Barcelona. This hotel was one we could book directly through the cruise line, but considering they were charging 110euro per person we booked it online on our own. Considering we only spent 110euros total, I wasn't expecting much. This hotel is very modern and clean. The hotel staff were wonderful. Even after we checked out, they allowed us to store our bags for the day while we went sight seeing. The hotel was walking distance from the subway station, which made getting around town very easy. I would caution anyone to drag bags to/from the subway though. (While it is close to the station, next time I will get a cab with all the luggage we had) There wasn't any free internet (which is not unusual) Unfortunately the view from our room was of a large construction crane, but beyond that was a beautiful view of the city. It was a great place to cure the jet-lag with blackout shades and an extremely comfortable bed. I would love to stay here again and hope to one day!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel overall is brilliant. Decor is fancy etc etc, Having read reviews about the staff being rude, I was expecting this but we were checked in no bother, I saw at times however, that rudeness come out. (this shouldn't be a factor on your stay though,as you will only have dealings with staff minimum twice-checking in/out. The Hotel is lovely, the rooms are comfortable and it is worth the stay. Now on the matter of breakfast, We got the hotel with breakfast on a deal, which made breakfast worth it. The breakfast is nice however, you can even get a glass of sparkling wine to have if you want, iberian ham etc. (which I hounded into every morning!) But over the length of the stay, €36 for 2 peson on Breakfast isn't worth it no way (plus there is a shopping centre with supermarket cross the road) Its only a short walk to glories metro stop (not the 10 minute walks that some reviewers have said) Personally it doesn't matter one bit where you stay as long as you get a Metro Card, you can fly round Barcelona no bother! 4 stops and then you are just off Las Ramblas I'd stay here again not a bother, Its a lovely hotel</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel based on the reviews that I had read about it. I read that it was away from the city but also that there was a metro stop near the hotel. There was and we found it to be very useful from the start. It was simple getting to the hotel from the airport. Bought one T 10 pass for my wife and I to share. Took the train from the ariport to Clot metro station. Then took the metro from Clot to Glories and we were right next to the Torre Agbar. Simple. You are only about 3 stops from the center of the city and it was nice to have a quite safe area to come back to after all day out. The room itself was very nice clean and modern. We had a great view from our room of the Torre Agbar and of La Sagrada. Within walking distance of the beach (15-20min) and there is a mall across the street that also has a grocery store next to it. We were able to save a lot of money by going here to get some simple items. Yes there is a glass wall around the bathroom so if you are traveling with children maybe not for you but for business or for couples I thought it was perfect. Keep in mind that star ratings in Europe are very different from the states. But this hotel exceeded our expectations.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent experience (compared to subsequent Plaza Mayor in Madrid). Brand new, clean, excellent bathroom, good bed, fridge. The only trivial nit is that the water tends to splash out during shower on the floor -- yes, that's how good a hotel it is. ... But all other reviews say that as well already. A few extra comments on the location: Superb. 2 minutes walk to Metro with 4 stops on L1 line to Catalunya -- 10-15 minuts max. With the price of T10 being 7 euros and frequency of service, it's almost as good as being in the center, except you get brand new hotel in a newer part of town. Can walk safely at night along the Avenue Diagonal with other folks walking or biking down the center. Another major bonus is a large shopping center across the road. Don't want to pay for expensive hotel breakfast? We didn't, so we stocked up at Carrer Four supermakret in the shopping center for breakfast & lunches. Coffee? Can choose between Starbucks (filtered coffee worse than North America) or local Spanish outlets (excellent coffee). Lots of other eating/drinking establishments around the food court with outdoor seating area. Paid 107 euros a night (hotel web site, about 2 months in advance), which seems like a good value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">went to Barcelona for a long weekend and as we like to relax and do some sightseeing we booked a hotel with a pool. The Silken was the only one within budget and reasonably near the Catalunya metro stop. It is 5 mins walk to the underground stop and it is 3 stops to the Catalunya station takes 10 mins. I found it fine and good distance to the La Ramblas area. We found the rooms very nice, modern and good facilities. The blackout curtains were great but noisy in the morning as we like to lie in sometimes and you knew it was 9am as you could hear all of the blinds going up. The bathroom is glass and so you can see in so ok if you are with a partner or spouse but if you are with a friend you will need to shut your eyes when they are in the shower as they only have a thin piece of material covering it. Obviously the toilet is closed off!!! The rooms had everything, hairdryer, spare razor, spare toothbrush and all toiletries needed. It also had a safe and a minibar! We never used the restaurant so we cannot comment. Across the road was a mall glories it was great and had a food court and coffee shops and restaurants if you just want a quick bite to eat. Staff are very friendly and pointed us in the right direction!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I booked 3 nights at the diagonal via Easy Jet's own website. I was keen to see the hotel, as the previous reviews had left me feeling curious. In appearance, it is very stylish, very cool. Lots of modern decor and an upmarket feel to the place. I found the staff to be pleasant and generally helpful, although perhaps not at the pace that I am used to as a Londoner. The lock broke on our room one night as we were leaving the hotel to eat, and it took around 45 minutes for it to be fixed. Not a complaint really,more a small inconvenience. The rooms are very well appointed, ask for a view and you will get one. The Sagrada Familia is visible, and there is generally a good panoramic view of Barcelona. We were on the sixth floor and could see loads. The bathrooms are very nice, our bath leaked a bit but nothing dramatic, good toiletries. You are very close to the metro, you can be in the town centre in 10 minutes. We didn't eat in the restaurant, seemed a bit pricey, but there is the shopping mall across the road with a few different cafes and fast food joints for breakfast. So, would I recommend the place? Yes, but not at their listed room rate..if you can get a good deal..definitely. Oh, and the beds are a bit hard.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for two nights before a Mediterranean Cruise and enjoyed our stay. As other travelers mentioned, it's right next to a large cone-shaped building that's pretty cool. We loved being able to see La Sagrada Familia from our window! The rooms were very clean and the decor was nice. The bathroom walls are glass...but not the toilet (whew!)! Each room has one large bed for two people, so if you're traveling with 4 people, that will be two rooms. If you have three people, they do have some larger rooms with a couch that will accomodate that size group. The complimentary breakfast is phenomenal! There's a wide variety of fresh, hot food. Delicious fruit, eggs, meats, etc. It's all very good...even the coffee was wonderful! The pool is on the roof, which is unique, but it's incredibly small....SO much smaller than it looked in any picture we saw beforehand. Our kids didn't even want to go in it because they could tell that once they were all in, they wouldn't be able to do anything (there were 10 kids in our group). They didn't care about that though, we were there to explore Barcelona! It was easy to hop on the subway from the hotel (turn left outside the hotel and about 1/2 block up you go down the stairs to the subway) and see this wonderful city.</p></li>

<li>It was easy to hop on the subway from the hotel (turn left outside the hotel and about 1/2 block up you go down the stairs to the subway) and see this wonderful city.</br></br></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good clean hotel with some quirks”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here in Feb 2008. This is a good clean 3-star hotel with some quirks, I would not rate it a 4-star. The entire hotel is designed in a minimalist Philip Stark style. The rooms are modern (almost too modern), but a bit cold looking for my taste. The hotel not in the best location for walking to sights or restaurants, but it is right on the metro and tram lines which are very convenient ways to get around Barcelona. The hotel is on a busy street and there is some street noise. Also, as of Feb 2008, there is some major construction across the street where a couple of high rise buildings are going up, this was noisy. The breakfast was good. The lobby bar is a bit sparse, but they do have smoking and non-smoking sections. The elevator is strange, there are no floor buttons inside the elevator, you basically press your floor outside the elevator and it tells you which elevator you need to take, once inside, you cannot change your mind or go back! I would recommend this hotel if the price is right. Pro: - clean and modern - near the Glories metro station - free internet access in the room (wired only, no wireless) - good breakfast Con: - ultra modern may be a bit too minimalist for some - not in best location - thin bed cover on the bed, not high end sheets - uncomfortable pillows - traffic noise</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Silken Diagonal for one night before embarking on a cruise. Taxi from the airport to the hotel was 26 euros and took about 15 minutes. The hotel is very modern-the lobby bar and reception area is lovely- 70 style chairs and furnishings, fab! Check in was fine- the staff spoke enough english to check us in smoothly. Our room was on the highest floor and although the view wasnt exactly picturesque, it was lovely having a huge floor to ceiling window. The room itself was modern and clean, with enough room to move around despite our two big suitcases. The only strange thing was that the bathroom 'wall' is a kind of frosted glass which means that anyone in the room can see you in the shower- fine if your staying with your partner but not so great if you were sharing with a friend or your mum!!We went up to the rooftop bar for a drink but as there was a private party going on we couldnt stay long. The view at night over the city was lovely. The hotel is located just outside Barcelona city centre- there is a subway station a 2 minute walk from the hotel and the tube only takes 3 or 4 minutes to get to Las Ramblas. There is a large mall opposite the hotel that has quite a few shops and several places to grab something to eat. All in all, a good hotel and I would return went next in Barcelona.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for three nights. Everything was going fine and well until our last night, when it stormed and rained the whole night. At another hotel, not an issue. Here, you will not sleep that night. Outside the hotel above each floor's windows are long, hollow aluminum shades of some kind. When rain hits these the sound is so loud throughout the whole room nothing can drown it out. Not the AC or the TV, nothing. We had a flight to Majorca to catch early the next morning and because it happened to rain all night, we got no sleep. It may sound like I'm nitpicking, but believe me if you happen to stay in the fall or spring when it may rain all night, you'll experience the same thing that we did. It is for this reason alone I would never recommend this hotel, and it is a shame because it was just an awful design flaw that ruined an otherwise great experience. I'm sure if you go during a non-rainy season, and you appreciate modern design, you would like this hotel. It is rather spartan however (did not even have an iron board in the room) and the shower situation was annoying (only half covered with no curtain or door to close, so water gets all over the bathroom floor when showering). Clean and decently priced though, and the rooftop was great (not really a swimming pool up there though, more like a wade pool).</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here the day prior and the day after a cruise. It was one of the hotels the cruise line offered with in their package. I agree with another reviewer that it wasn't like the pictures. Our first night we got a corner room on the fourth floor with a view overlooking the "bullet" and the Sagrada familia. The room itself wasn't very clean. The shower system is very confusing to operate, the water splashed all over and there wasn't anything to hold onto getting in and out of the tubs, not very safe. We were a little cold that night and trying to be energy conscious, pulled the comfortors out of the closet. They were both dirty and covered with mold. The motorized screen was broken on one of the windows. Breakfast was fairly good. Upon return from our cruise, we ended up with a room on the second floor, no view, dirty, the light bulbs in the bath were burned out, the toilet seat was broken, the stopper in the tub wouldn't pull up so we had to remove it in order for the tub to drain. The elevator system was very slow, the corridors so dark, you couln't see your door to insert the key. The lobby was supposed to be designed to look like a ship with an ocean theme. I found it to be dark and uninviting. We have travelled often to several countries and continents and this hotel makes it to the bottom of the pile.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved our stay here and found the location to be perfect for us. Room: Comfortably appointed though I found the bed too firm. Be aware that the shower/tub and bedroom are separated by a peek-a-boo see through glass wall which may not be for the shy. Bed linens were nice. Cable tv with 2-3 english channels (BBC News, CNN). Good AC and scenic floor to ceiling windows. Location: We enjoyed the hotel location and found it quite convenient. A two minute walk to the metro and another 2 minute ride to all the happenings of the Ramblas. La Sagrada Familia is within eyesite and maybe 20 minutes by foot. We also found it very helpful that there was a nice shopping mall accross the street. This was great for last minute or forgotten items and snacks. Resturants nearby are better quality and much better priced than more touristy areas. It was also pleasant to be able to interact with people who lived in the neighborhood. Other Useful: The rooftop bar is great on a warm Barcelona night. The view of the Torre Agbar cannot be beat. Service: We experienced great (albeit not warm) service from all staff. Most everyone spoke English well and was very tolerant (amused?) with my attempts at Spanish. I casually spoke to the front desk manager and learned that they do everything from answering phones and emails to concierge service - so bear this in mind.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great and convenient for overnight, forget about the rooftop”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got a very good price for the room, very nice modern rooms, great bed, in general clean and nice hotel, everything you'd need is there. Location is also nice, easy to reach by public transportation or taxi, even possible to walk from downtown. The rooftop bar/pool was a minus, though. Went up on sunday evening to have a refreshing "swim" and some drink...There was some kind of open party with a bad DJ and strange people going up and down all night (people that are not hotel guests...a bit weird) so the atmosphere was absolutely not favourable for getting in the pool; we decided to get some mohito but then it turned out it ain't that easy - no it's not from the regular bar it's from a makeshift desk. No you can't pay there first get your "ticket" from the hotel personnel at another table. No you can't put it on the room, you need cash or credit card. Of course we were planning to swim, didn't bring anything up with us. All this for a small mojito in plastic cups (10 euro for one!). I never met a hotel bar where you can't put the consumption on the room, not in western Europe, not in Brasil, not in Romania. Additionally, the Michelin-recommended "piano"restaurant downstairs was...closed. (closed every sunday...in full season...hello??) Concluding, it's a great hotel to stay in Barcelona but find some other place to relax in the evening.</p></li>

<li>Additionally, the Michelin-recommended "piano"restaurant downstairs was...closed.</br></br></li>
<li>(closed every sunday...in full season...hello??)</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Agree with most of the reviewers - the staff's command of English was spotty.... some were great and others not so much. Perhaps after a two-week cruise, we were spoiled, but assistance seemed reluctant. 1 - The lights don't turn on unless you put your room key in a special slot - Were not informed - had to get the front desk to help. 2 - Directions to the Metro was vague, but there were signs on the way 3 - Requesting best way to get to airport via Metro was met with much confusion The Metro works well, but it takes about 3 transfers to get to the airport from this hotel. Additionally, the route to the underground was through a deteriorating neighborhood - lots of trash and grafitti. We decided that with luggage, it would be better to take a cab. The hotel arranged the cab and like a previous reviewer noted - about 30 Euros and 30 minutes to the airport. The rooms were futuristic. We really loved the double curtains that completely darkened the room. When we rolled them up in the morning, we were surprised how bright it was outside. They were very effective. The toilet has a door, but the shower is visible from the bed - just a skimpy curtain and glass. Not an issue for a couple, but a family with kids might have concerns. The breakfast was outstanding - well prepared, plentiful, and varied. Definitely not your typical continental breakfast.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great hotel, with friendly staff and in a good location. The hotel itself is very nice and modern with great views from the rooftop of the mountains, Torre agbar and sagrada de familia. We had a room on the 8th floor and this was really comfortable, although there wasn't any complimentary water or fruits offered as you might get in some hotels, the bathroom was nice and clean, had the usual toiletries offered in a 4* hotel. The room was cleared and replenished with new towels and mini bar items everyday. We didn't actually eat at the hotel, but at the food court in the shopping centre called Glories, this is just across the road. There is also a supermarket here if you need to get some water or any basics. For travel we bought a 10 trip card for 9 euros, this can be used on the metro, tram and buses, all these transport links are 5 mins walk from the hotel and are really easy to use, you can also get to and from the airport using this metro card on train. The hotel is only 4 stops away from plaza catalunya where you can walk down las ramblas, or you can get the tram down to the beach which takes 5 to 10 mins and the hotel is also 5 to 10 mins away from sagrada de familia by metro. I thought that the location of the hotel was really good because it’s just outside the touristy areas but still easily accessible and the staff here are very friendly, would definitely come back.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 4 nights. We have been to Barcelona twice before so know the city quite well. We wanted to stay somewhere that had links to both the city centre and coast and this hotel was perfect. Situated next to a tram line to the coast and Glories metro station which runs into the city. The hotel was modern and clean. We paid for an upgraded room and had a sofa and seating area which would make the room more comfortable for an extended stay. It has a reasonably priced bar and mini bar facility in the room but a way too expensive buffet breakfast at 18 euros per person. However you can get a coffee and croissant for 3 euros in the cafe bar in the hotel (or use the local supermarket and eat in your room). The hotel has a swimming pool on the roof and terrace with good views over the city-The hotel is located right next door to the Torre Agbar (the head office of a water company) which resembles the Gherkin in London and lights up at night. You also have good views of Mountjuic in the distance and Sagrada Familia approx 20 mins away on foot. The area is being redevoloped so the hotel is surrounded by building sites but to be honest we didnt really notice any noise. There are few restaurants in the local vacinity which is probably explained by the shopping area over the road as it has a food court where you can eat, mexican, chinese, italian, american etc. I wouldnt recommend eating in these as you could be anywhere but if you dont want to go back into the city, these are convienient options.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for a week in this hotel in March 2007, and used it as a base to explore the city. The architecture and style of the hotel appealed to us, and the price was reasonable. Although it is not in the city centre, it is within walking distance of attractions such as the Sagrada Familia. Alternatively, there are metro and tram stops by the hotel, giving quick and cheap access to the whole city. The hotel restaurant is not cheap, so we ate many of our meals at the various cafes and restaurants in the shopping complex across the road from the hotel, popular with many of the locals. As a gay couple we were concerned about how we would be treated. However the staff reacted very normally when we booked in at reception, apart from checking whether we did want to share the same room. The room was good, with everything that we would need during our stay, including a little safe and a TV. The housekeeping was great, and it was a real pleasure to return to a fresh clean room each day. The hotel was not noisy, but I did get woken up in the middle of the night a couple of times by someone in a neighbouring room opening or closing their electric window blind in the middle of the night! Other reviews mention the shower cubicle - if you are sharing the room with anyone you do have to know them well! The toilet was more discreet in a seperate room. The view of the city from the rooftop is fantastic. You would also get to see the neighbouring Torre Agbar, which sometimes gets lit up at night. Overall it was a great hotel, and I would recommend it to other people.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 4 nights at the Silken prior to our 5 night Royal Carribean cruise from Barcelona. The location was away from the major attraction, but the subway (Gracia) was around the corner and was extremely convenient to get around. From the airport we took a bus to Catalunya (8 euro for 2) and then a cab to the hotel which cost 10 euro. There's a strip mall across from the hotel, where they have clothing stores like Zara, H&M, and other Spanish brands and the french hypermarket called Carrefour. Euro was 1.60 to a 1 when we visted, so we shopped for basic food to save some $$ on breakfast. Their wine selection was quite large and inexpensive, with differnt selection of cava. We stocked up for our cruise there :). It's a great place to get gifts like Spanish Olive oil for family as well. The room at the Silken was very modern. I read the previous reviews and packed an extra soap/shampoo for myself, as they did kind of smell like male perfume. The bed was on the harder side but it wasn't too bad. I loved the rainfall shower, although you do need to be careful not to splash outside the tub. Overall with the money we paid it was a good stay. We booked directly through the hotel website and got a promotional rate $130 or so. Barcelona is a beautiful city so you're never in your room much! **Btw, one restaurant recommendation - "Cal Pep" in Ciutat Vella. This is a must!! They serve truly amazing tapas. The place is tiny and there will usually be a line outside, but once you're in, just order what you see others are having. There isn't a formal menu, you just sort of have to order by describing the dish. It's a culinary experience you will never forget.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you do not want to have a feeling that you have overpaid for the hotel and have not got the expected value for the money you've paid - I really recommend you to stay at "Silken Diagonal". The liocation is good - 3 min walking distance from metro station Glories +3 or 4 stops to the very center of Barcelona.15-20 min walk (or 3 stops by metro) to Sagrada Familia. Tourist bus stop is just opposite the hotel dore across the road. We were using this bus during 2 days. This is the "City tour", absolutely the same logic as in London, by double deckers. Tickets and earphones are available on board. Excursions are provided in the majority of languages. In the bus you will get a small book with a lot of supplementary discounts for the sightseengs and restaurants/bars in Barcelona. Shopping Center Glories is situated in front of the hotel, also across the road. Honestly, I did not find "Glories" very interesting from shopping perspective :) but there are a lot of small restaurants and bars to stay in the evening if do not want to move away from the hotel. Our room was reasonably big and always clean. The beds were comfortable. Soundproofing is good. Interesting design of the hotel from inside. Just for the traveller information as this is not a unique set provided in the hotel of this level. Provided: shower gel, shampoo, soap, shaving set and AS lotion, shower cap, toothbrush/paste, comb, sponges. Not provided: slippers (indoor shoe). If I try to see where I can find the weaknesses - this is probably that reception is always busy - a lot of people. But I do not think this is the significant point. I definitely recommend this hotel for the tourists with and without children.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have just returned from Barcelona after having spent 4nights at this hotel. I have been to Barcelonma before and stayed in hotel Jazz at top of La Ramlas and would say this is of equal standard but in a different location. The pros of the hotel were the hotel was very modern and had comfy beds and electric blind with a black out blind too. The pool area was nice and there were plenty of tables to sit at and have a drink in the bar area. Its across the road from a shopping centre which alos has a supermarket and a great footcourt with lots of outdoor restaraunts to eat at in the evening. You can walk to the beach in 15mins and there is only a 5min walk to all the lovely tapas bars and coffee shops which are m uch more reasonably priced with more atmosphere than being down la ramblas . Its a 5min walk to the metro and 4stops into town. The cons would be there is only 7 sunbeds at the pool so you have to be lucky to get a seat,but as nobody lies out all day you will get one at some point,also you can walk to the beach anyway. The hotel did not do any snacks up at the pool but then supermarket is across road anyway so can get your own. If you wanted to go to a pub or a restaraunt and eat drink and be merry you could till 2pm ish but if you wanted clubs or loud bars you would have to go to the centre. I have done both and stayed in both areas and I would say I prefered this as there was more local restaraunts which were cheaper and nicer,you could walk to the beach,shopping centre across the road,not so busy and for people watching at bars and cafes it was so nice watching all age ranges from the very young to the very old out enjoying a drink or an icecream and walking there tiny dogs,it felt like you really were on holiday !!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel for my sisters 30th Birthday based on the reviews and pictures on TripAdvisor and I was not disappointed. As first timers in Barcelona we took a taxi to the hotel from the airport (Just under 40 Euro) - we got a three day metro pass from the Tourist Information Centre in Arrivals (had to queue for a bit though) We stepped into the entrance of the Silken Diagonal and my sister was already won over. The check -in was painless and the staff more than lovely. We loved the lifts and thought pressing the number from outside was different. We had room 826, a superior room and it was everything that I had hoped for, my sister loved it and described it as stunning! Bed and pillows really comfy As for the bathroom - yes it is a little see through and I did nearly drown myself having put the shower head the wrong way but hey we were on Holiday. The best things in the bathroom are a proper hairdrier and a magnifying mirror along with a nice selection of bathroom items. We did not eat in the hotel - but it was nice to know from previous posts that there is a shopping centre over the road which we used for Starbucks. Previous posts have commented on the surrounding building work - this did not bother us or spoil anything in the slightest. Other posts say this hotel is out of the way - rubbish!! 4 stops on the metro which is about 100 yards away and you are in the centre of Barcelona. We used the metro to go everywhere - it is fast clean and very efficient - puts things in the UK to shame actually!. We also used the tram (included on the metro card) to get to Port Vell which was great as we saw some of the outlying city - again very efficient I would say that the Silken Diagonal is in a fab location, is a cool hotel and is priced very reasonably, I have nothing but praise for it and I would definitely return again when I come back to Barcelona!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from a five day stay at the Silken which was superb. Admittedly the hotel was more of a crash pad for us after a long day sightseeing, but in that regard it met all our needs. Location - yes, it is a little far out but we both love walking and exploring less touristy parts of a city, so it meant that we had a good twenty minutes walk at the start and end of each day in the more residential parts of Barcelona. (Cab to/from the airport is around 30 euros) Opposite the hotel is the Gracias mall which had a good range of Spanish high street stores - for example, Zara was bigger that the branches downtown and distinctly less crowded. We could therefore do lots of our shopping and only have a thirty second walk back to the room with our bags. Carrefour, the hypermarket, is also in the mall and was great for stocking up on water and fruit etc. Opening hours for the mall are 10pm-10pm. I wouldn't recommend the eateries around there as hygiene doesn't seem to feature highly on the list of priorities The rooms in the hotel were extremely comfortable, clean and functional. The best part were the blackout blinds which enabled us to sleep like babies. We found the hotel to be really quiet and we only encountered fellow guests briefly in the lobby. My only real quibble with the hotel is the pool - it's more like a small tub. The roof terrace is fab for sunbathing with an exceptional view over the city but the pool was far too small for swimming in. Sadly the hotel roof bar is only open on weekends which we weren't told about - a shame as its a great place to relax late at night. What else would I recommend for travellers - for food, go downtown. I have some superb restaurant recommendations - Taller del Tapas, Agua and 7 Portes are excellent. Also do rent a scooter on the waterfront. It cost us only 25 euros for the day and it was a superb way to see the city (really safe to zip around too).</p></li>
