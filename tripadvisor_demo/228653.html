A word of warning, do not use the taxis at the airport, they will cheat you and will try to charge up 80 euros if they think they can get away with it. Get the airport shuttle to Plac de Catalunya and a taxi from there to your hotel - costs about 6 euros....you do the maths! :-)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very good location and friendly staff. But the waitress at the breakfast is chasing you out if you come at the end of the service. The pool is not heated and very small and there are only a few chairs on the terrace... the bar on the terrace is not open all the time...

The pool area is great for relaxing after you've done the sights or for a pre dinner drink before you head off to the many nice bars and restaurants in the area. You'd be hard pressed to find a hotel of this standard for the same reasonable price - we'll definitely stay there again next time we visit Barcelona.</p></li>

It is a bit expensive for such a hotel. 172 euro per night for a superior room of 1 person... There is wireless internet coverage in the hotel. You have to pay for that, but don't do that. Just go near the window in your room and try to get on one of the non-secured networks. There are several! ;-)</p></li>

It is about 10 blocks removed from the mayhem but easy enough to get there if you want by metro or taxi (cheap taxis!). The only complaint was that it was a bit loud, but it didn't keep us up. We got the Barcelona card as our travel books recommended but didn't find the value in it. I would recommend just taking the metro and taxis.</p></li>

Also the rooftop swimmingpool was releaxed, but we didn't swim. Because it was a little bit to cold in Barcelna at the moment... I would suggest this Hotel to everybody.

The hotel offers some nice extra's (they have a car that can be used for a couple of hours free of charge, wireless internet was free, etc.) We particularly enjoyed the roof terrace and bar, with a nice view over Barcelona.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for four days, and had an excellent stay. Our room was not noisy or small (we had a third bed), it was clean, and the service was very friendly. Our only criticism was the cost of the breakfast (15 Euros, too much when we only wanted a continental breakfast) - we used the cafe Ramplax across the road, excellent value there. We would also recommend the Catalana restaurant (1 block South, two blocks East), really good tapas etc., good atmosphere, and not too expensive. It wasn't warm enough to use the pool, but it was nice to sit out on the roof with a drink.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a short break in Barcelona and wanted a good hotel away from the Ramblas. The Hotel America is an ideal location in that respect. It is not too far from the subway and is within walking distance (well for me, it's about 2km) of the Sagrada Familia . There are a number of Gaudi buildings and the top end of the Ramblas within 500-600m. The Parc Guell is about 3km. The room was a good size with furnishings that are quite chic. The hotel has a small roof top pool and a small gym and sauna. There is a good Tapas bar just around the corner that is a fraction of the price of those on the Ramblas.</p></li>

Xabbi on the check in desk made us laugh every day.Breakfast was great,plenty of fruit and quality creals/yoghurts to choose from plus some hot foood. We were given a very detailed map on our check in,which we used instead of the map we'd bought with us as it was better! We walked everywhere because the weather was so good,most popular attractions are within 45 minutes walk. Free Wifi in the room was another bonus. Would certainly go back again and wouldn't hesitate in recommending.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a short 5-day stay at the Hotel America, which lived up to its reputation for being modern with great service and facilities. It is in a "quieter" location though there is still some traffic noise which is slightly invasive. The rooms are clean and well maintained, and the service from the staff was excellent. Free internet access was appreciated and the reception staff even helped to book tables for us at our restaurants of choice! For a four star hotel near the centre of barcelona this is a great place to stay and is fabulous value. Try and book a higher level room to avoid the noise from the streets!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just stayed 4 nights in Hotel America at Barcelona and we truly enjoyed this fabulous hotel. Clean room, Xlarge bed, good working airconditioning, fancy breakfast buffet with fresh products and friendly personal. We certainly recommand the pool/lounge area at the roof of the hotel where you can enjoy a tasty coctail, cool cava, wine or beer. You don't need to bring your own towel or towel from the room as they give you a large one there. This is very handy. Nice to chill in the pool after having walked in the city centre for hours. We will certainly take this hotel again if we visit Barcelona again. This hotel gets a 10 plus from us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon in September 2011. We should have listened to the reviews we saw on trip advisor. The hotel is like staying at a construction site. The city is doing major construction right outside the hotel and ALL day everyday, all your hear is construction. The crane outside the hotel seemed to never stopped working. If you want to take a siesta at 5 or 6pm, don't even attempt it. The construction work went until it got dark outside, which was until 8pm! The hotel rooms are very nice and clean, and the hotel has a nice roof top bar. BUT, it's impossible to enjoy any of this when all you hear is construction noise.</p></li>

Service was excellent the bar staff lovely and reception staff also (Christian) happy to help with anything. We got a good deal on hotelsclick.com so our room was very good value for money, although it was two single beds pushed together. There is alot of construction work outside but didnt bother us and we got a good sleep every night. The terrace & pool on the roof was beautifull, a relaxing place to sit in the sun with nice cocktails. Definitely will return on our next visit to Barcelona!</p></li>

The Hotel America is very friendly, very clean and the breakfasts are superb. It is a pleasant 10/15 minute walk from the hotel to Las Ramblas. It is situated in a very nice and quiet area where there are lots of nice shops. The restaurants round about are many and varied so you will never be stuck for somewhere to eat. The rooftop swimming pool and sun terrace are lovely but unfortunately we didn't get a chance to use them because it rained for our entire stay!! Instead we got to use the bar area!!. However this gives us a good excuse to return and it will certainly be to the Hotel America!</p></li>

Rooms nice a bit small but very clean nice bathroom . We loved the roof top terrace amazing views too . Weather was superb making our stay even better . This time we walked everywhere didn't bother with metro , it's around 20 minutes down to La Rambla. Tended to eat local in the evening some nice places around if you look . Small bar next door to hotel ( to the left ) is nice Semi and his wife are very welcoming. We will return had a better time this time round did all the sights last time so just chilled and shopped and enjoyed the fantastic weather .Thank you Hotel America..</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was clean and modern, breakfast was very good, fresh juices, hot and cold breakfast. We first got room 201, just make sure you don't get this room! It was incredibely noisy, because it is just in front of the two big roads and has large non-isolated windows. We asked for another room after a night of non-sleeping and we got room 209 which was very calm and not noisy at all. It's true that the rooms are a bit noisy, but hey, you're in a hotel in the middle of a big city... If you can, ask a a room at the back of the hotel, no noise from the outside and less neighbouring rooms... Rooms are not very big, but again... it's a hotel in a big city. Service was ok, we got free bottles of water the day we left.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful hotel with extremely clean and well-appointed rooms (bath salts for the jacuzzi tub, candles & matches, robes, slippers, nice toiletries). Front desk staff were all friendly and helpful. Breakfast is nice, but also easy to walk next door for coffee and pastry. Only problem was that the entire square in front of the hotel is in the midst of a huge excavation project for the underground, and workmen and equipment started at 8am. Not sure how long it's scheduled to continue - if you wake up early or aren't a light sleeper, probably not an issue other than the view. Plus side is no traffic noise! Within several blocks of a couple metro stops, with lots of good restaurant choices within easy walking distance.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Yes the construction was annoying but there is construction everywhere! The staff when out of their way to find us converters for our electric items which we forgot. We stayed for 4 days while waiting to board a Disney European Cruise. We had a fantastic time in the city in general although BEWARE of the gypsies. They will try to get money from you any way they can especially around La Sagrada Familia. We used the bus tour which was several hours long and extremely informative. Ok back to the hotel. The deck/outdoor terrace area we just didn't use as it was tiny. Unusable for a family of 6 pretty active/rambunctious people. Bar was beautiful and lobby is very small. Again, the staff is probably the best asset of this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just back from the Hotel America, Barcelona. Took a little time to actually find the hotel but when we did we were met with a friendly and efficient check in. Had a great room on the 6th floor- all our requirements were met - we had requested direct with the hotel that we had a room on the top floor, non smoking, away from the elevator and a bath and shower - oh and a king size bed. Slight road noise at night but that is the only negative. Fabulous breakfast spread - including chocolate - a first I must say - and delicious too. The breakfast room is lovely and bright and again great serving staff. Also found a fantastic restaurant around the corner - called Lagrantasca I think. Ate there 3 times in 4 days - greedy or what. Staff again were great and food and ambience very nice.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 3 nights mid october. Had a room on the 1st floor which made it easy to get to and from. Check-in was quick and simple and the staff were very friendly. The room was very clean and nicely decorated, what you would expect from a decent hotel. The hotel was situated around a 10 minute walk from Diagonal metro station from where you can access the excellent metro network. The construction work looked a little daunting on arrival but as per other reviews was not really an inconvenience as the road was silent at night and no work took place at the weekend. It would only disturb you if you were going to be in the room for any length of time and even then was not that loud even from our room on the 1st floor. Overall a nice hotel at a reasonable price for a city centre hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in Hotel America from May 30th to June 2nd, 2006 and I have to say I was somewhat disspointed. I made my reservation here based on the reviews on this website. I have to say that in the past the reviews were dead on, bu this time, I think that the reviews on this hotel are somewhat overrated. We arrived to find the room with an extremely musty smell. We had to open the windows in order to air out the room. The sheets and the towels had a strange smell. The Breakfast, good, but EXPENSIVE - try El Apeadero which is a block away on Proivenca. The gym that they advertise on their website, awfyul. The treadmill did not work, and the one weight machine was complicated to figure out. I do not think I will stay here again, considering there are much better 4 star hotels all over the Eixample.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here in May 2010 with a couple of friends for our first trip to Barcelona. The location ideal for walking to the Cathedral and Sagrada Familia,shops, and the tour bus. The hotel staff were wonderful especially as we needed help getting a cab to Montserrat outside the city and our Spanish is meager at best. They were patient with us, it seemed we needed much help for other things as well, so appreciated that. The roof top pool and lounge area with bar was our favorite place to meet for a drink and the views of the city at the end of the day. Stunning area in all respects. The rooms were spacious and clean, but if you leave a window open at night be prepared for noise as it is a bustling area all hours with people coming home from clubs from 3 AM to 6 AM....this is Spain and the Spanish love to party.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I read some of the reviews with heart pounding horror - we'd already booked Hotel America. However, it's a very nice hotel, understanding staff, good breakfast and the rooms are what you'd expect - they even gave us bath robes which was a bonus (I'm easily pleased!). The 'bar' is on the small side - OK, it's minute. And hardly comfortable, so the hotel should be considered a room for the night not a place to get socialising. It's one stop away from the Rambles and one night we had to get a cab back as the metro was closed. For this reason only I'd have picked another hotel more in the 'heart' of the city. But if you don't want to pay over the odds, want somewhere comfortable this is the place for you. Oh, we booked via TravelRepublic - that's a great site with the best deals I've found. And, believe me, I look!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We visited this hotel for a weekend in March. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were clean and nicely decorated. We had no problems with noise and the beds were comfy. The location was decent as it's only a step away from the metro which gets you everywhere quickly! We didn't have any food in the hotel, we thought it was overpriced. Coffee was good though and the rooftop is fab even in March. La Pedrera is a few minutes walk away as is all the higher end shopping eg Gucci. We were very pleased with our choice of hotel all things considered and £70 per room seemed a bargain. NB Take you own hairdryer, the bathroom ones are next to useless - reception will lend you a travel plug if you are silly enough to bring an American one as I did! Barcelona was a great city with loads to do and very friendly people!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I stayed here for 4 nights. We had rooms (double and twin). Rooms were fine: clean, well serviced, nice bathroom. Not massive but certainly not small. Location was good - about 20 mins walk to Placa De Catalunya but there is a metro station approx 100m from the hotel. The breakfast was a good selection of cereals, ham, cheese, eggs, fruit, yohgurt etc. There was even some scrambled egges, bacon and mini sausage. On the roof there is a small swimming pool and terrace which is great after a day sightseeing. The staff were really helpful and knowledgeable. Nothing was too much trouble. Check out is 12pm but as our flight wasn't until 10pm they told us that we could leave the bags, use the pool and have a shower in the gym. Overall a nice hotel for a short trip and I would be quite happy to stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were really delighted with the hotel - it is in a great location , close to the Rambla and Passeig de Gracia with lots of bars and restaurants close by. It was spotlessly clean , the staff very friendly, breakfast excellent. The roof terrace and pool were lovely. Our only concern was that our room was very warm but the airconditioning was switched off because it was on a winter setting so could only be heated. However it was good to be able to open the window and although there was traffic noise it didn't bother us ( we live in the country where there is no noise usually!) We were a bit apprehensive that other people had mentioned that the hotel was noisy and they could hear other guests but we did not find it to be a problem any more than any other hotel. We would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to our friends</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We can only praise the hotel and agree it is a wonderful place to stay. Four of us went last weekend and had a great time. The hotel is immaculate, staff very friendly and they even upgraded my parents to a superior room as it was my dad's 60 birthday present. The rooms are fantastic and my husband and I stayed in a standard room which was also very spacious with a great bathroom. The superior room had a jacuzzi bath and DVD and CD player extra and a much bigger bed. The breakfast was wonderful with so much choice and Barcelona is a great city. We all had fantastic tapas in the Taverna Mediteranian located next door to the America Hotel and the food and drink was very reasonable and also fantastic service. The roof top area of the hotel is wonderful and views good over the city and a great place to relax after a busy day sightseeing.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel for a weekend with two of my friends. I liked the location as it is in close proximity to the Ramblas and two blocks away from Casa Mila. It is also around the corner of the Palacio Flamenco where we booked dinner and the show. The rooms were spotless with a full bar, three robes and enough towels. Beds were comfortable and sheets clean and fine and when window's closed, no noise coming from outside. Internet access and bar available anytime and breakfast was great! Staff weren't overly friendly but they were helpful when needed. I didn't find Catalonians being too friendly in general. They are quite reserved. The terrace has a pool and lounge chairs/sofas that is great for relaxing! Overall rating for this hotel with great value, I give it between 4 and 5 stars! I would stay there again and recommend it to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is just great! It's a modern hotel with big modern rooms with flatscreen. The hotel is located in the best area of Barcelona: bario eixample, not far from the trendy passeig de gracia. It's also near very good restaurants and bars. When I go on holliday I always want to stay in a safe area and I can promise you that eixample is the safest area of Barcelona. The hotel has a beautiful loungie roof terrace with a swimmingpool and a jacuzzi and there is a bar where the friendly staff makes the best cocktails! The staff at the reception is also very friendly and want to help you with everything... I go a lot to Barcelona and I have been in a lot of hotels but from now on I will only book in Hotel America!! It's modern, friendly staff, swimmingpool, located in best area and the price is also democratic. And the roofterrace is just great!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In my opinion this is quite an overrated hotel. I stayed here between Christmas and New Year's Eve 2005, had booked a single room (100 Euros) and was treated to a windowless, tiny room. Decor is modern indeed, but not of the best taste. A gym is available, but it merely consists of a small weights machine, a bicycle and a "running" machine. Service is pretty indifferent. The hotel lobby is extremely small and really unsuitable to wind down after a day spent strolling through the magnificent city that is Barcelona. In all, this was probably a 2 or 3 star that was refurbished in a "modern" fashion to look more costly, but deep down can't really hide its roots. I had booked 3 nights, only stayed the 1st and went to the NH Calderón for the other 2. My God, what a difference ! For about the same price it was a huge difference in comfort and quality.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Hotel America Barcelona for 3 nights from the 16th December 2005. The hotel is clean, friendly and well situated yet far enough away from the lively La Ramblas to get a good nights sleep. The breakfast is great and at Euro 14 if not included in your rate is good value for what is available on the buffet. Ask for a high room at the back of the hotel, because although the view is not great it keeps you away from the road. The staff at the hotel are great and speak good english which if you do not speak spanish makes things so much easier. Took a taxi both ways from the airport cost Euro 25 each way, but make sure you put your seat belt on because no driver in Barcelona takes any prisoners. Barcelona is a great place to visit with lots to do and I would recommend the bus tours which have 3 routes ( 2 in winter) which covers all the main attractions with ease. This hotel is a good base for a visit to a interesting city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visited Barcelona mid December and found the hotel was again to a good standard. The rooms are adequately sized, very clean, and my request prior to arriving for a room on a higher level was duly noted and a top floor room allocated. My only concern before arriving was the comments concerning road works in progress near to the hotel. These were in fact finished off on our last day staying there! I found the hotel to be relatively close to the main shopping streets in Barcelona, be it a 10/15 minute walk, though further away from past accommodation I've used in the city. However this hotel provides travellers with pleasant and helpful reception staff, good bar staff, useful welcome pack including maps and city guides, clean rooms, good and varied breakfast and most importantly in close proximity to the main city centre attractions. Overall another fantastic experience and would head back for my next visit to this beautiful city.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Not a very nice hotel, expensive and dirty, at least one star to many.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was the last stop on our 18 day trip across Europe. We stayed at 3-5 star hotels in 6 different cities and this hotel compared with our cheapest 3 star hotel. The hotel was the second most expensive only beat by the 5 star hotel and by the time we add in parking and internet I'm not sure it wasn't as much. The room was very noisy, I could hear the people in other rooms, lots of noise from outside and the room wasn't very clean. My friends took a tissue and rubbed it on the bathroom floor and it was filthy. Maintenance on the hotel is lacking in all areas. The walls in one room were all scrapped up with exposed sheet rock. The air conditioner sounds like a lawn mower everytime it starts up. The door man was very friendly but the front desk staff was not. The beds were not good quality and the internet was painfully slow. If you are going to charge for something it should at least work well. I would not recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In our opinion the location of the Hotel was idea as it is situated in a nice quiet area that provided many eating and drinking options close by and was within easy walking distance to the tourist oriented areas like Las Ramblas and the upmarket shopping streets of Gracia and Catalunya. The Hotel is a smart, chic establishment with clean modern design lines. The rooms are comfortable, clean and provide all the facilities that you need. The restaurant serves breakfast only, but they do it very well with a great variety of food from cereal to smoked salmon. The pool and spa on the roof looked good but the weather was a bit cool to go in. In the bar a free internet terminal is provided for guest use. One of the best things that we liked was that we arrived at Hotel at 5.30am after an early flight from Cairo and we were able to get an early early check in to our room without any hassle. We have no hesitation in recommending Hotel America.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in Hotel America for a week with my Partner and we absolutely loved it - probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in! The rooms were comfortable and very clean and the hotel was modern and clean throughout. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and nothing was too much bother at all. The roof top terrace was excellent a great place to relax after a days sightseeing! The breakfasts were excellent as well there was so much to choose from and everything was fresh and plentiful. The hotel also sell some gifts in the reception area which we found were a very reasonable price compared to the gift shops we went to. There are lots of nice places nearby to eat but I would definitely recommend a place called The Attic on Las Ramblas and also the Fairy Forest themed pub next to the wax museum. We booked our stay through Octopus Travel and got a very good rate which included breakfast. Already saving up for our trip back to Hotel America!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have just returned from my fourth visit to Hotel America in Barcelona, I would recommend this hotel for a relaxing short break. I stayed in the superior room on the third floor, the package included a bottle of cava and flowers in the room. I stayed on a B&B basis, the breakfast was very good although I did not have the cooked choice everything else was lovely. I did read about roadworks on tripadvisor but all was finished in Jan'12 The staff on reception were very helpful and especially Xabi. The hotel has a small bar near the reception desk where you can get a coffee or drink at most times of the day and into the evenings. My only downside of the hotel albiet a minor one was that the only british TV chanel was BBC world news, this just repeats the same thing over and over again. Another plus while I was there was the sun shone the whole time and although it was winter it was pleasant all the same. I will be back to the Hotel America very soon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Last year i wanted to give my boyfriend a weekend barcelona. I booked by our travelagent in Holland. Because i had a question about our luggage ( we checked in very early) i sent them an email. There was absolutely no problem. I told them it was my boyfriends birthday present, and they promised me we would have a weekend to never forget. I also upgrade our room to a superior. When we came in, our room was allready been cleaned, so we could check in right away! They said "happy birthday" to my boyfriend and in the evening we were suprised by staff with a bottle champagne and a birthdaycard!!! We were there for 3 days, everything was clean, and nothing was to much for them! The top of the hotel was absolutely BEAUTIFULL!!!! It was a lounge area with a nice pool and very nice jacuzzi. The last day we had to be at the airport late in the evening, so they had a service for our luggage for the last day. Next time in Barcelona we will be in hotel America!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">stayed at the hotel in august, we were 3 adults sharing a room and although it was cramped, the 'camp bed' was comfortable and the room was clean and all we could wish for. it was handy to have a fridge in the room and we bought water from teh little supermarket round the corner of hte hotel and kept it nicely chilled. Although the hotel is only a couple of blocks from the metro station and the trains are very frequent, i felt it was a little bit out of the way and i would rather stay somewhere more central next time i go to bareclona. there was free wifi in the hotel which was handy, and the sunloungers on the roof were great for catching a few rays - although there werent many and it is a small area. The service was great and breakfast was ample, with the usual cereals, breads and cheeses etc. although there was construction work right outside it wasnt too much of an inconvenience although we did get work up one day at about 9am... so not too bad!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel America is not a bad choice if you're planning a trip to Barcelona. The staff was nice, especially the overnight receptionist. The pool are is nice also, though the hot tub is not very "hot" at all. We were there in September and the water was way too cold. The location is pretty good. You can't really walk to Las Ramblas, but the subway is easy to figure out. We got a rate of 100 euros per night on Expedia, and you definitely can't beat that! DVD players are available to rent for 10 euro a night. That was great b/c I found myself dying to hear some english and the only english channel is CNN. I definitely liked this hotel much better than our second hotel. We THOUGHT we wanted to be closer to Las Ramblas, so we switched to the H10 Catalunya for our last 3 nights there. BIG MISTAKE! The closer you get to the "tourist area", the hotels get more expensive, hotel rooms get smaller, and restaurants get more expensive. I'd definitely recommend Hotel America!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The service at this hotel is great - on par with luxury hotels we've stayed at (Peninsula, Four Seasons). Friendly, and considerate to a level exceeding expectation (e.g., I left a book on the night-table with a tissue marking the page and housekeeping left me a bookmark). The location was excellent - 2 blocks from P. de Catalunya - very convenient, but away enough that it was quiet and felt more relaxed (on St. George Day it was so crowded on P. de Catalunya that it would, literally, be difficult to exit your hotel onto the street if you were staying there). Considering people are out all hours in Barcelona, this is important if you want to sleep well. The rooms are fairly large compared to other European hotels we've stayed at. The rooms do need refreshing - the decor is dated, and in some cases the furniture is showing signs of wear. We booked based on online photos and were disappointed on seeing our room. Best thing: The service. Worst thing: Dated rooms.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at hotel america for five nights with my husband after it was recommended by a friend. After looking at the reviews decided to stay as the majority are very good. This hotel is very clean staff are helpful if asked for assistance. The terrace is lovely specially when you return in the evening and want to enjoy some evening sun. However, drinks are expensive as a bottle of local beer in the terrace bar costs four euro but can be bought in the supermarket around the corner for fifty cent! Rooms are a decent size but walls are paper thin. Hard to sleep if your neighbours are having a few drinks in their room or watching tv any way loudly at all. When quiet I even heard the people next dooe use and flush the toilet! Location is fairly good but iftou want to be close to the action on las ramblas it is a good trek so if you don't like walking 20-25 minutes in the heat then this hotel is not for you! Would definatley stay in Barcelona again but would pick a hotel more central!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had to go to Barcelona for business and had a tight budget due to the Euro being so high. I booked this hotel based on the reviews and was not disappointed. The service was good, the hotel rooms were spotless and everything seem fairly new. The downside was that I had a room near the elevator and I heard everything inside the hotel. The way the interior was set up; noise just bounces off the walls. The location wasn't too bad. It was not too far from the main areas such as Passage de Gracias; it was only a 5 - 10 minute walk; and probably about a 20 minute walk to the Ramblas. One night I was extremely tired and decided to just ask the hotel for a dinner recommendation (I usually never do this) and I regretted it. The front desk recommended Trobadero and the food just was not that good. I also don't recommend eating at the little Meditteranean bar next to the hotel. It's much better to go to the Boqueria during the day for lunch and go to Barceloneta for dinner. If would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This welcoming and comfortable hotel is perfectly situated for exploring Barcelona and is in one of the more upmarket and sought after addresses in the city. The staff were helpful and charming and made our five-day stay an absolute pleasure. Our third floor room was comfortable and quiet - our only complaint that the air conditioning was not turned on in the hotel because it was the beginning of April. However the staff kindly provided us with an electric fan which went some way to making the nights less stuffy. The buffet breakfast had a wide variety of food and was always a pleasurable way to start off our day. Sadly the unexpected rain during our stay didn't allow us to use the rooftop pool and terrace but had there been a little more sunshine, it would have been the perfect place to relax after a day exploring the city. I travelled with my husband and 14-year-old son and we were all extremely impressed with the hotel and would highly recommend it if you are considering a short break in Barcelona.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As others have pointed out, the Hotel America is situated in a charming neighbourhood, close to the uptown shopping districts and a wide selection of cafes etc. While the construction works taking place outside may not be very convenient (as taxis have to stop a short walk from the hotel), this did not really disturb me. In fact, the hotel as such is quite nice. I stayed in a superium room which was spacious, tastefully decorated and well equipped. (Sure, the view from the large windows would have been better without the construction site, but at least there were no works going on during the weekend when I stayed there.) Service was quite friendly. The only essential negative aspect I can think of is that it was kind of pricey - after a late booking, I ended up paying nearly €240 for one night (superior room, single use), which however included a very simple "express breakfast" (basically toast and coffee, i.e. not the buffet). Perhaps not great value at that price, but still, no complaints about the stay as such, and I would not hesitate to come back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">a great location - a five/ ten minute walk away from the busy ramblas area-perhaps more suited to people who have been to barcalona before and are more confident about exploring on their own. Rooms and facilities are more business - like than plush- but everything you need provided . Staff very friendly and attentive-i sprained my foot on the third day and could not walk -without me even asking they went away and found and gave me some crutches!! No restaurant but this gives you every reason to explore excellent restaurants literally on your doorstep for evening meals - "pulpo" and "provenza" are opposite and provide great food at great prices. Breakfasts can also be found cheaply minutes away eating with spanish locals One of the main reasons I booked was the roof garden whick has a very small pool and sunbathing areas - this came in very handy when I could not move for a day - I sat on the extensive decking under sun umbrellas and had food and drinks delivered throughout the day by willing and friendly staff - I will definately being going back to this hotel again</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for 4 nights at the Hotel America week commencing 7 March. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel was clean and spotless, the rooms are constructed around a central atrium with the restaurant situated on the first floor, we were on the second floor so didn't have to bother with the lift. We also went up on the roof terrace from which you can make out the Sagrada Family along the road the hotel is adjacent to. Although sunny we didn't brave the pool. Never noticed the noise other posters have mentioned but we did stay midweek. They also provided breakfast buffet at 2 for 1 @ 14.25 Euros and there was plenty of fresh fruit, eggs bacon sausage, pastries, toast etc etc. Staff were very helpful and minibar selection was varied and not extortionate. Hotel is about a mile from Catalunya Square but it was a pleasant walk in every morning via Ramblas Da Catalunya which is a couple of blocks away. Beds were very comfortable but we walked so much everyday we were out like lights once we hit the pillow. Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay there again when we return</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Hotel America for a 3 night break with British Airways. Nothing bad to report on this hotel at all; in fact if returning to Barcelona, would be quite happy to stay here again, because of its location. The rooms are perhaps slightly smaller than one would expect and no balcony, but perfectly adequate. Room came with large LCD TV. Room was clean and kept clean, towels were good, and the shower was powerful and hot. Would benefit from having tea and coffee facilities in room. Hotel has a roof garden and small swimming pool, which would be great later in the year, but not in March (Although weather on our last day was fabulous) Breakfasts were varied and filling with a good selection, although if you want a decent cuppa take your own tea bags because the hotel ones were awful! Reception was efficient and helpful, and advised us on how to see the best of the city in the short time we were there. The street outside could be a bit noisy (certainly on our first evening) but it didn’t really bother us. The hotel was small, and very quiet. Absolutely no worries about recommending this hotel</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Chose this hotel for its central location in the Eixample district and so glad we did. A short distance from the underground made it easy to reach using the rail line direct from the airport. We could've used the underground to get around but we chose to walk everywhere stopping at various cafes or bars along the way. This hotel really is the perfect base from which to explore the city. As for the hotel itself, staff friendly and welcoming, lovely bar area near reception, gorgeous roof terrace and rooftop pool. We started many evenings with a drink on the roof terrace, the time of year however, meant the pool was a tad chilly but could be lovely during summer. The room was nicely decorated, modern and clean with a lovely bathroom, perfect. The one downside, our room was at the front of the hotel on a relatively busy road with numerous cars/trucks/noisy deliveries made in the early hours which often woke us up. Didn't help that Barcelona FC won a match while we were there as the fans took to driving the streets and honking their car horns repeatedly through the night. Otherwise an enjoyable stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our three night stay at the America was excellent. The position is great, about five minutes walk from the Ramblas and Passeig de Gracia . It's very modern, not too large and extremely clean. Our room was a good size, bed very comfortable with plenty of storage space. Good bathroom with great variety of toiletries, hairdryer and magnifying mirror and huge towels plus towelling robe. Staff are all very friendly and there was always someone around if you needed them. The breakfasts were the best surprise - huge choice of everything plus plenty of exotic fresh fruit. Lovely bread and croissants and cakes! Bar area is filled with plenty of comfortable settees with free internet access plus plenty of guide books and others to browse through. Hotel umbrellas available too! Dinner recommendations were superb - there are lots of nice restaurants in the area which are not typically touristy. Although I didn't go to the roof I was told that the pool area was good. A good price and nice place to stay if you want to be away from the noisy end of the Ramblas. Also felt quite safe walking around with a handbag.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have no idea why this hotel is so low on the Trip Advisor ratings. This is an amazing place to stay at. Walking distance to Passeig de Gracia and La Ramblas. Was in Barcelona for a day with two rambuctious pre teens, prior to taking a Med Cruise. Chose this hotel after reading TP reviews and was so glad I did. Elegant boutique hotel, incredibly clean and spacious rooms, and an outstanding rooftop pool with a bar area you can relax in. Both boys have travelled extensively and unanimously voted this the best hotel they have been in. Staff were friendliness itself and couldn't have been more helpful. They even provide courtesy big fluffy towels for the pool. Everyone speaks English, so the boys felt quite comfortable making their requests known. Location couldn't have been more ideal. We walked to the Casa Batllo and the Ramblas very easily. And there were loads of quality eateries all around us. Felt very safe in the area, as a single woman with two children in tow. I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough and would definitely urge a stay here if you like quality accomodation without the price tag.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was a really pleasant surprise. We really enjoyed our four night stay at Hotel America. It's a really good value, very modern hotel in a peaceful neighborhood. The neighborhood is walking distance to Las Ramblas but a lot more upmarket. There's plenty of cafe's and shopping nearby and it's very close to a metro stop. (Diagonal, I think) The Hotel is boutique size (7 floors) with modern furniture and wood flooring in the rooms. We shared a twin room and there was room for two suitcases, an armchair and coffee table and still plenty of space to walk around. The bathroom was large including a full-size tub. The breakfast buffet is good also - fruit, cereal, pastries, sausage,eggs etc The roof terrace is a bonus for a hotel at this price range - pool, sun lounges and day beds and they deliver room service to the terrace. We really enjoyed having somewhere to relax after walking around all day. I would definitely stay here again. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for people who won't/can't walk very far as it is 10 mins on the hoof to Las Ramblas, but if you're not fussed on the tourist tat down there then try this hotel. This is a real treat if you're on a budget.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from my daughters hen party weekend. This hotel was recommended by the travel agent, so the staff knew well in advance thet seventeen females would be staying for two nights. On arrival, we were greated by two lovely members of staff who made us all feel very welcome. They showed us a map of the area and places of interest as we all wanted to see and experience the beautiful culture of Barcelona. Our rooms were clean, modern and comfortable and the amenities fine for a short break holiday. We all decided to relax and chat by the rooftop pool and this is where we were all made to feel like we just were not welcome. Some staff spoke to us very rudely without any obvious reason. On several occasions I was told to be quiet which I found extremely unreasonable as I am 50 years old and have never in my life been made to feel so unwelcome and very embarrassed. Other visitors did comment to us on how rude they thought the staff were towards us and with no obvious reasons as to why. So, if you are thinking of making a group booking, I would advise you to seek elsewhere and this is a real shame because the hotel itself is ideal for those lovely short city breaks.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In November me and my boyfriend went on our second trip to Barcelona. Although the hotel is not so close to the center, it's only a 15 minute walk to La Rambla. The staff was very friendly and helpfull and the breakfast was very tasty and there was a lot of choice! The room was comfortable and clean. The view could have been better but then again, we didn't go to Barcelona to sit in our room and look outside. The pool and bar area was closed seeing as it was November but the view from the roof was great. we found a nice restaurant at a corner nearby were we ate almost every evening. For the same price as a 3 star hotel on La Rambla we now got much more value for money. And the daily stroll down Rambla de Catalunya had it's charm. We would definately recommend this hotel to anyone who likes clean and simple rooms, nice food and is not afraid to take a walk everyday. But isn't that the idea of a citytrip? to see as much of the sity as possible. The first time we went to Barca we tried to do everything a tourist is supposed to do and see. we spent a lot of time underground. This time we saw the other side of Barcelona and this hotel is in the perfect location for this. We had a great stay here!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for a week and it is in the best location. Only a short walk to the metro, train station and some of the best attractions. The hotel was clean and staff pleasant but found their knowledge wasn't all up to scratch. We were travelling by train to Figueres the next day and thought we knew what we were doing but wanted to check with the reception. The guy on reception nearly sent us in to town to catch the train and told us it was twice as much as we had researched before coming to Barcelona. We postponed the trip so we could go check it out first as it meant a very early morning wasted otherwise. As it turned out we were correct all along and we shouldn't of asked as it just confused us. The hotel was extremely noisy at night and our bed was really uncomfortable and everytime we moved it made a noise so we hardly slept. We never had breakfast at the hotel as they were charging 16 Euro's but only 2 doors away is a pastry shop which has the nicest croissants and on the corner is a coffee shop where a cup of coffee with milk (cafe con Leche) is only 1.35 Euro. There are loads of great Restaurants around which serve a selection of food but check the prices at the door of each first as they vary dramatically.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having decided two days before New Year's Eve 2010 we were going to go to Barcelona to celebrate, we chose Hotel America from a list of available hotels with no other guidance whatsoever... But a fantastic choice it was!!! The stand out quality of this hotel is the service from the reception staff. Extremely helpful from the moment we got there (they booked tickets for a Barcelona football game for us and also were very helpful and sympathetic when one of our party had a bag stolen). The room we stayed in was very tidy and clean, bathroom the same. My only slight criticism would be the mattress was a bit hard for my liking and made my back ache but that is a purely personal thing. Maybe an extra pillow to, but if asked for, staff attended straight away. We also had to ask for some tea making equipment, which again was seen to promptly. We did not sample the breakfast in the hotel, instead opting to eat when out. Location of the hotel is good, well within walking distance of majority of sites and has good metro links; a station being just down the road. It is situated in a (normally) quiet area; there were roadworks outside the front of the hotel, this however not their fault. In summary, definitely worth a stay and I certainly would again!!!</p></li>

<li>Having decided two days before New Year's Eve 2010 we were going to go to Barcelona to celebrate, we chose Hotel America from a list of available hotels with no other guidance whatsoever... But a fantastic choice it was!!!</br></br></li>
<li>The stand out quality of this hotel is the service from the reception staff.</br></br></li>
<li>Extremely helpful from the moment we got there (they booked tickets for a Barcelona football game for us and also were very helpful and sympathetic when one of our party had a bag stolen).</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#4363d8">room</span> we stayed in was <span style="background-color:#4363d8">very tidy and clean</span>, bathroom the same.</br></br></li>
<li>My only slight criticism would be the mattress was a bit hard for my liking and made my back ache but that is a purely personal thing.</br></br></li>
<li>Maybe an extra pillow to, but if asked for, staff attended straight away.</br></br></li>
<li>We also had to ask for some tea making equipment, which again was seen to promptly.</br></br></li>
<li>We did not sample the breakfast in the hotel, instead opting to eat when out.</br></br></li>
<li><span style="background-color:#008080">Location</span> of the hotel is <span style="background-color:#008080">good</span>, well within walking distance of majority of sites and has good metro links; a station being just down the road.</br></br></li>
<li>It is situated in a (normally) quiet area; there were roadworks outside the front of the hotel, this however not their fault.</br></br></li>
<li>In summary, definitely worth a stay and I certainly would again!!</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a 4nt stay at the Hotel America and having previously stayed off the Ramblas area I must say this was a far better experience of Barcelona. The hotel was very clean and the rooms were cleaned everyday to the same excellent standard. Initially we were on the 6th Floor just below the rooftop terrace and the room was excellent for getting to the pool and back however after a couple of days of experiencing drainage smells from the room which the hotel staff did try to rectify with chemical cleaners we were given the option of moving to the 3rd floor which we accepted. The only thing wrong with this from my own personal view was there was a lot more road noise and noise from building works that are going off just over the road from the hotel which appear to commence every morning at 7.30am. I found the breakfasts to be good and experienced none of the problems other reviewers have had, the food was plentiful and the service good. The pool area was clean everyday and there is bar service and food available at poolside if required. The reception was very helpful and always friendly and I would have no hesitation in staying here again.It was a very relaxing stay in a less touristly part of the city where you can easily get to the busier parts if required .</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “definitely not a four star hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">i'll start with the good points - hotel is in a great location, easy to walk to all the main attractions and a very short walk to a metro and train station. And there are many top-rated restaurants and bars close by. There is work going on outside the hotel, but despite staying in a room facing the construction site we weren't bothered by the noise. And that's all i can say that is positive. I think the friendly, helpful staff must all have been on holiday in the week that we were there - staff were either abrupt or ignored us completely. Our room was tiny and an odd shape, probably ok for one person but far too small for two, storage for clothes/luggage was terrible, the complimentary bathrobes and slippers were nowhere to be seen, the bathroom was damp and covered in mould, paint was peeling from the ceiling, the windows leaked when it rained, the air conditioning didn't work - and apparently this was the receptionist's favourite room in the hotel! The 'gym' consisted of three machines (a stepper, a running machine and a bike) that looked like they were made in the 80s, and any time we tried to access the pool area on the roof the door was locked!! Overall i'd say it was ok if you are staying for one or two nights max and not planning to be in the hotel much. Otherwise i'd look elsewhere.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “More an Inn than a Hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">At 106 UK Pounds per night and based on previous Tripadvisor reviews, we felt that we had chosen a quality accommodation option by booking America Hotel for our first visit to Barcelona. Sadly, the hotel came up very far short of our expectations. For a start, the location is not ideal, being situated on a side street in an area well north of the city centre. The hotel has one very small lounge room on the ground floor with a few chairs. This sole public room also contains a bar and the check in desk. On the first floor there is a small breakfast room but no restaurant. Did no previous reviewer think of pointing this out?? The bedrooms are very clean and minimally furnished. The beds are rock hard. The TV has 8 Spanish channels and about 8 other foreign channels, including CNN, which are blurred and grained with very poor reception. The bedroom windows leaked rain water unto the floor - we did get a room change but the second room had the same problem. The maid left a towel beneath the window for the duration of our stay. This is an Inn type property and not at all a full service hotel. We were left to ponder how, with such limited services, it ever managed to be classified as 4 star and how on earth it ever reached 16 th place on the Tripadvisor popularity ratings. We would not return, even at half the price.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great hotel - would definitely visit again.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Hotel Amercia for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. The best bit is the roof terrace, with pool to cool down in after a long day sight seeing. There was usually a member of staff up there to provide towels, food and drink. It was lovely to drink champagne on the terrace early evening as the lights are turned down and the candles are lit. The breakfast was superb, lots of choice to suit all tastes - egg, bacon and sausages, bread, cold meats and cheese, cereal, yoghurts fresh and dried fruit, nuts, croissants and patisseries, fruit juices.... The room we had was a corner room with double bed and air conditioning. The room was very clean and the maid/housekeeper left my nightie arranged prettily on the bed like origami every day. The location of the hotel was great, just 2 blocks away from the nearest metro, 30 minute walk to Gaudi's unfinished cathedral, and 3 blocks from the tourist bus stops. There are many bars and restaurants within minutes of the hotel, in a very nice area of barcelona, with superior shops. Be careful of pickpockets in the more touristy areas including the metro (we nearly came a cropper on the metro but managed to foil them at the last minute) - however, did not feel this kind of threat in Eixample around the hotel. All in all, a lovely stay, ideal if you want a romantic break. Would definitely return in the future.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the America for 5 days on a business trip. I booked a superior room with wifi included; unfortunately, the wifi wasn't working when I arrived. But they had it working the next day and for the rest of the stay, and offered to knock of the cost of breakfast for two days to make up for it. I thought the breakfast was very good, very typical for a Mediterranean/European hotel. (Note that breakfast isn't necessarily included in the price.) The room was nicely minimalist, the bathroom was very nice and included a bidet; overall the room was great. Other reviews have complained about noise, but didn't have any problems in that regard. The bed was the firmest bed I think I've ever slept on, but I liked it. A problem I had, which hopefully is not a chronic problem for the hotel, is that a small but noticeable amount of sewer gas was seeping in through the drains in the bathroom. The management was aware of it and was working on how to resolve it. Barcelona had been going through a pretty severe drought, and I suspect that inadequate water flow in the sewers may have accounted for it. As it was, I was able to solve it by simply opening the windows for a few minutes (I do like hotels that allow you to open the windows). Despite that problem, and the one day outage on the wifi, I'd gladly stay at the America again. It's not absolutely top drawer, but it's a good value.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 3 nights in the Hotel America in late December. The rooms are very modern and very nice. I really liked the location and the hotel. It is located about 3 blocks from the main area of interest. It is an excellent location to base a stay to explore the most interesting parts of the city. We were able to walk all over the Las Ramblas neighborhoods and the Gothic district. We even walked to the Sacred Familia Cathedral in no more than 15 minutes one morning. The breakfast is more than adequate although they do run out of things if you wait too long to go to breakfast. The negatives for us were that the street noise is pretty loud in the room. We were on the 5th floor and it was difficult to sleep. This is complicated by the fact that the air conditioning is not on while they are in heating mode and they keep the hotel halls very warm at least on our floor. This meant in order to sleep we had to open the windows to cool the room, which meant that the noise became much worse. Our methodology evolved to where we opened the windows in the evening to get the room cold and then closed them to go to bed. The other problem was that the beds didn't have a top sheet but a very nice down comforter. This means that you are either under the comforter or exposed, this is hard for me to regulate my sleeping comfort temperature. This set up though is very typical in Spain, and it is hard to fault the Hotel America for this. Just be aware.</p></li>

<li>The other problem was that the <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">beds</span> didn't have a top sheet but a <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">very nice down comforter</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>This means that you are either under the comforter or exposed, this is hard for me to regulate my sleeping comfort temperature.</br></br></li>
<li>This set up though is very typical in Spain, and it is hard to fault the Hotel America for this.</br></br></li>
<li>Just be aware.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having stayed at this hotel in September 2008 wy wife and I have just returned from a 3nt break (15/7 to 18/7) and review as follows: As we arrived at the hotel on the Thursday afternoon and we noticed that the junction immediatley outside the front of the hotel had been closed off at the commencement of what looks like a long term underground project (more of this later ! ) . We later were informed that the air conditioning in the hotel was not working correctly. This was very noticable when you returned from the 30+ temperature outside to our room. There appeared to be no or very little air con inside the public areas which included the restaurant for breakfast. The breakfast was good with good service The rooms were kept clean however our room (401) had an issue with the wooden floor that was lifting which could have caused injury if someone had tripped over it. The area is still an excellent area to stay in for easy access to the main areas and has good local restaurants etc. The following morning at 9am the silence was broken by a concrete breaker attached to a JCB breaking through the raod surface which continued for most of the Friday however thankfully they did not work on the weekend. Thses works could be ongoing for some time so beware !!! if you like a sleep in. Sadly this time for our stay, I do not think the hotel achieved its 4 star rating and was more 3 star plus. Too many problems We would recommend it if the price was right and there were no major issues</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in the America hotel 12-15th August with another couple and we loved it! We arrived at 11am to helpful and friendly reception staff and checked into our rooms with no problems. We loved the clean spacious rooms, comfortable bed, decor, lighting, free use of safe in the room and air con and the rooftop terrace with pool and jacuzzi. Whenever we wanted to relax by the pool there was always somewhere to lay down and sunbathe. The rooftop has lovely views of the mountains although the drilling in a nearby hotel did give me a bit of a headache but this isnt the hotels fault!! I just asked them to play some music and they did so without hesitating and it was good music at that!! We found the hotel's drinks and food were expensive so we had a drink in the bar next door at a fraction of the price, The hotel were so helpful and recommended a good restaurant down the road which did the most amazing tapas as we had a bad experience eating out on our first night. We checked out of our rooms at 12pm and our flight was at 10pm but we had use of the shower room in the gym and found this very useful. The hotel is in a good location being a 15-20 walk from the Ramblas and 30-40 mins from the Port and Sea. However this suited us as we like peace and quiet and found the buses and metro very useful and it saved our legs when we were tired and hot. Overall a very pleasant stay that made our trip to barcelona a memorable experience. Would definately recommend it to family and friends.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I do not know how this hotel gets such good reviews. When I arrived at Hotel America, I was shocked at the scale of construction work taking place literally outside the front door - the taxi couldn't even get near the hotel because of it! I'm surprised the hotel is allowed to open its doors to customers. Apparently they are building a major new fast-train station right outside so you can imagine the amount of work involved. I could barely hear the receptionist on check-in due to the level of noise. And there was no way you'd be able to relax by the pool. The hotel itself feels more like a hostel. It is definitely not a 4 star. I'd say 2 star at best. You can hear everything going on in the corridor and rooms around you. My room seemed to join onto the council flats next door and I was hearing all sorts of strange noises throughout the night from someone who seemed to be having toilet troubles next door. As a single female, I didn't feel particularly safe in the hotel, mainly due to the fact that my room looked onto a very large run-down estate. The room itself was very basic, dark and not the cleanest room I've ever stayed in. The staff seemed amicable enough during my one night stay - I cancelled the rest of my stay and moved to the Princess Barcelona - a business hotel which was 100% better value for money at the beach-end of Diagonal. On a plus point, the hotel is very central, but at the expense of any kind of luxuries. So if it's just location you're looking for, this hotel might suit you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in Barcelona during the Mobile world congress(MWC) in Feb 2012. At this time, all hotel rates are sky high. I booked 2 months in advance and was able to get a rate of approx Euro 230 including tax, wifi and express B/fast (basically toast/muffins/juice/tea coffee). And the cancellation policy was also good. At the time of the MWC, the hotels typically want the money upfront and do not refund. But this was good. You can pass by the hotel and miss it. They should have a bigger and brighter sign. Lobby was decent, with a sprinkling of sofas. They have a bar at one end. Check in was smooth and the people sounded friendly. The room was very good. Modern decor, comfortable bed, a nice relaxing chair, desk etc. It also had a Flat panel TV and an ipod dock. They also have a music system and DVD player, and you cna borrow dvds from the reception. The bathroom was very good. Very bright, clean. Had all the required toiletries. Had a bath tub with a JACUZZI. Yes that's right. Put in the bath salts kept there, light the candles and enjoy a nice spa, right in your room. Water was hot and pressure was good. The only thing missing was an ironing board, and they do not provide one even on request. Real let down. Housekeeping was done on time and room was made up very well. Room faces the street and had lots of sun coming in. So if you want to soak in the sun, ask for a room facing the street. Overall, an excellent stay and value for money, considering the rates at other barcelona hotels during MWC time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My two young children and I stayed here for three nights pre-cruise and one night post-cruise in June/July. I chose this hotel based on reviews from this site and was not disappointed. We arrived early (around 10:30 a.m) and were able to get in our room right away. They still had to add the third bed we'd requested, but they did that while we were out taking a walk an hour later. Staff was wonderful...charming and helpful...especially Xabi and Fran at the front desk and Meritxell in the breakfast room. We added on the breakfast buffet for three of the four days and am so glad we did. We fueled up on delicious fresh fruit, meats and cheeses, bread and pastries that kept us going on long days of sight-seeing. (They also had hot items like eggs and sausage available, I just didn't try them.) Room was very clean with a great bathroom and shower. Not a huge variety of English channels on TV, but not a problem...I enjoyed practicing my Spanish and trying to figure out the Catalan on the local news stations. We took advantage of the rooftop deck and pool a couple of the nights...once so my kids could cool off after our long day of travel; the next to watch fireworks for the Festival of Sant Joan. Hotel is located in the Eixample neighborhood which was very nice and only three blocks away from Gaudi's La Pedrera and the Bus Turistic stop. Going back to the same hotel after our cruise for an extra night was great...felt like I was walking into "Cheers" where everyone knew who we were and welcomed us as old friends. I'd definitely stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed one night at the Hotel America Barcelona Hotel after returning to Barcelona from a short med cruise. We booked via the internet after reading good reviews. On arrival we found the guy on the receptionist realy friendly and helpful he could speak reasonable english and made as feel welcome straight away. When he looked up our reservation he said that he was going to upgrade us at no extra charge, we of course was thrilled and found our room was lovely. It had a jacuzzi bath with bath salts and candles, dressing gowns and slippers and complimentry coffee and tea plus a mini bar that you could use and pay for when checking out, the bedroom was large and bright very nicely furnished and absolutely spotless. There was construction site directly outside but although it was Thursday we never heard any noise from the site. We also was thrilled to go on the roof where there was a swimming pool and lovely tables and sofas. It was so nice we had lunch there before setting out to explore Barcelona. The breakfast included was an express breafast which we were happy with but for an extra charge you could upgrade and have a full breakfast. On check out there was a lovely woman who phoned for a taxi when we needed and they also let us leave our cases in the morning as we were not due to get our coach to the airport until 1pm. We will definetly stay at this hotel again as it made our short stay excellent plus there are excellent restaurants around the corner much better than the ones near La ramblas which seemed overpriced and geared up for tourists.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Barcelona 4 night break”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After missing our flight (my fault) we arrived a day late in Barcelona. We had pre booked a taxi to our hotel but because of our later arrival we had to get a taxi at the airport. All of which are metered & worked out at 30 euros into central Barcelona (10 euro cheaper than our pre-booked taxi!) The hotel America was ideally situated for all the major attractions & tourist bus routes. There is currently on going road/underground rail work going on outside the hotel which on the plus side makes the road quiet during the evening as traffic is unable to use this route past the hotel. Engineering work starts at about 8am but really should'nt bother you at all because you will be keen to get out & about this wonderful city. The reception staff at the hotel are very helpful & will guide you through the map so that you can make the most of your stay & see all the sites. The bedrooms are of a good size & comfortable with a mini-bar & safe in them. Tv channels not so good but hey! what are you doing still in your room! The Breakfast room is nice with glass walls & good air conditioning. The staff again are attentive & helpful. Breakfast is ok & adequate but nothing spectacular. On the roof of the hotel is a small unheated swimming pool & terrace which was great mid-afternoon for a quick dip in the hot afternoon sun to recharge for more sight seeing. There is a nice lounge area on the roof with a bar where you can enjoy a lazy drink whilst looking out across the rooftops of the city. To sum up...ideally situated, great for a short break & would recommend you stay. Ps if you love football you must do the Barca Tour of the stadium (22 euros)</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at Hotel America Barcelona in Sept 2011.The location of this hotel is good, its close to a metro station & its possible to walk to Plaza Cataylona from the hotel. The breakfast is ok (nothing special) and the rooftop amenities are good. There are also several nice restaurants near the hotel & the neighbourhood is generally good & has a nice vibe. Those are the positive things about the hotel. I had several issues with the hotel in general though. Its calling itself a 4* hotel & yet 2 of the rooms on each floor have no windows or natural light at all. Do not stay in rooms 9 or 10 on any of the floors, they have no windows at all, I stayed in room 10 on my first night & it was like being in a cell of some sort - horrible. Fortunately I managed a room change the next day.There is a terrible smell in the bathrooms of those rooms in particular & in the bathrooms in general. I do not know if its the chemicals they are using to clean the bathrooms with or the fact you can't ventilate any of them but I have never encountered such a smell anywhere & it was extremely unpleasant to say the least. I switched the air-con off altogether & that seemed to improve the smell in the bedroom area of the room so while the room wasn't cool I could at least breathe in it. There is a major construction project going on just outside the hotel, the upside of that is that there is no through traffic. The down side is that work starts at 8 am & apart from seista time doesn't finish until 8pm. You can hear the noise everywhere including on the roof. Would I stay at this hotel again? No. Would I stay in that neighbourhood in a different hotel - definitely. Solo traveller Sept11</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “fab hen weekend!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we reserved 5 perfectly wonderful twin rooms for a hen weekend! The rooms were modern and clean with a mini bar(which they will empty for your own supplies), TV and hairdryer. I felt the hotel info book was a little on the lean side and the elecronic room safe kept locking itself with our money and passports inside! However, staff attended our needs very quickly and we only had to ask once for anything. On Sunday we used the roof pool area which was to die for! Especially after busy day sightseeing and a late night with the girls. Get there early to bag the few beds on offer. The giant sun-mattresses beat the sunbeds hands down on comfort and made us feel we'd really made it in the world! Dial 9 for bar/food service and sit back and enjoy. We bagged a minibus from the airport for 80eur which between 10 was a bargain. The hotel booked us 2 smaller minibuses for 130eur (for 2) for our return. Not that many bars in the hotel vicinity but there is a great one opposite the hotel with a fabulous relaxing area upstairs with a giant leather bed and trendy cubes. Beer 2eur each but the vodka was a bit pricy. Hard Rock cafe highly recommended but we had to wait ages for a table as they don't take bookings for <15. It simply meant we had plenty of time to spend and sample the cocktails in the lower bar, so no complaints there! The food portions were ace and very good value. Catch a taxi to Port Olimpique for 9-10eur and you can find some good restaurants and enjoy a proper pub crawl! The pubs were a bit too spread out for our liking along the Ramblas so go straight for the port if you want the buzz of a good night out. We took the sightseeing bus at 11am on Saturday but get there earlier if you want a top deck place.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staying for three nights, we obtained an excellent ´Romantic Package´ deal booking directly with the hotel itself. This included a superior room with hydromassage bath, a bottle of cava, flowers, and breakfast. Our room had a great view of the street outside and, though not huge, was of a good size. The bed was spacious and comfortable, there was a modern flat-screen television, coffee machine, and bathrobes and slippers. The marble bathroom was attractive with a good size bath, and the candles and bath salts were a nice extra touch. The location of the hotel is superb, in a trendy and upmarket area just off the Paseig de Gracia. The hotel staff were very friendly. Although we did not go in the hotel bar on the ground floor, it looked warm and welcoming. As it was fairly cold, we did not use the (small and shallow) swimming pool at the top of the hotel but we did do up to have a look and there was a spacious terrace with comfortable sofas and chairs, as well as a jacuzzi tub. There was also a small gym and sauna in the basement. Further there was a little ´courtesy car´ parked out front, available to use for up to four hours. Just a few down sides. Though the rooms are nice, the reception and corridors are a bit basic and lacking for a four star hotel. The buffet breakfast leaves rather a lot to be desired. The room was clean, however the housekeeping staff did not clean or replace our used coffee cups throughout the duration of our stay. However, the most annoying thing is that the walls are extremely thin so you can easily be disturbed by noise from other guests. All in all, if you can obtain a good deal for this hotel, it is well worth staying here for a city break as the location is fantastic and the hotel is friendly and comfortable overall.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great stay at Hotel America”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a 4 night stay in the Hotel America. We had a fantastic time there. We booked 2 rooms as we travelled with my mother in law. Both rooms were ample in size. In our room, they had put a roll away bed in for our 3 year old son free of charge (I did request this prior to arrival). The rooms had all the usual benefits of a 4* hotel i.e. comfy beds, mini bar, safe, free toiletries, plasma tv. Our one minor complaint was that the rooms were very warm and the fan cooler didn't work. However, we didn't complain as it wasn't unbearable and I'm sure it would have been fixed straight away if we had reported it. The service of the staff was exceptional including reception, bar staff, restaurant staff and cleaners. Nothing was too much trouble. The buffet breakfast as detailed in previous reviews was great. It was one of the best we've had. Plenty of hot and cold choices. We were even given a glass of champagne for my wife's 30th birthday. The bar was nice although quite expensive. It was lovely to unwind at the end of a busy day with a beer or glass of wine. The bar area also had a computer with free internet access which was a nice bonus. Another real attraction of the hotel was the terrace. Although the pool was too cold, the jacuzzi was warm which our 3 yr old son enjoyed. The terrace also has lovely views across the city. The location of the hotel was ideal close to Rambla Catalunya and Paseig de Gracia. It was only 3 blocks from the Diagonal metro. It was a busy area but not too busy. There is a lovely restaurant/tapas bar next door to the hotel called Restaurante Mediteraneo. We had lovely tapas there which was always busy mainly with Spanish locals. (Highly recommended) Barcelona is our favourite city and when we return, we will definitely consider staying at the Hotel America.</p></li>

<li>Plenty of <span style="background-color:#911eb4">hot and cold</span> <span style="background-color:#911eb4">choices</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>We were even given a glass of champagne for my wife's 30th birthday.</br></br></li>

<li>It was only 3 blocks from the Diagonal metro.</br></br></li>
<li>It was a <span style="background-color:#008080">busy area</span> but <span style="background-color:#008080">not too busy</span>.</br></br></li>

<li>We had lovely tapas there which was always busy mainly with Spanish locals.</br></br></li>
<li>(Highly recommended) Barcelona is our favourite city and when we return, we will definitely consider staying at the Hotel America.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel at the beginning of April for 2 nights. My friend and I thought the hotel was very, very nice and contemporary and although there were roadworks going on outside the triple glazing took care of that. Upon arrival the hotel staff were absolutely lovely and told us the best places to visit and do shopping. The downside was when it came to the ironing. We needed an iron and were told that they did not provide them but could iron our clothes for us; there was no mention of cost at this time. The next morning we asked for 3 tops each and two pairs of jeans to be ironed, we handed the clothes over, still no mention of cost! We went out for the entire day and when we returned we saw our ironing waiting for us together with a bill for 57 euros. We were absolutely horrified by this and complained to the night shift manager. Two tops that did not cover your bottom were charged as dresses (8 euros each) and my cardigan was charged as a sweater and they also tried to charge for another non existent sweater. We complained about this, but both the night shift manager , Olaska and Javier on the next morning were extremely unhelpful and rude and did not want to assist us. Olaska even left a couple waiting to speak with her to leave the hotel without having their query dealt with; she could have asked us to step aside for one moment! It just goes to show how bad their customer services skills are, they were argumentative and unprofessional. They corrected the tops to dresses and the cardigan from a sweater to a top, but the fact they did not inform us of costs and failed to have the price list in our room upon arrival as they should have for our perusal, shows their inability to have even come to a compromise, which they flatly refused! A real shame considering the actual hotel and facilities (barring the ironing) were great.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Loved Hotel America”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a week in Barcelona staying at the hotel America.Loved the hotel especially the rooftop pool and terrace. Great place to chill after being out and about with the option to order food and drink to the terrace. The hotel was clean with modern decor. More of a boutique style hotel. The staff were nice, friendly and very helpful. The room was clean and comfortable with a free room safe which was a welcome find. The hotel had a small bar next to the reception which had a computer with free internet access. There was also a small gym(which provided water) and a sauna.Breakfast was great and although there was no restaurant this did not affect us as we were happy to eat out at the many restaurants within walking distance. Found some lovely seafood restaurants down at Port Olympic( a taxi ride away) which were extremely popular. Passage De Gracia was a 5 min walk away and it was about 15 min walk to the top of Ramblas.There was a subway one block from the hotel which was great if the feet needed a rest. An added bonus was the hotel's Smart car which you could have, for free, for 4 hours. We managed to borrow it hassle free and headed to a shopping outlet. The only cons were, the room had no drawers at all,there was no iron( ironing service available at a price), the air con occasionally became noisy which if you were a light sleeper was at times very annoying (you became too hot when it was switched off) and there was a bit of noise from the other guests returning at night. There were repairs to the roof terrace being carried out for 3 days, after we left, resulting in the pool area being closed. Thankfully this did not affect us as this was our haven for the duration of the holiday. The thing I noticed about Barcelona were the constant warnings about pick pockets, when you were sitting at restaurants and going into bars. Thankfully we had no encounters. All in all I would definitely return to hotel America and would recommend it.</p></li>
