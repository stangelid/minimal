<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Maui Seaside was a good place for us. The location was the best for sure and the view of the harbor was quite nice.

Close to the airport and the mall, this is a good spot as a base for the entire area. The rate was good and the breakfast was enjoyable.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 1 night at the start of our Maui vacation, after arriving late at the airport. Our expectations weren't grand - we needed somewhere clean to shower and sleep before setting out early the next morning. The Maui Seaside was ideal for us - the welcome was friendly, the room was a little dated but clean and confortable, and we had a nice view over a small beach.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Im sure if you're here for business or work it's a place to sleep. But the hotel doesn't offer much more than that. If you're here to enjoy a vacation or relax this is NOT the place to be. The staff are a nice group of locals however the location is on the windiest part of the island, I woke up tired( unable to sleep the night before), and had to request that our room be vacuumed a couple days in. In all, if you're looking for a nice get away, a relaxing venue, this is not the spot you're looking for.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My daughter & I just returned from our vacation to Maui. We thought that the Maui Seaside Hotel was a convenient place to start our vacation. It was close to the airport and easy to get to. We planned on driving the road to Hana the next day and needed a place to stay overnight. This worked great. The staff was pleasant and the free breakfast was good. The rooms aren't huge and I wouldn't want to spend a whole week there (I wouldn't want to spend a whole week in Kahului, either) but for our needs it was perfect.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We needed a last minute hotel for one night and figured we would just have to make do. What a pleasant surprise! We ended up staying three nights. The room was spacious and very clean. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. Our room included a free breakfast at the on-site restaurant so it made the price of the room even better. We didn't use the pool but it was well maintained with fresh towels daily. Parking is a little tight with a little walk but no different than most parking in Hawaii and very doable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this hotel for a one night stay because we were arriving on a late flight and wanted to stay near the airport. It is very conveniently near the airport, but easy to miss when you are driving by on the highway. The hotel was not great. Everything in the room felt sticky. Soundproofing is poor. One good point is the made-to-order free breakfast in the hotel restaurant. Go early to avoid the line at the door. They have a nice view of the ocean and cruise ships dock nearby. This is not a place for a long stay.</p></li>

Rooms were comfortable, clean and the breakfast was fine - anything free on Maui is unusual.

The only thing that annoyed me was we specifically ordered a room with a king size bed, paid extra in fact for a king sized bed, and when we got there we were told they were sold out and they only had two double beds. The rest was ok.</p></li>

A little noisy as people tended to stand under the window to smoke... I could have shut the window, but I was enjoying the ocean sounds too much for that!!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On the surface, it looks clean and elegant, a classic hotel. The location and parking are pretty handy too. But we changed rooms 3 times trying to get a decent nights rest. The first room had a rattling noisy airconditioner, and we were woken up by a stupid rooster after 5am. We tried changing, but the next room smelt so foul, with the bathroom so pungent from weed, that we didnt bother opening our bags. The 3rd room wasn't too bad, the aircon was a bit quieter, and it was okay. Breakfast in the hotel was pretty good, although service is friendly but can be a bit slow.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We only stayed three nights and that was enough. The down side is the room smelled musty and gross. The place is not fancy, but we weren't there to spend in the hotel room. The pool was too cold to swim in. Beach is average. The air conditioning unit was very noisy and kept us awake the first night. We told the management and it was fixed right away. We also needed another blanket, no problem. The people were very friendly and the breakfast was good. Plan on 40+ drive to any attractions. Probably wouldn't stay here again. But for those on a budget like we were, it was fine.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel reminded me of the flea bag hotels I would see around bus stations. I've stayed at better hotels at truck stops. It's the type of hotel that if you were looking for a hotel to stay in and you drove by the Maui Seaside, you'd keep driving. Staying with a tour group we had little choice of where we were staying. Frankly YMT Tours should be ashamed of themselves for booking their groups at this hotel. Every time I think about sleeping in this hotel, I cringe. As my mother would say: "this is not a hotel where a respectable lady would stay". Once again, mother knows best!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Maui Seaside Hotel on our 1st night (late night flight in) and last night of our vacation (early flight home the next morning). It was basic, but clean, and just what we needed to be close to the airport. The in-room refrigerator was handy, coffee pot was nice too. The tight parking was $5 and we did not receive a free breakfast. However, I would like to note that the restaurant right next to the hotel served a wonderful breakfast, and was reasonable (considering Hawaii's costs). We would recommend this hotel for a quick night when you need to be close to the airport.</p></li>

This is probably legal but hallways had no sprinklers but a series of small fire extinguishers in the hall way. I guess for the price it was ok if you were not going to stay in hotel very much. Oh the Continental sucked if you like nutrition No bagels or cereal. Next time I will probably go to a diffrent place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I did not stay at the Seaside but stayed at the Maui Beach hotel in Wailuku, which is similar and also below my standards, but...... If you are going to travel be realistic. Don't be surprised at finding cockroaches and geckos in Hawaii. If you want a nice room for under a $100 go to Waikiki. This is Maui - where a 1920's bungalow in Kahului sells for more than half a million dollars. You can't go cheap on Maui and expect a resort. The main tourist areas are Kihei to Wailea and Lahaina to Kapalua. What were you doing in Kahului - its where the real people live. The most interesting parts of Maui are off the beaten path which most tourists will never experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just spent a week here, and definitely will not return to the same hotel.

I'm not at all a demanding for posh accomedation type, but this place is simply horrible. Free breakfast was okay, same three choices daily. Room price seems cheap but if you add wifi charges, parking charges, you can get much better places in seaside towns such as Lahaina and Kihei for around the same cost. If you are planning on your first Maui trip, my advise to you is to not stay in Kahului, go for Kihei and Lahaina if you are budget concious and travel with family.</p></li>

After reading the reviews I was pretty scared to see what we were in for but the room ended up being clean and basic which was what we were looking for. Had an okay view in the morning but checked out right away so didn't really matter. The staff were friendly enough--would not say overly friendly but did their job fine. Went for a late night snack at The Ale House down the street which was perfect. The room is very basic with dated amenities but was clean.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel did provide a shelter for us to stay in and for that it's good enough. It is the closest thing to cheap that Maui has to offer and is close to the airport for convenience. The parking has room for improvment. The parking space is limited and they still "sell" you parking passes for those limited spots. All others ark at a gravel lot outside hotel property and walk to your room. Internet is an additional charge and the laundry facility is only open certain hours, which puts a damper on vacation plans when you have to wash laundry on someone elses schedule. Having used this hotel now, I'd use it if I had to but I'll certainly be looking for something else next visit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel for one night after arriving in Maui late at night. It was our first time in Maui and we did not want to deal with renting a car or trying to find our way around at the late hour we arrived. This hotel is close to the airport (a $12 cab ride). Our unrenovated room was badly in need of updating. However, the bed was surprisingly comfortable and we had a good sleep. We went to the nearby Ale House for a drink and snack after we arrived. It was fun and we can recommend the Maui 'Big Swell IPA'. The next day we took a $12 cab ride to Enterprise to rent a car, and headed to our resort. If we stayed there again we would spring the $10 or $20 for an updated room.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here because we had to (a late flight in, so did not want to drive in the dark). And will never stay again. The personnel was friendly but that is just about as far as it gets. The bed was a nightmare, room way below average and the whole building was old and not well taken care of. The vending machines were out of everything (and were the only place to buy anything at night) and the breakfast was basically non-existent. For this price in the mainland you stay in motels which are ten times better than this one! Next time I will book a flight that is in Maui earlier and just head streight to the beach locations.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading some of the reviews, I was very nervous about going to the Maui Seaside Hotel. But I can honestly tell you, it was great. We did not go in there expecting a 5 star hotel. It was a package deal...air, hotel and car rental. Our room was huge. King size bed, fridge, new air conditioner. It was clean. No bugs. Grounds were very well kept. Friendly staff. Contintental breakfast every morning was awesome! Staff in restaurant was great! Greeted us every day. Hugged us when we left. Check in staff was awesome. There was some upkeep going on. Replacing of carpets, air conditioners, bedding. Painting was happening. Re -tarring of the roof. It IS an older hotel, but would highly recommend it!</p></li>

This place was horrible, there were all kinds of bugs in the room and it smelled like a dumpster. It was so old and crowded I think everyone staying there was defenetly in a really tight budget.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent a week in early September at the Maui Seaside Hotel in Kahului, Maui, Hawaii. It was honestly the best place if on a budget. It's nicely situation in Maui's largest city, close to the airport, the only Wal-Mart on the island, and the gateway to the Road to Hana as well as the volcano. The hotel staff was very accomidating as well. They helped us out endless times. An added bonus to this hotel is just how close it is to shopping centers, gas stations, and eating establishments. You're less than an hour from Maui's famous west coast. It's not a super fancy place. It's a simplistic hotel that's clean. All in all, my wife, baby and myself are happy and please that we selected the Maui Seaside Hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Maui Seaside for one night in January 2009. We used the place for our first night on the island rather than going straight to our condo. This worked quite well for us, as we were tired and the Maui Seaside was quite easy to find and get to from the airport. The rooms are standard family class hotel with a small fridge. Our room was clean, but did have a slight musty smell. Theyâ€™re saving energy and it was closed up without the AC running. The property has a nice garden area in the center with the swimming pool. There is a little beach out back, which made for a couple of pleasant strolls. We had breakfast at their Coconut Grill Restaurant and it was quite good. They do charge $5 for parking.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here for just a night upon arrival in Maui. It reminded me of the little family run hotels in Florida before the chains took over. The rooms are basic and the property is definitely vintage, but what do you expect? If you want the Four Seasons you can go pay for the Four Seasons. We should have stayed longer. It would have been a good place to stay for 2 or 3 nights as a base to see the north side of the island and would have saved a lot of money. No complaints. Services was great too. I even got an "apology" that I had to park off-site, which was approximately a 60 second walk back to the hotel. The restaurant was good too. I recommend putting some of the coconut syrup in your coffee. Very tasty.</p></li>

The hotel is very close to the airport and easy to find. The staff is very friendly. Handy restaurant is attached to hotel for an average breakfast before you head out (our meal was included with room) The room was neat and clean - that was my main concern. Bed was comfortable. Two chairs outside to sit and look at the bay and pool in the centre (we had a ground floor room). Parking is $5 or free just beside the hotel. Either option is fine and close. We paid the $5 but ended up parking just beside the free parking as it was late and the closer paid parking was full. No safety issues for car or contents that we could see..</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this lovely seaside hotel on my first trip to Hawaii. The hotel is all open air and the breeze flows through at all hours of the day. When you walk into the hotel lobby, you can see straight through to the ocean and it's really very nice. Our room was large, clean, and service was very good. The building is older and has an authentic Hawaiian decor which is not as flashy and overstated as the rest of the US and most high priced hotels you will find in the area. Every morning you have your choice of muffins, toast, wonderful fresh fruits and juices and an open air seat to start off your day. So, if you're looking to save 75% on hotel costs and still stay in a nice play, I would highly recommend the Maui Seaside hotel. Mahalo!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arranged to stay here for the one night before moving on to our nicer plans. That being said, it's clean and fine for a night's sleep. I was not impressed, however, with paid parking. Yes, it was only $4, but the idea was just plain dumb for approx. 20 parking spaces and three driving/security guards to make sure they park correctly. You don't have to park there, of course. You can walk all your luggage down 1/4 a mile over a semi-sidewalk and grass. The other thing that completely blew me away was that the pool shuts down at SIX in the EVENING! Yes, there is the ocean (with not safe swimming near), but wow! Would I stay again? Yes....for a clean place and a night's rest. I would never suggest anyone experience Hawaii by spending their trip there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">this hotel looks little bit old inside , outside but i could feel very relaxed atmosphere when i enter the lobby. This area is very convenient and you can find a couple of shopping mall with easy drive. You may not like this hotel if you want to enjoy bathing time.(shower room has no bath tub and the room is small, not very very small, i guess and water pressure is not so good) there is a small fridge and one coffee table,two chairs in the room and we could enjoy some to-go foods there. the room was very clean and there was no funny smell like nicotine. AC worked pretty good. people who works there was very nice. if you are very active tourists and don't spend too much time in the hotel and don't care too much details, this is the one you are looking for.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Basically you get what you pay for at this joint. The hotel is perfect for those getting into Maui late at night. It's 5 min drive from the Kahului airport. At this hour, with possible jet lag, you probably don't want to be searching /driving far for a night to stay. The hotel is generally dated, carpet is old, hallway is dark, has that leftover musty smell from the 70's (most likely used to be a smoking hotel). We chose a standard /non-oceanview room. The room is clean, AC, and quiet. We went for continental breakfast the following morning and checked out. The hotel security guy was one friendly guy, he gave us an updated Frommer's Hawaii guidebook to keep! Stay here only at the start of your trip, then move your way up to nicer and more $$$ hotels.... :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked a 14 night stay at the hotel during a business trip and the staff was so warm and friendly that I felt like I was at home! They had the true Hawaii spirit and showed me so much Aloha that I will ONLY stay at the Maui Seaside hotel going forward while I'm on business on Maui. The hotel is not the most modern hotel but Is very CLEAN and sits right on the ocean and is centrally located right near the malls wholefoods and the airport. This hotel has everything that is needed if our traveling on business or on a family vacation. They also provideded me with a microwave, coffee maker and refridge so I could eat in after a long day of work. I highly recommend this hotel if you really want to experience the true hawaiian hospitaliy that the islands have to offer.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Maui Seaside because it was one of the few reasonably-priced hotels on Maui. It looks like, and feels like, a mid-priced motel in the US or Canada. It's very convenient to the airport and shopping -- there's a large fashion mall within walking distance, and many local restaurants. The rooms are rather small, and WiFi costs about $25/week. Parking on their lot is an extra $5/day. We did get a microwave and small fridge. It has a large pool and small beach, which is part of the protected Kahului bay. There's a restaurant on the property, which we never ate at. If you expect an all-inclusive resort, you'll be disappointed in the Maui Seaside. We wanted somewhere to sleep, and store our stuff, while we explored Maui, and we were well satisfied. Charles</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for one night. upon check-in the reception staff were kind enough to upgrade us to the junior suite without us asking (we had booked the standard room). The room was in a quite location as requested, away from the parking lot, and had 2 flat screen tvs, one in the bedroom and the other in the lounge/kitchen room. Although the bedroom was dark (with only small horizontal window near the ceiling), we found it to be clean and comfortable. There was a large fridge and kitchenette. we didnt do any cooking here but even if we did, it would be difficult because we couldn't locate any plates/bowl/cuttlery in the kitchen. The hotel charges guests for parking, which we found unusual. but all in all, good inexpensive place to stay near the airport for one night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our first time in Maui and we were looking for an inexpensive, nice place to stay. We stayed the whole six nights here and had a wonderful time. We swam in the bay, walked to local restaurants and rented a car to get around. The staff was friendly, very accomodating and kept our room very clean. Our 22 month old loved playing on the lawn and walking us to the restaurant every morning. Breaksfast came with our package and it was very good. I loved the Banana bread. We paid for parking 5.00 a day and compared to some places this was very cheap so no big deal. The Coconut grill closes for lunch early and does not serve lunch on the weekends so make other plans. Great burgers and pancakes with coconut syrup. Over all, we were very pleased and would definelty stay their again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a 9 o'clock pm flight so we got a room at the Maui Seaside to nap, hang out and freshen up before our flight. The staff is friendly. The hotel is Hawaiian owned which made me feel good. The room was a little dated in its appearance. They had just changed from keys to key cards the day we arrived. The room had an old fashioned telephone and no alarm clock. No big deal as we called the front desk to ask for a wake up call, and they did. The room had a fridge which was nice. The room was clean but seemed a little dreary because of the outdated fixtures. I didn't use the pool but I noticed it at check in. Looked nice. One little complaint-- they charged me for parking. That seemed odd as this was a more like a motel than a hotel.... It was only 5 bucks though so not a big deal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for two nights in maui seaside hotel. We really loved our stay there. We arrived at the lobby at 12 instead of 3:00 pm and still were given an early checkin. Also we got a room upgrade from standard to deluxe. The view from the room was very good as it was partial oceanview. As for the room it is very spacious .....very clean .. The atmosphere at the hotel is very nice and the staff is friendly. At night one can walk on the beach adjoining the hotel. If you are visiting maui for the first time .. this is the place to stay as location from the airport is key to this hotel .... just 5 mins drive, and also 5-10 mins to costco for stocking up on your stay . Complimentry breakfast is nice too. No parking problems at all. Overall the feel to the hotel is very good and i would highly recommed it .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Maui Seaside left MUCH to be desired. The room was tiny and rundown, with ancient 70's style decor. The AC did not work well at all, and housekeeping turned it off each day when they came to clean, meaning we returned from each day of sightseeing to a steaming hot room that took hours to cool again. The location is central, pool and grounds are actually quite nice. I was there for a conference so it was convenient for me, but this is most definitely NOT a vacation spot. Considering that the place is not particularly nice, it is definitely overpriced. For $20 more, you can get a MUCH nicer and more modern place. They give you breakfast coupons for their highly overpriced and not particularly good restaurant, again, not worth it. Stay away-- try the town of Kihei if you want something not too far from Central Maui.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A decent place for what we paid. Some reviewers complain that this isn't a $400 dollar a night resort, but that isn't what you're paying for. We booked this hotel through priceline and weren't supposed to get the free breakfast, but they threw it in anyway. The breakfast consisted of eggs, sausage, toast, and potatoes and was really good. They do charge for overnight parking, but there is a free parking lot right next to the hotel. We were not nickel dimed at all. Cell phones work everywhere so why would you make calls on the hotel phone anyway. We have stayed in resorts in Wailea and Kihei before, but were on the road or at the beach all the time anyway so we decided to stay at the much less expensive Maui Seaside and were extremely happy. I would compare this to a Best Western or Super 8 with a free cooked to order breakfast.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved this hotel. We stayed here one night - Friday Oct 8th, after landing from a flight to Kahului from LAX via Honolulu -- we arrived late - 11 PM. We were beat. These guys were very nice, courteous, caring and just wonderful. The room was a basic hotel room but it was clean and comfortable and quiet. There is a parking lot on site but we did have to pay $5.00 to park our rental car. They also have an on site security guard. The location is "Local" and not close to the resorts but there is a beach and a nice bay/ocean view. I've posted a few pictures on this site and you will see that the grounds are well maintained and very nice. There is a coffee shop - "Coconut Grille" attached to the hotel and we had breakfast there. The food and service were excellent. This is a good hotel to use as a base location for sight seeing while on the island.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Like the previous reviewer, we stayed here one night after a late flight into Kahului. The front desk staff was very nice, and security were patrolling the parking lot. The room was large, but not in the main courtyard area, instead it was in a 3-story building with no view of the ocean. The rooms are older, but ours was clean. There are no hair dryers or extra amenities in the room, and it smelled musty. We got up too late to try the free breakfast (its only from 7-8:30 am) The parking lot was full by the time we arrived at 10:30 p.m., and we had to park in the "annex" lot in a neighboring park. It was a bit of a walk back to the front of the hotel to get to our room. Overall, it served its purpose for our overnight stay, and is close to grocery stores if you're stocking up for your trip (we drove to Hana the next day). I wouldn't recommend staying here longer than a night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We read mixed reviews regarding this hotel. Basically those writing lesser than positive were looking for a resort type stay. Location was fantastic! Walkable community in Kahului. Ease of transportation by rental car. Great shopping mall nearby for last minute items. Wonderful acesses to the Arts Center where we saw Jack Johnson and Friends (reason we booked the trip). We were able to walk to the concert safely and easily. We could get to all areas of the island easily and quickly from Maui Seaside. Each trip to a beach or park was breathtaking. Room was clean, staff was very friendly and accomodating! breakfast was something to be desired - but free. I prefer something more healthy. We hope to have the opportunity to visit Maui and stay at your hotel once again! We would certainly book a room at Maui Seaside again! This was our most relaxing vacation EVER! Mahalo Maui!

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Yes, I know Hawaii has cockroaches. BUT THEY SHOULD NOT BE IN YOUR HOTEL BED!!! And this one was giant, almost two inches. We saw one of his smaller friends earlier on the curtain, and who knows how many more of their buddies were lurking around. Needless to say, we got the hell out of there. The last thing I needed was some cockroach imbedding itself in my ear canal. We slept in our rental car that night, which was more preferable than sleeping with cockroaches. Oh, the hotel, don't stay there, don't even stay in Kahului. Aside from the rather awesome movie theater, there is really nothing there except big box stores. We ended up in Lahaina and loved every minute of it. A really authentic experience over there, with great restaurants and shops, and tons of local artists. And, of course, awesome beaches. It turned out to be a really fabulous trip. Don't let the Maui Seaside Hotel ruin your trip!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We needed a place to stay for one night because our condo wasn't ready until the next night. We arrived right at check in time 3pm, and I had booked the cheapest room. We paid about $95 for the room, it was a basic motel room, like a motel 6. It was clean apart from the dingy carpet, that was so old and almost sticky. It had a nasty smell of too many cleaning supplies or deodorants to mask the smell of the old carpets I'm assuming. The beds were comfortable though, hotel staff were very friendly, (apart from the front desk staff)... the pool was very clean and nice, and there is a nice beach as well. All in all, it was fine considering the price and it allowed us to go to costco the next morning and pick up groceries before heading to west Maui. They have wireless internet but you have to pay for it. $9.99 / hour or $20 for the day I think. Parking was $5 unless you wanted to park somewhere else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I read a few of the reviews on this hotel after I had already booked it on AARP passport a couple of months earlier. We had requested a quiet room and were very happy with the room they gave us. The staff were all very friendly and most helpful. The hotel was a tourist class 60's but had awesome views and the room was very neat and clean the towels were very soft, fluffy and abundent. It is close to the airport (but not noisy) and has many malls and shopping centers close by. Our flight left at 9 PM so we ask for a late check out giving us plenty of time to pack and the request was granted. We had plenty of hot water, nice TV, clock radio, secure parking and night entrance was only permited thru the front lobby. Never seen the first bug or any type of rodent. I would have to give this hotel a 2 1/2 star or or better rating due to the quaility of furniture,staff being very good and just plain polite. Doc</p></li>

The AC was not even on; were they not expecting us?? When we turned it on ( a small window unit in a hole in the wall-very inadequate) it never cooled the room, even after running all night. There was a used band-aid on the floor and overall the place was run-down. The grounds are alright, beach access was easy. I did not try the breakfast because even though there were 3 of us traveling, they only gave us 2 breakfast vouchers. The fridge also was not on when we checked in and did not cool until hours later when I turned if off then on again. There was absolutely no way an ocean breeze could have come through the room and we spent an uncomfortable night. Couldn't wait to leave the next morning. I am very glad their price was so reasonable because I would have hated to pay more for what we got.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was looking on the internet for the least expensive place to stay on Maui and this is what I found. I don't know if it is but... I just returned home to Oahu and I think I got what I expected there. I do wish that they had supplied at least small bottles of shampoo and lotion though. Also, the parking is free but limited. If you are returning to your room at night you may not find a parking spot. I also wish the parking stalls were wider. Most times I had to have my companion get out of the car before I could park. I got to stay in the poolside rooms and I liked it. As long as you don't expect too much you will be pleased with the hotel because the staff is very friendly and the location is near the airport. If you are staying on maui, you should not be spending much time in your room anyway! There is so much to see and do! For the price I paid, you could get a better room in Waikiki but for Maui, where everything costs a bit more, it was fine.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We wanted an inexpensive central hotel for a clean and quiet place to sleep after long days of exploring Maui. For the most part, this is an adequate hotel and it was surprisingly quiet, given the relatively busy location and number of guests booked over the holiday weekend (except for the chicken coop under our window, but we have wild chickens where I live in Honolulu so maybe I am accustomed). The hotel is a bit over priced, given the lack of amenities; we were told to pay $5 a day for parking, which was overbooked, so we parked off property in a nearby park. WI-Fi in the room had almost no signal, and at $8.95 per day, was not worth the expense, anyway. Beds were rather wobbly but we slept OK. The water pressure in the shower was excellent. We spent as little time in the hotel as possible, because we had lots to do, but the hotel reeked of cigarettes in most areas and it seemed very run-down inside (the grounds, however, were in beautiful condition).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I went to Maui on a reward trip from his company. We decided to fly in a night early so we could get in some sleep and get on the different time schedule. We picked this place based on its proximity to the airport. I was so freaked out when we got there! Our cab driver told us not to stay there but we didn't think it would be as bad as it was. I swear they must be running a drug ring or a prostitution ring out out of that place. The whole night we heard loud sounds and bangs on the walls. The thing is it that they advertise well on the internet. It is also not in a bad part of town. I don't think there is such a thing as a "bad part of town" in Maui. Anyways, we left the hotel at like 8 am and got a cab to our hotel at the Fairmont in Waliea. When we arrived at the Fairmont and saw our faces on of the staff immediately asked if we made the "common" mistake of staying at the Maui Seaside. I couldn't believe they knew without us telling them!</p></li>

When they say check in is at 3pm, they do not mean 250pm or 259 pm, for that matter. The breakfast was great...but if you book it through THEIR own website, you are not entitled to free breakfast. Even then...the staff did not want to be there, waiting on customers! Everything seemed like an inconvenience to the staff! Ask a question about local dining, etc and they are short...go to the mall....they have everything. All in all, you get what you pay for but then they charge you for everything else. $5 a day parking; internet access!!! Are you kidding!! I would have rather paid an extra $20 to be treated as a guest and not an inconvenience to them. Pay the money, people...Seaside is not worth saving a buck...trust me. KPNA SEASIDE was great, however and I ould stay there again. I can actually say that the rooms were very clean</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked our first night on Maui here because our plane got in very late and I didn't want to have to go far (with three tired children). It is not a new hotel by any means but I was happy that they upgraded our room to a kitchenette which included a day bed so our daughter didn't have to share a small double bed with her brothers! The staff was all very friendly and helpful! I would not stay for more that a day - it is a great jumping off point or place to stay before you go to the airport. You do have to pay for everything, internet, parking, but welcome to Maui! Unless you stay at a resort with all fees included, that is the way it is. I do have to say the breakfast is awesome. It is not a buffet but a sit down with a choice of three breakfasts. It is only for two people though, but we took ours to go and it was a lot of food! It is clean, the bed comfortable and the kitchenette fully stocked, but definitely not a $100 a night hotel back home. As per other reviews, "for the price it did the job"!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Like many other travellers, my husband and I stayed here after a late flight from LAX. We were given a key to a room that I happily realized would have an ocean view when we woke up to our first morning in Maui. When we hauled all our luggage up there, I noticed a Do Not Disturb sign on the door. I figured the maid might have left it. You can imagine my suprise when I saw people sleeping in "my" bed. It was after midnight, our time, and now we had to go back downstairs. The desk clerk didn't say a thing. Our final room was clean and the bed quite comfortable. It had no view, but then it had no other people in it either! The breakfast that was included was a little odd. It was only from 7-8:30. When they ran out of hard boiled eggs at 7:15, they were out for the duration. But it was a little coffee and muffin that I wasn't expecting so that was good. Another good thing--the hotel is so close to the airport, most car rental agencies will pick you up for free. They will call for you from the front desk.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Never been to Maui, so that may be my fault. But this hotel is really not near anything. But with a rental car, you can drive anywhere obviously. It is a very quiet motel to stay at. No real beach though. The pool area is very relaxing. The rooms are spacious and clean! THe ladies at the front desk are awesome! They were very helpful in giving us directions. We had to check out by noon, but our flight didn't leave until 6:30pm. The hotel staff stored our bags all day for us, while we spent the day at the beach! We came back before our flight, laid out at the pool and then used the hospitality room that they offer. It was pretty nice. They do have a restaurant, but it was very expensive. We didn't try it. Someone posted before that they lock up the parking lot at night with a gate..not true. they do have security...even though we left one morning at 3:30AM, they were no where to be found. All in all, great price for a room to sleep and shower. I don't understand having to pay an exorbitant amount of money for that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I were there for 11 nights. I have read alot of negitive reveiws of this hotel, even before we left to stay there. My husband and I were very pleased with our stay. I used to live on Maui in Wailuku, and wanted to stay in Kahului, because it would be close to my town and Baldwin school, and a good location to travel around the island, and easy to get to the Airport. It really was great after a 17 hour trip to be only 7 minutes away from the airport. We thought that the beach was great, lots of shells. The room was kept very clean, and if we asked for extra items we were given them. The grounds were kept very clean and the pool was great. I was pleased to have access to a laundry room. The only thing that I would ask a little improvement on would be the breakfast. Muffins, dounuts, juice, reg coffee, bread, hard boiled eggs and oranges. I would like to have seen Mango, Pineapple, milk, and perked decaf. coffee, I don't like packaged Sanka. We would stay there again, and would recomend it to people. N.H.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed at this hotel previously and have always had great stays and experienced the very friendly and wonderful staff there. On this particular visit we had our toothpaste confiscated by TSA due to the tube size being too big, our fault. It was 10:30pm when we pulled up to Longs Drugs only to see a closed sign on the door. Well, let's go to the hotel, check in and ask where else we could go to get some toothpaste. When we asked, while checking in, 'Keiki' handed us a little tube of toothpaste and said, "If you don't mind the brand, you can have this one." with a great warm smile. That just made our whole stay. On top of that, the next morning the wife realized she didn't bring her hair dryer so we called the front desk to check if we could rent one. "No charge, we'll have one delivered to your room." was the warm reply from the front desk. There are always warm friendly greetings whereever you go in this hotel. The stays are always too short and this hotel is truly 'NO KA OI' on Maui. Mr and Mrs Ramsay Morisaki</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading the reviews --as we all do. I had mixed feelings of this property. First, when we arrived around 11 am checked with t he front desk to see if any rooms would be avail knowing check in was at 3pm. They had a full night before - so to check in was not going to happen - however, the front desk person took all the info - cc name etc and when we did return late that evening our room was ready with the key. I gave this hotel a an above avg rating - because it exceeded my expectations of a 2 star property. Could not see the outside of the room since it was already dark. But the inside of the room was very clean, however, small. It served the purpose of our one night stay. Next morning we woke up to a view of the bay, landscaping at the property very nice - better than some more expensive hotels. Bathroom was small but comfortable and clean. All that mattered -- mattered. Close to airport - and highway for travel to other parts of the island. Glad to have chosen this property and will return when the time presents to visist Maui again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When we made our reservations 7 months before our stay, their website said there was a complimentary breakfast each morning on the veranda. That was a major reason we chose that hotel. When we arrived, I asked about the breakfast and was told they now had a restaurant. There was nothing on their website about having to pay for parking, but when we got there, we were charged $5/day to park in their lot. Our first night was uneventful, but on our second night, we returned to our room to find water dripping from the ceiling. We called the Front Desk and after about 30 minutes, we were switched to another room. We finally got moved in and then saw that there were termites swarming around the light. We killed about 20 before we called again. She said our room was the first this season to have termites. So, we got moved again. Our evening was taken up moving out of and into rooms instead of seeing Maui. I asked if we would be compensated for all the trouble, and she said she would "comp" us one night. If I had not asked, we no doubt would have paid the full rate for that night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for one night 2 weeks ago because we landed at 9pm and didn't want Mom & Dad to have to drive from Lahaina to pick us up so late. I would not want to stay here for a full week unless I needed to be right next to the airport or community college. Our room was perfectly clean & suited our needs for a place to get 8 hours sleep & a shower. Only 2 bath towels provided in the bathroom so had to get one more from the maid in the hallway. Also only conditioning shampoo not separate shampoo & conditioner. Good air conditioner & ceiling fan so you have your choice of what you prefer for cooling. Was able to layout by the pool for about an hour after breakfast before checkout & it was very pleasant. The buildings shelter the pool area from most of the wind. Pool water temperature was too for me to swim in. Got a good AAA rate that included free breakfast. Longs Drugs walking distance in case you need anything. Our cab ride from the airport was $15 including tip. Take a book/leave a book shelf in the lobby area. Shrimp Truck near the comm. college also has amazing food!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and my husband stayed at the Seaside hotel for 7 days. When we first got there we were told that parking by the hotel was $5 but that there was also a free parking lot behind the hotel. We saw a lot of cars parked at the free lot the first night, so we parked there too. The parking was safe during our stay. The room was cleaned every day but one day when we came back we found hair on the white sheet on the bed. We did not use this sheet before. So, I am not sure if it was changed from last time it was rented or not. We could not find any nice beaches around Seaside hotel. So, almost every day we drove to West Maui ( Lahaina, Kapalua ) beaches. This is about 30 mn drive from Seaside. If you are really looking to be by the beach Seaside is probably not the hotel you want to rent. There are shops and malls around this hotel but nothing more to see. I am not sure if you could go for a nice walk there at night. If you want to get out at night, take a walk, buy gifts then go to Lahaina. We ate at Kimo's restaurant. It is not cheap but they have fresh fish and the steak was delicious.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had an early morning flight so booked here just for the night. Upon entering the parking lot, there were at least 4 people directing traffic to remote areas on the property even before we checked in! We had to leave our luggage in the car which, felt very unsafe. The lighting was horrible and there appeared to be no security. Once we walked what felt like forever, checked in and then began our "trek" to find our room. It was exhausting. Once in the room, we decided it was so unbearable that we did not even sit down before calling it quits and returned to the airport and roll the dice for a standby flight home. When we went to leave, the closest exits had been locked so it was a return to the car via the same way we entered, about a 1/2 mile walk. The building is old, dirty, smelly, moldy and anything else you could think of that describes: rat-hole. That and they charged $4.00 for that absurd parking. The desk personnel was friendly enough but that was all I can say good about the place. Cheap is cheap. This place gives new meaning to "you get what you pay for". Next time we will sleep at the airport.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The pictures look nice, and maybe some rooms were... ours was at the right front by the door.. Room clean, but not updated. Beds were not very comfortable... I used my own matress on the floor after things settled down a bit. Parking out our window at ground level, and we had nothing but bumpers to look at.. in fact kind of scarry at the time because it looked like a car could come in your room easily if they failed to stop or accidentally gunned it. The other issues was the "safe coded" door. All kinds of people and women were asking for the code all night and the undesirable traffice was horrific. Very scarry for us to feel safe while we left my mom so that we could go pick up food. We called security due to traffic and constant propositions and begging at door for security code...no one came. It was a very scarry night! Later , my nephew on Oahu told us that that was a cheaper hotel that many locals stay at who come over to Maui to work for the week. You do get what you pay for. If cheap is what you want then go for it! Oh if you are planning on touring during they day, don't plan on a dip in the pool. IT CLOSES VERY EARLY... SORRY I CAN'T REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT TIME, BUT EVEN WHILE IT WAS STILL DAYLIGHT.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've never written a review before, but because I've found the reviews I've read very helpful, I thought I'd pass along the favor. We stayed at the Maui Seaside over the president's day weekend and were pleasantly surprised. The trip was booked through Travelocity. The front desk folks were friendly and check-in was very quick. They didn't even need my credit card as a deposit. The hotel is old, with dated decor, but room was very clean and the shower had adequate pressure. The air conditioner worked fine. The beds had either Serta or Sealy brand mattresses (I noticed it when the sheets came undone), and were comfortable. The pool looked clean, although we never used it. The FREE continental breakfast was good and very useful in pricey Maui. The location was actually pretty good, close to the Mall, airport, start of Hana Road and the Crator. When I go on vacation, I generally don't like the room to be made up everyday. So I left the DO NOT DISTURB sign on for 4 days, and they completely respected it. My idea of a hotel is really just a place to come back, shower, and sleep. If you're looking for a resort to hang out at, this is not the place for you. However, if you want a CLEAN place to sleep and shower, with FREE breakfast in the morning, all at a good price, then you should definitely consider Maui Seaside.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not expecting anything, as I have driven past this hotel 1000 times, I found myself in need of a clean place to stay for a few nights. Much to my delight, I found this family-owned hotel quaint and the staff could not be friendlier. I love the idea of being able to keep my windows open all night to listen to the ocean (who needs AC??? If you do, they have window units.) The pool area looked well maintained and inviting, and you can go into the ocean there, but I would not recommend it in the afternoon after the wind picks up. Right next door there is a nice little local beach. If you want a clean place to stay, conveinient to most everything on Maui, you can't beat this place. Breakfast in the restaurant was pretty good, as well (you have to go get your own food, no room service.) Yeah, I agree, the towells are small, but I loved the little refrigerators. I love the vegitation on and around the hotel property. It looks (& is,) natural to the islands and it feels like going back in time a bit, which I find inviting. One afternoon there were local musicians practicing in the seats in the lobby area, which also added to the island feel. I also agree with the Costco comment - all Maui roads lead to Costco! Don't stay on this island long without shopping there. Also, the Saturday Swap Meet has moved to the Maui Community College campus, which is close to the Maui Seaside. This is a great place to pick up some gifts and fresh fruits and veggies.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having arrived in Maui at 10:30 PM we thought it best to stay in Kahului vs driving into Kaanapali so we chose one of the only 2 places in Kahului. It was like being at a motel we would stay as kids when on vacation-cheap but fairly clean. We felt like we had gone back to the '50's. we were so tired this first night we didn't notice how tired and dirty this place is. On our return because our flight didn't leave until almost midnight and we had to check out of our condo in Kaanapali at 11:00 we chose to stay again at Maui Seaside just to rest and get ready for the flight home - no overnight, just a dayroom to relax before the flight but we paid as if we were staying the night. The staff was the most unfriendly and unaccommodating I've ever experienced. We arrived at 1:30 only to be told we couldn't check in until 3:00 - the parking lot was basically empty. So we sat in the lobby and waited until 2:30 and asked if "any" rooms were ready. Nope, you have to wait until 3:00. So, at 3:00 my husband asked if the room was ready and they told us they'd put us in the "tower". Well, the tower is at the back of the bus, 3 story unit which stunk to high heaven. I think they did this on purpose because there were other rooms available. I was so glad to get out of this hotel! Parking is a nightmare once everyone arrives and you could end up walking a half a mile just to park!!!!!! Not much choice though in Kahului...deal with the mold and nasty interiors or drive on to your destination which is what we'll do next time.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Maui Seaside for one night. We did not have a hotel reservation upon arrival in Maui. We had lots of weather related issues that held us up in Seattle for over a day, and when we finally were able to get on a plane to HI, we did not have time to make a reservation. The person helping us at Thrifty Car Rental had a couple of suggestions, since it was our first time ever in HI, we decided to try to stay the first night at the closest place by the airport since it was really late. He called Seaside and I overheard him say something when talking to them about them only having a room available in the old area of the hotel, that should have been my warning ... The good: Close to airport; Low cost for room. The bad: Apparently some room conditions are worse than others. We were in a room that appeared to be very old and run down. My wife was afraid.... We also had to park in overflow parking area as I saw mentioned in another review. This overflow parking area was by a community park of some sort where there were drunks in their parked cars. The morning after our stay, when we went to our car, we witnessed one of these people get out of their car and relieve themselves right on the ground by their car. Summary: Sounds like some people have had better luck here, they must have been in a newer room than we had. If you can afford a little more cost, and the distance, I would highly recommend you consider going to the Maui Coast instead. We stayed there the next two nights and were very pleased. Will try to write a review of that stay also.</p></li>

<li>He called Seaside and I overheard him say something when talking to them about them only having a room available in the old area of the hotel, that should have been my warning ... The good: Close to <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.935">airport</span>; Low cost for room.</li>

<li>The bad: Apparently some room <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.557">conditions</span> are worse than others.</br></br></li>
<li>We were in a room that appeared to be very old and run down.</br></br></li>
<li>My wife was afraid.... We also had to park in overflow parking area as I saw mentioned in another review.</br></br></li>
<li>This overflow <span style="background-color:#e6beff" title="p=0.999">parking area</span> was by a community park of some sort where there were drunks in their parked cars.</li>

<li>The morning after our stay, when we went to our car, we witnessed one of these people get out of their car and relieve themselves right on the ground by their car.</br></br></li>
<li>Summary: Sounds like some people have had better luck here, they must have been in a newer room than we had.</br></br></li>
<li>If you can afford a little more cost, and the distance, I would highly recommend you consider going to the Maui Coast instead.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here twice - one night upon arrival and then again for two nights at the end of our stay. This hotel is what you pay for - a basic, cheap motel that is clean but dated. It was a great option for us as the price was right and we only used it as a place to sleep. The fact that the pool was always closed didn't bother us because we would not have used it anyway. The service on the first stay was fine, but the second time we were a little disappointed. We were traveling with our infant daughter and had requested a queen size bed when booking as she was sleeping between us. The first time this request was met, but the second time is wasn't (we were given a room with two doubles). After requesting to switch the desk clerk was quite rude. I accepted her response that my request was only a request, not a guarantee. I asked if they had cribs available instead, and though they did, she was unable to get me one because the housekeeping staff were not on at night. However I had just checked in and there were four women at the front desk.This was the younger woman (I guess this is family run?), and though she was very rude and unhelpful, the older women and housekeeping staff were much friendlier. We did not get a crib as she did not feel it was her job. Rather than get into an argument we just left it at that and made do. I would still stay there again on the way in and out of Maui, but I would request a crib ahead of time and not count on great service. Of course it is worth staying here for the price alone if you plan to spend your day traveling elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is barely a 2 star. Dont expect much and if youre picky find elsewhere as you will be sadly disappointed. I paid $95 on expedia by booking 3 weeks in advance. I knew what I was getting into thanks to trip advisor, so I dont feel cheated. Did I get what I expected...yes. Did I get what I paid for? No, its over priced by 25% but its MAui. One complaint I have is that they charge $5 for parking. Come on guys. This just give you a black eye and yes others do it too but that just leaves people with a bad taste in their mouth in relation to the whole state. Just hide it in the nightly rate like everyone else in the world does. I stayed the remainder of my trip at the Maui Banyan and they had a beautiful 3 storey parking facility and didnt charge it. Also this is a MOTEL, not a hotel. The international standard for hotel is more than 2 stories and interior corridor access to rooms, so call it what it is. I had a good stay al be it short. The beds were traditional motel firm but linnes were good. The rooms were clean but dated furnishings and bath fixtures. The motel looks like it was constructed in the 40's and is showing its age. You can only paint over bulging dry wall so many times. Staff were awesome. This is a family run place. Choice of 3 hot table service Breakfast meals was included. Im assuming this is what the parking charge went towards. The property grounds were neat as a pin and the grounds keeper was like the energizer bunny. There was a security guard on at night. 2 hours of wifi avail in lobby for free upon request. Would I stay here again ...depends. Would I come here specifically for a vacation...not on your life.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had visited Maui a few years ago and stayed at one of the fancy resort places. I had no desire to pay for fluff and wanted an economical place as a base for our excursions on this visit. I got the Maui Seaside through Hotwire, and was concerned when I read some of the reviews. I must say that we enjoyed the Maui Seaside. The front desk staff was very friendly and accomodating to our needs. Our room was extremely clean and had air conditioning which could be set to the desired temperature. I have stayed in three star and four star hotels of a higher price which were not as clean or had staff as accomodating as the staff at the Maui Seaside. The room which we had was very quiet, so we really slept well on comfortable beds. Our room was on the lower level facing the pool. The continental breakfast included fruit, assorted muffins, hard boiled eggs, toast, etc. and was sufficient to keep us going for most of the day. Anyone who has been to Maui knows that dining out can be expensive, so this breakfast represented a significant savings and provided the energy to keep us going until we dined out in the evening. We used the Maui Seaside for our base for our travel excursions as everything could be reached easily from it since Maui isn't that big. Money saved on a room to sleep is money that can be spent on experiences outside of a hotel. We talked with an individual who was a guest at the hotel as a result of a business activity. She stated that her company always booked their employees into the Maui Seaside when they were conducting business in that area. We would definitely stay at the Maui Seaside again as we had a very positive experience. I do not have photos available at this time but will in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is my second time here, My husbands first. I admit, It is not a fancy hotel, No FREEBIES in the rooms as shampoo or conditioner, no iron, there is one in the laundry room, the bar has since closed down. the restaurant food is good but on my stay in 2003 it was MUCH better! I have seen a few things that have gone downhill, BUt the staff is great, maid service excellent. ANd the one who wrote about cockroaches! we were here for 9 days, not once did we see a cockroach or Gecko (as they are properly called) in our room, LOts of Geckos outside at dusk, but thats ok, they are harmless and eat bugs! As for the location, its good, we are in central Maui and very close to everything. The cruise ships that come in are quite beautiful. we had booked so many things to do once in Maui we were only in our rooms to sleep. The pool is nice AND quiet. not many kids here to be screaming, to me that is the worst thing when a kid screams around a pool. they should be told not to. It is only open till 6 pm though which is quite a bummer, cuz several times we wanted to go in at night. they say its because they have no lighting, although we thought it is very well lit. The rooms are ok, we had a ground floor with a Patio, last year I had a very big room with two double beds and kitchenette on the third floor. Be advised THERE ARE NO COFFEE POTS OR ALARM CLOCKS AS stated IN EXPEDIA! there are small refridgerators in all rooms. it was not fun dragging suitcases up there! The parking can be terrible around 10 pm. but you just park in the other lot. As for staying here, Yes we will, because of the money we saved to get to do all the stuff we did. And I like to bring my own toiletries anyway. Half the time they stink in hotels! give it a try.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have mixed feelings about our stay at the Maui Seaside. We showed up a bit early to ask if we could drop our bags off until check in, but the receptionist would not let me speak, she just kept telling me that 'check in not until 3.' I tried to tell her I understood that, but could we please offload our bags but she seemed disinterested. She registered us in the end, but our room was unavailable but she gave us a parking slip - which cost $5 per night (which was the cheapest parking we encountered anywhere in Hawaii) but had to leave our bags in the car. We came back at 3 to check in and the same girl served us. She told us to take a seat while she checked to see if our room was ready. Half an hour later we were still waiting. Obviously we'd been forgotten as the girl had gone home! Eventually we got to our room which had been ready for awhile according to the other girl that served us who seemed to think our dilemma was amusing. (We were not amused). My only other criticism was when the next day I asked the receptionists for some directions, I had to wonder if the woman behind the desk was all there. She seemed very reluctant to acknowledge my existance let alone help me. I realise these people get asked these questions 1000 times a day, but if you're not prepared to do that then get another job. I've done that job, and a little bit of curtesy can go a long way; even if it is forced at least you have tried. OUr room was nice, exactly what we paid for which was no frills. just somewhere to sleep, shower and take five. The pool area was very nice though, and we enjoyed a couple of meals at the restaurant the Coconut Grill. Service there was excellent, we found the food to be delicious and the prices very affordable.Shout out to our server Jonathan if he should read this - you ruled!</p></li>

<li>We showed up a bit early to ask if we could drop our bags off until check in, but the receptionist would not let me speak, she just kept telling me that 'check in not until 3.'</br></br></li>
<li>I tried to tell her I understood that, but could we please offload our bags but she seemed disinterested.</br></br></li>
<li>She registered us in the end, but our <span style="background-color:#aaffc3" title="p=0.998">room</span> was unavailable but she gave us a parking slip - which cost $5 per night (which was the cheapest parking we encountered anywhere in Hawaii) but had to leave our bags in the car.</li>

<li>We came back at 3 to check in and the same girl served us.</br></br></li>
<li>She told us to take a seat while she checked to see if our room was ready.</br></br></li>
<li>Half an hour later we were still <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1" title="p=0.986">waiting</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>Obviously we'd been forgotten as the girl had gone home!</br></br></li>
<li>Eventually we got to our room which had been ready for awhile according to the other girl that served us who seemed to think our dilemma was amusing.</br></br></li>
<li>(We were not amused).</br></br></li>
<li>My only other criticism was when the next day I asked the receptionists for some directions, I had to wonder if the woman behind the desk was all there.</br></br></li>
<li>She seemed very reluctant to acknowledge my existance let alone help me.</br></br></li>
<li>I realise these people get asked these questions 1000 times a day, but if you're not prepared to do that then get another job.</br></br></li>
<li>I've done that job, and a little bit of curtesy can go a long way; even if it is forced at least you have tried.</br></br></li>
<li>OUr <span style="background-color:#aaffc3" title="p=0.998">room</span> was nice, exactly what we paid for which was no frills.</br></br></li>
<li>just somewhere to sleep, <span style="background-color:#e6194b" title="p=0.999">shower</span> and take five.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#9a6324" title="p=0.998">pool area</span> was very nice though, and we enjoyed a couple of meals at the restaurant the Coconut Grill.</br></br></li>
<li>Service there was excellent, we found the <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">food</span> to be delicious and the prices very affordable.Shout out to our server Jonathan if he should read this - you ruled!</li>
