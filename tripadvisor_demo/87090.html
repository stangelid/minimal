<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not worth the $$ Ok - as long as you know what you're getting. Very small and not the cleanest. Extremely noisy at night (until about 4:30am!). Getting an elevator takes about 10 minutes.I think we could have done better for the money. Won't recommend it to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Love it I stayed here last year for 1 week. Good price for a central location. No point staying near the beach, the beach was so crowded. The other beaches around the island are way better. I would recommend this hotel if you want somewhere central and affordable. I would stay here again.</p></li>

A very noisy hotel (you could hear people talking on the phone in the room beside us at midnight/Security Guards walking up and down the corridors at all times during the night with loud RT's). The elevators take forever.</p></li>

We were very well received at the front desk. The room was quite nice with the largest bed I've slept in so for (Europeans are not familiar with king size). We stayed at 16th floor which was nice and quiet.</p></li>

Based on other reviews, called a few days before going and requested a room on a higher floor on the ocean side of the building. Room was clean and comfortable with a lanai facing the ocean. Waikiki is busy and commercial, but great fun and the beach is beautiful.</p></li>

Our room was very clean and the staff was very polite. My whole group stayed here in 4 seperate rooms and no one had any complaints. A friend even slipped the front desk an extra $20 and got a penthouse room.</p></li>

Great service, good location (right behind international market place),  clean rooms. We were not expecting much, but we got tons! They even upgraded us to a room with a mini kitchen! The only downer was all of the construction going in front of the hotel. I would definately stay here again.</p></li>

Our room wasn't what it was supposed to be the first night (we had booked a kitchenette room) so they more than made up for it by giving us a gorgeous large clean spacious wonderful kitchenette room for the rest of our stay. Staff was great and for meals we HIGHLY recommend the restaurant across the street, the Galaxy Steak House --- yummy and priced RIGHT!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Do you own earplugs?? Great location, friendly  helpful staff, good cleanliness. However, there is at least 1 bar/club nearby that must have a license until 4am as there is loud music pumping out into the air until then. With that you also get the inherent drunks shouting, dancing, laughing in the street etc, so they dont go home til 5am. OK if you are one of them - but not if you want a decent nights sleep.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not a bad deal My husband and I spent 12 days at the Ohana West. It's actually a good deal for the price. Our room was spacious and comfortable. It was clean and had a nice, partial ocean view. The staff was kind and accommodating. The hotel is in a good location, close to the beach. It's definitely not the Hilton, but for the price, it's exactly what we needed since we spent very little time in our room. We'd definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Value  We stayed at the Ohanao Waikiki West for 5 days in November 2008. Although this isn't the most glamorous hotel in Waikiki, it was exactly what we expected for the price. The location, basically a block back from the beach, was great as well.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Clean, efficient, This is a charmingly updated 30's hotel, very clean. Much of the sense of the era in which it was build is retained which adds greatly to its appeal. My upgraded room on the 2nd floor was compact and very comfy, with a little sitting room, kitchenette  balcony, good air conditioning, very clean bathroom and bed linens --I am noise sensitive and did NOT find it excessively noisy as other reviewers note. I would definitely return. My stay here was delightful.</p></li>

However, -- front desk people were very helpfull. -- rooms clean i was on the 17th floor facing the back (not the beach) it had a patio a tv a fridge.. what else do you need.-- good little bar by the pool before you hit the town.really thats about it. i know there are kitchenetts and smaller rooms than the we were in but for a hotel close to the beach it was great.</p></li>

Location was good. We had a total of three rooms, one king-combo and one standard kitchenette. It was nice to have access to a kitchen with a little one. I even made spam and eggs a couple of times. Hated the slow elevators that required a key for everything. Pool was cold. I would stay here again if I'm traveling with a group. The hotel was within eveyone's budget.</p></li>

The room we stayed in on the 12th floor had a great city view was well presented, with an extremely comfortable king bed. Kitchenette and bathroom were perfect for us. I am so glad I did not take notice of other reviews and stayed with Ohana West, I can't wait to stay with them again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very good hotel We walked over to this hotel from one very bad hotel and booked four nights for $1 cheper than we were paying in the first place. This was an oasis in the very busy Waikiki area and we enjoyed it very much. Excellent staff, easy parking ($20/day) clean, very comfortable rooms. The only issue we had was with the security system of using your room card to access the elevator. Almost 50% of the time it didn't work. Other visitors had the same frustration. Otherwise, we will surely stay here again!</p></li>

We had a king and two double beds, 2 bathrooms, and a kitchenette.The location was ideal across from the International Market Place and only a short walk to Waikiki Beach. We also found having the Food Pantry supermarket next door and Denny's across the street to be very handy.The staff were always friendly and attentive and our room was always kept clean. We would have no hesitation in staying here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We'll know better for next year We were on the 12 floor facing Kuhio and Royal Hawaiian, nice view. But that was about the only nice thing I could say. Ladies of the evening all over the street, partying on either side of our room till 3 or 4am, the hotels country bar letting out at 4am made for a noisy street, followed by delivery and garbage truck horns and reverse beapers starting at 4:30am made our vacation week a little hellish. Definitely not a quiet family friendly location. I would not consider this hotel again.</p></li>

I have been to Hawaii 9 times, and have stayed at this hotel 7 times, will be going to Hawaii in the year 2009 for xmas and we will be staying there again. Love the fact of grocery store being so close, love the restaurents, especially Porgys and Dennys across the street from Ohana West. The staff was always friendly, and kind, its nice just to relax in the lobby after a long day of sight seeing. so what if the elevators are slow, you are on Hawaii time, just hang loose, and enjy paradise.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">great budget hotel Stayed in the kitchenette with family of 6. Good value and were able to spend our vacation money on SCUBA and other expensive, fun things. The hotel is across the street from the Food Pantry and we were able to eat in breakfast and a few lunches and snacks. The street is where the action is for teens wanting to go out on an evening stroll. The beach is very close with Surfboard rentals and bathrooms/snack bar. We used the Outrigger hotel as well. Lots of other teen groups in the hotel, but they were gone most of the day.</p></li>

We had three rooms. All were excellent and very reasonably priced.It was very hot that week in Honolulu. All of our air conditioners worked perfectly. Hotel location in the heart of Waikiki beach was exceptional. We could walk to anything we wanted. We walked two blocks to the Don Ho show and to other things. Swimming pool was perfectly clean and very nice. Hotel's posted photos are very accurate. We highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

Very central to everything. Rooms very clean  renovated with fluffy towels in bathroom. Roomkeeping stafff very friendly and rooms cleaned most days very early. Kitchenette units great for keeping food budget in line as Waikiki is very expensive for a family to eat out all the time. You do not pay for coffee that you don't use as others would make you believe. Elevators not that slow.... you're in HawaII .... Hang loose! Would stay again for sure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stay here if you like noise Parking is $15 a day and the garage is badly overcrowded with cars parked everywhere. If you don't have good parking skills, don't attempt to park here.There are only three elevators and the decision to use key cards to get to upper floors is a big mistake. Passengers were riding up and down trying to get the key cards to work. This made for big backups to use the elevators.Kuhio St is busy all hours of the day and night so the hotel was very noisy.The units were well used but were kept clean and usable. The hotel staff was friendly and curteous.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">No worries. Stayed 6/10 to 6/16. Stayed on 12 th floor. Paid for a standard one bed room and they upgraded me to a kitchenett with two beds without me even asking. Very clean room and halls. Great maid service. Don't know where some of the other post got all the negative stuff from. Front desk was always hepful. Never had to wait more than 2 or 3 minuets for the elevator. Activity desk was great. Great location and would definetly book again. I live in Phoenix so am a little leary of cheaper hotels but the Ohana West was just what the Dr. ordered. Definetly check out the grocery store across the street.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Really Really Bad I booked this hotel for my parents Holiday to stay here for 10 days. They didn't want to stay there any longer than 1 night. The rooms were small. The lifts in the hotel didn't stop at the right place so you never got off on the right stop. The pool was always dirty and full of kids. Hotel was full of drag queens, out the front were hookers. Best thing about it is chillies is underneath and its across the road from the international market place. If you don't mind all of the other stuff its cheap accomodation. We just didn't fly 10 hours to stay in a dodgy place. It wasn't suitable for my family</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice hotel My daughter and I just returned from HI where we both had rooms at the Ohana West. Although the rooms are small, they are very nice. They appeared to have been refurbished in the not so distant past. We each had a kitchenette which made the stay very convenient as we were able to keep food in our rooms. The staff was friendly and the rooms were kept very clean. I would certainly stay there again as the location is top notch. A short walk to the beach, International Market Place, and upscale shopping. Of course, the bus system on the island is so handy that one can get to everywhere with not much effort.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great for the money/families This hotel is great for the money. There is 4 of us. Nice having a kitchenett , especially with the kids. Nothing fancy but it was clean. The staff are friendly. Everything is close within walking distance, about 2 blocks from ocean. Not alot for the kids to do in the hotel but swim, example, no arcade in hotel but there is one just across the street, a bit pricey. They were working on the hotel the whole time we were there by the pool so it was noisy with workers and then the day before we left they had blocked off the pool so they could work. Inconvenient. We would stay here again though.</p></li>

Rang from airport to confirm that we were not able to get to hotel. When we did book in the fact that I could show them that my cell phone had rang the number wasn't good enough we were still charged for the extra night. Room was clean but not beening a smoker it had major smoke odours. We are planning to go back to our daughters wedding in Feb next year - this is one hotel I would not recommend and will not stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel will disappoint you. We had a late check-in (around 9pm) due a late flight. Room is on the second floor right next to the bar and bathrooms. Our request to switch was turned down due to a so called 'full house' condition. We were not able to sleep until 4-5am due to the noise from the bar, elevator, people, AND, the flushing of toilets right next to our room. The carpet is dirty, paint was chipped on walls, bathroom sink was cracked, shower is extremely tight, half of dozen tiles in shower were broken. Presence of mildow is evident. This room should not be sold. This is a very bad experience! We will never come back to this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Affordable, Clean, Convenient This hotel is fine for those who don't go to Hawaii to sit in a hotel room. It is a clean no nonsense room. It was nice to have the refrigerator and the burners for cooking. Our party had 3 different kinds of rooms. One of the standard room was a little small but tolerable. All our rooms were very clean and well attended. The location was great but for $200 more a night you can be on the beach if you like. I wouldn't recommend this location for the honeymooners looking for a romantic view or the luxury traveler but it is a good place for a headquarters if you want to explore and spend your money on things other than a hotel.</p></li>

I was a bit leary of this place due to the comments by many. From our experience it was quite basic. Clean comfortable rooms. The staff was very friendly and the room was exactly what I thought it would be.This is by no means a four or five star hotel, but met our needs quite well. The pool area was very nice and clean, there was always someone cleaning around the hotel while we were there.The hotel is quite old, it has been updated with new paint, carpets, curtains and bedspreads. It is not lavish but clean.We would definatley stay here again and really enjoyed our trip to Oahu.</p></li>

We had a city/mountain view, king room, on the 16th floor with a nice size lanai, the room was a little small, but clean and comfortable. The daily housekeeping service was very prompt and did a very good job, and all the staff at the hotel demonstrated excellent customer service. The location of this hotel is perfect, it is centrally located to all the great things to do in Oahu. If your looking for a 5 star hotel this is not the place, but if your looking for a nice place with reasonable rates and great service, then this is the place to stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">TERRIBLE! This place was a nightmare. I went ahead and booked despite some warnings on this website. Our room was very dirty - gum on the carpet with other stains, as well as disgustingly filthy bedspreads. The bathroom was rusty and we had to hold down the toilet handle to force it to flush while it tried to push itself back up. Basicly, the only reason I'd go back would be if I was planning on partying hard and just needing a bed. We left early and stayed at a nicer place. Also we called the travel agent and recommended they change it to a half or one star rating. If you have kids - this is not the place. There were lots of partiers. I've stayed in hostels cleaner than this.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You get what you pay for! Great staff and location!Hug holes in the walls as you walk down the first floor hallway. Kitchen stuff was sticky not sure from what, remember to turn up your fridge when you put something in it or will will be warm when you return for it. Microwave small but very handy. Food market across the street is wonderful they have everything there. Denny's across the other street good as well. We paid $70.00 for a 7pm check out which I thought was kinda on the high side since the rooms only go for $99.As a travel agent not sure if I will reccomend my clients stay at this hotel, way too many small things to write about, just remember you get what you pay for!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nine out of Ten Just come back from 5 nights at the Ohana Waikiki West. The hotel was great. The staff were super cool and the rooms were large and airy. I had a kitchenette room on the 14th floor and everything was spotless. Views over to the sea were lovely and the street noise was not bad at all. One day I requested early make-up for the room, and the maid was there almost as soon as I had hung up the phone. Staff at the front desk were a little stressed due to daytime renovations and a fire alarm drill, but they handled themselves (and a bunch of arrogant tourists) very professionally.All in all a great location and great property (just remember the elevator is on Hawaiian time).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Central location My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 11 nights and found it a most enjoyable place to stay. It is situated adjacent to numerous bars, restaurants, shops etc, and only a five minute walk to the beach.Our room was spacious. It had a fridge , a cooker, a microwave and a tea and coffee maker.It also had a balcony, ample storage space and a TV.The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful at all times.Some people complained about the traffic noise at night but I dont think this is justified. It's the price you pay for a central location.One down side. Not enough elevators. This wasn't a problem for most of the day, but during busy periods, you would have to wait awhile.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Economical stay Hi all, Stayed for 6 nights at this place, Do not excpect to get a superior room . they are kept clean , but they are small. We were lucky, we had 2 dbl beds. The others in our group had much smaller rooms with the same size beds. the staff ar courteous and helpful.  the hotel is right on one of the main drags so if you get a room facing the direction of the ocean you can expect alot of vehicular noise. The pool is average, but then again I wasnt there for the pool or the room. I spent my time outside seeing the sights, on and off the beach. All in all, I would go back to this hotel again but my preference would be facing the canal so it is quiter. It is a very short pleasant walk to the beach from this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location and Service! I stayed here in October 2003 on my honeymoon. Not knowing anything about Hawaii, my husband and I simply went with our travel agent's recommendation, who had said she frequently booked travellers at this hotel and everyone seemed to like it.Our room faced Kuhio Ave., where the view was gorgeous and we could keep on eye on what was going on in the street. It's 2-3 blocks away from the beach, across the street from the International Marketplace, near several restaurants, and within walking distance to a couple of clubs. The tour desk was gave us all the help we needed to visit all the wonderful places and the cleaning ladies were so nice.Ohana Waikiki West helped make our honeymoon absolutely perfect!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Worth the price - IMHO We stayed in this hotel on 05/14/06 and 05/15/06 and was concerned based on some of the reviews but took a chance due to price and location.First, the less than ideal: $15 a night parking fee, *very* tight parking spaces in the garage, no view (none promised).The hotel staff was very cooperative when I asked for a king-size bed and to have a room on an upper floor. The elevator was not slow for us and we used it five or six times. I found the room to be average (room 942) and was quiet. The location was ideal for access to Honolulu. There was plenty of food and shopping close by.This hotel is not the best one in town, but it is not priced like the best one either. I would stay here again. I'm not employed by the hotel.Mike Honeycutt</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pretty decent... My wife  I picked this property as she stayed here on a previous trip. The rooms were clean  comfortable, though the decor was slightly 'dated'. The bathroom  kitchen fixtures could have used a little update, but otherwise the room wasn't so bad. There was some wallpaper peeling off in the bathroom, but it was under the sink  closer to the floor (i.e. out of main view). While we were staying there, the sidewalk around the front of the hotel was non-existent due to construction, but that was only supposed to last until early June. Waikiki Beach was a little walk (about four blocks), but being on Kuhio Ave was a nice break from all the expensive stores  restaurants over on the main strip (Kalakaua). Lots of cheaper food/shopping on Kuhio, which was nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice!!!!! This hotel was excellent. I had heard it was noisy and needed a remodel. Well good news - they just finished remodeling the entire hotel. Plus I asked for a quiet room (I am a light sleeper) and they upgraded us to a really nice room with a kitchenette on the 16th floor for no additional charge. The location is perfect, about 2 blocks from the beach right in the middle of great restaurants and shopping. The pool was nothing to scream about but who cares when you can go to the Outrigger, which is the Ohana's partner hotel, and use that pool, jacuzzi, and poolside bar. I will stay here again for sure! It's not the Ritz but for $55 per night who cares. Besides, you can use all the money you saved on lodging to buy expensive sushi dinners (yum) and cocktails in Waikiki!!!!</p></li>

Upon arrival both my wife and I felt a sense of what was about to come. The check-in was smothe however getting to the room was like running the gauntlet as the elevators are slow, small, and in disrepair. Our room was the final straw as it was in much need of repair. The paper on the walls were peeling, carpet was filthy and full of stains, the bathroom was also in need of a total overhaul. We decided to spend the night as it was late, however the next day we went out in search of new accomodations and found it at the Hilton Prince Kuhio for only $30 more per night than were had paid here. It was like leaving hell and entering paradise.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Only stay at this hotel if you don't care about sleep I would not recommend staying at this hotel if you are over 30. It is mostly for younger people who want to party, especially during the month of March. There were a lot of high school students with a limited number of chaperones staying on our floor. The hotel staff was kept busy with numerous complaints. There is also a bar that is connected to the hotel that is loud. There were numerous police visits to the hotel. The management and staff were very polite and professional but it did not make up for all of the stress of a week with no sleep. I would recommend staying at the Aston Coconut Plaza Hotel. It is the same price with out the noise. I stayed there last March and had no problems with getting rest and it had a nice continental breakfast.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ohana West Hotel in Hawaii 4 of us stayed at this hotel. When we got there we were advised we had been upgraded, instead of 4 to one room we were given two rooms. This was fantastic as 4 to a room can be a bit much at times!!. We found the hotel rooms clean and tidy. Had a great bathroom with no problems and great views from the balcony. The restaurant they have down stairs (Chillis) is great too. We used the laundry with no problems either. The only downside was 8 months later we received a letter stating that there was a pay dispute and we owed them $1137 USD!!! turns out when we received an upgrade we were supposed to have been given 1 big nicer room not two rooms but all has been sorted out now. I would highy reccomend this hotel to all who visit Hawaii and its close to all the shops and the beach as well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very Noisy This hotel is in need of a major renovation. We had two kitchenette combos adjoining which is supposed to house 6-8 people. Was very cramped. The rooms smell old and stagnet. We stayed two nights and both nights there were people congregating outside in the hallway on our floor. It was like that both nights and lasted from 10pm - 2am and it was so noisy, and also noisy outside in the courtyard where all the patios are, people are yelling and making noise throughout the night. We did inform the front desk when we checked out and they didn't seem too concerned about it. We would definitely not stay there again. The elevators are slowwwwwwww and the front desk employees need to take a class on courtesy and show they at least pretend to like their jobs.The plus side is that the hotel is close to the beach, shopping and restaurants.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pleasantly surprised!! First time stay at the Ohana West (Dec. 2003) but our 15th time to Honolulu. In the past we stayed at the Ohana Surf, but that was sold and made into condo's. Therefore, as creature of habit, our first trip to the Ohana West was a test as to our return in 2004. We were pleasantly surprised and my husband said I worried for nothing. Anyway, the staff were very pleasant, the room was a nice size although the shower stall was extremely small (and I mean small - unless you warm up the tiles in the shower, I wouldn't back-up too quickly). We had a kitchenette and our only disappointment there was the lack of cupboards to store anything (there weren't any. But the room was clean and a good size. If your on a budget and your not looking for luxury, but instead a clean, convenient location, happy workers than visit the Ohana West.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Super Hotel We stayed at the Ohana Waikiki West Jan.11 to Jan.15 and Jan.22 to Jan. 25,2007. It was better than we expected.Rooms are large and clean. The cleaning staff were very friendly...always smiling. This hotel is so handy to the beach,grocery store,drug store, and many restaurants. We booked our luau and cultural tour from the hotel and were very pleased with both....everyone so friendly and helpful. We also caught the free pink line trolley to the mall right outside the door. Pool area is large.Chilis Resturant and Nashville Bar are connected to the hotel. Rooms facing the street are rather noisey but rooms at the back are very quiet. We booked this hotel on the internet for the best rates. We would certainly stay here again and recomend this hotel to our friends. You do not even have to rent a car and could easily stay in the kitchenette rooms for long stays.</p></li>

Everything about this hotel was shocking. The bathroom flooded after 1 person had a shower, I was travelling with 5 adults we had interconnecting rooms, this was lucky as the other shower did not work.Do not wait for assistance with luggage as this is non existent although they do have a porterage desk.The pool area is a health hazard with large pieces of plastic lifting of the ground.Allow 5-10 minutes everytime you need a lift.They clearly advertise room service from the restaurant in the lobby, however when we called up to make an order we were told that room service had not been operating for 12months.Great location and that is the only thing this hotel has going for it.Never ever stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great value for those on a budget. This was my second time at this hotel. A very standard hotel with simple facilities but in a very active location close enough to the beach. Best location for being close to nightlife, resaurants, shopping, just about everything. Sure, there are better hotels in better secluded locations but with only a modest budget, it is a much better deal than most places in Florida. After all where would you rather be?Room was not very exciting but clean. The room was upgraded for free and they only charged me for one day out of two weeks for the safe. The hotel room card key was needed for the elevator which did not work properly half the time so you missed your floor often. That is the only real fault. Oh well, like I said if your budget can barely take you to Hawaii, then this hotel will work fine. After all, you want to see Hawaii, not hotel room walls.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Mainly Enjoyable Our family of four stayed at this hotel in October for our first trip to Hawaii. The rooms were a good size (kitchenette combo), beds were large and comfortable and the location was excellent for shopping, restaurants and the beach. The pool area is nice and relaxing and we spent quite a few late afternoons there. The only sour note of the stay was on leaving. My wife didn't notice until after we had left that she had left behind one of our daughters dresses and her favourite necklace. I phoned the hotel upon our arrival back in Australia and was advised there was no sign of them. We had left a nice tip behind for the cleaners so this disappointed me more. I know that it was our fault leaving it behind but I would like to think that I could have paid for the postage for the return of my goods. Please be careful of your personal belongings here. A disappointing end to a great holiday.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Upgraded Ohana West Waikiki is an okay hotel. We were upgraded from a standard room to a mini suite after iI plopped my Trip Advisor backpack down on the checkin counter.The room was large, with a 'fridge, coffeemaker, 2 burner stove top and microwave oven. The beds were terribly lumpy and uncomfortable.The bathroom was small, but the shower was great, with great water pressure.The view was on a side street, where many Japanese tourists congreated well into the wee hours, past 3 am. There was drug dealing, public drinking, 'ladies of the evening', public urination. The tourists made so much noise, we had a hard time sleeping on our third floor perch.Chili's restaurant is on the first floor. the parking garage is very tight parking! Food Pantry is nearby.the pool area was small and lots of little children, with lots of locals staying there.I woulndt stay there again.it cost $92 a night including tax. parking was $13 a night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Noisy This hotel must have the thinest walls. We were constantly woken up 2 or 3 times a night by people just walking by our room, sirens or the TV next door.It is looking very shabby. When we arrived the room was a little small so I asked if we could upgrade. The staff were very nice and told me we were in an upgraded room we thought about changing hotels but I had paid up front. The location was okay, quite busy at that end .We found the fridge toaster and microwave were handy and there was a grocery store right opposite so mostly we could have breakfast at the hotel.The elevators took forever and were often out of order. We were on the 14th floor so that was a bit of a nuisance if you were going up.If you stay there try and get a room on the higher floors these are apparently the upgrade rooms.I wouldn't stay here again it was too noisy and needs some TLC. I think to get a good hotel in Oahu you really have to pay the big bucks.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Clean hotel, Good value We stayed at the Ohana Waikiki West Hotel from Nov 25 to Dec 4, 2003. Positives - very good value for the money, regular size grocery store next door (much bigger than a typical ABC store), $2 one way Ala Moana Trolly Pink line stops right outside the door, very friendly and helpful staff. City Bus stops near by. Chili's, Starbucks, and Internet Cafes a very short walk away. Clean rooms. Location - yes, it's a short walk to the beach, but the hotel area still has a very touristy feel to it. Negatives - They were repairing the pool bar, so it was kind of noisy, but it should be done by now. Also, the elevators were a little bit slow. Suggestion - If you are a sound sleeper, ask for a room near the elevator shaft when you check in. There was a constant low pitched rumbling, but if you don't mind that, you can probably get a very large room, with a good sized fridge, minus a balcony, for the price of a regular sized room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">LOCATION AND VALUE AT OHANA WEST We had a10 day stay at this hotel and found it great value for the money.The rooms are of a decent size and you are really in the centre of all the action. The rooms are a little dated,but still pleasant.They were all very clean and serviced well.The walk to the beach is only a couple of blocks flat walk. There are heaps of cheap eaing and classy eating areas near by. We looked at some motels on the beach street and they were similar standard and three times as expensive. The pool area is lovely and the surrounding bar area a really nice place to have a drink or light meal -great coctails with a good happy hour.It is a little too noisy at times. We felt very safe and well looked after. The staff were friendly and helpful.Directly over the road was a restaurant which served huge breakfast for about 2.90 American. Over the road is the international market where Fatty's Kitchen had the nicest Chinese food for about 5.00 American.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Budget accommodations This was a very low budget hotel. Overall it was ok. Our view was of a building next door, that was very disappointing. We didn't have any problems with the elevator and there wasn't a lot of noise. I brought my simulated sound machine just in case. We used it a few of the nights due to this horrible grinding noise in the wall. Not sure what it was. Our room was small, but liveable. The shower was ok, not too small. We did have mold in the bathroom along the ceiling and corners. I know we weren't one of the lucky ones to get a redecorated room. The service was excellent! Everyone was very nice. Expecially the maids. If you like city life, stay in Waikiki, if not, go to another island. They don't charge 2.00 a day for the coffee anymore. And parking is 15.00 per day, but this is lower than some of the other hotels. We found parking to be just fine. We had a car for 7 of our 10 days (with repeated extensions). I highly reccommend renting a car. It is sooo worth it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The worst hotel ever!!!!! This hotel was the worst hotel I have ever visited. First off, the rooms were the size of a cracker jack box, EVERYTHING in these rooms were outdated especially the most important bathroom. The sink looks to have never been replaced and to make it worse the shower was dirty and dark.The restroom door had to open going outwards because it was so small had it went the other way you would have damaged the toilet. In my room we shared a balcony with other people which would not have been so bad but there was no seperation which left no privacy to my fiance and I. To make matters worse the air conditioner was supposedly on high but was barely able to cool down our minature room. The next morning we woke up at 6 am to get the hell out of there. We then went to the Ohana Islander where the hotel was what a hotel should be. If you never plan to sleep or shower in your room this may be the place for you but if cleanliness is a factor you should definitely look somewhere else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I think the reviews are different because... I've read the other reviews, and I've come to the conclusion that your satisfaction may depend on what room you get. We stayed for a week at the end of November on the 14th floor and could not have been happier with the hotel at such a reasonable price. Our room was very clean, the shower was big, the water pressure strong with plenty of hot water. Our kitchenette had a microwave, sink, stove, fridge, toaster, dish towels, silverware and plates, bowls, glasses and cups. The Ohana Waikiki West is about 1 1/2 blocks from the beach, very near the International Market Place, shops, a million places to eat, a grocery store, and adjacent to all public transportation. We loaded up at the grocery store and saved a lot of money by eating meals in our room. If you want to be waited on hand and foot and feel pampered in luxury, this isn't the place for you. However, if you want a nice place that's close to everything you came to see, it's perfect. I'll be back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, great price, but noisy We just spent the past week in this hotel. This hotel has very good location and is accessible to most of things. We booked a regular room w/o view nor kitchenette since we were out running around anyway, so it worked out great for us. We rent a car, and the current running price is $13 per day for parking, but do note that the parking space is very compact.Pros:- Great location- Great Price- A/C is excellent- Best water pump :-) We were at 10th floor, and the water came out so strong from the shower head I was astonished.- Free beach/pool towel checkoutCons:- Noisy: you could literally hear the folks talking in the room next to yours.- Kitchenette: When others cook, the whole section smells.- RoomService: They don't change the bed (but do make)Others (Neutral):- Pool: We observed the pool area was busy, but why do I need pool when we have so many beaches?- Elevator: Surely slow but it will come ... ok so far- Cleanliness: Average at best- Room size: Kind small but adeqaute</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ohana Waikiki West - Great location and not that bad! I Stayed The First week of June for 6 Nights, The room I was given was on 15th Floor, It was a King Bed and was Clean and Tidy. I had a fridge and Safe in the room.I have stayed here before as i found the loctaion Great. its close to most places in Waikiki, I had Previously stayed at Outrigger/ Ohana Malie Sky Court and found them of a good standard of accomatdation.I have read previous reviews and found none of the problems that the reviewers had posted, Yes the hotel may be dated but I didnt pay to stay at the Hilton. If I did sure I would expect more.The lifts could be faster. When I was there they had started to Paint the outside and they replaced the signage.The Hotel includes free local calls and free long distance in USA , this made it easy to book things etc and has Free Wifi in the lobbyAll in all its a good hotel near food and shopping, The bus stops closeby and the Waikiki Pink line Shuttle stops right outside and is included in the hotel rate , great to to Sears / Wallmart/ Ross Dress for less.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Enjoyed my trip thanks to hotel staff Stayed at this hotel Oct 2004. Original room was on 5th floor facing Kuhio which was very noisy with the bar right below and I could hear music from the room next to me. Spoke to reception and although they were booked up, managed to find me a room on the 16th floor facing the mountain side. The front desk staff were very accomodating. The new room was very quiet (couldn't hear anything from adjoining rooms), although smaller - but the view was still beautiful. The room had a King bed with 2 nightstands and one blocked half of the closet. Didn't bother me as I was alone, but might be annoying for 2 people. There is a Food Pantry and a bus stop within steps of the hotel, which was handy. The room renovations appeared to have been completed when I was there, at least my room was but they were starting improvements to the outside of the building - but I didn't notice anything negatively as a result. Housekeeping was great while I was there.I was looking for an affordable, clean, quiet hotel and I happily ended up with exactly that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Value, Great Location, Great Pool Deck and Bar! Stayed at the Ohana West from March 16 - 30, 2005. (Rm. 660) I was a little leery due to some of the negatives on this site, but I would definately stay there again! I would recommend paying the small extra for a kitchenette room, as some friends that we were traveling with just had a standard room and it was a little small. Housekeeping service was great, hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, and we really enjoyed the pool deck and bar area! You couldn't ask for a better location in Waikiki, right across the street from the International Market Place and just a few minute walk to the beach. The only negative that I could come up with about this hotel is the elevator service - sometime had to wait a little long for an elevator. But, if you're going to let a little thing like that ruin your vacation, stay home! Overall a great place to stay.P.S.There is a Chili's Restaurant attached to this Hotel - do NOT waste your money eating there. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried it twice, both times terrible service and food!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">No problems at all Two males travelling from Sydney to Las Vegas, via Hawaii. Our airline choice resulted in a two day/ one night stopover in hawaii and we booked into the Ohana WW, via BookIt.Hotel is clean and presentable. Check-in was fairly inflexible, we had to wait until around 3pm, but hey that's what they tell you first up. Our room was at the rear of the hotel, overlooking the car park. As the room faced away from the street it was pretty quiet and in the shade. The room was clean, the two beds roomy and the bathroom spotless. No complaints whatsoever. The location of the hotel probably couldn't be beaten in terms of centrality for Waikiki and its shopping, beaches and food  drink options.The pool was great, especially after the long flight and the bar staff at the poolside bar we're extremely helpful and friendly. Check out was speedy and the bell hops were great in helping arrange cheap transport to the airport for our connecting flight. Which made a change from the $40 cab ride to the hotel.All in all, we were very happy with the hotel considering its pricing. I'd stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Give it a chance This was the second time we stayed at this hotel. Upon arrival this time, we were put into a kitchenette (an upgrade), but it was dark and depressing. We went to the front desk and were told nothing was available, but to check back the next morning. We did check back, and they worked very hard and got us a great room (city view on the 11th floor) for a little extra charge each night. It was worth every penny we spent for the upgrade. The maid service was excellent and she was as honest and friendly as could be. It seemed that she would be sure and get in there to clean the minute we stepped out. The hotel is conveniently located so that you can walk or take a bus to just about anywhere you want to go. I only wish we would have walked towards town a little sooner, because there were lots of other places to eat and see that direction (both on the main streets and the beach). As everyone has stated, the elevators are slow, but be patient. The stairs are always an option. All in all, if you want a great value and a clean place to stay, this is it. I would not hesitate to stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not What It Used To Be It's been 13yrs since we last stayed here. On that trip, we thought the hotel (then known as the Outrigger West) was a little outdated. Clearly, they've done nothing to update this hotel in that time.Let me start by saying that the hotel is still great value. You get a place to hang your hat in the middle of busy Waikiki so that you can go exploring during the day. The location is close to shopping and dining amenities. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful.As for what we didn't like, the building is old, old, old. Carpet and walls are dirty and you don't really want to walk around your room in your bare feet. There is a country bar in the front of the foyer and you are made to run the gauntlet of drunks, stoners, hookers and criminal types ALL HOURS of the day. Not cool.Finally, the hotel was infested with OLD people. Our poolside visit felt more like a trip to a seniors home....a seniors home of drunks.If you want a cheap place to stay in Waikiki and plan on getting no enjoyment from your hotel, then stay here. Otherwise, spend a bit more money and go somewhere closer to the beach</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good for price This is a good family hotel for the price. Don't get your expectations too high, but for the room rate it's a good value, clean and relatively up-to-date furnishings.From the Property it鈥檚 a moderate 12 minute walk to Waikiki beach by cutting through the rear entrance of the International Market Place across the street from the Hotel. A drug store and general store are next to the Hotel which is convenient if you want to purchase some light snacks for your room to save on eating out. There's also a Chilli鈥檚 restaurant in the Hotel which has great food (but a bit pricy if you have a family). The outdoor pool deck at the hotel is nice with a bar and big screen TV. In the Hotel lobby there's a concierge desk, plus a travel kiosk where you can book activities such as tours, etc - the staff seem very knowledgeable about various attractions.The only caution is that the washrooms tend to be small with no tubs and a tiny shower. Plus, there's no hot tub or gym at the property and there are no good views of the ocean and Diamond Head. If you don鈥檛 plan on hanging out in your room much, this is a good Hotel for the price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic! I stayed at the Ohana Waikiki West for 9 nights in November, 2006. It was my first trip to Hawaii, and I was extremely happy with the hotel. In particular, it is in a great location - across the road from the International Market Place and Denny's Restaurant, where I found good food at reasonable prices; and only 2 short blocks from beautiful Waikiki Beach. My room was a kitchenette, but next time I'd just go for a standard room as I found it was so cheap to eat out, I did not use the kitchen facilities in the room. There was also a grocery store across the road, which was a little expensive but handy.As others have noted here, the lifts are a little slow, but hey - when you're on a holiday, who cares? I was happy with the hotel staff. When I initially checked in, I had asked for a non-smoking room but the room I was given had a strong smell of smoke; and it was also a little noisy (street noise). I asked for another room, and was promptly moved to a much better room which still had great city views but was quiet.All-in-all, I had an absolutely wonderful holiday and I would definitely stay at the Ohana Waikiki West again. God bless!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Warning for Techies 1) Must have called and verified access to internet with wireless in rooms 3 times before reserving rooms here. Regardless, no internet access in rooms. Big negative for me since I was counting on planning day trips etc. Alternative is to spend valuable time away from family in hotel lobby connected to their wireless router. 1a) Actually attempted to use Skywave in room since signal strength on their routers was strong. Skywave is a paid wireless service. Wasted about 3 hours trying to remain connected to Skywaves fluctuating performance and signals. At most times, it took 10 minutes just to be timed out while finishing the linking process which allows access to the internet.2) I have many devices which require charging during the night. Learned the hard way that most of the 110V recepticles in the room are so used they don't have any gripping capability (their loose) and thus what you thought was getting power to recharge disconnected during the night. Very frustrating since I was counting on having this equipment charged for the next day.3) Air conditioning in room was not nearly cool enough. Was counting on getting some good rest, but really, just too warm in room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Value for the Money Just returned from our 2nd visit to Waikiki West  enjoyed this trip as much as last year. Since we both smoke we were given an unrenovated room (with kitchenette) on the 1st floor by the pool, which was great as I use a wheelchair  didn't have to always wait for a mostly empty elevator. Speaking of the elevators, we had a good time going to different floors as many people didn't know how to use their room card correctly to hit the right floor. We heard very little grumbling about the mixups  mostly people treated it as an adventure. The staff was great - everything we asked for we received in record time. We tipped housekeeping every day  a thank you note was left for us. Our room was large enough to accommodate the wheelchair; it was very clean - no bugs; any dishes left in the sink were washed for us; bell staff were more than kind  helpful. As others have stated, the WW is right on the bus line, a short walk to the beach  right across from The Pantry, which has everything anyone could need for their stay. A word of warning, if you eat at Chili's, dress warmly as the temperature is somewhere around freezing, but the food is worth it. Can't wait to return next year! Aloha!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Budget Dream Stayed there for all of many trips. Thanks to the Entertainment book received $55 rate (it's been a few years) for a kitchenette. We always lucked into the same room which gave a great view of Diamond Head as well as the Ali Wai Canal. With the Food Pantry across the street and the International Marketplace a few doors down, it was the perfect location. Although it's not the Ritz, it's a great place at a great price with laundry facilities, nice pool area, and a fabulous view of the ocean from the 7th (or 14th) floor balcony. More expensive hotels don't even offer that. However, the best was their hospitality room where you can check out by 12:00, go to the beach, etc, then shower before heading to the airport.After travelling to many countries as well as throughout the islands, I would never go back to Honolulu and NOT stay at this hotel.As for the slow responsiveness- please remember that like the Caribbean, this IS an island where the attitude is laid back. To circumvent high blood pressure, simply go straight to management.One plus: staying at the West gives you privileges to Surf right on the beach. What a deal!Those who want luxury on a budget need to reconsider what budget means to them.</p></li>

After much complaint by us both, the receptionist was less than helpful referring us to the day staff later that morning. In fact, I have to say that 50% of the staff were like minded.We then presented ourselves to the Manager during business hours and were given the room we requested although I have to say that we fronted the main thoroughfare which was noisy with traffic and people alike along with the odours of the restaurant kitchen below eminating skywards.The hotel itself is in need of an urgent renovation both for its extremely slow lifts, tatty looking rooms with wardrobe doors running off the track, toilets not flushing correctly and taps barely running water, let alone draining quickly.Room telephones wouldn't access our Australian telephone cards to ring home (although I have never had this difficulty anywhere else in the States) and in fact the local Hawaiian card too proved useless, but could be used at public (pay) phones.All in all, I could not recommend this hotel unless you are, as they say, a backpacker.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I would give this hotel a pass We just arrived home having stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. Using Hotwire, I got this hotel for $82 a night which is a very good deal for the location. The hotel is not as nice as the pictures on the website. It is a little shabby and worn, the pool was closed for repairs and there are no laundry facilities. Our room was a decent size, freshly painted and with new carpeting. The bedding was old and the bathroom was shabby with a cracked and dark shower stall. The location is good but some of the other Ohana hotels appeared to be brighter and better maintained. Despite having received a very good price for this hotel, I would not stay there again. I would spend more money for a nicer place. I know many say they do not go on vacation to stay in the hotel, however, heavy rains in Honolulu for most of our stay as well as wanting to feel comfortable to be barefoot in the shower or to sit on the bedspread are worth spending more money. This is not a bad hotel but it is not an enjoyable one either. We were rarely able to get an elevator and always took the stairs. Checkin took close to 45 minutes and we often waited 15-20 minutes for the bellman to reappear at his desk. I would pass on this hotel and stay somewhere a little nicer.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ohana Waikiki west, just OK We stayed at the Ohana Waikiki West at the end of July and it it is really just a 2 stars. Everything is very basic (the lobby, the service etc..). The elevators are very weird. They are not only extremely slow but sometimes you can go up an down for a while whithout stopping (quite scarry). The hotel is very crowded. We arrived on Friday night and there was a lot of drunk people and noisy young guys in the lobby and the elevator. As a lot of people mentioned, it is noisy. I would not recommend this hotel for people who want a quiet place. You have to choose between the noise of the street and the noise of the huge ventilation on the top of the buildings. We stayed on the 16th and had the noise of the ventilation. On top of that, we were woken up in the middle of the night by babies crying in the adjacent room (they must have been at least 5 in that room). My mother stayed on the 8th floor and it was quiet but her balcony faced a wall of brick.A good point: the free shuttle to Ala Moana is very convenient.I love Hawaii and I would like to go back but I will not return to this hotel. There are so many hotels in the same area that offers a better quality. For example the Miramar across the street is better and just slightly more expensive.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Patio bar We are a family with two kids 6and 9 the pool was great for them.The bar is close to the pool(open till 8pm) which we thought was great as well. Have a drink play darts or pool and watch the kids swim. Also had a big screen t.v.The elevator was fine once you figured out how the card worked, pretty crowded most of the time but hey, it was only a few minutes ride. Service was good, no complaints, housekeeping super nice, make sure you leave the tip on the bed. Speaking of the bed, I felt very itchy and thought maybe there were bed bugs but after researching realized it was the detergent they used I was allergic too. No BUGS were seen anywhere. Could use new bedspeads for sure.Easy walking distance to everything, kids loved the Fun factory(arcade) across the street.Bad side well pretty noisy on the pool deck they just need to crank the music a bit more. No one bothered us, noise sleeping was NIL and the patio door blocks out most noise. It is in a busy part of Oahu.The airconditioner was very quiet and Low was perfect for us. Over all I would say the decor was the only thing lacking and they could charge more if they up dated it, but hey, who cares your only there for a week or so.Great for people on a budget!!!any questions email me Mistressdee444@msn.com</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good deal hotel The Ohana West is a decent hotel close to Waikiki and all the tourists sites. The staff is friendly and the hotel is clean. Nice sized decks, right across the street from a grocery store. I've stayed there twice now and had good experiences both times. However, the main downfall for this hotel is the major lack of parking. If you are driving a lot and going in and out on Friday/Saturday nights in a car and expect to have a spot in the hotel parking lot when you get back -- good luck. Its extremely tight parking and there aren't many spots. But, most of the time you can just get the attendants to valet your car, especially if you tell them you don't feel like driving to the three sister hotels around the corner to look for a spot. Just beware that getting in and out on the busy nights can be annoying. Also, on the last day of our trip, the valet actually lost our car key, and we had to have the rental company drive a new one to us. Kinda annoying, but didn't ruin the trip at all.Overall, the rooms are large, comfortable and clean, but this is not a 5-star place. Anyway, when you are going to Hawaii, you really shouldn't be spending much time in your room in the first place!!! Either way, I'd deal with the crappy parking for the great rates and ideal location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Got my money's worth.. Hotel is in a prime location, just in back of the International marketplace. Lots of things to do and dining places within walking distance.Lobby of the hotel is decent. A bit dated in decor but it did have several seating areas. Front Desk service was pleasant and check-in was extremely quick.The hotel has only 3 elevators which require you to use your card key to access. They were over crowded and we found ourself constantly having to hike up 8 flights because they were terribly slow and always packed.Rooms are spacious and clean. We had a kitchette with a sink, mini fridge, a 2 burner stove and cookware/dinnerware. Bathrooms were a bit odd. We were puzzled why we had a handicap shower (shower curtain with a handicap chair and a drain on the bottom) instead of a tub. Seems that there are only a few tubs avaialble and you need to reserve them in advance. The drainage wasn't that great on the shower and we ended up with water all over the floor on more than one occassion.Parking garage is very VERY tiny. Valet parking after the self park is full is the best option or you'll spend a good chunk of time trying to get your car in and out.I don't believe that they had room service since we couldn't find a menu for it. Hotel did have pay movies  games availabe. It was a decent place for the money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Aloha- its got all of the basics and a great location! Ohana Waikiki West is in a great location. Centrally located on Kuhio Avenue, one can easily walk to shops, restaurants and of course the beach. The beach is only about 3-4 minutes by foot from the hotel and a nice little walk at that.Rooms are large and clean, with simple amenities. You can get kitchens if you want, which would be great for families. Views are limited, and since the building is built in an L shape, you get different views, depending on how high up you are: water, mountains, street, or other buildings.Staff are friendly and get things done efficiently. Right across the street is the Food Pantry, which is a supermarket with everything you need, including souveniers.There is a safe in the room, mini-fridge and other basics. Balconies are nice and big, great for relaxing on. There is a tiny weight room, and a large pool...but who wants to go to the pool in Hawaii??? They also have a shuttle which will take you to several points in the Waikiki area for free, you just need to show your room card. There is also parking at the hotel, but this tends to be on the expensive side, just as most other hotels are expensive for this.Again, great location for a basic room. If you are going to be in your room most of the time, I would not recommend this. But if you are there for the sun, surf and sights, then this is a good place to be. Enjoy!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location We stayed at this hotel for five nights in April. When we arrived at the hotel and saw our room with a view of the parking lot and surrounding buildings, we were quite disappointed. However, after realizing that we were only there to sleep and probably wouldn't even be opening the drapes, we decided that this was O.K. The room is large and clean with a king sized bed, large closet, and a fridge. There is only a stand-up shower, no tub, and it took a bit of work to shower properly. I had read previous reviews which indicated that the hotel was noisy. Well, we must have lucked-out as we had a very quiet room on the seventh floor and heard very little noise. The staff was friendly and were willing to help with directions or information whenever needed. The activities desk staff were very helpful and friendly as well. The hotel is centrally located and is within walking distance of most things such as a grocery store, restaurants, a pharmacy, the International Market Place, and just minutes from the beach. The public transit buses stop in front of the hotel or just across the street and will take you just about anywhere for a couple of dollars. We are budget concious people and don't mind walking a few minutes to save money on a hotel room that we are only in for a few hours of sleep time. I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again. By the way, I am bug phobic and we did not see a single one here.</p></li>

Hearing the guest next door especially there baby who cried during the night and mum and dad shouting at each other, then having to listening to making up!!!!!! We also were able to smell the breakfast they were cooking. View of the trash bins from the bird poo balcony. Not very clean, coffee dribbles down the furniture that hadn't been wiped, although I must say the staff were very nice. Didn't eat in Chillis it was always busy. Only once did we go to the pool bar in the evening, we are still waiting to be served, the ONLY barmaid spent at least 10 mins talking to a friend while we stood waiting for her to serve us, we ended up walking away and she still continued chatting to her mate. The lifts - ah yes they ARE very slow totally inadequate for that size of hotel. We did book trips at the Outrigger desk, visting Pearl Harbour and the Punchbowl. However the trip on the Star of Honolulu was very average as far as the food was concerned, not very good value for money.Honolulu itself did not live up to our expectations of a relaxing palm beach holiday. We couldn't find a spare area of sand to lie on it was packed and a bit too cosy for my liking. \Honolulu sound idylic but unfortuantely it is not. No we won't be back. Although I have to say the people were very nice and friendly and the food at La Cucaracha was excellent.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic hotel in the heart of Waikiki We had a wonderful 9 nights at this hotel. We turned up at the reception desk at the Ohana Waikiki West after walking out of the hotel I had initially booked over the internet (which turned out to be a total disaster). The reception staff at the Waikiki West were friendly and welcoming and immediately checked us into a lovely room with a view of Diamond Head, even though it was only about 9.30am and check-in time isn't usually until around 3pm. We had a large, comfortable, spotlessly clean room with a kitchenette, and as part of the accommodation deal ($139/night) we were given $15 vouchers to use every day at the Food Pantry supermarket next door. Even better than that, we were given all our vouchers on the first day so were able to do quite a big shop and stock up on our groceries for the week. We were also able to use our room keycard for free trips on the Pink Trolley that services Waikiki and Ala Moana shopping centre. All the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful, including the room attendants and reception staff. All the other guests I spoke to in the lift seemed to be very happy to be there as well, and I didn't hear one complaint about the hotel from another guest for our entire stay. The location of the hotel is great, only a five minute walk to the beach through the International Market Place. I will definately stay at this hotel again and will recommend it to friends.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spring Break Waikiki We stayed at this hotel because it was recommended from a friends friend.Check in was fine however, we requested a room above the 7th floor three months before arriving.When we arrived we where told Your room is on the mezzazine level and no other rooms are available.Well we tried the room on the mezzazine level but found it too noisy late at night and from approx. 500am and onwards as you can hear the delivery people shouting instructions to each other.After two days ,we went back to the Front desk looking for a solution to this unacceptable living condition.We stated our concerns and where able to transfer to the fifth floor same side of the building and conditions improved right away.No noise from receiving area and street noise was barely audible.Room was cleaner except for windows facing out,probably had not be cleaned in months(inside or out).Had to purchase some window cleaner to clean myself as room attendants where not concerned.Elevators slow,using stairs gave us some excercise every day.Central location close to International Market Place,one block from main shopping area and block and a half from the beach.If you want to park overnight its $18. per night(ouch)because overnight parking is very limited in the area.Pink trolley very handy to get to Ala Moana Shopping Centre(free with your room pass)stops in front of hotel every 10 mins.Weather was beautiful in March and would like to return again but maybe a different hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Really Not That Bad I read the reviews AFTER I booked my stay and was really worried. To tell you the truth, the place was not that bad. The elevators were slow and the middle one kept stopping on 9 even when you didn't press it, but they were secured which means you had to use your hotel key to go up to a floor. Our room was clean and the maid service was great! The beds were made every day, new towels for the bathroom when requested, new towels for the kitchenette, and they even cleaned our dishes in the sink!! The hotel is a short walk from the beach and close to some good places to eat. The pool area looked clean, but we spent most of our time at the beach. The pool bar was really nice in the evening and they even had someone singing on Saturday night. The activities desk was knowledgeable and the bellhop stored our luggage for us in a secure room so we could spend our day exploring instead of at the airport waiting hours for our flight. There was even a courtesy room that we took advantage of before we went to the airport (you can take a shower, have a nap, make some coffee). But you only have 45 mins to use the room, which is still great!! Some other great points:1. The room had free internet service2. The lobby had free wireless service3. You could call anywhere for 15 mins and it was free (you could even hang up and dial the same number again!)If you're looking for a place to lay your head and not have to pay through the nose, then this hotel is a good place for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Clean it is not! My husband and I stayed at the Ohana Waikiki West over the Christmas holidays 2004-2005. We chose the hotel because of the many good reviews on TripAdvisor, particularly comments about the cleanliness of the hotel. To say we were disappointed is simply an understatement. The first thing we did upon arrival was go to the store to buy cleaning supplies to clean the kitchenette and bathroom. The toilet was especially disgusting. I don't think the toilet bowl had been cleaned in many weeks. The daily maid's idea of cleaning the room was making (not changing) the bed, and barely wiping down the counters. On our 6th day there (of our 12 day stay) construction began on the exterior of the building. From 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. we were forced to tolerate extremely loud drilling and vibrating noise as the concrete on the outside of the building was drilled away. This was not my idea of a relaxing vacation! The pool area was also under construction, parts of which were unavailable much of the time. As well, we didn't find the staff to be very friendly or helpful. The bellman's idea of calling us a cab was to stand on the street and wait for one to come along. We could do that ourselves. We did appreciate the honeymooners upgrade we received to an ocean-view room. The only reason we stayed was because of the economical rate, however it is true what they say, you get what you pay for. Needless to say, upon checking out on our final day, the staff did not even ask us how our stay was. I would never return to this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very pleasantly surprised! I have been reading these reviews for a while prior to my Hawaii trip that just concluded. I knew they were mixed but this place seemed to have the better reviews.Just returned from a trip to Oahu and the Big Island. I stayed a total of six nights at the Ohana West. The place was really nice!! A definite upgrade from Ohana Reef towers which was the dump I stayed at before. My first three nights I stayed in a city view Kitchenette facing Kuhio street. They actually upgraded me at no charge since I could not get a non-smoking room. The room was nicely re-done with new bathroom fixtures, paint and trim. I didn't smell any smoke. Nice big shower and bath! The room was facing the street but I couldn't hear any noise with the door closed. The pool was really cool! It's on the second floor with a pool deck facing the street. Nice bar there that is always busy. Some young girls run the bar and it's usually busy. I came back and stayed three more nights in the same type of room but in the back of the hotel this time. It was also nice and newly renovated with a bigger bathroom.My stay was very good. You'd think this is a four star hotel. Only problems were the front desk computer going down once delaying my check in and the airport van was late arriving at the hotel but that was due to the incompetent van driver. Elevators weren't a problem for me. There is three or four of them and they only slow down during peak hours. I was on the fourth then third floor so I mostly took the stairs.I'd definitely stay here again.</p></li>

I booked and paid for two rooms at the Ohana Malia in March 2006, 7 months ahead of our requirement(Nov 2006). One room was for my daughter and her family, the other was for my wife and I, from South Australia. Longstanding friends from Alberta, Canada, also booked a room in the Malia, requesting to be placed near us, in the other two rooms. When my daughter and her family arrived, they were moved to the Ohana West, no explanation. We arrived on our due date, were picked up by my daughter and taken to the Ohana West and were informed when I asked we have upgraded you. They could not locate our friends from Alberta, arriving later that night. No explanation, just we know best. We eventually found out our friends were at the Malia and they did bring them down and put them in a room two doors down from our two rooms. But wait, there is more. On the second night, we put our gandchildren to bed (Girl 9, boy 6) bed, also reporting a noise in the airconditiong, but with two seperate instructions, Dont come till morning. You guessed it, room invaded, two very upset kids. The place is a nice lucky dip. The Ohana West allow glass bottles by the pool , alcohol affected adults to throw, with gusto, balls in the pool when children are present. My daughter removed a glass topped table, used as a step, from the pool one morning. There was little point telling any one, they do not listen. As at 18th Dec 2006, I have not had the courtesy of a response or an explantion of why we were bumped, despite paying well ahead.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location is wonderful but staff and room is NOT Upon arrival, we had an argument-unecessarily from staff re: Additional charges for room. When we went to our room it was horrible, and not acceptable. I wish I saved the photos of the room, but during the tours I deleted them to give more room in my camera memory. The room was not what we reserved, after still in a grumpy staff, he gave us the King size with the TUB, mind you we had a toddler with us and he does not like the showers. Yes, the bed was hard and lumpy.. but being so tired every night from touring and attending nightshows.. I was too tired to care.When we went down to ask what we have in our package, we were told You have airline rate, so nothing. You get nothing and swipe his hands together. On departure day, we asked to store our bags until we leave for the airport, the staff there kept telling one another to put it in the storage. There were three of them just standing around talking amongst each other, and none of them moved. I even volunteered to take the bags myself to the storage. After a minute or two, finally one moved. I offered to help him.With their awful assistance, I figured it was due to being an Airline Employee. SO, next time, I will ask before booking another reservation with another HOTEL. We will not be going back to them again. THe room was horrible, even when I started to wash the dishes and cleaned around the stove I notice I picked up old grime and dust. Very distasteful room. Also, the bathroom...but I kind of excuse the rust and mildew to the weather climate...The housekeeper in general was good, she cleaned around our belongings, even when we left money laying around and electronic devices, food and such.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice place to stay Enjoyed a ten night stay here in early .November. We were not sure what to expect after reading good to bad reports about this hotel. On the whole we were very happy with this accommodation. With respect to Ohana, you must keep in mind if you want Hilton service then stay at The Hilton.Bad stuff first which there isn鈥檛 a great deal of to be honest.Elevators they can be slow which means a wait sometimes and because of this at the wrong time they can be crowded. This was the worst thing we found so as long as you don鈥檛 let that get to you you should be fine. We had a queen size bed room on the tenth floor which was spacious and clean, the maids were friendly and took care of the room well. There was a small refrigerator in the room and coffee making facilities in our room although self catering rooms are available. The bathroom was small but clean and tidy. TV was a fair size and there are three in house channels telling you all about the island and suggestions on where to go and what to see.You can book most trips from the desk in the lobby. Staff are ok and do answer your questions but some are friendlier then others which is the same most places.You can get Hot Dogs etc at the pool area which is small but nice enough.You can get a nice breakfast lunch and dinner from Perry Smorgy鈥檚 Buffet which is a 3 minute walk when you turn left out of the hotel. Even if you don鈥檛 eat a lot it is sometimes cheaper then getting a small meal. There are plenty of other places to eat too. Location is good Waikiki Beach is a short walk away but we preferred getting the bus to Ala Moana Beach as this is less crowded. Buses are very good and cheaper the the trolleys. We would stay here again if we went back to Hawaii.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice Hotel-Nice Price I just returned from the Ohana Waikiki West yesterday, staying there from 4/13/04 thru 4/20/04. Wonderful stay! While my king room on the 16th floor was not one that had been refurbished yet, it was still clean and comfortable. (All rooms are to be refurbished by late August 04). The large lanai was very relaxing and I could see part of the ocean, even though there were several buildings between the beach and the hotel. The room had a large refrigerator, coffee maker, and toaster. I was told that microwaves are going to be added during the renovation. (There is a $2 charge to use the coffee that is in the room). There is a separate dressing area with sink and closet that is located outside of the bathroom, which included tub and shower. Maid service was great! (I had Tracy-very hospitable!) The pool, pool deck and bar, all located on the 1st floor, are excellent!!! The bartenders are fun and friendly to everyone. Great drink prices and happy hour daily. Live music, pool table, dart boards-all on the pool deck. Nice tables with umbrellas and someone cooking burgers and dogs at the BBQ grill on weekends. We had more fun hanging out at the hotel than at some of the other pubs that we went to! There is a country bar located in the basement of the hotel, but we did not have the chance to check it out. The hotel is in a great location, on the bus and trolly route, had a grocery store across the street and a pharmacy next door. I did not experience the delays with the elevator that some others on this site talked about. Also, while it's true that some of the rooms are used as a dormitory for a local college, I didn't notice many students around the pool or any excessive noise. In conclusion, I would definitely stay here again. The price was right and I couldn't have had a nicer stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel for price  There were 6 adults and 1 15-year old in 2 units with a connecting door. 1 room had a kitchenette (2 electric ranges, a small fridge and a sink with plates, flatware  glasses for 4) and 2 double beds. The other room had 1 king size bed with a smaller fridge and plenty of room for a queen size air matress. Both rooms had a shower only and balconies (city view, nothing special). Did not have problems with noise between walls (even the connecting room) or above us or from the street. Smells from other rooms with kitchenettes were nonexistent, except for in the hallway when walking right by a room whose door was open. Housekeeping people are nice and clean every morning/afternoon, but really take their time in cleaning a room. Hotel does not provide beach towels and if you get pool towel, you pretty much have to sign your life away if something happens to the towel. Pool is decent size for being on the 3rd-4th floor and has a good amount of tanning chairs. As for the elevators and since we were on the 12th floor, we did not have trouble getting 1 of the 3 elevators on the way down, but as we went down, the elevator filled with people so by the 7th or 8th floor, it was full. On the way up was not a bad wait at all (1-3mins). Parking here is definitely a problem as their lot fills quickly and is $13/day. If you want to take The Bus, the stop is right there.Since the hotel is on Kuhio Avenue, there is plenty to do during the day and night. Restaurants, bars, and shops line Kuhio and is just a block down from the other main street. The hotel is across the street from the rear of International Market Place. For the price we paid ($104/night) and location wise, what more could you ask for? A short 6 minute walk cutting thru the Sheraton Moana Surfrider's lobby and your feet are on the sand.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay was okay This review is for our stay at the Ohana Waikiki West hotel. The hotel was easy to reach from the airport and convenient to the beach and shopping in Waikiki. Our suprise was to leave one city only to reach another. Waikiki is inundated with high rise hotels, traffic, and all of the other trappings of the big city. We made our choice to stay at this hotel based upon the recommendations and reviews we had read from this site and the claims from the hotel that they had recently completed renovations. The hotel was average and met our requirements for an overnight stay, however they had not completed renovations. The rooms and furnishing were old and not well kept though functional. They could have used a good basic cleaning. The air conditioner was caked with dust and debris, plus the fan rattled on high speed. The hotel had three elevators that seemed insufficient for the amount of foot traffic and guests. They were slow and small and always seemed to be on the higher floors, also when the hotel associates were using them they were unavailable for the guests. A lot of guests had bicycles and rode them throughout the day and it only took two guests with bicycles to tie up the elevators for extended periods of time. There was no onsite restaurant but this was no problem as there were several eateries close by. Parking was ten dollars a day and contrary to some reviews we had no problem parking our Volvo Stationwagon at the hotel. I would recommend this hotel if your intention is to go to the beach, shop, or take in the sites. If you want a more luxurious hotel or attention to detail then I would recommend that you stay somewhere else. If I were considering a honeymoon to Waikiki then I would not stay at the Ohana Waikiki West or any of the other similiarily priced hotels. This hotel suited our need for a no frills hotel for one night before catching our hop to Kauai.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Economical hotel I knew making reservations with this hotel that it was not a 4 or 5 star accomodation but the price and location were right. The front desk, housekeeping and maintenance staff were all pleasant and very professional. The shower stall had some mildew and musty odor which was resolved by the maids when I pointed it out to them. They changed the sheets every other day and vacuumed daily. (I found no evidence of bedbugs or any other type of vermin in the room). The pool was not heated and the air conditioning in the room worked sporatically, but we always had a nice breeze coming in thru the sliding glass doors. The street (Kuhio) in front of the hotel was quite noisy, especially at night after the bars closed, but such is the case in any major city in the USA. I inquired at several 4 and 5 star hotels about their rates and found the price I paid at this hotel to be about half their price. We had a kitchenette (refrigerator, microwave and 2 burner stove top) so we ate most meals in the room. ABC store, Foodland, Denny's and Chili's restaurants, as well as the backside of the International Marketplace were within a block or less. The beach was a quick 5-10 minute walk and the bus and trolley stopped right in front of the hotel. The hotel offered free trolley rides on the pink line and 15 minutes of free long distance to the mainland everyday. Two activity desks were in the lobby for excursions and they were honest about which excursions we could do cheaper on our own (by bus or taxi) and which ones would be better thru them. Most of the tourist sights provided free transportation or it was a $2 bus ride each way. Overall, I would stay at this hotel again even with the few minor inconveniences stated above. There were 3 of us in the room and our vacation in Honolulu cost us approx. $1300 each with airfare from the mainland, hotel charges and excursions (pretty cheap for Hawaii !!!! )</p></li>
