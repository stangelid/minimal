<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very good location for shopping, tourist attractions and transport links, be sure to get a room at the very top of the house as the rest are noisy (we had 4 rooms between our party all over the building). By Paris standards it is value for money, the rooms were a good size with decent bathrooms and were nice and clean. Breakfast is good but you can do as well in the cafe's locally for less money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my fourth time to stay at the Hotel Langlois. It is away from the hustle and bustle of touristy Paris, but so close that you are only a few blocks away from the Galleries Lafayette and the Opera and other shopping. They provide a variety of foods for breakfast and the staff is very accommodating. My favorite place to stay in Paris - other than an apartment - if I am there for a few days.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Have stayed here three times now and think it the best value hotel in Paris. Service is very good, room size is incredible in comparison with most hotels of this price in the city and I love the very clean but jaded art deco bathrooms which in some instances are actually bigger than bedrooms in other hotels I've stayed in. Great position especially for the Grand Magasins (Gallerie Lafayette a 5 minute walk).</p></li>

This hotel is a very pleasant place to rest your head at night after a long day of sightseeing. The room we stayed in was very large, with a fireplace and a bathroom half the size of the room itself. Staff was affable and helpful, and I loved the old elevator. I'm glad we found this place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I would rate this hotel as average at best for the price. The staff is very nice. The accomodations are clean, but a little below average. The neighborhood late at night is not terribly great. i paid for a suite. The rooms were very not at night, so we needed to open the windows, which made it loud. The beds for the third guest, my adult son, was a fold out chair not laong enough for anyone over six feet tall. There are better deals in Paris, this is not one of them.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the hotel for 3 nights at the end of February and had a great time. We had a room with a HUGE bathroom and lovely decor, it was on the third floor. The best part was waking up each morning about 5AM to the smell of fresh baked goods. The breakfast was really wonderful and worth the extra $$ as it is right there. We also found that since it was freezing when we were there, we could take a taxi or the metro back for a very reasonable price. We would stay there again!</p></li>

The reception desk is friendly, the bathroom is spotless and the room a gem. We had a room right under the roof with a gorgeous view. It is in a quiet side street, but 4 minutes and you were at a Metro stop and l'opera is close by. I was concerned since it was once featured in a movie that it would be too commercial but it isn't. I highly recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Now. This hotel is perfect. Really. Since there is no air condition in the rooms the hotel, by french standards, gets a maximum of two stars (one star?). The class is much higher though. I'm giving only 4 stars due to the fact that the hotel had accepted more reservations than they have rooms. We had to stay at Hotel Brittany the first night (out of four) and that was not a pleasant experience (avoid that hotel at any cost!).

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 7 days in Hotel Langlois (room 21)... Location is excellent, service was magnificent!!! Size of our room was OK, but the bathroom was small. Our friends stayed in room 22 - which was much larger with huge bathroom. Our room faced backyard - it was relatively quite (no noise from the street). But when somebody was walking in the room above/below our room - the floor sound like orchestra from Paris Opera. This is a VERY old hotel, which was not remodeled in ages. It is good hotel for the money you are spending, if noise is not an issue for you</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here as part of our honeymoon trip based on the reviews on trip advisor. What a great hotel. We had a wonderful room on the top floor with fantastic views of the Sacre Cour. Room was huge for a Paris city hotel, and the staff were most friendly. The location is excellent with all the major sites within comfortable walking distance. Good tip though, don't bother with breakfast as there is an excellent bakery right next door. We bought our food there and ate at our table in the room while looking over the rooftops of Paris. We will be returning!</p></li>

It is a beautiful little Paris Hotel that gives you a great Paris experience. We had the top floor family suite. It had two bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom. It had plenty of room for a family of four. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There is a great little bakery next door and cafes next to that. The metro is right around the corner that will take you anywhere in Paris. When I go back to Paris, this is the only hotel I will consider.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Lanlois and thoroughly enjoyed it. The price was very reasonable, at the time, and the hotel and our room were very clean. The bathroom was very nice, and the room was spacious enough. All European hotel rooms are rather small; but, our room did not make us feel claustrophobic. We also found the staff to be very friendly. The elevator is a very tight squeeze, if you have an overabundance and oversized luggage. You may have to make a couple of trips. I would not only reccommend this hotel; but, would also stay again and again on subsequent visits.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A great little hotel full of character close to Gare St Lazare and Grands Boulevards. One minutes' walk to the nearest metro station (Trinité) and bakeries, take-aways and cafés all a few doors' down from the hotel. I had a single room for 2 nights which was on the 6th and last floor (Room No. 64). It was spacious, clean and decorated with antique fixtures and furniture. I had a fantastic view of the Sacré Coeur church in Montmartre from the bedroom window. There was a faint smokey smell in the pillows, but apart from that, no complaints. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful.</p></li>

Located between two major rail stations and just steps from the metro, I can't imagine finding anything more satisfying. A very friendly and helpful staff, absolutely beautiful, clean and incredibly large rooms. Also beautiful elevator and staircases. Great breakfast (yes, extra cost, but well worth it) We have travelled a great deal in Europe and the Hotel Langlois is far, far above the norm. And at this price!! I would not hesitate to recommend it to friends and family and will certainly not bother to look elsewhere on our next trip to Paris. Absolutely tops!</p></li>

The staff were lovely and for 507 Euro we got a great room with a view onto Montmatre and breakfast every day. The location is superb with some great restaurants within walking distance including l'oenotheque at 20, rue st-lazare and others in the vicinity. Many of Paris's attractions are within walking distance and all others can be reached on the metro. This hotel seemed to have wireless internet access from the look of the computer downstairs although without having my laptop I couldn't check this properly.</p></li>

Note construction ongoing next door during Mon-Friday. Hotel is less than 10 minutes from Gare du Nord by taxi. Breakfast is a bit expensive - but you get fresh squeezed orange juice, soft-boil your own eggs, toast, cheese, olives, croissants, etc.. and they will provide room service. Wireless internet in rooms worked very well if you have your own laptop. Will continue to return.</p></li>

We paid about 100euro for each room which was excellent value. The rooms were spotless and perfectly sized (our friend's bathroom was huge!). Trinite metro was a mere 1 min walk away which was convenient for getting around. A taxi was less than 10 euro to the Lourve. We walked to the Moulin Rouge which was no more than 10mins away, with Montmarte a mere 20 min walk. We would all definitely stay there again as it was a terrific Parisian hotel and great value for money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose Langlois because we prefer hotels with character rather than chain establishments and it certainly didn't disappoint. We stayed in room 41, which was spacious and well furnished. The bathroom was huge with a beautiful art deco sink and bath. The location was also great - we walked to the Louvre in about 25 minutes and back from Montmatre in 20. Getting to the hotel was really easy from the airport, as there's a direct bus to Opera which is a 10 minute walk from the Langlois. I would certainly recommend this place for people who are looking to stay somewhere a little bit different in the centre of Paris.</p></li>

I wouldn't quite rave about the place as much as others but I'd still actively consider returning there. My room was quiet and clean if gloomy. Yes, a certain style. Some electrical problems but these were rectified. Good breakfast. Maddening old lift. My main criticism is that Langlois should get out of the late 20th century and have designated non-smoking rooms. I tried hiding the ashtray, I may do more drastic things on my next visit. I told them politely that they should get their act together here. They were polite but didn't seem responsive. Come on you francais!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a difficult review to write, because the hotel was excellent on almost every level--larger than average room and bathroom for the price, friendly and helpful clerks (with the exception of a dour one at nighttime), close proximity to the Trinite metro, and free Internet access. We didn't notice in their e-mail confirmation that the continental breakfast wasn't free (cost 9 euros), but that was our fault. As attractive as this hotel is on many levels, I wouldn't stay here again, for only one reason: the noisy clanging pipes at night, which became unbearable. If you don't get much sleep, it can be hard to sightsee the next day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent our first wedding anniversary at this great little hotel and would definitely recommend it. The location was perfect - 2 minutes from Metro station, but the hotel is so central, that we rarely used it and tended to walk everywhere. Our room was great (6th floor)and the hotel in general was very traditional and quirky. We loved it. Didn't have breakfast as there are loads of bakeries nearby, but plenty of people did, so it must have been good! The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel was kept beautifully clean. If you're after somewhere a bit different with plenty of Parisien charm and character, then this is a great hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a lovely old hotel in an interesting part of Paris. The reception staff were very friendly. A quaint old elevator takes you up to your room. The room themselves were decorated with antiques and the room we had a nice view over the rooftops of the district. We could see the pretty church (Trinitate if I remember correctly) and the Sacre Coeur. The area is nice with a couple of Brasseries and restaurants. The huge department stores are within walking distance. Cross the road and go up the hill to walk to Pigalle and Montmartre (not a long walk). There are some really nice cafés and restaurants on the way up. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hands down one of the largest rooms (and bathroom!!) I have ever seen in Paris, at a third of the price. Beautiful light from large windows which looked out into interior courtyard. Well located for public transportation (Metro, buses, Gare du Nord) and walking--straight up the hill to Montmartre in twenty minutes, or down to the Seine in 30. Responding to other reviews I would have to say that yes, the cleaning people were slightly aggressive, and there were some loud pipe noises, but nothing that took away from a generally excellent experience, or that would be unexpected in an older building. I managed to sleep very well in a comfortable bed. Great value!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent location just seconds from Metro (Trinite). Hotel down quiet street just off busy square. Lovely building. Very inviting reception. Traditional Parisian lift. We went for a standard double (on 5th floor) which was at the rear of the hotel so very peaceful. A lovely authentic, large bedroom. Big, comfortable bed. Bathroom basic but clean and in good working order. Cleaners keep the rooms in top condition. Did not have breakfast as did the cafes but at 12 euros it seems reasonable in comparison to elsewhere. Had sneaky look at a superior bedroom located at front of hotel; definitely worth the extra 20 euros a night. Can't believe it's only a 2 star!!</p></li>

We have probably stayed in every room type, and prefer the rooms overlooking the front of the hotel, as opposed to the light well at the back. Of course if the window is open you will get all associated city noises, which is not surprising! It is always spotlessly clean, the rooms are spacious. Its in a great location for a spot of shopping at the Galerie Lafayette.Breakfast in the little breakfast room off the lobby, is fine. A little cosy, but i would recommend it as opposed to looking around the area for something else. Its very french, which is just what we like in France!!</p></li>

Coming back to the hotel after a full day of viewing the sites, was like coming home. It's so quaint and comfortable. Our room was #63 which has a HUGE BED and wonderful view. [We've posted some pictures]. The breakfast room is beautiful and the breakfast was incredible for the price! It was all we needed to get us going for the day! Fresh yogurt, fruit, cereal, milk, several kinds of cheese, meat, eggs to boil, toast, croissants, rolls, coffee, juice. It was an all you could eat buffet! We're going to stay there whenever we visit Paris!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A lovely hotel in a great location - the nearest Metro stop is Trinite which is only a few steps from the hotel and from there you can be in any part of the city in a very short time. The hotel is also only 5 minutes walk away from Blvd Haussman where you will find some of the major Paris department stores including Printemps and Galleries Lafeyette. Overall the hotel was clean and the staff were friendly and welcoming. The rooms are large and traditionally French (from the era of the Belle Epoche) and the rate per night is very reasonable.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located on a quiet street, this hotel has 2 names (aka Hôtel des Croisés). We had a fun time taking the small historic elevator up to our huge room with a view of the Sacre Coeur and the Trinity building (see photos), #64. The tub was splendidly big! Decor was historically romantic. Hotel service was great. The location was good, close to shopping and Metro stops. We found a yummy Italian restaurant around the corner, Restaurant dell'Orto. We also found a friendly (English speaking) wine bar called Le Rouge et le Verre, but look for the awing marked Cave a Vins / Tables d'hotes. For the room size, prize and romantic decor, we highly recommend this hotel and hope to return soon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the hotel for 4 days with my wife, with mixed feelings. Good points: -It was in good location with access to the Trinite metro a few minutes walk away. - Good prices for Paris. - Plenty of cafes/brasseries nearby all serving decent food. Bad points: - the noises in the hotel were annoying. They were from the water pipes, heaters, and neighbours. - it was very hot. - the cleaners very overeager to say the least. One morning she came in at 9:30. And the other day, she wanted to clean the room whilst we were sleeping!!!! I appreciate she may have been busy, but come on! On the whole, the hotel has its charm, but the constant noises and the mad cleaners spolit the stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After almost obessesive searching on TA, my daughter (16 years) and I chose this hotel for our 8 night stay in June. We weren't disappointed! It has a charming feel to it even though not immaculately dusted. Our two room suite was perfect for us and gave us a little space after very long days of exploring. The patisserie/boulangerie just down the street from the hotel was excellent and was our first stop every day. I especially enjoyed not being in a traditional tourist area and could better experience Parisien life. For dinner one evening we grabbed sandwiches and sat in near by Trinite park watching children and their parents enjoy the summer evening at the end of the work day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband, teenage daughter and I stayed here for two nights. Our room and bathroom were nice sized, large by Parisian standards, and the bathroom was enormous and well appointed. The proprietress was very helpful in assisting us with reservations, Metro advice, maps, etc. They have a computer available for guest use in the lounge. Excellent location - very close to Trinite metro, and several other Metro stops, include Gare Lazare and Gare du Nord. Also, easy 15-20 minute walk or very quick cab ride from where the Roissy Bus drops you off. The neighborhood is a little dead on the weekend compared to the Left Bank, but very lively during the week. Easy walk to Louvre. We will definitely stay at the Langlois again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for a weekend at the Hotel Langlois and thought the hotel was fantastic. We were slightly apprehensive after reading the bad reports on trip advisor but we were pleasantly surprised. We even took ear plugs as there were many reports of the hotel being extremely noisy on your website. We arrived late on Friday night for the weekend and the staff were very courteous and friendly. We had a superior double room on the 5th floor. It was much larger than any other room in Paris we had stayed at (for the same price) and never encountered any noise problems whatsoever. A great location, only 10 minutes by bus from Gare du Nord, and 10 mins by metro to Musee D'Orsay. We will definitely stay here again when we return to Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed for 4 nights from Jan 23rd based on the comments we had previously read on this site and we were not disappointed. We were in room 62 which was a good size, clean and had a comfortable bed. The room had a couple of interesting old features such as carved wooden posts surrounding a small window bay with a table and chairs. There was also an unusual tiled fireplace. The hotel is good value and central - 10 mins easy walk to the Opera and 20-25 mins to the Louvre. The Metro is only 100 metres away so linking to anywhere in the city is easy and quick. Lots of restaurants within 10 -15 mins walk towards Opera. The Patisserie 50 metres along the road is brilliant with lots of delicious cakes etc. We will certainly book in again when we return to Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from a four night stay the Langlois. We stayed in Room 11 which featured a giant bathroom with large tub and enclosed WC, but no view. Our friends stayed in Room 64 which has a small bathroom but a great view of Sacre Coeur. The staff was helpful in arranging dinner reservations. We took the Roissy Bus and walked to the hotel. Some restaurant ideas. The Pommerai restaurant across the street was quite pleasant. Be warned that they speak little english, however. We enjoyed Cafe Des Musees near the Picasso Museum as well as Robert et Louise in the Marais. Reservations in Paris are necessary for dinner. Also this time we purchased the paris museum pass which allowed us to cut lines (very long) at Versailles, Louvre, and The Orangerie Museum. Highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the hotel for six nights. The hotel is charming. The room is big. I got a room that did not face the street; so, it was very quiet at night. I thought it was almost too quiet! I found the bed to be a bit too soft for my own preferences. A metro station is just around the corner. I hopped on and off the metro almost the entire time I was there. There are a couple of great restaurants and crepe places around the corner that I went for breakfast almost every morning. I also really like the hotel's free Internet even though I didn't realize that the french has a little different keyboard system! But that just added to more fun! In sum, I had a great time staying at the hotel and would definitely recommend it to my friends and will stay there again in my next visit(s).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for 4 nights after seeing the review on Trip Advisor. We were very happy with the location. We were able to get around easily on the subway. A great way to get places in Paris! I loved using the Paris subway!! At first it seemed daunting but it took 1/2 day to learn it and we used it constantly. This hotel is also close to one of the main bus stops, St. Lazare. in Paris. The subway entrance is 1/2 block from the hotel. The hotel was built in 1879. the rooms were a bit older looking but were large, clean and very comfortable. Our bathroom had been recently remodeled and was very nice along with the staff. There were alot of nice restaurants close by. We were at first concerned because it was more northeast but we didn't really feel far away from anything. I would stay there again without a doubt!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Langlois is a charming, comfortable and clean hotel with helpful staff. The only major downsides were the price and the noise (but only during the working day) from the very extensive renovations being carried out next door. It is conveniently located very near Trinite Metro station and plenty of eateries for anything from a quick coffee & croissant in the morning to a full evening meal. The furniture was very solid and traditional -- as was the plumbing in the bathroom which was as large as many a hotel bedroom. The lift has period charm but saves walking up many flights of stairs. Our room overlooked a central courtyard so we were not exposed to any traffic noise. The price was noticeably higher than the equally-convenient hotel which has just been refurbished (also a 2-star) that we have previously used in Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I stayed at the Hotel Langlois in June 2008 for one night. We had been on an organized tour, and we wanted to stay in a hotel that was both reasonably priced and centrally located. This hotel fit the bill. The hotel is located within a few feet of the Trinte Metro stop, and it is close to several nice cafes and restaurants. One of the nice things about its location is that it is only a ten minute walk to the Roissey Bus to CDG. I would like to thank the entire staff at the hotel for a pleasant stay. The room was a good size, and the prices for the minibar were extremely reasonable. The room was also extremely quiet. The only complaint we had was the extremely hard bed, but that was minor compared to our overall good experience. I would recommend this property to anyone looking for a good location with good value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family of 4 stayed at the Hotel Langlois for four nights. At first, I wasn't so sure about the neighborhood and being far from sites. But we weren't at all. We walked to everything, but took the subway back. The folks who work at the Langlois were very nice. We stayed in a suite that accomodated us well, but for the last night needed two seperate rooms since I made a mistake when I reserved. They did give us two rooms, moved our luggage for us, and gave us a very much coveted air-conditioned room! When I checked out and paid for our stay, I realized that they only charged us for the suite again for the last night! That saved a bit of money. I doubt that there is a better deal in Paris. In the neighborhood we picked up outstanding coissants for 1 euro. Breakfast for 1 euro? My children voted their stay in Paris the best of our 2 week adventure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here with my wife over a weekend and overall I was pleased. On the plus side the hotel is in a great location. It's close to the RER, Saint Lazare line (just down the street) and it's right around the corner from the Metro 12 line, Trinity station. There are some cafe's around the place to buy a cheap (relatively speaking) breakfast and it's in a good, quiet area. I like the decor and the rooms and bathrooms were adequate in size. On the negative side, I'd have to say that I was disappointed with thickness of the walls and floors. I could hear people walking around upstairs, conversations in other rooms and out in the hallways as well as running water in the bathroom beside us. They cleaned our rooms every day but they didn't replace the towels which in the end isn't so bad but may bother others. Overall, I think I'd stay here again. I thought the price was reasonable at 96 euro per night.</p></li>

I selected the hotel from it's positive reviews on TripAdvisor and I can tell you that we were very happy with the choice. This being our first trip to Europe, we have nothing to compare it to, but being very typical Americans, we had plenty of room and the bathroom was large. The thermostat was a remote control (have not seen this in the US). The front desk people were very helpful. The breakfast nook was warm and inviting with a computer set up for internet. The hotel, on a quiet street, was well located a half block from the Metro Station Trinite. My sister, who traveled with us, was without her main suitcase for 4 days due to an airline snafu. The hotel staff was so sympathetic to her and and there were hugs as we checked out. Nice people running a quality hotel in the 9th arrondisement in Paris. We already want to go back!</p></li>

I did a lot of research through Tripadvisor and I am pleased with our choice for the hotel. The positives you read in the other reviews are true. I was mainly impressed by the staff, specifically the two young women who staff the front desk. They were very helpful when we had questions about where to find a store to buy food for a picnic (the Galleries Lafayette has a gourmet food section), where to find a laundry (walk out the front door of the Hotel, take a right and it's a 5 minute walk on St. Lazare and is on the right) and how to find the Hard Rock Cafe' - Paris (it's on Boulevard Hausmann - we only went there for a souvenier for a friend). I'd also like to put in a plug for the guys at the panini / crepe stand attached to the Royal Trinite' cafe. The panini's are great (try the l'espangnol) and the cooks are really friendly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from 7 nights at this hotel in room 31 which had a double bed and a large bathroom. We had a twin bed added since there were 3 of us. The room was quiet and ample. There was no view, but that was okay. Breakfast was 9 euros which is better than in a restaurant for the food you get, but much easier to walk outside the hotel to the little patisserie close by and get a croissant and orange juice. Good place for lunch! The Trinite metro stop is the nearest one. Being in the 9th makes it a quieter hotel than most, but still convenient to attractions if you use the metro. The staff at the front desk understood English very well. The drinks in the refrigerator in the room are reasonably priced which is unusual for a hotel. I would definitely stay here again. There is computer access in the breakfast room as well. The cost for the room was 110 euros. There was no additional charge for the extra bed/person.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My sister & I stayed here in May of this year. Of all the Parisian hotels I've stayed in over the years this has to be one of the best experiences. Near to just about everywhere you want to visit, close to buses and Metro, this hotel is in a less touristy part of Paris & in a more "authentic" area where local Parisians, work, shop and eat. Galleries Lafayette & Au Printemps are just down the street, the Opera House behind them. Monmartre is a short walk away along winding streets and then a short hike or 'Funicular" up to the Sacre Coeur area. The hotel was clean, quiet and friendly - plumbing excellent and breakfasts good.We had a room on the 4th floor overlooking the street which was very bright & we were not distubed by noise from traffic or other hotel guests. We took a taxi from Gare du Nord to the hotel but the metro is very easy & the station about 1 minute away. I'll stay here next time I visit Paris for sure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Langlois is a charming hotel with a friendly and helpful staff. We always seem to have a lot of questions and we appreciated the extra help that the staff were able to give us. The rooms are large and the bathrooms are big and very clean. We thought the beds were very comfortable. There is a lovely breakfast room with an excellent buffet each morning ( for an additional charge ). We loved the vintage elevator with the wooden and iron doors. A metro stop, cash machine. post office, bakery, restaurants and laundromat are all a few steps to a few blocks away. Several big department stores are also within walking distance. And...there's a computer in the breakfast room that is available for guests beginning at 11:00 in the morning. We have stayed there on 3 separate occasions and had an excellent experience each and every time. We will DEFINITELY recommend the Hotel Langlois to friends and we hope to be able to return again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed in a suite (#44, I think) with our 3 children from June 12 through June 15. The hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff friendly. The kids (ages 7, 8 and 13) loved the elevator. We opted out of the hotel breakfast (only because our children do not eat 8 euros worth), but there is a wonderful bakery next door for breakfast pastries which we ate in the suite with coffee ordered up from the hotel (at a very reasonable price). The only downside is that the location is not the most convenient for the major tourist attractions. The Musee D'Orsay is only 3 or 4 Metro stops away, and from there we could take the BatoBus around to the sights on the Seine during the day, but returning back to the hotel from the Eiffel Tower at night (after 9 when the BatoBus shuts down) was difficult by Metro, requiring 2 transfers, so we convinced a taxi driver to let the 5 of us squeeze into his cab. Overall, a great experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Langlois is located in a charming old building outside the main tourist area, yet within steps to a Metro stop and cafes and shops frequented by locals, providing a taste of life in Paris. This was perfect for us, as we have been to Paris multiple times, but I would probably not recommend staying in this area on a first trip. It is also located close to the train station, which is ideal as we took the Eurostar from London. We had requested one of the rooms with a view of Sacre Cour, but unfortunately this request was not met, though no guarantee was made by the hotel. Our room did not have a view, but it was immense by Paris standards, as was the bathroom, with large ceilings adding to the spaciousness. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel, as there are many lovely cafes and brasseries within walking distance. Hotel Langlois is a good value, and we would stay again, crossing our fingers for one of the coveted rooms with a view!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Another wonderful stay from a hotel I chose blindly from trip advisor. This hotel is very European and cute, it is located on a semi-quiet street close to the Mulan Rouge and only one block to the nearest Metro station. The rooms were decorated well, we were lucky to see two of them as they has missed booked us one night and gave us an extra room for free. They have antique decorations, comfortable beds, and some with balcony's onto the street. There are many nice streets surrounding that you can cruise through during the day, cute boutique shops and restaurants mostly. If you enjoy walking, the Sacre Couer and Monte Martre is very close as well, maybe a 20 minute walk or so. Book early, we booked over a month in advance and could only get four of our six nights there. When we moved hotel to a higher rating (3 star) and payed literally double, the 3 star hotel was horrible! All in all, a very nice place at an incredible rate. I will definately stay here my next time in Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here July 1-3, 2005. Nice location (close to Trinity church) and excellent staff. Gave us great recommendations on nearby restaurant (Restaurant of 2 Theaters, just around corner, 32 Euros priced fixed for champagne, wine, and 3-course meal with many excellent choices), where to boat the Seine from (Eiffel Tower - we picked boat with shortest line), where to buy food (nearby convenience store), and how to get to CDG (Roussy bus at Opera). Only shortcomings - even with the fan - the room was hot! We had just missed a major heat wave in the City so I can only imagine what previous week was like (bad). We had view across alley of an office type building (room 32); luckily they were gone for rest of our stay. Also, on Sat. and Sun. the nearby Patissierie is closed. On Sunday, almost everything is closed so plan ahead. We didn't breakfast at the hotel, so cannot comment on that. Did smell the food cooking early in the morning!! Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would go here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Langlois on Dec. 24, 2004 for one night. We picked this hotel based on the reviews from trip advisor and we were not dissappointed. We stayed in a suite on the second floor facing the street and it was not noisy. The room and bathroom were large with very high ceilings and very clean. Also the bathroom had great water pressure and plenty of hot water. The only reason I didn't give this hotel 5 stars is because I'm very picky and felt the room could have used a fresh coat of paint by American standards but it added to its old world charm. Also the double bed seem to be the size of a full not a queen. My husband is 6'3 and I'm 5'7 but it made us have to snuggle. The staff was very friendly and informative. This hotel was close to everything by metro which was literally at the end of the block. I enjoyed the neighborhood with many restaurants and the Laffayette Mall. The Best thing was the bill...soooooo cheap for Paris....maybe I should have given it 5 stars!!!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a really nice little hotel, and a pretty good value considering that it is near the heart of Paris and is just a block from a Metro stop. The staff speaks enough English to help you with just about anything you need, and they are very friendly besides. Can't beat the free (and fast) internet in the breakfast room - so much better than having to search for internet cafes while you're out touring during the day. Our room was great - pretty architectural details and a beautiful view of the Sacre Coeur church. The bathroom was tiny, but everything was clean and they had complimentary soap, shampoo, and conditioner. I'd say that the only drawback is that the housekeeping staff are really noisy in the morning, so it's hard to sleep in past about 9:00, although most days we were up by that time anyway. Overall I'd say that this one is a good pick for travelers looking for a good deal on a very pleasant stay in Paris. Also, their tiny elevator is a little scary looking, but don't be afraid to try it - it works great!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Unique Older Hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Langlois is a classic older and smaller hotel, with all of the uniqueness and charm that you might expect. The lobby looks like it came out of a movie set, and there is a wire-cage lift for moving luggage up and down. (The wide stairway is perfectly adequate for walking.) We had a spacious room and bathroom on the front side of the hotel. There is some traffic noise if you leave the windows open, but generally things seemed to quiet down after midnight, at least on the weeknights. The hotel is conveniently located next to the Trinite Metro station, and there is a good bakery nearby, as well as several cafes and bistros. However, if you are planning to visit the major tourist attractions (Eiffel Tower, des Invalides, Museums, etc.), you may want to look for a hotel on the other side of the river, as it can be a bit of a walk. The neighborhoods around the Langlois are a mix of apartments and night clubs (Moulin Rouge is not too far away), which is a plus if you are looking to experience the real Paris rather than the typical tourist sites.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I read the reviews on Tripadvisor and decided to book a three night break at the hotel Langlois, Paris. When we arrived we were warmly welcomed and were pleasantly surprised by the size and decor of our rooms. Lovely high ceilings and a real ambience that can only be experienced when in Paris! The hotel reception were always very helpful and friendly, and ensured that our stay was a memorable one. We asked about reservations for the Moulin Rouge show and the reception immediately contacted them and reserved our table...which ended up being one of the best spots in the theatre! As for location the Hotel Langlois is close proximity to everything, a 15 minute walk to Montematre, same again to the Champs Elysee, close to the large shopping centres, and with a metro within literally 50 meters nothing in Paris is more than a few minutes away. There are a number of relatively inexpensive cafe/ bistros close by and a delicious pattisserie at the corner. All in all I would highly recommend for anyone to stay at the Hotel Langlois, in fact I have booked my second stay for August this year!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Langlois is an excellent value. I just returned from staying 5 nights at this hotel. It is located on a quiet street in the 9th district within walking distance of many of the Paris sights. The Metro, city bus, eateries are all very close by and the Roissy Bus, to and from CDG airport, is only a short walk. The staff of the Langlois were all terrific, especially the three women that I met over the 6 days who worked at the front desk. There is a computer with free internet access for guests to use. Because of all the places to eat in Paris, I did not have breakfast at the hotel so I can not speak to that. Rooms were clean and very confortable and as I already said my room was very quiet. I had a room facing the courtyard and was able to keep the windows open whenever I was in the room. This is important to me since many hotels in Paris have rooms facing noisy, busy streets. Another nice feature of this hotel is that the rooms are not all the same. Each has its own style and features. I have stayed at other hotels in Paris, however, when I return the Hotel Langlois will be my first choice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My girlfriend & I stayed here for 4nights last December in a particularly bitter Paris winter. We booked the hotel through its own website and paid on our departure. Langlois is a small hotel, close to Gare St.Lazare. Though not immediately nearby any of the more touristy areas, we often walked to the Louvre and there is enough nearby to keep you going. I would recommend getting a tube to go eat but only for an evening meal, and only because many of Paris' best restaurants are off the beaten track (Try Willy's Wine Bar). We stayed in a second floor room (small lift isn't necessary except for the infirm) without no view. However the room was exceptionally large for the price, with grand antique furnishings and a large clean bathroom (superb deep bath!) The decor may not have been to everyone's taste (red&green in our room, slightly baroque feel) but I enjoyed it since most cheap hotels have zip character. From memory we did get charged slightly more than the website quoted but given the large comfortable room, friendly service (helps if you have basic French) and reasonable location I doubt many people will leave unhappy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Langlois was recommended to me by a good friend who had been intrigued by the hotel after walking by. I reserved a single room via the hotel's website. I arrived at the hotel at 8am on a Tuesday morning and was actually able to check in at that time -- thankfully since I had just been on an 8 hour flight from Africa! Unfortunately for me, the only available room was on the 6th floor -- and the elevator was broken!!!!! Not wanting to wait several hours for a cat nap, I accepted the room on the 6th floor and lugged my luggage up the stairs. Wow -- thats a lot of stairs!! The room was clean, comfortable and had a great view of the city. The elevator remained out of service throughout my 2-night stay -- so I definitely worked off my nutella crepes and croissants!! I did not partake in breakfast at the hotel -- 11 euro seemed a bit steep for breakfast. There are plenty of cafes surrounding the hotel and Rue de Martyre is full of fresh food stands!! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a bargain in a unique part of town. Just make sure to get a room on a lower floor -- just in case the elevator breaks!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this place based on the reviews of this website - I'm sorry I did. The service was very poor. I arrived at the hotel early in the morning with a confirmed reservation for a certain room type picked out from website. Was told that I couldn't check in yet - which was reasonable since it was before noon. Came back later in the day but was then told, oh sorry that room is not available despite my confirmed reservation and having presented myself earlier in the day?! The only room now is one on the ground floor right off the lobby facing the street (with traffic passing by). Why wasn't I told that when I got there that morning? I would have left and found a different hotel. But obviously when I came back it was too late to find another hotel. Guess they wanted to fill as many rooms as possible and gave mine away to someone who didn't want the "lobby" room. The attitude of the manager/desk staff was very poor. She half-heartedly tried calling for a cab. When the line was busy after one try she said sorry just find one on the street. Thanks for nothing. I would definitely not stay there again and if you do, don't count on your reservation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's comforting to know that Tripadvisor ratings are reliable, and the Hotel des Croises certainly lived up to its ratings when we visited in early October. The staff in this delighful hotel were quietly courteous and efficient. They offered a very helpful service, which included some assistance that went well beyond the minimalist approach often adopted in modern hotels. Enough has been said about the unique charms of this establishment in other postings:they are all true!

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My daughter and I spent a week at the Hotel Langlois and highly recommend it. We had originally planned on not taking the optional breakfast, but ended up doing it almost every day for convenience and to fill us up for the day. In addition to the usual French pastry and bread they had sliced cold meat, eggs to boil, sliced cheeses, and Turkish cheese and oil cured olives. Also orange juice and tea if wanted plus plenty of good French cafe. Very convenient location--only a half block from the Trinite metro station, and about four blocks from the Opera Garnier (where the Roissybus from the airport stops). Also very close to an RER train station. Free Internet was useful, especially when I got very sick during my stay (nothing to do with the hotel!) and needed to check symptoms online, communicate with my health care at home, and order a wheelchair at the airport. The room we had was large by Parisian standards with two firm single beds and an immaculate roomy bathroom. Staff is multi-lingual and very helpful; you are steps from the Metro, and it isn't a tourist-ridden area--we didn't see a single Rick Steves book all week! Strongly recommend for a comfortable well-priced place to stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel based on many great reviews here on Tripadvisor. We were quite happy with our choice. A quaint, hundred year old hotel with good service, nice rooms, and a convenient location in a good neighborhood. If you want a closer look at the hotel, watch the DVD of the Jonathan Demme film, "Truth About Charlie", the remake of "Charade". We are a middle aged couple, travelling by train from London, to the Gare du Nord station nearby. A perfect trainride. Be sure to take a taxi to the hotel. The suites and rooms are large by Paris standards. The antique elevator that you will use makes you feel like you are in an old french movie. Be a good rider, and close the gates when you get off, so it can move for the next rider. We experienced good service, and assistance from the desk. Try Le Bistro des Deux Theatres for a great meal. It's a quick walk from the hotel. It was so good, we returned on our last night in Paris. Early morning you will wake up to the smells coming up from the bakery next door. Wow---I miss those croissants. English is widely spoken. Whenever, I had slight problems with my lack of French, I would just smile, and have fun. Stay at the Langlois, and have a great trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location of the hotel is excellent, with a metro station at the end of the road and walking distance to many interesting sites. The room ( #55 ) was really big, i think it was twice the size of the room at Hotel Concorde St. Lazare (a 4 star hotel in the neighbourhood) we stayed at last year. The bathroom was a bit small but absolutely ok. The room was very nicely furnitured. For €130 it is really a bargain. It was a little bit noisy, traffic noise and noise from other rooms, but not annoying. The breakfast (€11) was good. A huge plus for free internet access. The first impression of the staff was not very good. Then we checked in the man in the reception was more interested in the television, and he barely spoke a word english. Then we discovered that the aircondition did not work, we told him but he responded in french, after a while I managed him to take a look. He didnt manage to get the air condition to work, and then I asked him if we could get another room, I didnt understand the answer. I think he told me, in mostly french, that no other rooms where available. Fortunately at the rest of the stay the staff was english speaking and very friendly. The cleaniness was excellent. I would recommend this hotel :-)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We thought this hotel was well located and good value for money. Our triple room was very spacious with an enormous bathroom. Unfortunately we overlooked a very dismal void between buildings, but i'm sure the rooms facing the road are better. Our teenagers had a very pleasant room on the ground floor beside reception looking out onto a pretty courtyard (at the bottom of the dismal void) The ancient lift was a novelty, and some of the bumps and lurches were as good as the Disney rides (I notice another review where the lift is not working!) With regard to the location which as your other reviews have pointed out is excellent for transport and shopping, i should also mention that at the end of the street in front of the Eglise de la Trinite there is a childrens playground, where i spent some time everday with my 7 year old letting off steam after sightseeing. It was fun watching the nannies and their immaculately dressed charges. The playground had an outdoor tabletennis table, and i asked at reception if they had any bats and a ball, which they didn't (wouldn't cost much!) The staff were helpful and my only criticism would be breakfast, which is uncomfortably cramped, and guests have to squeeze past each other to get to the buffet table.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife, my three children and myself have stayed at Hotel langlois now on three occasions in the past three years. This time we had a suite on the 4th Floor - 42. This hotel cannot be beaten for value for money, ambience and location. We have always found the staff very friendly and professional without being intrusive. The breakfast has gone up to €11 each, but, is still great value and useful when with kids. This time our youngest (8 years old) could walk everywhere! The Louvre, Musee D'Orsay, even the Eiffel Tower and Left Bank were all manageable. As regards shopping, well, the main shops (Printemps, Galleries Lafayette, GAP) are literally two blocks away. We also got out without the kids to the very atmospheric Bistro des Deux Theatres, just around the corner at the side of Trinite Church. 3 Course meal with coffees PLUS a choice of a bottle of wine at €34 each was great value. The Trinite Metro stop is 200m away. There is a superb pattisserie on the same street for stashing up with lunchtime rolls and pastries. Some good Italian restaurants also nearby. One suggestion, if travelling from CDG Airport. Take the train to Gare De Nord and the metro from Magenta (next to Gare De Nord) to Gare St Lazare, from where you can take the 10min walk to the hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have been to France a number of times, generally staying on the Left Bank. We decided to stay on the Right Bank the last trip and were looking for a hotel that was also reasonable for Paris. We liked the hotel, although it may have been too far off the beaten path, so I'm not sure we would do it again. We felt as though we weren't quite in Paris, though it is not hard to get to the main sights from the Langlois. The staff was nice, the rooms large for Paris, and clean, so we have no real complaints. I remember reading from other people that it was not a hotel for "first time visitors" and that is probably true, as you are out of the heart of Paris. When we go back, we will either stay closer to the center, the Marais, or the Left Bank again. The Langlois is not far from the Opera, Gallerie Lafayette, and Printemps, so it depends upon what your preferences are. The bed was a little hard, but the rooms were nice, spacious, and probably the greatest deal for the money space-wise. The staff was helpful and friendly. They spoke English, but we're spoiled as our daughter speaks fluent French. The rates at "our Left Bank hotel" had risen considerably, so we tho't we'd try the Langlois. It is certainly a good value for the money and the Metro and train station are nearby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here from 3rd - 5th January and find it very hard to fault the place. First of all the location is superb. To get there we just got off the bus from Beauvais at Port Maillot where we went round the corner to the Metro station and bought our 3 day tickets. From Port Maillot we travelled on to Concorde where we changed for Trinite. Although we took a wee while to find the hotel it's really very easy to find if you know where to look. Just come up the steps of Trinite Metro and take the street on your right - Rue St. Lazare. It's just along there a bit. From this station you can get anywhere within minutes. It's also within easy walking distance of the Moulin Rouge and the Opera. The hotel itself is very charming and we found the service to be excellent. The bed could be more comfortable but the room was huge and we had a shower, toilet, minibar and tv. We were lucky enough to have a room at the back so we didn't get much noise although it's in the middle of a big city so you should probably be prepared for that. Any time we asked for help at the reception we received it with a smile. My biggest tip would be to ask for a restaurant recommendation. You won't be disappointed. All in all if you want a place to rest your head for a decent price in the centre of Paris you can't really go wrong with this place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having visited Paris five times previously, staying in hotels at around the 100 euro mark, I believe that the Hotel Langlois, represents the best value for money that I have experienced in Paris. We stayed over Xmas and paid 96 euros per night. The rooms are clean and pleasantly decorated with antiques, and our bathroom had recently been renovated. Staff are very helpeful (confirming dinner reservations, making restaurant recomendations, and printing directions and metro information). The hotel is in an excellent location, only a 5 min walk from Opera. The Metro stop "Trinite" is less than a two minute walk away. A taxi stand is located at the end of the street (approx 5 euros to Gare de Nord Station, 9 euros to St. Germain, 7 euros to Champs Eleysee). There is also a fantastic Bistro called "Le Bistro des Deux Theatres" near the hotel, at 18, rue Blanche. Turn left outside the hotel, and then take first street on your right - continue for about 200m and you will hit rue Blanche. We had dinner here on Xmas Eve, and it was one of the best meals we had in Paris (33 euros for champagne cocktail, 3 course meal, bottle of wine and coffee!!!) Hotel Langois, is NOT a 5 star hotel, but if you are looking for a hotel in an excellent location, that is clean and great value - you really can't beat Hotel Langlois. I thoroughly recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this hotel based on a great review in a newspaper for our trip to Paris. My mother, father and myself booked a double room with an extra bed. The extra bed was very hard and not very comfortable. I woke up several times each night with pain in my back. Didn't feel very well rested in the mornings. My parents lied in the double bed and had no complaints about the bed. Another irritating thing was the housekeeper. One morning she came into our room without knocking. And although we were 3 people we only got two big towels. One morning I took one towel (for the next morning) from the trolley and put it in the room before we went out. When we got back in the evening she had been in the room and removed it. Very annoying to say the least. I had to use the small towel intended for use after hand- washing every morning. And why was she in our room when the room was already done? The people in the reception was just ok, not too friendly and they rarely even looked up from the computer when we passed the desk. Breakfast was ok, it cost 10 euros per person, the food was high quality and tasty. The aircondition worked fine (thank god, it was over 30 degrees fahrenheit every day) All in all a good experience and I would stay there again, but a little bit more friendliness from the staff and more discretion from the housekeepers would be nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wanted a Parisienne feel to the hotel, do not like the plastic 4/5 stars hotels that could be anywhere in the world.Room 15 was at the front of hotel and with window open loud traffic noise( did not bother us though) with shut no noise at all. In we walked having been in the quaint and tiny lift ( can not believe one of the previous reviewers said it was awful) it was fab ! only on floor one, but used it up and down everytime like little kids ! Door opens into a hall with big mirror and then into a big big bathroom with picture mirror, big old fireplace and tiled floor. The other side into a very large room, with seating area by window, old furniture, very very heavy wood. Mantlepiece above big old fireplace with a woman bust ( showing half of her actual bust if you get my drift) She was lovely just sitting looking over us. I work for a bank and am not a wierdo honest. Anyway, we walked to the Moulin Rouge for a show. Not to be missed 90 euro with no food and drink, but an absolute must and a restaurant up the same hill, 3 mins from hotel call something theatre rest, on the corner. Fab french food. All in all. Great place to stay. Excellent. Thanks Paris for a fab time. Beautiful city I have to say. No bar, and we did not have breakfast. Breakfast room small and functional.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After much research (Trip Advisor & every other source we could find) we were thrilled to be able to book three nights for our family of four at the Hotel Langlois. The chance to stay at the #4 rated hotel in all of Paris for a very reasonable price seemed like a wonderful opportunity. We were assigned to the attic apartment where we found our room to be nothing close to the photos and/or room descriptions on the internet. The Hotel Langlois website speaks of "Ecole de Nancy" furniture & crafted mahogany and sycamore headboards ... Our double bed was a portable bed w/ no headboard, sitting about 6 inches off the ground. I don't believe "Ecole de Nancy" furniture includes the wicker and particle board pieces in our room. Paint was peeling off the walls in several places. The space had great potential. - It was good-sized (the reason they told us we were placed there). There was a small kitchen. The bathroom was nice. And there was an incredible view of Sacre-Coeur. But it was as though the room was an afterthought. - A place for families when everything else was occupied. Certainly not representative of what I would expect from the #4 hotel in Paris. I would suggest that Hotel Langlois paint & furnish the attic so that it measures up to the rest of their facility. A little work and a small investment would make that space a highlight of a Paris vacation instead of a source of disgust and disappointment.</p></li>

<li>We were assigned to the attic apartment where we found our room to be nothing close to the photos and/or room descriptions on the <span style="background-color:#d0d0d0" title="p=0.999">internet</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>The Hotel Langlois website speaks of "Ecole de Nancy" furniture & crafted mahogany and <span style="background-color:#808080" title="p=0.562">sycamore</span> headboards ... Our double bed was a portable bed w/ no headboard, sitting about 6 inches off the ground.</br></br></li>
<li>I don't believe "Ecole de Nancy" furniture includes the <span style="background-color:#d0d0d0" title="p=0.987">wi</span>cker and particle board pieces in our room.</br></br></li>
<li><span style="background-color:#4363d8" title="p=0.997">Paint</span> was peeling off the walls in several places.</li>
<li>Paint was peeling off the <span style="background-color:#aaffc3" title="p=0.999">walls</span> in several places.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#808000" title="p=0.999">space</span> had great potential.</br></br></li>
<li>- It was good-sized (the reason they told us we were placed there).</br></br></li>
<li>There was a small <span style="background-color:#f032e6" title="p=0.997">kitchen</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#e6194b" title="p=0.999">bathroom</span> was nice.</br></br></li>
<li>And there was an incredible <span style="background-color:#808080" title="p=0.999">view</span> of Sacre-Coeur.</br></br></li>
<li>But it was as though the room was an afterthought.</br></br></li>
<li>- A place for <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1" title="p=0.581">families</span> when everything else was occupied.</br></br></li>
<li>Certainly not representative of what I would expect from the #4 hotel in Paris.</br></br></li>
<li>I would suggest that Hotel Langlois paint & furnish the attic so that it measures up to the rest of their facility.</br></br></li>
<li>A little work and a small <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.998">investment</span> would make that space a highlight of a Paris vacation instead of a source of disgust and disappointment.</br></br></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked a double room at the hotel Langlois after reading positive reviews on Trip Advisor, and on the whole, was pretty pleased with what we got. Our room (31) was big, with a large bathroom, and while the decor erred on the vintage side of chic, the old furnishings gave the place a great deal of character, often missing from anonymous city hotels. Big double bed (but small pillows), lots of hot water, TV, wardrobe - and we didn't have a problem with noise from other rooms at all. And as other reviews have mentioned, the old-fashioned lift and the helpful French staff make it a characteristically Parisian experience. Location is very good, about 2 minutes' walk from Trinite metro station, and the Metro itself is as easy to navigate as the London underground. Montmartre is just a few stops north, and it takes no time to get to the major central attractions. We skipped breakfast in the hotel in favour of nearby cafes or boulangeries, of which there are plenty. Downsides? Make sure you bring your own toiletries, or buy some from the Monoprix nearby: the soaps and shampoo sachets are really horrible, stingy offerings, and there's not even a facecloth. Our room was freshly cleaned when we arrived, but it did smell very pungently of fragranced cleaning products, to the point where we had to leave the windows open during the day, just to air the place - if you're a non-smoker with sensitive nose, ask for a non-smoking room!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I think one has to acknowledge from the very onset that what is good for one will not necessarily be for another. Like other people, I chose the hotel based on good reveiws but I must say I was disappointed. Except for the location and some helpful members of staff, in particular one very friendly and extremely helpful young lady, there isn't much that I liked about the hotel especially the room - from the decor to just the ambiance. Although the room was bigger than most of the hotel rooms I've seen or stayed at in Europe, I did not quite like it. The room was not sound proofed, making each and every sound from other rooms very audible including footsteps on a creaky wooden floor from the room above. I'm sure the occupant of the room below me also suffered, as my floor also creaked badly and I was restless for most of the time. I should maybe take some responsibility for not specifically asking for a non-smoking room, but it was as if people on my floor were on a smoking holiday. They would smoke until the small hours of the morning and by day break I would be literally choking. The bed was uncomfortable, 'caved in' and creaky, the pillows equally uncomfortable. I don't know if the heating system was not effective or if it was just me freezing. The lift is quite antique and intersting but it wasn't getting to my floor on some days.I think some travellers will still find the hotel ok, but personally I don't think I'll be returning.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great for not making your hols feel like a business trip”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I thought I might add my voice to the many reporting here... The hotel was great with the foyer and very cool lift setting the mood. The room (64) was clean (apart from the mysterious but inoffensive appearance of an empty wrapper marked "Trojan") and had a great view of the Sacre Coeur over the rooftops. The furniture was warm (in feeling, not temperature although that was fine). The staff was helpful and patient with my French. We didn't try the television / look in the minibar since there was no shortage of entertainment or bars even in a very wet and windy December Paris. We didn't try the breakfast either as there's no shortage of cafes to find a coffee and a croissant. Since I travel relatively frequently with business, I find it difficult to drop into holiday (vacation) mode in the sort of identi-room seen in most cities in most countries, and when I'm off for a long weekend with my fiancee we don't need a pool on site, great conference facilities and 2,134 channels of TV to alleviate the boredom of a soulless cell. This place was the perfect antidote. I gather the previous reviewer's successors in room 63 (or 62) also enjoyed their stay from the faintly audible expressions of pleasure (ahem), but other than that and some gently gurgling plumbing, the place was quiet. Obviously the place has a certain mood to it... Hausman is very close so perfect for shoppers, but everywhere is walkable and the metro is less than two minutes away.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved this hotel. It has a great vintage Paris atmosphere, and my room was huge by Paris standards. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Morning room service was incredibly fast and cheerfully delivered, and there is the option to eat breakfast downstairs as well. The location is great -- a little off the beaten tourist path but with lots of restaurants and stores nearby, as well as a Metro stop down the block and the lovely Gustave Moreau Museum around the corner. The RoissyBus service from Charles De Gaulle Airport stops within walking distance from the hotel, which is very convenient. My room faced the back of the hotel and didn't have much of a view, but it was very quiet and peaceful. I thought the price was a bargain, given the excellent service and the size of my room. My sole complaint about the room was that the bed was uncomfortable -- the mattress was too firm without much cushioning. Also, unfortunately I do want to report that my purse was stolen from next to me in the breakfast/computer room just off the lobby. This was definitely not the hotel's fault -- it could happen anywhere. But please watch your valuables carefully when you are in the common areas downstairs. The staff was helpful after this theft occurred. I would still recommend Hotel Langlois to anyone and would stay there again. As a solo female traveler, I felt safe there. My only reason for mentioning it is to warn people that they should be careful with their purses and wallets.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Merci to all of the staff at the Hotel Langlois for such a wonderful time. OK - many others have described this piece of traditional old world charm (the large rooms, the dated decor, etc) - but not many recounted their contact with the lady of the house, a most charming Madame who also has a great sense of humour, to staff who like to laugh at their lack of English while you laugh at your own lack of French - the people who create the right atmosphere for those with the sensibility to appreciate the opportunity to avoid yet another cloned Western hotel. One of the stars of the hotel has to be the elevator - cosy, not for those who suffer from claustrophobia - but very quiet and efficient. We have just stayed at the Langlois for five nights and thoroughly appreciated every moment of the experience. Unfortunately, the building next door is being renovated and the resulting noise starts early - but, come on, you are here to sightsee and shop, not sleep in late every morning. Our room faced rue Saint Lazare and while not whisper quiet one was not overtly disturbed as long as you kept the double glazed windows closed. The room was impeccably clean, serviced every day, and we were given a non-smoking room as requested. The location of the hotel near some great brasseries and pastry shops, with the Metro station right on the corner, and fantastic shopping within easy walking distance, make this a perfect spot to stop. If you want a great dinner while staying there, try the Villa Victoria (as recommended by the Hotel). We will most definitely be staying there again.</p></li>

<li>One of the stars of the hotel has to be the elevator - cosy, not for those who suffer from claustrophobia - but very quiet and efficient.</br></br></li>

<li>Our <span style="background-color:#aaffc3" title="p=0.998">room</span> faced rue Saint Lazare and while not whisper quiet one was not overtly disturbed as long as you kept the double glazed windows closed.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived early October and planned to stay six nights.It was the last leg of a very long holiday, 2 months in all. Arrived at CDG airport and decided to be adventurous (for us anyway) and got a train to Paris. Silly move in hindsight especially when you have two kids(8 and 13), two adults and too muych luggage and you have no idea how the train system works. Eventually go to the hotel with the help of a local and checked in. Staff were very nice, no issues at all. Went up to our room (24) and were quite surprised. It was a very nice room. Note that the lift (elevator) only fits one person and two suitcases so you may have to do two or three trips to get all your stuff up if you are a family. Anyway we wanted to do some laundry and found a laundromat up the street (turn right when u leave the hotel, approx 300 metres). Along the same route before u get to the laundromat is a small shop where u can buy lots of other necessities, milk shampoo, fruit etc. For breakfast we had hot chocolate and and some croissants that I bought from the two bakeries nearby. We had that same breakfast for fourdays in a row, we just loved it.....on the fourth day the staff gave us some extra hot choc. and juice....they were very very nice. As for the sleeping arrangements, our kids slept on two fold out beds which were quite good, better than they looked. The hotel exceeded our expectations. The location is perfect (near the Metro), the staff were very good and I wish I was still there........PS: We are from Melb. Australia. If anyone wants to ask specific questions email me and we can chat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Langlois last week for 3 nights on a holiday visit. There were 7 in our party. My husband and I stayed in a double room, while my brother, his wife and their 3 children stayed in a suite which was very reasonably priced for so central a hotel. I had had a lot of trouble finding a budget hotel in central Paris that could accommodate my brother's family in one room, so after much searching on the web was delighted to see the reviews for the Hotel Langlois on this web site and took the chance of booking. We were all very happy with the hotel. It is perfectly situated for sight-seeing, and was within walking distance of the Louvre, Opera, Palais Royale, large department stores, the Roissy Bus, L'Open Tour Bus and Metro. There were a good number of restaurants (French and ethnic) nearby, though I would recommend trying to go further afield if you have a smaller party than ours, as we had difficulty finding any interesting or particularly French culinary treats close by apart from the cake shop next to the hotel and the creperie booth opposite the Trinity church. But the French restaurants nearby did offer good size portions of standard 'pub' fare and were helpful in regard to children's meals. The hotel itself was very clean, the breakfast buffet was fresh and there was plenty of it, and the hotel has obviously gone through a recent refurbishment. There are also many pleasing period features retained throughout the building. Our only complaint was that the rooms were very warm at night. But the weather was unseasonably mild during our stay, so the heating system may not have been able to adjust.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I chose this hotel after reading rave reviews on tripadvisor, and were not disappointed. After confirming our booking, I read a review which stated that room 64 had great views. Chancing my luck I emailed the reservation line, and requested room 64. Of course I recieved the mandatory email informing me that they could not 100% guarantee specific rooms but would try and accomodate us. I did not hold much hope. However, upon arrival I was informed that room 64 was already booked. The receptionist then informed us that she had taken the liberty of up grading us to a suite at no extra cost! As u can imagine we were more than pleased. We stayed in room 24, it was excellent as I smoke, and the added luxury of having a "living room" meant that the bedroom did not smell like an ashtray. the room did overlook the street, but we didn't find traffic noise a problem. We didn't opt for the breakfast. One because we were never up early enough, and two, because we felt it was a little expensive for a few bread rolls. In the morning we grabbed a filled baguette from th nearby stalls and stashed a couple for lunch in our bags. The local franprix was also a saviour and we stocked up on cheap vino! The Gare du Lazare is 5 mins away and will bring you to all the major sights with a transfer or two. Sacre Coeur and the Moulin Rouge are very close and definitely worth a look, however, I would be wary of travelling at night as ladies of the night do frequent the Pigalle district! All in all loved the hotel, very quaint and more than comfortable, close to all attractions and homely. I would definitely stay here again. Photos to be posted.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Langlois in Paris for 4 nights in September 2005. We chose it after reading the reviews in TripAdvisor and can now happily echo the sentiments of the reviewers. Despite the awful exchange rate from Australian dollars to Euros, we decided to take advantage of the relatively low room rates at this hotel by booking a suite for not much more money. It proved to be a great decision, as the rooms were very spacious with really high ceilings, marble fireplaces, antique statues, and large double windows opening out onto a relatively quiet one-way street. The building is quite old and the parquetry floors creaked a little, but the rooms were spotless, the elevator worked, the plumbing was good and the ensuite just fine. The staff were experienced, helping us with our (great many) questions. There was free internet access from a computer in the breakfast/sitting room downstairs. We chose not to pay the little extra for breakfast there, but instead opted to eat out which is what you have to do in Paris. The location was perfect. Everything was within easy reach even by foot, so we walked nearly everywhere. The train station for Versailles was a 10 minute walk. There was a metro station within 200 metres, and a great number of theatres, shops, restaurants, bistrots, cafes, and convenience stores all around. The opera house is nearby as are the 2 famous department stores. We took the metro one memorable evening to Sacre Couer and, after dinner in Montmartre, walked back down the hill to our hotel through interesting lanes via the more "vibrant" Pigalle district (Moulin Rouge, nightclubs, bars, etc) for a rounded view of what makes Paris so... Parisien. We can highly recommend the Hotel Langlois as a central part of anyone's Paris visit.</p></li>

<li>Everything was within easy <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.974">reach</span> even by foot, so we walked nearly everywhere.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.995">train station for Versailles</span> was a 10 minute walk.</br></br></li>
<li>There was a <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.996">metro station</span> within 200 metres, and a great number of theatres, shops, restaurants, bistrots, cafes, and convenience stores all around.</li>

<li>The <span style="background-color:#557585" title="p=0.840">opera house</span> is nearby as are the 2 famous department stores.</br></br></li>
<li>We took the metro one memorable evening to Sacre Couer and, after dinner in Montmartre, walked back down the hill to our hotel through interesting lanes via the more "vibrant" Pigalle district (Moulin Rouge, nightclubs, <span style="background-color:#46f0f0" title="p=0.999">bars</span>, etc) for a rounded view of what makes Paris so...

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here back in June 2008, so bear in mind some of this may have changed, but I'm sure it's relatively unchanged. The Hotel Langlois is a fantastic, affordable, classic Paris hotel. The room we had, which was a two-room suite, was comfortable and large. It had high ceilings, a bathroom that was spacious and clean, and a television with cable. The view was very cool - it looked out onto the front street where every morning we could open the windows and see businessmen and women buzzing about on the streets. Our room was on the third floor, and there is a small elevator, which is unique and beautifully adorned in wood, but it is not necessary to use all the time. The marble stairs are large and on a gentle incline so unless you're on the top floor or unable to use stairs, it isn't a big problem. The service was friendly - the front desk and breakfast staff were helpful and smiled when they saw us. There were free newspapers (The International Herald Tribune) at the desk every morning and breakfast was served in a front room. We ate there a few times but generally went to the corner and had a delicious breakfast at the cafe right there looking out at the plaza. The location is excellent. It's in Paris's 9th district and therefore is convenient to many quintessential Parisian sites and places. There are many excellent restaurants nearby. Also, the hotel is in a location that is not too frequented by tourists, so you feel like a Parisian resident yourself when staying there. The metro is nearby and taxis are plentiful in the area. There is a bike-sharing system at the foot of the street, viewable from the front rooms in the hotel. Overall, it's a relatively affordable and hotel that is unique and filled with character and individuality. You will not find this anywhere else in Paris.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great hotel--if location suits”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed at the Langlois for a week. Here are my impressions: The hotel itself is charming. The room was large by Paris standards and had most of the amenities that I needed--comfortable bed, fresh linens, a small table with 2 chairs, TV, a minibar and air conditioning. There was no safe. The bathrobe was fairly old-fashioned, but everything worked well and there was a bathtub. The only amenties provided were soap, shampoo and a shower cap (besides towels of course). Both rooms were very clean and kept that way. The staff was excellent. They were very helpful with transportation advice and went out of their way to assist us with whatever we needed. We did not eat breakfast in the hotel, so I cannot comment on that. I did not have a laptop, and tried to access the lobby computer a few times. Unfortunately, the connection was sporadic at best and at times did not work. The telephone connection in my room was also problematic and calls got cut off or weren't able to get through. There is construction work being done next door. The hotel volunteered this information when I first contacted them, so I have no complaints to them. The work would begin about 8:00 am, which you might want to take into account. The location is a plus or minus, depending on how you view it. On one hand, the hotel itself is not really near anything, except perhaps Rue Haussemann and the department stores. The Rue Richer area is a 7-10 minute walk.. On the other hand, many sites are within a 15-30 minute walking range. In addition, there is a Metro station right on the corner , and the Metro system in Paris is truly excellent. You can get almost anywhere within a few minutes. I really enjoyed my stay at the Langlois. Next time I might opt for a different location. But if you are willing to walk a lot (and have the time for it) or spend time on the metro, the Langlois is an excellent option.</p></li>
