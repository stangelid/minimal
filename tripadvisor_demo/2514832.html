<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">very helpful and informed staff. great location in the heart of Latin Quarter. We would return again for sure. The only complains, which are small, would be that the walls are rather thin so we could hear conversations in the next room, which was a distraction when some noisy neighbors checked in with a small child. And the wifi was a little unreliable at times. Not major deterrents for us!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here with my wife when I raced in the Chateau Chantilly Triathlon. The staff were really helpful with directions to anywhere that we wanted to and even got up in what seemed the middle of the night to help with my breakfast, including giving me access to the kitchen! It's a great location for sightseeing too as you are round the corner from the Metro and a few minutes walk from the Pantheon and Notre Dame.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We visited the hotel in August 2011 and it was very nice, well located and the decor was very modern. The room was small, quite tight for two people. We didn't do breakfast at the hotel but it looked good. The only small criticism I would have is that it is rather expensive for the size of the room (280 euros per night), luckily we received 3 nights for the price of 2 which made it a bit more reasonable. Apart from this it is great.</p></li>

The rooms are small BUT did not feel cramped at all. They are as beautiful as the pictures show. The receptionists really helped us with our very basic french and helped us with where we wanted to go and how we would ask for certain things The shower is the best I've ever had and we are going to try and copy the layout!!

Pros: *Friendly and helpful staffs! *Great location, close to RER Luxembourg station *Clean rooms Cons: *Very poor internet connection, sometime WiFi signal is on sometime off. when I called the reception, I was told they can not do anything.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our extremely positive experience began even before we arrived with helpful correspondence from the hotel team. Every member of the staff was gracious and helpful upon our arrival and throughout the 5 nights we spent in Paris. Our superior room was attractive and meticulously clean. It was small - we knew this in advance as square meters were posted on the website - but the use of space was well thought out. The bed was very comfortable, and the shower was great. Worth the price we paid!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at Le Petit Paris for 5 nights during our recent trip to Paris. We thoroughly enjoyed the hotel and the staff were very helpful at providing suggestions for authentic dinner spots and shows. Our room was very well appointed and luxurious, albeit teeny-tiny (not entirely unexpected for Europe). The location was good, on the edge of the Latin Quarter, although the walk to many of the tourist attractions (i.e. Eiffel Tower & Champs) sometimes was about an hour. Overall, a very good experience.</p></li>

Finding a reasonably priced (relatively speaking for Paris) and well located hotel in Paris is no easy feat. We loved this hotel. The room was chic, comfortable, and clean. The shower was fantastic. Location was perfect. The room was small, but not unusually so for Europe.

The staff were fantastic and really helpful, we loved the 'honesty' bar. The decor was very unique and modern. I had the best shower I have ever had in my life. Rooms on the small side, but what you would expect for a hotel in central Paris called 'The little Paris Hotel'! Very clean, very good and very lovely. Will most certainly go and stay there again next time we go to Paris!</p></li>

The service from all the staff and owners was very welcoming and helpful and they directed us to some lovely restaurants (Le Perraudin :classic french food - very near and great fillet steaks).

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A beautiful and charming little hotel with perfect location in Paris. It´s walking distance to all kinds of shops and restaurants, both expensive and more affordable (Boulevard St. Germain / St. Michel / rue de Rennes). It´s also walking distance to some of the major attractions and close to the metro which takes you wherever you want in Paris. The staff is incredibly friendly and very helpful. Be aware that the hotel is small, but it is part of the hotel experience at this charming place. The interior design is of the highest quality.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here 4 nights from the 31st of March to the 4th of April 2012. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful - recommending and booking our evening meals for us. Our room was stylishly decorated and very clean, although on the small side. It was on the fourth floor at the back of the Hotel and was very quiet at night. The lounge area downstairs was very homely. They have an honesty bar from 6pm on an evening, which we used for pre-dinner drinks and thought this was a great idea. The hotel is in a good location, within 15 minutes walking to Notre Dame. We would certainly stay here again - and we're not easy to please!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic hotel, extremely helpfull staff who are more than happy to assist with local resturants, taxis, maps etc. On arrival we were upgraded to a Deluxe room, originally booked a Superior so this was a lovely surprise. Room was very comfy and not at all noisy, it was on the 5th floor and over looked the rooftops of Paris with the Eiffel Tower in the distance on a clear day!! The tea & coffee facilities in the hotel lobby are a nice touch and make it feel like home. After 6pm they have an honesty bar which is great when returning after a long day of sight seeing! We loved our time in Paris and the hotel topped it off. We cant wait to return!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here in July and enjoyed it quite a bit. The staff is friendly and accommodating. They are willing to book tours for you and give recommendations (and reserve) good restaurants. The rooms are a bit small, but they are modern and equipped with nice bathrooms. The bed was very comfortable, but it only had a comforter (which I found to be fairly common in European hotels). They have free wifi service, and the room service was pretty reasonably priced. Breakfast was not included, so I didn't try it. Conveniently, there is a laundromat next door, and restaurants within walking distance. I really enjoyed it and would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

Check in and out was quick efficient and the staff helpful and friendly. Only downer was that I could hear my neighbors (once they woke up) and also what seemed like endless noise coming from the cleaner vacuuming the surrounding areas. This place gets a 5 for the design, a 4 for the location, but a 3 for the thin walls</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Le Petit Paris having read the reviews on this site. We arrived early and our room wasn't quite ready so we left our bags with reception who were really helpful. The decor is quite incredible and very stylish. It felt very trendy. We loved the feel of the place and the shared areas. We were quite shocked that our room was quite so small - I guess that is Parisian hotel rooms! It is well located for picking up Velib bikes which we did for 2 days and loved. It is also a great location for some great cafes just down the hill. Overall we would recommend it although with exchange rates it was pricey. It is not a bad location for getting around but not at the heart of the big sights.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is in a great location in the Latin Quarter, close to Notre Dame. The bed was comfortable and the room was on the small size but not uncomfortable. Coffee was free in the afternoons/evenings and in the room there was free soda/water bar (though they forgot to refill the soda the last 2 days we were there). The bath room was pretty but we couldn’t take a shower without water running all over the floor as the shower glass didn’t cover enough. The Staff was very friendly and spoke many languages. The breakfast was a little expensive for what you got so we went out every day. There was a party across the street one night and I thought they were in the room with us but that is not really the hotels fault.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything is brand new and clean. Love the rain shower. It is a really cool boutique hotel where you feel part of Paris instead of a guest in a American mega-chain. Staff is really friendly and helpful. They were able to find us a tailor and describe how to get there very clearly. One downside to the location is that everything nearby closes around 10pm. An upside to this is that everything is more authentic, less crowded and quiet. However, if you are like us, and didn't appropriately adjust to the time difference, asking to leave the hotel at 2am (which is only 8pm EST), you discover that much is closed. There is a lively area (read: clubs) down by Notre Dame, St Michel area but it is very touristy. All in all---LOVED it. Would return in a heart beat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was in Paris to visit my daughter who is studying there. She joined me in the hotel so we got a room with twin beds. We stayed there two nights before we left for Normandy, but loved it so much that we made a reservation to return on Monday night. Yes, the rooms are small by American standards, but they were so well decorated and the space thought out very well. We especially loved the rain forest shower with the sparkle lights. The staff were very accommodating and very polite about speaking English for me. My daughter has already said that if she ever returns to Paris (and not on a student budget), she will stay at this hotel. It was very close to many things and if not, it is close to the Metro. I loved this hotel and found it to be a wonderful home away from home.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I have visited Paris approximately 15 times in the last 2-3 years. We tend to stay in different hotels each time we visit and most recently we stayed for 3 nights at Hotel le Petit Paris. For the price that we paid this is the best hotel in Paris that we have stayed in. The reception staff are friendly and welcoming, the hotel is chic and modern with refined décor throughout. Our room was small which is typical of Parisian hotel rooms but it was also contemporary in design, elegant, extremely comfortable and spotlessly clean. The breakfast is very good and reasonably priced and the hotel is perfectly located, a short walk from the Latin Quarter. I can’t recommend this hotel enough to couples wanting to spend a romantic weekend in the world’s most beautiful city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our relatively small room, with a georgeous balcony had everything that you could possibly need. We stayed in the medieval suite on the fourth floor.The staff were incredibly attentive to our needs at all times. The coffeemaker on the lounge floor was always available and made perfect coffee. The designer furniture on the first floor fits in perfectly with the rest of the hotel without being too much, just perfectly comfy. There was a small malfunction in the shower as the water kept leaking onto the floor and towels were needed to make it passable but it was a small insignificant thing compared to the comfort of the hotel. Absolutely felt like home this hotel and I would reccommend it for both business and leisure. The next trip, work or pleasure will absolutely be at the Le petit paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 3 nights to celebrate my mum's 60th Birthday. The staff were very friendly and made you feel very welcomed. The hotel is small but very cute and they do well with the space. There was 8 of us and we all loved it. We used the living room quite a lot. I broke a cup one day and a girl came straight away to clean it up without me even telling them and she did not make me feel bad or like a pain in any way. The only think i would say as Breakfast did not look like it was worth the money which is way we didn't go there for it. There were lovely places local to eat. You do need to get a tube but it is not bother. Great hotel Lovely Staff. Was perfect for us! So Thank you Hotel Le Petit. If we were in paris we would definitely go there again and we would recommend it to friends.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There are so many things I could say about this hotel. All of them are positive. The staff was gracious and responsive to any request. The room was brand new and lovely. We were traveling with our six year old and the hotel welcomed him warmly. It was quiet. In a good way. The hotel is seemingly off the beaten track, but around the corner from various amenities including a _great_ wine bar. (which the hotel recommended) We liked the vibe of the neighborhood and felt quite comfortable there whether we were "whooping" it up or "vegging" out. It was also an amazing place to come back to after spending breathtaking days and nights out and about. The hotel isn't a scene, but a sophisticated take on being laid back and off beat. It is a hotel to be discovered...go and enjoy. Now...while you can.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for 12 nights during a recent visit to Paris. The trip was originally to be 7 nights, but we were detained in Paris due to airport closings from the Icelandic volcanic ash cloud. The owner extended our stay, and everyone was gracious, accommodating and helpful. The location is terrific - Latin Quarter, near Luxembourg Gardens and Pantheon, a very short walk to the Metro. (! 45' train ride from Charles DeGaulle Airport). Near many ethnic food places too. The hotel is immaculate, modernly furnished and upscale, with state-of-the art bathrooms, TV's, and furnishings. Bed was comfortable as ours at home and we are very particular! Hotel staff knowledgeable about local attractions and restaurants, and always available to help. English is spoken, if necessary. It was a pleasure to stay here!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the location of this hotel and the staff members were very helpful. Great dinner recommendations. The place had the feel of a Bed and Breakfast. (but skip the breakfast, there are lots of choices nearby). Who could beat a spot in the Latin Quarter of Paris near the Luxenbourg Gardens. The rooms are very small, but well engineered. Pocket doors on the shower room and the toilet (seperarte from each other) made the room space more usable, but the space between the bed and the walls never exceeded 1 meter. The free tea and coffee in the lobby at night were great. Soooo... as someone who is used to big hotels and lots of perks, and rooms with lots of space, this was a big change. Still, we eneded up loving this unique spot, and even after 32 years of marriage it was a fun change that literally brought us closer together.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Le Petit Paris Hotel did not disappoint in anyway!!! From the warm welcome on our arrival to the courteous and helpful staff throughout our stay. Nice touches such as umbrellas provided when there was a hint of rain shower. Great Location to the RER B station Luxembourg which is only 5mins walk from Hotel and provides a great link to airport. Rooms are very stylish and the bed was memory foam so a great nights sleep! Free WIFI throughout the stay was a nice touch and the complementary tea and coffee throughout the day was also a great bonus. The 'Honesty' bar was also a great idea. The Hotel has is in a great location to explore with plenty of cafes and restaurants near by while St Michel and St Germain are a 10min walk while Notre Damn is about 15mins. Staff were very helpful in recommending restaurants etc. Would highly recommend the hotel!!!</p></li>

The hotel, location, the rooms (103 & 102), and the cleanliness were all fantastic. We loved the decor and the deep bath tub, not to mention the sparkly lights in the bathroom tiles! The location was quiet, yet 5 minutes walk to the nearest metro and 10 minutes walk to Notre Dame. We cannot say enough about the staff. They were exceptional and went above and beyond helping us make dinner reservations, arranging cars to and from the airport, and even storing our large suitcases while we went to the countryside! Alexandra, Karim, and Benjamin were so helpful and friendly and really helped make our trip outstanding. We will stay here again and will definitely recommend this fantastic hotel to anyone planning a stay in Paris. Thank you so much!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was so impressed with this hotel. You hear so many horror stories about Paris hotels, but Le Petit Paris I cannot fault. It is only small, but so comfortable and friendly. The rooms have great decor and huge comfy beds. I loved the shower and L'Occitane toiletries. The mini-bar is full of soft drinks which are free. In the afternoon free tea and coffee can be found in the salon and in the evening an honesty bar. The location is very good. It is about 3 minutes walk to Luxembourg RER station which is just 3 stops for Gare de Nord so very covenient if arriving on Eurostar. It is within easy walking distance of a number of attractions (Notre-Dame, Pantheon, Musee du Moyen Age, Jardin de Luxembourg....). We did not have breakfast included, but there are lots of creperies, restarants and cafes nearby. I would definately recommend staying here. I'm sure i'll be returning.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiancee and I have just returned from a 3 night stay and were very impressed by this hotel, being a 2 min walk from Luxembourg Metro (on the line from CDG airport) the location is fantastic to explore the Latin quarter or St Germain de Pres by foot. Situated on Rue Saint Jacques which runs parallel to Boulevard Saint-Michel and is literally round the corner from The Pantheon and less than 10 mins walk to Rue Mouffetard where there are many Cafe's, Restaurants and Bars. Notre Dame and the Saint-Michel Metro are only 10 mins walk away. Rooms are petite, but beautifully decorated, very clean, new, fresh and complete with large walk in shower albeit at the expense of having a separate toliet and shower room. The reception staff are very helpful and knowledgable. We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a romantic, well located boutique hotel experience in Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was brought here on a surprise getaway for my 30th birthday and it was fantastic. It was very convenient to get from the airport to the hotel. A 40 minute trip on the RER B and a five minute walk from the Luxembourg stop. The room was tastefully decorated and spotlessly clean. The bed was really comfortable. Free drinks in minibar were great. It was very easy to get a good nights sleep after busy days of sightseeing. The hotel is in a great location for places like Notre Dame and the Pantheon and a short walk to Rue des Ecoles for the 63 bus to the Eiffel Tower. Service was excellent for directions to sights and buses. Receptionist made dinner reservations for us at a nearby restaurant. Laptop available in reception for use of guests and free wireless internet all over hotel. Breakfast was delicious. Free tea and coffee downstairs is great as is the honesty bar. Will definitely return to Hotel le Petit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here with my wife for four days. Room was very cozy and location was very good. The taxi driver did not find the hotel so easily, and spent 10 additional minutes to find it (but did not charge us from the point he got lost). We enjoyed walking down to the Quartier Latin area (5-10 minutes) and the fact the subway station is close. Furniture in the room is very well tought and adequate for the lack of space (common in Paris), and the hotel appears to be brand new. The room had a small (really small) balcony - I always liked spending some time in the balcony in hotels in Paris... it is like being local and being part of that scenario for a while. Indeed, all reviews regarding water leaking from the shower area are true (due to lack of space, the glass dividing the shower and the rest of the bathroom is not big enough). In Paris, a very good choice for the price (stayed before in less atractive hotels paying higher prices).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Highly recommend this hotel... The 5th and 6th are my favourite locations in Paris for a quick getaway. The only problem is that St Germain can become quite touristy (I am fully aware that i am part of the problem!). Le Petit Paris is just off of St Germain about 0.5 miles up rue St Jacques. Perfect walking distance to St Germain, the Pantheon, Jardin Luxembourg, Notre Dame, Montparnasse, need I go on? But it is also far enough away to be in a quiet, relaxed location surrounded by very untouristy bistros and shops. Staff are extremely helpful and speak very good english, just ask them where to go nearby for a good lunch and they will point you in the right direction. Recommendation for dinner - 'Vaganende' on St Germain... walking distance from hotel. Great Belle Epoque style classic French dining. Rooms are small, but this is Paris and that tends to be what you get... they are however very comfortable and the bed is great. Go for it</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at Hotel le Petit Paris for 4 nights for our first anniversary. It was in an absolutely perfect location (Latin Quarter, right near the Luxembourg Gardens and the Pantheon). The front desk staff was extremely accommodating, speak very good English and helped us with dinner reservations, etc. The hotel is very well appointed. We stayed in a deluxe double which was a good size for 2 people. I will say that anything smaller probably would've been a tight fit. The bathroom lights are a nice touch (starry) and our shower (room 403) was amazing. We only had breakfast there one morning but it was a good standard European breakfast and for extra euros, you can order eggs. Just so you know, this is not a value hotel. It is quite expensive, although if you book ahead of time on-line, you can get 20-30% off (which is what we did). All in all, we loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone wanting to explore Paris on foot.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My girlfriend and I were in Paris for 5 days and had a wonderful time. Our incredible experience was due, in no small part, to the exquisite Hotel le Petit Paris and the staff. The Hotel itself is just stunning in its' decor, clean and comfortable, and in a great location. Our room was beautiful, filled with touches of elegance. The bed was so comfortable that we decided to forego the usual wake-up calls while on vacation and just wake up naturally. The staff at Hotel le Petit could not have been nicer. They were very accomodating (they speak several languages fluently) and made us feel like we were part of their wonderful city. All the restaurant recommendations were perfect and any time we had questions about getting around town, they were more than happy to assist us, even printing maps for us to the particular location. We can not wait to go back to Paris and we see no reason to stay anywhere else but this hotel. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE THERE!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This 20 room, boutique hotel in Paris is an oasis in a large city with bustling traffic and busy landmark sites. The staff cannot be more helpful and kind and when we arrived at 8:30 am after a long flight, they juggled the rooms so we could check in early and rest. Then the hostess prepared coffee and breakfast and made us feel welcome and comfortable. Although the rooms are small, each one is decorated differently and they are cheerful, bright and very clean. The bathrooms are modern, with great showers with beautiful star-like lighting set into the bathroom tile. Breakfast was continental, but for a few extra Euros, the breakfast host will make you fresh scrambled eggs or an omelette. In the evening, drinks are available (for a fee). I enjoyed the delicious madeleines after a long day of sightseeing and they were truly delicious. This hotel is special and don't hesitate to stay here. Hurry and book. There are only 20 rooms and word is getting out!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel de le Petit in Paris last summer. It was absolutely wonderful & charming. I only say charming because the room was small, but big in European standards I hear. The entire hotel was kept meticulously clean. The staff were amazing to work with. They helped us arrange a variety of evening activities during our stay, including transportation to & from. They offered to give us "direction" if we didn't know where we wanted to head on any given day, and were very helpful in every way possible. We were at the front desk nearly every day asking questions and they were always happy to help. We felt very fortunate that they were located only a few blocks away from the RER and the Metro. There was a laundry mat just down the block as well, which was great considering we were there for 11 days. I really can't say enough about the tremendous service we received during our stay. When we return to Paris, we will definitely want to stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here for four nights. We had a superior room, 502 on the top floor. The room was not enormous, but within expected parameters for Paris. It was very stylishly done (belle epoque style allegedly I think) and comfortable. Free wifi very welcome, as were juice and soft drinks in minibar, and Occitane toiletries. Some small glitches - a broken light fitting, and shower curtain did not really work so showering caused a large puddle to develop on bathroom floor. Staff were fantastic and welcoming at all times. Tea and coffee facilities downstairs were welcome; honesty bar a nice touch too. Breakfast was reasonable value for 12 euro - the spread was deceptively extensive and it was possible to fill up on pastries, cereal, toast , fruit and so on. Location is absolutely fabulous and atmospheric. I would not exactly describe this as a bargain - we paid 250 euro a night which is certainly not cheap. But we had a very comfortable and enjoyable time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of 4, 2 12 year olds, stayed at the Hotel Le Petit Paris for 3 nights before traveling to the south on a canal barge tour. Our flight was delayed from NY and we arrived shortly before 2. Although check in time is not until later, it would have been nice to get into our room and relax for a few minutes before we did the bike tour, which was fabulous! We did change and use the facilities in the basement before going on our afternoon adventure. Again, it was okay but expected more than a bathroom and a small open floor space. Upon returning that evening, our bags were in the room but the room was extremely tiny. Barely enough room to walk around the beds but the quality of everything in the room was very nice. Great colors, nice fixtures, etc. Location is great! Front staff was fine but nothing exceptional. Actually pretty plain vanilla as they were there to greet and that's about it. So, all in all, nice but I think you could do better for a top rated hotel.</p></li>

<li>Although check in time is not until later, it would have been <span style="background-color:#e6194b">nice</span> to get into our room and relax for a few minutes before we did the <span style="background-color:#e6194b">bike tour</span>, which was fabulous!</br></br></li>
<li>We did change and use the facilities in the basement before going on our afternoon adventure.</br></br></li>
<li>Again, it was okay but expected more than a <span style="background-color:#808000">bathroom</span> and a <span style="background-color:#808000">small</span> open floor space.</br></br></li>
<li>Upon returning that evening, our bags were in the <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">room</span> but the room was <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">extremely tiny</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>Barely enough room to walk around the beds but the <span style="background-color:#f032e6">quality</span> of <span style="background-color:#f032e6">everything</span> in the room was very nice.</li>

<li><span style="background-color:#e6194b">Location</span> is <span style="background-color:#e6194b">great</span>!</br></br></li>

<li>Actually pretty plain vanilla as they were there to greet and that's about it.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I did like this hotel but there were a few niggles which if straightend out, could make it a fabulous hotel. The location and service were excellent. However, a previous reviewer mentioned that the shower leaked and it appears that this has not been rectified as the whole bathroom was flooded continuously when you took a shower. The lock on the bathroom door also broke so my husband was stuck in the bathroom for 20 minutes upon arriving at the hotel which wasn't ideal! Although the manager was quick to respond when I went to get him. Also, there were two single mattresses with a double sheet over the top. This was quite uncomfortable as the mattresses kept separating and moving around. We also found the breakfast to be very expensive. A much better idea is to pop along to one of the lovely patisseries and buy your breakfast there instead for a fraction of the price. It is such a shame we experienced these problems as we really had high hopes for this hotel as it has such good reviews on TripAdvisor.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Returning to this boutique hotel having first visited when it had just opened 2 years ago, I was very pleased to see that the standard of both the accommodation and the service had not dropped in any way at all. The staff were, without exception, friendly, helpful and patient with all our requests however peculiar! They answered all our endless questions, made meal reservations for us, looked up obscure addresses, printed off maps and routes etc etc whilst at the same time providing us with as much tea, coffee, water and soft drinks as we could consume - all free of charge. Little touches such as this make a stay that bit more enjoyable. After a long day's walking, returning to the comfortable lobby of le Petit Paris for tea (or a glass of wine from the honesty bar) is like coming home. The individually decorated rooms are quirky and comfortable and it is very quiet for such a convenient location - Notre Dame 8 mins walk away and plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance. We will certainly return here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights - 21st to 24th July. Had spoken to them over the phone and sent an e-mail that I needed a very quiet room (I had seen a review by customers who had had a problem with construction noise) - I was assured that would not be a problem! At 7.00 a.m. the next morning I knew it was going to be a problem. When I complained I was told there were no other rooms available - they offered me a free breakfast. My option was to find another hotel, but we were there for such a short time, I didn't want to spend it trying to find somewhere else to stay. Very unsatisfactory. Also our room was classified "Courtyard" - if you leant out the window and looked down you could see the courtyard, way below - the room should have been classified "rooftop". Despite the above - the rooms were extremely clean and bright and comfortable, albeit a little small. The bathroom was very pretty, but the shower did leak all over the floor. I might return to this hotel - good location - but I would need a written confirmation that their would be no construction close by.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this rather 'mod' hotel in Paris last year and returned for three days this month. While small hotel rooms are the norm in Paris (and this is no exception) such modern comfort is unusual. Additionally, it is the welcome hospitality of the staff who man this establishment and the high standard they have maintained in the fit out that will see us return (I am sure), yet again. The availability of tea and coffee in the comfortable lounge in the afternoon, or even a champagne or cognac before dinner or bed is most welcome (run on an honesty bar basis). While our room overlooked rue Saint Jacques, it was surprisingly quiet - we even overslept a couple of times! Karim, who manned the reception over the weekend could not do enough for us and was genuinely helpful in booking restaurants, cars and even witnessed a business document that required urgent faxing home. The hotel is also in my opinion, perfectly positioned around the corner from the Luxembourg Gardens and the Pantheon, walking distance to all the other highlights, shopping, and remarkably quiet as well.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went to Paris on a clothes shopping citytrip and also wanted to visit Versailles. The "Le Petit Paris" was chosen based on Tripadvisor rating, and frankly fulfilled all our wishes: it's a new hotel in a few old houses, looks very trendy, a lot of thought has been put in several small decoration details (the LED lighting in the bathrooms has already been mentioned), beds are very good. From your arrival, the impression you get is very good, with perfect reception service as well at night (we arrived around 23h) as during daytime. We had room 103, and like all rooms on that floor rooms are small, yet all you need is there. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant, just a breakfast area, yet just accross the street you have several good choice restaurants. And the location is great to do many things in Paris: we walked from the hotel towards the Pantheon, then by the university to the Notre Dame, to end up in the shopping area at rue de Rennes. All of that by foot, no need for taxi. So we consider this hotel as a little gem, hidden in Paris. Not cheap, yet delivering perfect value for money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Being non french speaking Australians we encountered, from our early morning arrival to the end of our 4 day stay, friendly, helpful staff. The language barrier was not a problem, all had a good understanding of English. Our first discovery; their exceptional coffee maker followed by delicious breakfasts. The availability of all day tea or coffee making facilities in the Breakfast area and the honor bar at night made our stay pleasurable. We enjoyed our themed pink '60's room, very fitting for our 40th wedding anniversary celebrations. A little small, but it is Paris. It is situated in a good location easy walking to the metro, great shops, museums, gardens and cafes. We felt safe walking at night. The front desk kindly arranged our bus tour to Normandy, printed out a Google map for our walking adventure to Sacre Coeur, and it was never a trouble for then to call us a cab when needed. Best liked the decor and color scheme of reception and the idea of themed rooms. Least liked the lack of storage space in the bathroom. Will definitely recommend to family and friends and look forward to returning.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed 3 nights in Hotel Le Petit Paris and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Our room was on the small side but that I believe is virtually universal in Paris hotels and perfectly adequate for a short stay. The space available was utilised optimally and thus the room didn't feel cramped in any way. Our bed was comfortable and fitted with quality linen.The space in the public areas was also very well used to provide a welcoming space to have breakfast, a coffee or a drink. The staff were helpful, professional and spoke excellent English. Our room was in the small annexe at the back of the hotel so we had no road noise at all, on the contrary it was very quiet. Finally we really liked the location. It was an easy walk to many attractions including Notre Dame, Louvre, Musee D' Orsay. It is extremely convenient in terms of access to the airport, it being a 35 minute RER journey followed by couple of minutes walk from the Luxembourg RER station. There are also more than enough quality restaurants and bistros in the area I really can't find anything bad to say about this place! well worth a stay</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel exceeded our expectations which were already set fairly high from all the previous reviews. It couldn't be easier to reach from the airport, straight on RER B and then maximum 5 minute walk. Location is great, we were lucky to have lovely weather and so to have the luxumbourg gardens so close is a bonus. Its also a short walk to the metro, and some lovely bistro's and restaurants. We used the metro a fair bit but also managed to see a lot of the sights by foot. The hotel itself is perfect and as advertised on their website. Our room was spotlessly clean on arrival and was kept this was by the daily maid service. The staff were helpful and friendly at all times and offered advise when we asked about where was nice to eat in the area etc. The honesty bar is a great touch and we enjoyed using this before/after dinner. The decor of the hotel is immaculate and well thought out, we found our room practical as well as visually appealing. The free drinks in the mini bar is a rare find and was appreciated. Fabulous shower and ample space in the room for our suitcases. We will most definitely return and would highly recommend.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great boutique hotel near the Sorbonne”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We picked the Hotel Le Petit Paris as a good location for our stop-over before flying back home from Charles de Gaulle. We flew into Paris via Orly, so this was one of the more readily accessible locations to both airports via public transit. We always look for good value "boutique" hotels when we travel, realizing we are going to spend little time in the room, but still not wanting the chain hotel feel. Le Petit Paris fit the bill perfectly, combining period and modern furnishings, all with a very new feel. Our room was plush, with all the amenities, complemented by a very modern (split) bathroom (see photos). The truly king size bed does cramp the room, but was much appreciated. A small balcony, with seating, allowed us to enjoy Paris the last night of our 3-week trip. Continental breakfast is not included as part of the price, but we took advantage of it anyway. It was adequate, with good quality ingredients, but not very lavish. The staff was very helpful, giving us a great tip on local dining, and otherwise tending to our requests. For expensive Paris, we felt the Hotel Le Petit Paris was a very reasonable value. It met every expectation and gave us a few surprising extras.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Really nice hotel, staff could not do enough-thank you Laticia and Alexandra. Contempary chic design with nice entrance lobby area. Spotless, shiny and new.We were informed the Hotel only opened in Sept 09 and that may be the reason for a few unfortunate teething problems. 1) Shower leaks through door and onto floor and is a pain, mopping after a shower with towels-not much fun. 2) Lack of storage is an issue, could be sorted with a chest of drawers, also no bathroom cabinet, mirror steams up, needs a heated mirror, yep I am fussy but at two-three hundred euros a night.......... These issues are a bit of a surprise to me as there has been major investment in the building and very chic/classy decor, but it is early days and staff informed me that works to fix the shower/s were being carried out just after Christmas. Definitely good for two people, not sure about three in a room, apparently they have a bigger triple room? Gave me discount on checking out, thank you, staff were very apologetic and aware of the issues and I have no doubt they will address same asap. Good place to stay, overall Paris is kinda pricy compared to London, but what an amazing city if you havn`t been dont miss it!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We (married couple and teenage daughter) found Le Petit Paris absolutely to our taste. It is a small, friendly, well located hotel. The rooms were confortable and stylish. My daughter was delighted with her seventies themed room and we were happy with our medieval style room. The staff well all very helpful and friendly and all had good English. The buffet breakfast was good and we particularly appreciated the availablity of tea or coffee through the afternoon and evening in the downstairs lounge area -- my daughter loved the hanging spherical chair. This was a very pleasant place to relax after a day walking around Paris or in the later evening after dinner. Location on the Rue St Jaques near the Pantheon is good. The RER is conveniently near for longer distances, but the Ile de Cite is just ten minutes walk away, good restaurants near at hand -- we eat a couple of times at a very pleasant Italian restaurant just two doors down and another twice at a good French restaurant only about four minutes away. An excellent little hotel. (I add in parenthesis that our initial booking did not work and the hotel were generous in the way they dealt with the problem and compensated us for our inconvenience.)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in Hotel Le Petit Paris for 6 nights for our honeymoon. We found the hotel very conveniently located. It's right in the heart of the Latin Quartier (5th arrondissement) and we were within walking distance to the Panthéon, Jardin du Luxembourg, Église St-Sulpice, Notre Dame... 15 minutes walk from the hotel brought us to St-Germain, where we found plenty of good restaurants and cafés. The closest subway station to the hotel is the RER line, Luxembourg. Despite the frequent delays, it was the most efficient way to get around the city. Service was impeccable. The staff are friendly and very helpful. They were always happy to recommend places to eat and they certainly recommended well! MUST TRY: Le Comptoir du Panthéon! Clean cosy room with modern deco and a really really comfortable bed. The free self-service afternoon tea at the hotel lobby was a good idea. Every day we would stop for a little refreshment while planning for the rest of the evening itinerary. The only downside is the room was quite small and the bathroom floor gets flooded after each shower. Will I recommend this hotel? Yes, it's a good value if you wish to be centrally located in a small boutique hotel. Will I come back? Definitely!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just returned from spending 9 nights here in August for our Honeymoon. We had a nice clean room, it was small like everyone said but that was expected so that is not a complaint on my end. Who ever happened to be at the front desk was always helpful when ever we had questions. They clean your room every day...and really want to. We were on our honeymoon so relaxing was part of our stay and a mix of jet lag kept us in our room later in the day. Front desk will call you to ask if you want your room cleaned or anything done to the room. Even when the DND sign is on the door..and you can hear the cleaning lady because she vacuums the hall way too. So that wasn't the best..but oh well. I also remember someone leaving a review about saying you could only connect one device to their wireless. Well when we checked in they asked how many devices we had I said one. Later I remembered I could also use my phone for wireless and I went down stairs and they gladly gave me a second login for that device. They have drinks they leave in their mini bar in the room, which is not a fridge at all... We might stay here again, but if we go back I think I'll pick another area to stay in just to explore more of another area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went to Paris for a long weekend to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary, and selected le Petit Paris on the basis of tripadvisor reviews. We were very satisfied, even though it's probably the most I've ever paid per square foot! The location is great, just a couple minutes walk from Luxembourg RER, thus very convenient to CDG airport, and of course in the Latin Quarter, and very convenient to everywhere in Paris. We stayed in a "standard room", which was quite small, and facing the rear courtyard, but very nicely appointed. As others have commented, the sparkly lighting in the bathroom is a lot of fun. It may well be worth spending a bit more for one of the somewhat larger rooms. I really loved the map-of-Paris carpeting in the halls and stairwell! Service was really excellent, competent and friendly. Anything we wanted, we got: advice on the neighborhood and restaurants, and even use of the office computer to copy some memory cards for my camera. Breakfast was very nice, and at 10 Euros, a better deal than many hotels of this class. Another nice and un-advertised touch: a self-service "honesty bar" serving glasses of wine, etc., in the evening. I highly recommend small boutique hotels like this, when they're this good.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed in this lovely boutique hotel late May, 2011. On arrival we were met by very pleasant and welcoming staff. The lounge/breakfast room on the ground floor decor is contemporary and very relaxing, with tea and coffee available, which we found very refreshing after returning to the hotel from a very busy day sightseeing! Although our room was on the small side it was quiet, spotlessly clean and comfortable, and had everything we required including a small table and 2 comfortable armchairs, the bed was very comfortable with lovely clean, crisp linen. The en suite was a nice size, which included a full bath with shower, with lovely toiletries! The toilet was separate from the bathroom, a big plus. Another big plus was the air-conditioning, it was very hot in Paris during our stay, and returning to a beautifully cool room was a pleasure not to be taken for granted in Paris!! Breakfast was fresh and plentiful, with fruit, cereal, yogurt, toast and tea or coffee. The Hotel is located near The Luxembourg Gardens and is handy to the RER, with excellent restaurants and bistros within walking distance – ask reception for their recommendations. We highly recommend Hotel Le Petite Paris and would happily stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have just returned from the Hotel Le Petit after spending 2 days there. This hotel is very lovely and brilliant. The rooms are small but they’re well designed and comfortable. My room is decorated by the red color and grey - boutique style. The bathroom with the L'occitane toiletries and twinkling lights are amazing. It made me feel better after 8 hours flight. I absolutely like the curtain with creative and attractive patterns in my room. The bed coverings and towels were changed daily. The best thing here is the mini-bar which is always full of soft drinks. And they’re free! Moreover, in the evening, about 6pm, unlimited tea, coffee were available in the lounge area with a honesty bar. The hotel staff were so helpful, enthusiastic. There were nothing much troubles while staying here. Besides, the hotel is in a good location, it’s very easy on walking to other places such as Dame, Pantheon, Musee du Moyen Age, Jardin de Luxembourg… It was so magical to have dinner in the room which had a view of the Eifel Tower outside my window. I was totally conquered by the beauty and the convenience here. If I have a chance to come to Paris again, I will choose this hotel to enjoy the wonderful atmosphere as well as the the L'occitane toiletries again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel not only has a fantastic location just 5 Min's walk to the Luxembourg RER station which is just 3 stops 10 Min's from Gard de Nord station for Euro star arrivals. Small & friendly, boutique hotel with a fantastic design in all area's. This Hotel has the WOW factor in huge quantities. Our room was on the top floor (5th) room 501 i was preparing myself for a tiny room after reading previous T.A. reviews but on arrival we were pleasantly surprised on how much space we had. The room, decor & furnishings breath quality. I have never slept in such a comfy bed before, the pillows were heavenly. We didn't have any problem connecting with the Internet. The shower was fantastic, really lovely toiletries & fluffy white towels.Cleanliness gets a 10/10. We booked through Thomas cook & received a good discount but unfortunately their room description is a little wrong, there is no espresso machine in the room, in fact this was the only thing that we missed Tea & coffee facilities in the room, but if you are desperate for a cuppa you can buy one before noon from the lounge or help yourself to free tea or coffee after noon. We did have a mini bar in the room full of soft drinks.I would definately recommend this to couples, friends & family members of ours when staying in Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the moment I entered this lovely hotel, I was treated like gold by the helpful staff (unfortunately I have forgotten the name of the incredibly handsome young man who made me feel very welcome and assisted me wherever possible). I was fortunate to be upgraded to a Deluxe room and if I were to return I would definitely pay the extra to secure this standard of room. It was gorgeous and I could even see about a third of the Eiffel tower! For my first time in Paris this made it so special. I cannnot fault the room and was exactly to my taste, fluffy robes, slippers, comfortable bed linen - and the bathroom with the inset lights in the shower was magical. I was on my own but didn't feel lonely at all. I am usually a room service breakfast kind of person (to spare everyone my hideous morning face!) but I made the exception to enjoy the wonderful ambience of the cute breakfast room - everything was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced - freshly squeezed orange juice was such a nice touch. I appreciated the location and was able to walk everywhere - even to the Eiffel Tower which seemed to be quite a distance away. I will definitely return with my daughter next year. Thank you to the staff for making it easy by speaking to me in English and being so helpful - if only I could have stayed longer...</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Partner and I decided to spend New Year in Paris and after searching on the website, this hotel kept coming up and we liked the look of it. We were not disappointed, the pictures just do not do it justice. We stayed in room 103, the Louise XV suite. The room was immaculately clean. The bed was huge and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. There was a delightful shower with gorgeous romantic lighting. There was a safe and a mini bar in the room. There was no tea and coffee making facilities but you did not need this as you could have tea and coffee in the lobby downstairs at all hours of the day. On arrival which was the 31st December 2010 (new years eve) at around 8.30 the member of staff on reception was amzing. He booked us into a fabulous restaurant two minutes down the street called Le Parraudin. Would recommend the goats cheese profiteroles. It was an absolute bargain for 3 courses at 29 euros and it was new years eve. The hotel is around the corner from the Luxembourg gardens which are worth a stroll around and the nearest metro is just around the corner Luxembourg again. Down the road about 10 mins walk is notre dame. We would definitely stay there again as the hotel had everything we wanted. Some reviews have said it is small hotel and yes it is but that it what a boutique hotel is all about.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “our new favourite hotel in paris”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Paris is our favourite city and we travel there at least once or twice a year from Dublin. We have stayed in lots of hotels, generally 3 star boutique hotels that tend to be more interesting than the boring, corporate style in the expensive 5 star hotels where you could be in any city in the world. The amenities in this type of hotel tend to be limited, but that's fine by us - we are there to see Paris, not sit in the hotel all day. In this hotel there isn't actually even room service (although they had a bottle of Champage waiting on ice in my room on arrival, as requested) - there is an 'Honesty Bar' where you take what you want and fill in a form that they collect and bill you for when you're paying at the end of your stay. This is our new favourite hotel in Paris. It's small and modern, brand new and near to lots of nice restaurants, bars, shops, metro, etc. The hotel is obviously very new, but the staff were literally more helpful than in any other hotel i've stayed in europe - nothing was too much trouble. While the bedroom was small, it was very well equipped, and the decor (every bedroom is different) was really nice. We stayed in the 'medievil' style room on the top floor and it was really fantastic. In short, I couldn't recommend this hotel enough, if you don't mind the 'cosyness' of this type of 3 star hotel in Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When I first saw the pictures on trip advisor, I thought it looked very tacky and old-fashioned. but i saw all the great reviews so thought i'd give it a try. upon arrival, i realized how wrong i was. i was thoroughly impressed with the design and attention to details. the place was gorgeous and the tackiness i originally thought was actually ultra trendy... i felt i was in an art gallery and each room has its own unique look and feel. it makes you want to check out each room. the room i wanted was not available until the second day, and the only one available on day 1 was the two-story suite. i paid significantly more, but it was definitely nice. the room i stayed in the other 3 days was also pretty amazing. i'm writing this review 6 months after my stay and my memories include: the tasty coffee in the lobby, room scent, tv in the shower, the wallpapers, and even the hotel's basement bathroom. most memorable is the awesome staff whose helpfulness seemed so sincere despite my many annoying requests and the various internet searches i had requested. note, this is no hilton or marriot with huge lobbies, conference rooms and tons of staff running around everywhere. it's a cozy boutique hotel with a lot of character. it's special and in a class of its own. also, check out the actual hotel website... the photos there seems to do it better justice.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My mother and I stayed 3 nights here in August 2011.We (and I) have stayed in a handful of other Paris hotels,but I would say this was the best by some margin. It is small,quiet(it is fair to say that we were staying in August when many local shops and bars nearby were closed,but by no means all),beautifully and quirkily decorated,very clean and with a charming front desk reception.It felt laid back but also of high standard service-wise. The lounge area includes free tea and coffee after midday,a cute outdoor courtyard,and then in the evening an honesty bar,where you serve yourself and fill out a form to charge it to your own room later. I loved the modern bathroom with its twinkly lights and the shower with option of overhead and/or handheld spray. The beds were comfortable,and the aircon perfect and easy to use.Twin beds always seem to be v narrow in hotels,but it was fine. The area is full of local individual shops,small convenience stores, bars,cafes and bistros.Luxembourg RER is close by, just a few stops to Gare du Nord.The Metro (Maubert Mutualite) is a bit more of a walk,about 15/20 mins,perhaps not one for those who don't like hills(up on the way back!) Bus no 84 to Musee d'Orsay/St Germain and Le Madeleine leaves from the Pantheon nearby. I almost wish I hadn't written this review,as I hope this hotel retains its air of a secret "little gem"!If you want large grandeur,a huge lobby and thriving bar,this won't be for you,but for comfort,style and friendliness it is superb.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A cold weekend in paris but a warm stay at this design hotel...”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a couple, we wanted a central location in a smaller, boutique hotel as we were only in Paris for 2 nights. As others have said on here, it is completly understandable (and deserved) as to why the hotel is ranked so high; the staff are very helpful, the decor is impressive, and you really feel like you are in your own boutique parisian paradise. That being said, our overall 'very good' rating just misses out on 'excellent' due to a couple of relatively minor points, most of which can easily be rectified as the hotel grows older (it is only recently opened). Namely, Valentines weekend in Paris was extremely cold (negative degrees) and unfortunately one evening our air con just wouldnt stop blowing cold air into our room- we called reception who, while very polite, couldnt help rectify the problem. Fortunately the duvets in the room are both extremely comfortable and very warm, so we managed! The minor detail points referenced above include having an electrical socket near the shower (!), missing towel racks, no place to put amentities while showering, and a broken light (wires hanging out). These can be forgiven as the hotel is finding its feet, but still need to be rectified - a standout hotel is one that pays attention to all the little details. Those comments, however, did not take away from a fantastic stay- we were near a ton of boulangeries which all make fantastic bread, some very nice bistro's as well as the Jardin du luxembourg. Yes- the hotel is near a subway. But i implore you- dont get on it..WALK..this is a beautiful city.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Love this hotel-but it is "petit"”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently had a great four night stay here and would highly recommend this hotel. But be aware of a few things up front: It does indeed live up to it's name as the "Petit" Hotel. I've stayed in many European hotels and this was, by far, the smallest room I've ever experienced. We chose a "classic" room and we struggled to fit suitcases for both me and my husband in the room. If you are travelling with two or more people, choose one of the choices other than the "classic" room because it really is only big enough for one person. That said, if you can get past the room size, it's a great place to stay. The location is perfect. Close to all the sites and two blocks from shops and a wide selection of restaurants. The rooms and the hotel overall have some really fun, modern decor. The rooms are very clean. The bed are exceptionally comfortable and the bathrooms have awesome "rain showers". The breakfast is an extra 12 euros but is very good. Wonderful French coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice (best I've had outside Florida) and a good selection of fruit, breads and yogurt. The best part of the hotel was the staff. They all speak very good English and are exceptionally helpful and friendly with restaurant recommendations and tour bookings. We also had no issues leaving our large luggage for a two day side trip to Normandy. When we returned for our last night in Paris, the staff knew we were a little disappointed in our small room for the first few nights, so they put is in a deluxe room for the same price as the classic room. A very nice touch.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a BRILLIANT EXPERIENCE this HOTELwas for us. We availed of their 3 for 2 night special in Superior Rooms - each room was individually decorated with beautiful furnishings, a huge bed and A THEME - ours was MEDIEVAL. From the moment we stepped into the hotel, which is only 3 minutes walk from RER B line straight from Charles de Gaulle Airport we knew we had chosen wisely. The STAFF were clearly interested in us and gave us lots of help during our stay, the room was cleaned daily, the towels were huge and fluffy and the toiletries in the Bathroom were first class. The Bathroom is something else with a Fantastic Shower with water coming from the ceiling - what luxury - easily the Best we have experienced in Paris ever. Location wise the hotel is on one of the oldest streets 'La Rue St Jacques' parallel with The Boulevard St Michel and the Luxembourg Gardens - its full of lovely restaurants, bars and patisserie shops - it takes 10 minutes to walk to Notre Dame Cathedral and 2 minutes to The Pantheon. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR LUXURY AT REALLY GREAT PRICES FOR THE CITY OF LIGHT WE RECOMMEND THIS FANTASTIC HOTEL - IT HAS EVERYTHING YOU COULD WISH FOR, Remember that old saying that you only stay in the hotel at night - DON'T BELIEVE IT - everyone needs a lovely hotel to come back to after an exhausting day sightseeing in Paris and when we came back in the evenings we sat in our lovely breakfast area and had complementary Tea and Coffee and a great chat about what we did that day. OVERALL THIS HOTEL OFFERS EVERYTHING YOU COULD WISH FOR AND WE WILL RETURN ASAP.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Arrived at Hotel le Petit Paris at 11a.m after an overnight flight from NYC. Laetitia from the front desk immediately tried to get us in our rooms. While we sat and waited for 20 minutes she brought us a bottle of Evian and offered us coffee. Just the beginning of a wonderful weekend of service. Our rooms were beautiful. One room on the first floor was decorated in beautiful shades of pinks. The other room on the 4th floor with a terrace was perfect in shades of green. The terrace was a small area with 2 chairs with many leafy plants. The view was up and down Rue Saint Jacques. What a great spot to drink our bottle of champagne sent from friends at home. The rooms weren't huge but we had plenty of space. Yes, the shower walls are not designed that well so you often times have mini floods on the bathroom floors but the showers were wonderful with excellent water pressure. The honor bar was a great idea. We used it almost every night before and after we went out to dinner. On our last night after returning from a late dinner, we sat in the lobby with other guests from Australia till 3:30 am. The gentleman at the front desk never acted like he was put out to be cleaning up our glasses at that hour. And the prices for drinks at the honor bar are beyond reasonable. Overall, I can not say enough about this wonderful boutique hotel in the heart of Paris. You will not feel like tourists when you step out the front door. You will feel like this is your Paris neighborhood as you walk off to buy something at the boulangerie or patisserie a few doors down. Can't wait to go back!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at le petit paris for 3 nights between xmas and New Year and absolutely loved it! On arrival Alexandra greeted us and was extremely helpful in making restaurant bookings and advising us on where to go. Our room (104) was on the small side but had some clever design making the most of the space available. It was exceptionally clean (with housekeeping visiting our room each day), very comfortable, quiet and very chic. The bathroom was gorgeous with a rainfall style power shower which was good and essential after being out in the cold sightseeing all day! The location of the hotel is good, a short walk to many bars and restaurants, the pantheon and Luxembourg gardens, and only a few mins away from the metro station which gave us easy access to all the must see sites in Paris. There’s an honesty bar at the hotel which we used (although a little pricey but that’s no different to anywhere in Paris) but the tea and coffee was free which was good as there wasn’t a facility to make hot drinks in our room. We had a little difficulty finding the hotel so here’s a (hopefully) useful tip – as you come out of Luxembourg metro station (if you come up the escalator exit Rue Gay Lussac) walk straight ahead, cross the junction and turn right at McDonalds. Walk up this road and then turn right once you reach Crepes a Gogo on your left (which is a good place for breakfast), walk along this street and after a short while the hotel is on your right. We’d definitely stay at this hotel again if on a return visit to Paris and we’d recommend it to others as during our stay we couldn't find fault with it.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at Hotel le Petit Paris for a week on our honeymoon, and we could not have chosen a better place. As a first-timer to Paris, I felt that the hotel was perfect- the whole atmosphere of the place was very cute, friendly and accommodating. The location is great, very close to the RER and metro lines, with plenty of great restaurants in the area. It made it very easy to explore the Latin quarter and all of Paris. Getting there from the airport using the public transit was surprisingly easy; we just took the RER all the way to the station a block or two away from the hotel. The concierge were very nice and friendly, spoke several different languages, and were very helpful in recommending restaurants, sites to see, and overall tips for a first-timer to Paris. They have a really useful free pocket map of Paris that we could not have done without. The little outside garden and indoor lounge are lovely, especially to have breakfast or the very good free tea and madeleines they provide in. The rooms are small, as expected with a typical Parisien hotel, but what they lack for in space, they more than make up for in the luxurious towels, bed, sheets, comforters, toiletries, shower. Our shower had both a detachable shower head and a lovely, relaxing rain head, with sparkling little lights within the tiles. The decor of the room was well thought out, unique, and comfortable at the same time. Housekeeping was very good and always kept us well-stocked with free juices and water in our mini-fridge and L'Occitane toiletries. We had an amazing time here and will be staying here the next time we're in Paris.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 4 nights after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor. We definitely were not disappointed! After a quick journey on RER B from Gare du Nord we arrived mid afternoon to a welcoming reception. The receptionist gave us a map of Paris and some useful bits of information and said if we had any specific questions to just ask at reception. We had planned our trip before arriving and so we didn't have too many questions but I heard them helping many other guests whilst we were there. We had booked the 3 nights for the price of 2 deal with breakfast included and we had been upgraded to a superior room. Our room was 70s themed and pink and white. Yes the room is small (but I think the clue is in the name of the hotel!) but everything is very well thought out and there is enough storage space if you are organised. The bathroom was amazing! The shower was huge and had 2 shower heads - 1 from the ceiling and 1 from a portable showerhead also. The twinkly lights in the grout of the tiles were beautiful. I see some people had mentioned the showers leaking - my o/h found the shower did leak a little but I didn't have that problem. Breakfast was downstairs in the "study" area and was a lovely continental breakfast with fruit, yoghurt, cereals, toast and pastries. We certainly had no complaints. The hotel is in a really good location, we found that we walked to most of the sights. The batobus stop is down beside Notredam which we took when we went to the Eiffel Tower. After a hard days sightseeing we enjoyed coming back to the hotel and sitting in the study area to enjoy the complimentary tea and coffee before heading out for dinner. We would thoroughly recommend le Petit Paris to anyone visiting Paris and had a wonderful trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Has anyone ever looked at a hotel website and thought you found the perfect place and booked it, only to be very disappointed when you arrive at the hotel. This was not the case with Hotel le Petite Paris. Hotel le Petite Paris was perfection in every way. The front dest staff Alexandra, Laetitia and Karim were amazing and extemely helpful with every request i had for them. Since my travels to Paris are work related and my comand of the French language is good but not great, having a helpful and attentive front desk is key and their was no request too large or small for these guys. Now if your a fan of contemporary design, this is the place for you. Often when a hotel goes in the direction of contemporary they lack a charm and warmth. The designers of this hotel have done a terrific job at maintaining warmth and still keeping it very cool and hip, as for my room as far as Paris rooms are concerned this room was the perfect size for one or two travelers. the decor was a lovely golden yellow and browns set against cream. I was also thrilled to see I had a view of the Eifel Tower out my window. The bed was very comfortable and after a long day of work and sight seeing it was a great place to come back to. Did I mention the bathroom? Plenty of towels, full size bath sheets, face cloths this is usally not the case in Paris hotels. This is the norm at the Hotel le Petite Paris. L'Occitane bath products were a lovely touch as well. The neighborhood embodies Paris perfection in the Latin Quater, the metro is very close by and there are a number of bistros and great ethnic restaurants right outside the front door. One in particular was a Tapas Resturant with a fun, young student vibe, simple menu and yummy sangria. The owner Tomas was the ultimate host. Nothing like the Latin Quater to make one feel very french and part of a community. With all the above being said, I have finally found my home in Paris. Hotel Le Petite Paris.</p></li>
