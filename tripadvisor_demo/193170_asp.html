<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you expect to pay 2* prices and get 4* value, you'd be disappointed. On the other hand, having paid 60 pounds for a clean room, very comfortable bed, renovated bathroom and reasonable breakfast - warrants a 4 star review in my opinion. However the reviews which referred to room and bathroom size are right: they were indeed small - and when sitting on the loo one's knees bumped into the sink.</p></li>

Continental breakfast was disappointing as you get toast,croissants, cereal, tea or coffee, so not really continental. Location of hotel was good as you were close to local shops & restaurants & 2 tube stations, didn't take long to travel to see the sights in the centre of London.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lots of the reviews we can relate to..Dirty carpets, random fire alarm, dis-interestest staff, small lift, noise from the street, but I reckon I can trumph them all. We had a MOIUSE in our room (311) on our first night!! Obviously, he was not impressed by the 'continental' breakfast because he went for our bag of mini eggs and had a good munch. Found a massive (by mouse standards) hole in the wall in the morning. Told staff...didn't even ask our room number. Bunged the hole with tissue as the hotel made no attempt to fill it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Don't expect any fancy frills with this hotel, the rooms are very small but clean and you can hear all the goings on outside and if it is windy expect the curtains to blow even with the windows closed. The reception staff are very friendly and will do there best to help but as for the rest they can be quite rude. breakfast is very poor, there are bread rolls with only jam to go in it and cereal thats about it. However it is very well located and if you are only planning to sleep there and not spend any time there it is a great place to stay.</p></li>

Do not take it on BB basis - breakfast in awful... awful is even not the word....just round the corner there is good irish pub... better have breakfast there. In general if u are not ready to pay real fortune to stay in hotel facing hyde park and u come to london for sightseeing - then this is perfect hotel for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A small hotel with one of the smallest elevators I have ever seen. The bathroom smelled so bad it woke us up in the middle of the night. The cleaning lady folded wet towels, which led to damp and cold towels to dry us the day after. For breakfast they served toast with jam or cheese, traditional english breakfast directly from cans. Nothing but the scrambled eggs were home made or fresh. The building site just outside our window was active from 7 am friday, saturday and sunday. The fact that sheets and showers were clean prevent me from rate the hotel Terrible.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stay away from this hotel, this is probably the best advice you can get. The rooms are very small as are the beds. You have to be very much in love to sleep in the so-called double bed. The bathroom was nice except for no hot water in the morning. Breakfast also is ok if you love toast. Some of the staff are very nice and helpfull but a few of them seems to have studied at Fawlty Towers. The hotels only real asset is its prime location close to the tube, busses and restaurants in quuensway but there are lot of better hotels only slightly more expensive in the area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel, at short notice, through Expedia based on the cost and their description. It was truly horrible. The description made the place seem good and mentioned cable TV, free newspapers, bar/lounge and much more - well it has none of these. The room I had was tatty and disgusting. The main fabric of the hotel could not have been redecorated or refurnished for decades - dirty carpets, peeling stained paintwork etc. I can see that if you paid perhaps Â£20, it might be just about worth it but at Â£100 definitely not. The DIY breakfast was the only part that was just about OK.</p></li>

We were not expecting too much from this hotel after reading the reviews but we were very happy with everything. Clean beds ,clean bathroom towels etc. If your very picky under the beds could have been hoovered better. Breakfast, you just grab a table and help yourself to the usual coffee ,tea, tinned fruit, cereal, toast and croisant. Breakfast staff not interactive at all. We were an floors 1 and 2 so used the stairs and think we were lucky to have quiet neighbours or none at all. Over all good location, comfortable if small rooms and would certainly book again.

Considering the location (so close to numerous 'sights' in the heart of London) it was a good price. Yes, the rooms are small but well equipped. New bathroom/shower and freshly painted walls only spoilt by the carelessness of previous guests appearing to scrape their luggage along them and leaving dirty marks. Good choices for a continental breakfast. Downside undoubtedly the lift - far too small and rather ancient - and only one working. Unable to use our room safe as it had been locked by a previous guest on leaving and no-one was available on reception to unlock it for us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in feb. When we booked i was nervous at what we would find because of all the bad reviews. But i can honestly say it was fine. We had a double room which was tiny but it was clean with an on-suite. Booking direct through the hotel web-site we only paid Â£40 per night including breakfast. The Breakfast was basic with cereals, croissants, toast, tea, coffee and juice it was all fine. The location was brilliant very close to tube and right next to hyde park. I would definatley stay there again and would recommend it to friends. I think some of the reviews are a bit harsh as its only a 2 star and for Â£40 you can't expect the ritz.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel at the last minute as needed to be in London for just one night, and seeing as the cost of the stay was within my budget decided to go for it. The location is fine for the money and the hotel/room was clean. Was disappointed in the overall standard of the room. It was in dire need of a makeover: scuffed marks on the walls, the bathroom door had a hole in it, no bedside light, matress was worn out and only ONE bedsheet between and the matress itself (shouldn't there be a matress protector or something??). The TV remote didn't work. I didn't complain as was only there for one night so on this occasion the hotel served its purpose... and as they say you get what you pay for.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Queens Park Hotel for one night and to be honest it was one night too many. Our original room the window catch was broken. We were moved to another room but the rooms are tiny and the shower was more of a drip. Certainly no good to wash in. There was major road works going on directly outside the hotel causing a lot of dust and noise but none of this was mentioned when we booked the hotel. The continental breafast was stale, cheap bread which you had to toast yourself or tinned fruit. We ended up sitting in the lobby of the hotel eating what little we could stomach as the tiny dining area was full. Not an enjoyable experience and would certainly never go back to this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room with twin beds was clean and comfortable. Bathroom small but plenty big enough for one at at time. Staff extraordinarily helpful. We got as many towels as we wanted immediately. Sheets were changed twice during our 6 day stay, continental breakfast was fine. Good coffee! The only noise was from the Youth Hostel across the street and they weren't that bad. It is summer after all....It was great to be so near the Park, the Tube (2 stations), lots of restaurants and Whitbeys. After reading so many bad reviews, I too, was prepared to move but I guess people only write letters of complaint, not praise. I don't know what the others expected for the price, but my friend and I felt we had good value for the money.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked through superbreak for a 2 night theatre package. Wonderful greeting at reception, helpful staff. Small room as we would expect in central London but clean with everything we needed in it, comfy bed and an impressive shower in a newly updated en-suite bathroom. Quiet at night, although the fire alarm went off quite early in the morning but was quickly stopped and we were able to get back to sleep. Breakfast was basic but plenty of choice. Internet available. Lovely area with a park at the end of the road with nice walks into London past Kennsington Palace and Princess Diana Memorial fountain. Local shops and restraunts at the other end of the street and 2 tube lines within a 2 minute walk, location could not be better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I travel a lot and I'm not picky when it comes to hotels, but this place was probably one of my worst hotel experience. I stayed there in 2 different rooms, one facing the front street was small and ok. The second room I stayed was facing the back street, bigger but nasty. The carpet and the bed were just so old and scary. I felt itchy the whole night. I'm used to talk on carpet without shoes, but there I was scared to walk around without shoes. The bed was just too old and so uncomfortable. Breakfast was the worst compare to all my other stays in Europe, just some bread and can fruits. Location wise it's pretty nice, very close walk to subway station, park and lots of shopping and food around, yet it's on a very quiet street.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are used to north american hotel standards, this is probably not the hotel for you. The decor is pretty trashy and the linens look and feel like they were purchased in the 1970's. There is peeling wallpaper and stained furniture in both the lobby and the hotel rooms themselves. Not the best place I've stayed but not totally repulsive either. Basically, you pay for what you get and in this case given the cheap price, it's no wonder that it didn't feel like I was staying in a four-star hotel. They rate themselves as being a three-star hotel but do not be fooled by this - it is really more like a glorified one-star hotel to be honest. Stay here if you need to save a buck! Elevator was out of order when we arrived, but location can't be beat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is great value for money and it was busy everday of our 4 day stay so I'm not the only one to think this. Our room was tiny but there is so much to do in London that we were barely in the room at all, however it was very clean and even had a tv for catching up on the weather reports. The hotel is located 5 minutes walk from the nearest tube and the bus was 2 mins outside the door and took you straight into Picadilly Circus and Oxford Street. The hotel is just across the road from Kensington Park great for an early morning stroll. The only downside we found about the hotel was that most of the staff were foreign and didn't have a lot of local knowledge to advise us on buses, sightseeing, etc but we managed to figure things out by ourselves ok.</p></li>

As I first walked into the hotel, I saw a mouse in the breakfast room...no wonder why; the vacuum cleaner remained in the hall, unused during my whole stay (5 nights).I guess a lot of guests must have seen it long before I did... Our key-cards didn't work most of the times and we had to go down all the way to the lobby to have them reprogrammed. Apart from that, lovely neighbourhood, two tube stations nearby and Hyde Park of course. If you don't mind packing your own sheets and towels, then this hotel is all right, I guess..</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I made the mistake of reading the generally dreadful reviews on this hotel after booking and paying for a room. I wasn't therefore expecting anything except an argument with the hotel about the dozen unacceptable problems that I anticipated. However, for the GBP 37.50 I paid (for a hotel in an excellent London location) for a double room including breakfast, there was precious little to complain about. The room (501) was warm, clean, freshly decorated, reasonably furnished and quite spacious. Ok, the carpets in the public areas were a little threadbare and the lift (one working out of two) was fine only for anorexic midgets but, on the basis of my experience this hotel represents good value for money. Really, you can do very much worse than this for the same money or more.</p></li>

On the eve of our visit I read the reviews whilst looking up the location in order to find out how to get there. I immediately booked an alternative hotel as I did not want to put our health at risk by staying there. I contacted Superbreak asking them to cancel my booking and refund my hotel bill. On my return I also contacted First Choice. Neither organisation has replied to my e-mails. They have not even attempted to refute the claims on Tripadvisor, leaving me with the only view that as long as they have your money they do not care where they locate you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We (young married couple) stayed at Queens Park Hotel for 3 nights August 10-13 2007. We got dbl room on the basement floor. It was great, because we didn't need to use an elevator at all and the room wasn't hot at all, although it was August. The room is small, but VERY clean, the bathroom is VERY clean, which is the first pripority for me. There is a bath, 4 towels - 2 small & 2 big, change towels EVERY DAY. There is a private safe in the room, as well as tea & coffee faciities. The breakfast was poor, but it was enough for me for 51 pound per room per night. The staff is very friendly, very nice. You can buy tours and excursions directly from the consierge & you can also book shuttle service from the hotel to Stansted airport for only 12.5 pounds per person. I would definetely stayed again in this hotel</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">'I stayed there with my friends for a few days. The reception was helpful, friendly and the rooms were tidy and clean. I missed the breakfast but that didn't bother me much. Good location... Hyde Park is around the corner and I was able to walk to Oxford St. too. Pricing was very reasonable for London. You really get what you pay for... it's not a 5 star Â£300 a night hotel and so I didn't expect to get a lot of amenities. The main thing for me was that the rooms were clean and comfortable. My only complaint is that the "concierge" was never there when needed. We waited a long time until he came to help us with the tickets for a bus tour in the morning and he didn't seen very attentive when we wanted to pick up our bags either. That really irked me... if you hate your job then leave and get another one... don't make my vacation more hassle.</p></li>

We continued on to go and see our room, waiting for the lift, the geenral cleanliness was horrific. dirty walls , door knobs, dirty handprints all over walls. as we walked to the rooms the floor was even sinking! Got tot he damp smelling room. Dirty looking bed covers with blankets you wouldnt even use for the farm animals.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I, travelling alone with my 8 and 11 year old daughters, stayed at this hotel for two nights. We ended ut in a tripleroom in the basement, with a view of some kind of storage room full of crap (why do they even bother to put a window in the room?) We could hear the underground in our room, but ok we can live with that ;) The room smelled funny when we first got there but we got used to it after a while... There were no bedlights, and being in the basement with no natural light either, in the morning it was a little adventure to walk trought the room to switch on the lamps. The breakfast was very poor, basically coffÃ©e, tea, juice and toast with jam. I have been to London several times and are usually not so picky but this is a place where I would never stay again! The bathroom locked nice thought, but don't touch anything because it will fall down on you ;)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiancee and I stayed at this hotel and I'd have to say, its the worst hotel I've ever been in. 1st off, the rooms are small. When I say small, I mean 100 sq.ft. if you are lucky. Then throw in a bed (might as well be a block of wood), the dresser, your luggage, and soon after you check in, you'll be looking for a new hotel. Just trust myself and many others, do not waste your money or time or ruin a good vacation with a crappy room from this hotel. Ohh yeah, did I mention the elevator that is only big enough for 1 person (2 if your super skinny) at one time? But if you do decide to not heed this warning, just print out my review and take it with you. Put it in the section of your travel-book titled (London Hotels). I want to make sure you read my review when you go looking for a new hotel. Not to make the review all negative, I will say at least the hotel is only a short walk from a Tube Stop.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was a couple of years since we stayed here, but seemingly from the other reviews this hotel is still as bad as it was. The room we stayed in was old, tatty and unattractive. The whole room just felt grubby and dingy. The shower room was awful - peeling wallpaper and damp walls. The breakfast was awful - you had to go down into the dining room and help yourself from the meagre selection of white bread and jam and cheap ham and cheese. You had to queue to use the one toaster and when the few plates on the side had gone and we stuck our head in the kitchen to ask for another, the girl grumpily pointed to the just washed ones on the side of the sink and made us dry them ourselves! After the first day we preferred to eat breakfast in a cafe. I know this hotel is cheap, but it was so miserable staying there. I am sure there us better at this price in London - the handy location of this in no way makes up for the standard of the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel charges a lot of money because of its location....but it really is not worth the cost. As past reviewers have noted, there is a lot to be wary about, and although I found it alright for a short stay, I know there are better options out there. The lifts were coffin cramped and slow, so I negoiated the badly labelled staircases, wandering around steps and floors until I got to my room. The room itself was very good - a bit cramped but I am on my own so it wasn't that bad. The bathroom had not been cleaned that well, and it was very small. "Breakfast" really did live up to the name "fast" - the bread/fruit/cereal selection would have been a scandal were it not so laughable. Saying all this, I really would not bad mouth the hotel too much - it is great for three tube lines, and almost every bus is on the main route into Oxford Street or Westminster. It is a good location for the shopping and pubs outside Queensway station itself.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I wish I could say this was the best hotel I have stayed at but that would not be true. I booked two doubles for two nights and a single for one night, on arrival we had to spend first night in basement room for 4 as the two doubles were not available, the basement room was supposed to be a superior room but in fact was anything but. Second night had two double rooms one of which was very small, upon entering this room I thought it was a single as the bed was so small. Some of the furniture in the rooms we used was falling apart and some of the beds were very lumpy. On arrival at the hotel one lift was out of action the other was exceedingly small. The continental breakfast was not the best meal I have ever had. On the plus side the location was fine for our purposes, not to far from queens park underground station. The area was pleasant and close to Hyde Park. At the price we paid for the rooms, Â£55 for a double per night, you could say we got what we paid for.</p></li>

The moment we checked in, wee were welcomed by friendly staff, courteuos concierge who took our luggage right up to the room and showed us the room. When entering the room we were satisfied with the condition, the room seemed recently refubished. The ameneties all there as advertised. The staff were extremely responsive and the housekeeping department were always good. We paid a fair price for what we had received and included breakfast which was very good. Consisted of a full continental breakfast which had a good variety. The hotel was in good condition, the staff were extremely friendly and the location was fantastic, really is in the centre of London with Hyde Park only accross the road and underground stations nearby. Buses also pass through this area. All in all, my husband and I really enjoyed our stay. The only downide was the the lifts were small, but they were in good working order.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 3 people in two rooms, but saw 3 rooms. The rooms were very, very small, in one room the 2 doors couldn't open because of the bed. Worse were the mattresses: it felt like lying on metal wires, which was excactly what we did - awfull (the staff told us that all beds were the same). My father asked for a lamp and a chair for some evening reading, but was told after asking several times: we don't have chairs in the rooms, it is not hotel policy - funny because there was a chair in the other room... The toilet papir stood on the floor and the shower hose was leaking. Our safe didn't work, the staff figured it was due to a used up battery, but it was never fixed. Breakfast was very uninspiring: two types of marmelade of the cheapest kind, no cheese, no honey, no bacon and eggs, just the same boring tree types of bread, one type of cereal, bad juice, milk, coffee and tea. Not very friendly either, always started removing our plates ect. before we were finished.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband & I stayed here in December 2011. I had read the reviews on here & some are comically bad so I was a tad apprehensive about what we were letting ourselves in for. However, we are of the opinion that all you will do is sleep & shower in the hotel so if these bits are ok then thats good enough for us. We were pleasantly surprised. The room although small was big enough for both him & me to move about & spread our belongings about. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was absolutely fine. I cannot honestly find one thing to complain about & really can't see what other peoples problems are. The breakfast room did get full quite quickly but we soon worked out the best time to go to avoid everyone else. The best thing I think though was the lift, it is beyond tiny. My hubby is a big guy, but I'm small & we just about mananged to squeeze ourselves in laughing all the way up. All in all we have a great stay not one thing wrong with the place. We would stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have just stayed at the hotel sharing a twin room with my son, to be honest my son was paying, so the price was important. The hotel reminded me of one from Blackpool, with upgrades going on all the time. Our room was on the 4th floor, I went up in the lift once only, which only fits two people, the other lift was broken, and as I have seen from past reviews has been for a while. The stairs are very narrow and the upper floors feel clostrophobic as you climb, the floors are on a downward slope, even the mattress on our beds. But the rooms where very clean and comfortable and for the price I was very happy. If I was a family with small children I would ask for a room on the first floor. We did not find the bar on arriving back at 10pm which was disappointing, but managed to get a bottle of water from reception. The restaurant was not open on the Thursday evening we arrived, and next day at breakfast it was, make your own toast, no cloths on tables and not very helpful at all.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When we came in, there were other customers complaining at the reception. We soon would learn why. Although we arrived nearly at 3pm, our rooms were not ready yet, and the receptionist declined to make a firm statement when they would be. They were also impolite to rude. In the rooms, the light in the bathroom was broken. As was the trashbin. The toiletseat was swollen up with some mold on the underside. The bed was clean and the room was small but acceptable. When trying to call the reception one evening, first they did not take up the phone, then they actually picked up the reciever just to put it down again, instead of answering. I would never visit that hotel again. With friendly staff, this would have been an OK stay, but this way, you felt unwelcome and spending your money for keeping the wrong people in employ. The breakfast was simple but sufficient, baked beans, sausages, egg, toast, jam, butter, and yoghurt and croissants. Nice sliced oranges, too. The street was quite loud outside, with renovations going on next door.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My stay in this hotel was great. I went with my couple on holidays and we were very happpy. The staff of the hotel were very helpful with us, but one thing was that they didn't make the effort of speaking to me slowler unless they notice to be foreigner. But this is not a problem at all. The room was clean, small but clean. Only one problem the last day, the cleaner cleaned the spoons on the bathroom and put them again inside the cups, like news!! well, it's not good for this kind of hotel... The location of the hotel was perfect, near notting hill, near the tube, a lot of shops near, resaturants... The only seriously problem that I had was that they asked me for a credit card number because it was something broken when I leave. And they return me the money 3 weeks after I came back to Spain and because I went to the travel agency to say that they didn't return me the money. If not, they woudn't return me the money!! The breakfast was not good at all, but it's English breakfast! The coffee was water not coffee!! But, I recomended you to stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Queens Park Hotel, London 48 Queensborough Terrace, Bayswater, London A real nightmare.!!! This hotel NEEDS DECORATING. Dirty rooms. Window whoch opened max 6 inches. Bedroom: Thin pillow & very terrible beds, hard and very lumpy broken bed. Curtains were so old and dirty. Poor standard and wall paper and borders was peeling off. Beaten up lampshade. Bedrooms are shabby and carpet dampish smell. The bathroom was tiny. Hair dryer broken. The halls were narrow and hard to navigate. Very noisy from early in the morning by staff in reception. Very small breakfast. Cornflakes and soggy toast with jam, coffee/tea and juice and fruit cocktail. No cheese or egg. VERY basic â€œContinental Breakfastâ€�. No facilities to buy food. Confirmation promised a daily paper - receptionist informed me this has been discontinued for the past three years! Would strongly recommend people do NOT stay there In my experience, this is no way a 3-star hotel Hotel a real nightmare. !!! These observations refer to rooms 108 and 120 when we would be moved for the second night. Not value for money at all!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Shocked when we arrived, exterior looked good as in various websites but first room given was so small and dirty, no kettle and socket not fixed to wall properly. Old tatty blankets, totally horrid and not as in photos etc........delapidated to say the least. Lifts are extremely small and paper peeling as well as paint in halls, rooms, reception etc. Second room offered was larger with net curtains half hanging, huge stains on carpet, broken bin and tv remote control, shower door wouldnt shut properly and all very tatty with writing on the wall, paint flaking and very dated......dirty and one looked out to see if cockroaches or fleas would appear. Window in both rooms delapidated and whole hotel appeared dirty and tired, huge clumps of hair balls on stairways. Didnt expect luxury at Â£84.50 per night but did expect it to be clean and tidy and as in the photos. Attended for a business party nearby so returned to room at 1am and left at 6am without daring to eat incase the kitchen reflected the rest of the hotel. Very upset at the misleading details shown on websites regarding this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this place as it seemed in a good location and was reasonably priced and it looked OK from the pictures and description on various websites I browsed before deciding.First impressions were not good, old, tatty reception, resturaunt was closed for refurbishment which was supposed to be completed 2 weeks before we stayed. The lifts were so small you couldnt fit 2 people in with luggage so we went to the 4th floor by stairs. the corridors are so narrow that you cant pass another person with luggage without one person giving way.the whole place is grubby and tired. The " lavish" room we were staying in was supposed to be "recently refurbished" with sat TV, radio, trouser press and other stuff that wasnt there.It was pokey, grubby, the shower was useless, the bathroom was so small you had the sink right over you when you sat down.The toilet seat was broken and brerakfast was in a paper bag in the room due to refurb. I imagine now that the refurb has probably been completed this will not make a blind bit of difference. Now the good bits....er er none apart for location and thats it. AVOID</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I got the hotel through Hotwire and was very concerned by some of the reviews here, however, the hotel was fine. It is not a luxury hotel, but was clean, color flat screen tv, bed was fine, telephone, modern private bathroom, nice armoire, very small room but not uncomfortably small, desk, coffee maker, hairdryer. Tiny lift and slightly bigger lift. Breakfast of toast, croissants, rolls, sliced fruit, orange juice, grapefruit juice, 2 kinds of cereal, coffee, milk, tea. (Wish they'd had, even a bowl of plain yogurt for some additional protein). Great location. Get off at the Queesnway tube stop, walk towards Kennsington Gardens, turn left, 2 blocks to Queensborough Terrace. Hotel is on the far side of the street. Very reasonable for a safe place in this great location. Probably Hotwire gives the 1/2 extra star for the location? In this price range your only other choice is out at Heathrow which means spending time and the overpriced tube cost to get in and out of the city everyday. If you want a luxury hotel, this is not the place for you, but for a low cost place from which to see London, it's fine.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Date :9th July 2011 We booked this hotel for just one night based on its availability and location in Central London. Even though this Hotel is Centraly located - it has to have possibly the worst rooms we have ever stayed in. The room had space for only one person to move around - though we has asked for a family room for 4. This was supposed to be the big size. It had space for only one small suitcase, a tiny window close to the ceiling (which had no value). However, it did have a TV wall mounted. The toilet was okay. From a cleanliness point of view, it would just about pass the mark. The elevator was so small - that we had to go down 4 times to get the luggage all up and the corridor to the room would be a protential fire hazard. It would be hard for a person and luggage to move through that. The only thing that was nice about the Hotel - was the breakfast and the staff. The breakfast was a full English breakfast and the staff were friendly and helpful specially with the kids. If you have any other alternative Hotel to stay in, in Central London, please do not book here. It is just not worth it. It had also had no WIFI.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at this hotel in the past. It was ok then but certainly nothing speicial. First time back for nearly a year or so. The hotel has gone through some significant changes since my last visit. The communal areas have gone though a significant upgrade. The lobby and breakfast area is now vastly improved and the rooms seem to have been upgraded as well. Whilst my double room was compact the bathroom was surprisingly larger than expected and the room had coffee/tea making facilities, a flat screen tv and newish furnishings. Hotel also offers wi-fi in your room (at a nominal cost). Staff are very pleasant particularly the lady receptionist who greeted me. Full breakfast buffet is also included within the price which was very popular with the guests. All in all a very pleasant surprise. Will most definitely look to stay at this hotel again. Finally there seem to be some fantastic deals to stay here at the moment. Look at the various hotel search engines. I am sure the price will start to go up as the year progresses. I certainly would have expected to have paid a lot more for the services that were on offer so I am certainly not complaining.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked a deal through superbreaks with rail and 3 nights in queens park hotel, I must admit I was a little nervous after reading some of the reviews but had a lovely stay! First of all it is in an excellent location, Hyde park across the road and 2 tube stations less than 5 mins walk away, which was perfect for getting about and doing all the sightseeing! When we first arrived the staff were really friendly and were very helpful throughout our stay. We were in room 319 which is in the recently refurbished part of the hotel, the room was brilliant! I had read that the rooms were small but there was plenty of space with a decent size double bed and even a little kitchenette :) the bathroom had a good shower, was always warm and plenty of water pressure! We had breakfast only once as we ate out most mornings, the breakfast was ok, simple buffet with hot items (but we didn't pay for it so didn't mind not eating there every morning) So basically I would recommend this hotel for location and also great value (we paid Â£165 each for rail travel and 3 nights stay) thoroughly enjoyed the trip to London and was made even more enjoyable by a comfortable stay :D</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Service was terrible staff didnt understand what we were saying and very unhelpful. On arrival we found the lift was tiny, only one person could use at a time. After walk up 3 flights of stairs with our luggage we discover we were given a different room from the one we ordered. Eventually managed to get a triple room, which was small. The sheets had blood on, the mattresses were stained and ripped, the pillows were stained, curtains were hanging off the rails and in the tiny bathroom the curtain didnt even cover the whole window so people could see in. The room had not been dusted for a long time as there was dirt and dust in the window sill and on top of the lamps on the wall. There is no bar as advertised, no lounge, and breakfast was awful with no advertisement of the cooked breakfast you could order. A member of staff twice tried to come into our room whilst we were still in bed in the morning. The lobby floor was covered in chewing gum, and there was sick outside the main entrance. As for sat tv, we had 4 channels and 1 of those wasnt clear, no wi fi in rooms when I asked about the internet I was told it was Â£2 for an hour to use a computer in the main lobby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Queens Park hotel london, having read reviews prior to our trip, we were pleasantly surprised that our room although small was clean and well laid out. The hotel service was however non existent. The lifts were working prior to check in then mysteriously hand written notes appeared stating both were out of order. The stairs are very steep, I was grateful our room was ONLY on the 3rd and not the 5th floor. There appeared to be no visable sign of these being repaired. The complimentary newspaper was unavailable on request as was room service despite being advertised. The breakfast in the foyer looked ok however when we arrived 20 minutes prior to deadline there was an absence of hot drinks and the staff had disappeared. The location of the hotel is superb and to be fair we were hardly in our room at all, it was an annoyance that the service was so poor. I would recommend the bayswater area for excellent bars and restaurants, do check out the indoor shopping centre, great cinema and restaurants on the upper floors. It is a vibrant area and not expensive. As for Queenspark if you are relatively fit and indifferent to the staff give it a go,at a discounted rate only.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Firstly I would like to start by saying that when I contacted the hotel via e mail requesting a room without carpets and one with windows that open onto a road, my request was honoured. My husband and I were very disappointed with the shabbiness of the hotel reception and the fact that only one lift was working as the other lift was out of order since before 23rdJuly 2010 as a note on the 5th floor had a paper attached to the lift promising the clients that the lift will be in order by then. The only lift in operation was about one and a half feet deep by four feet wide. The room was very very clean but so small that there was a small table on one side of the bed. The room had no air condition nor a fan and the weather was quite warm in the twenties. On departure we were asked to pay for leaving our suitcases in a safe place and this was never quoted on their website. Breakfast was consisting of canned fruit salad, bread, jams and fruit juice. I dont think that we got value for money and would never recommend this hotel to anyone. When I complained with both the receptionist and the gentleman who looks after the tours all I got from this gentleman was that one can never please everyone.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pictures of the lobby, outside, and "restaurant" are very misleading. This is definitely a low budget hotel. The restaurant is really only open for breakfast. The staff is no way overly friendly, although we did have a very meticulous maid. Our key card failed to let us into our room twice, the second time beacuse we were trying to get into our room 5 minutes after check-out time. As we were on the 5th floor and the elevator trip probably takes a minute a floor, this was extremely annoying. The shower setup was very strange- there was a ledge between the tub and the wall the shower head was on. There was no remote for the TV and the Channel Up button on the TV, which turns it on, was missing. The matress was absolutely disgusting. It looked very yellow and old and was very hard. There was an extra blanket undeneath the sheet being used as a matress pad. The location is very nice, though- most convenient to the Queensway Tube station (just redone) and Kensington Park. The area seemed very safe, even late at night, and we didn't have any trouble sleeping through any street noise with our window open all night. I would not stay here again unless I was on a very, very tight budget and needed to be in this area of London.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A friendly staff that really tries. Rooms are small as is typical for this area of London. You need to bring your own travel alarm as there is no radio/alarm in the room although the wake up service is prompt. I agree the lifts are small, one person and luggage is about it. Continental breakfast is very adequate, you may order up eggs and other hot items at additional cost, if the continental is not included in your rate. Rooms are clean, water pressure is terrific, hot hot water flows and the in room instant coffee is really good.. Despite it having 120 rooms, very quiet hotel as well as the neighborhood. Two blocks from Queensway tube stop (Central red line) and many places to eat nearby. Although lacking a bar, no problem sitting out on the stoop and having a glass of wine or a beer purchased half a block away at the Shell station (very good adequate selection). If you care to go a little more upscale for a cocktail,hotels within couple hundered yards have bars. Only 4 or 6 rooms have air conditioning at additional cost of 10 pounds, but it's London and you rarely need it. Excellent location off of Hyde Park. This is not an upscale hotel, as is typical for this part of London, just a basic clean place to sleep and a good value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was a little leery of the Queen's Park after reading the reviews, but after staying there for three nights, I really don't understand the issues people have had there. Yes, it's small, but how much room does one need to sleep in and if you aren't asleep, why would you spend time in your hotel room when you could be out exploring London? Yes, the floor is creaky, but this is not surprising given the age of the building. We were not on the top floor and had people above us, and the creaking was not significant enough to bother us at all. The hotel was undergoing renovations, when I was there mid March 2011, but this progress was not obtrusive in any way. The hotel was clean, in a fantastic location near a tube station, restaurants and a grocery store and a huge, hot English breakfast was available each morning in the breakfast room. The staff was friendly and helpful. Note: the pictures on the Trip Adviser website of the teeny tiny elevator, are totally accurate -- it was hilarious. Four people could only fit in that elevator if two people were standing on the shoulders of two other people. There is however a second larger elevator right next to the tiny one if you are claustrophobic. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I must have stayed in about 10 different hotels in London at the cheaper end of the market, and I can only think of one better - and it has now put its prices up. The one thing that can be guaranteed about these hotels is that the rooms will be small. Very small. Tiny. The Queens Park is trying its best to improve itself. The reception area is lovely, the breakfast area is pleasant, and the rooms have obviously been recently decorated. The scaffolding at the front may be inconvenient for some but clearly to paint the facade it has to be there. I booked three rooms for ourselves, our friends and our son and we had a great stay. The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable. The bathrooms were en-suite - great! The breakfast was by no means gourmet but it was quite acceptable and left us satisfied and looking forward to the day. Lets face it, no-one goes to London to spend hours sat in a hotel. The staff were fine. The lifts were tiny - but they were there, and were a giggle really! We've had to drag suitcases up three flights of steep, narrow stairs before now. The location couldn't be better with easy access to just about anywhere. So my advice would be to stay at the Queens Park, don't expect pallacial rooms but get out and enjoy that great city!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">stayed here for a weekend with friends never again! Upon arrival there were four guests at the reception voicing loud complaints about their rooms. We arrived at 11am and were told we could not check in till two 'o' clock. Eventually when we did check in we were given room 108, which was absolutely filthy. The wallaper was peeling off the walls, ceiling was black with damp, filthy curtains, carpet, and dirty blankets on the bed! The bathroom had been cleaned though, but the overpowering smell of bleach made our eyes water. The bath was ancient, and was so high I nearly needed a forklift truck to get into it. No plugs for the bath or handbasin, so no choices, had to use the stoneage shower which was over the bath and kept falling off the wall! Upon complaining to reception staff we were moved to room 103 which was only about 1% better. Continental breakfast consisted of brown or white soggy toast, the cheapest brand cornflakes or rice crispies, and tinned fruit. The piece de resistance was the rude, brusque, noisy, and utterly unsociable breakfast staff! Be warned, never, ever stay at this "hotel", a term I would use very loosely, wormwood scrubs would be cleaner, and the prison warders probably more friendly! Dont know how this dump was ever awarded three stars.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was a little concerned about staying here after reading some of the reviews, but after having stayed here was pleasantly surprised. It's a budget hotel and you get way you pay for. If you are expecting 5 star accomodations at a 2 star rate, you're setting yourself up for disapointment. The size of the room is typical of a European hotel, not very big but enough space to move around. In order to watch TV, we had to ask for a remote control from the front desk. The breakfast room was the nicest area of the hotel, having recently been remodeled. The breakfast was good and there was plenty of food each morning. The elevators are small which is also typical, so not very surprising. I fit a huge suitcase, a small carry-on suitcase and myself just fine. The walls in our room were rather thin, so we could hear our neighbors which would be an issue if I wasn't such a heavy sleeper. The hot water does go in and out a bit, but it never got so cold that it was unconfortable or unbearable. The best part of the hotel is the location, just around the corner from the Queensway tube stop. The Bayswater tube stop is also close as is a bus stop. Plenty of restaurants and souvenir shops around the corner as well as grocery stores. Overall it's a decent hotel for the price. Could use some updating, but it's functional and in a prime location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">By far our worst hotel experience in London: We booked this hotel after seeing pictures and description at the hotel's own website. The room was very small and so was the bed: Actually the bed was so short that I (1m83cm) had to lie diagonal in order to bee there. No duvets were present, but one bedsheet and blanket for sharing. Amongst others, the hotel webside promised "flat screen LCD television" but it was some 14" old fashion tv with only three channels and no working remote. It also promised a trousers press which were there, but it was visibly broken. Bathroom was also very small and toilet cistern was extremely slow to refill. The continental breakfast did not contain what I would call "a selection" of cereals as stated on the hotel website. It contained of cornflakes and one type of oatmeals or the like. None of the promised fruit or juices were present. We were woken several times as the firealarm - according to the staff when we asked about it - went off everytime someone took a cigarette somewhere at the hotel. Hence we ended up in not taking the alarm seriously. Lifts were of very poor quality and actually we trembled out of the lift the first time as it didn't quite reach the level of one of the floors, but was missing a few inches. The staff didn't greet when guests were coming or going, but seemed rather resigned.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel on a theatre break booked through a seperate company. Although the staff on reception were polite and helpful this was all forgotten once we arrived in the VERY TINY room. This was situated in the basement, next to the conference room. This seriously needed redecorating and was kitted out with batterd and scratched IKEA furniture. The walls were covered in scuff marks and the window latch was broken causing a constant draft throughout the night. The curtains were hanging off the rail and the TV did not have a remote control. I was assured by the reception staff that someone from maintenance would be down to look at the window and curtains, but they didn't materialise. However, despite the disgusting state of the room, the hotel is in an excellent location and very close to 2 tube stations. Generally, the hotel needs a good refurbishment. We were also told on check in the breakfast was served until 11am. Yet upon getting to the dining area at 10.15 we were very rudely told that they had stopped serving 15 mins previously. When I asked whether I could have a small bowl of cornflakes (which they had not yet cleared away), the woman huffed, scowled and told me to 'get my own bowl' then flounced off. For these reasons, I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. You are better off staying in a travelodge for the price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There were holes in the walls and bathroom door. The towel rack fell off the wall. I put a do not disturb sign on my door but the house keeping staff walked in anyway. The buffet breakfast was disgusting. Tinned tomatoes heated up, the coffee is like hot bitter dishwater. I ended up eating breakfast out most mornings. I asked for a 4am wake up call, luckily I woke up at 4.15am by chance. I never received the wake up call. I checked out and listened to the staff argue over how many nights I had stayed and If i had paid my account in full... I had prepaid weeks before I arrived. On that subject, I had to email and email and call 4 times to finally get the hotel to process the payment and issue me with a receipt. They eventually processed the payment. I then had to follow them up again for a receipt. Absolutely appalling customer service. The corridors are like a rats maze and the carpet is worn and Old. The lifts are scary and ridiculously small. To top all this off after 3 nights I developed what appeared to be a rash. By the end of my stay I went to my doctor who said the red spots on my arms and legs are bed bug bites. My advice to anyone looking for affordable accommodation is to save up a bit more cash and splurge on a hotel with another few stars. this hotel is advertised as 3 stars, it would barely make 2 stars. Worst hotel experience EVER.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location is great! When we booked it, this was far and away the cheapest in-suite hotel in tube zone 1. There are certain compromises you have to make when booking budget travel. The room was small (Did I mention it was the cheapest in-suite hotel in zone 1?). The free breakfast was a simple continental affair, no decaf available like most of Europe, but it could be filling (did I mention it was the cheapest in-suite hotel in zone 1?). The room was clean, but the carpet and wall were stained (did I mention it was the cheapest in-suite hotel in zone 1?). The bathroom was clean and well stocked for a budget hotel, but definitely a one person affair (did I mention it was the cheapest in-suite hotel in zone 1?). The TV only had a few (3 or 4) channels (did I mention it was the cheapest in-suite hotel in zone 1?). Wireless is available in the lobby for a charge, but not in the rooms (did I mention it was the cheapest in-suite hotel in zone 1?). One real negative thing is the aforementioned fire alarm going off every night. It was quite disrupting (did I mention it was the cheapest in-suite hotel in zone 1?). I understand that people who are not used to budget travel might find lots of fault with this place, but what I don't understand are the complaints about the staff. Everyone we dealt with was absolutely friendly and helpful. We were always greeted and made to feel like we were valued guests.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've read alot of the reviews and often didn't agree with all the negatives. However, i have been compelled to write a review after staying at this hotel as it was really a disgrace. I don't know how they qaulify as a hotel. We booked 4 rooms to stay in for taking part in the london marathon. My girlfriend and i, my brother and his wife, my mum and dad, and my sister,her boyfriend and son. Our room was tiny, cupboard only a single size, toilet door did not shut, shower didn't hang on, toilet had a bad smell (Not only after I'd been in it!), decor dated, and black marks all over the walls, also banged my head off the tv sticking out the wall. My brothers room was pretty much the same, siters room was nice though and it had air-con. It was like being in a different hotel. Very nice, although they gota cockroach on the last night(3rd night), and mum and dads room was a step up from ours too, but still not great. We arrived late at night on the first night so just wanted to get our heads down there and then. When we complained the following afternoon, we got nothing but excuses from the smarmy little receptionist guy. Full of it and we were getting nowhere. Like I said, i really don't like reading so many bad reviews as there are alot to be said about personal preference/opinion, BUT i really wouldn't advice anyone to stay here. pay the extra Â£20-30 and get somewhere decent. Big thumbs down from everyone in my party...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our hopes were high on arrival after seeing an Aston Martin and Range Rover parked outside, but soon shot down as we got inside, had to pay upfront, walk past an original Windows 95 computer and squeeze into a lift the size of a shoebox that took about 3days to go just a few floors. It was either that or use the maze of tight stairways to get there. So in no particular order, here's a list of reasons not to stay at this "hotel". - Tiny room - Bedside cabinets are a plank of wood with drawers that aren't even drawers - High dryer works at 5 second intervals before needing a 5 minute breather - No air-con or hint of a breeze so hot and sticky - Windows that go out onto the fire escape (not the safest or private) - Toilet that's basically in the shower - Toilet that wouldn't stop dripping and wouldn't refill properly - Shower door that wouldn't close so soaked the floor - Most uncomfortable, supposedly double, bed i've been in/on since they put an old woolen blanket on in it for some reason in the summer - TV that was too high on the wall and signal was shocking and had no remote - Cupboard that stank - Thin walls so you can hear everyone else complaining about their rooms aswell, and more - Awful breakfast; they somehow managed to get fresh orange juice wrong - Bathroom door that got stuck on the floor when opening One positive to mention though - the chair in the room was really nice, except it probably shouldn't have been in there considering that extra empty space in the room would have been useful</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">me and my partner stayed there this weekend for my birthday and our engagement. ... so where do we start. not with anything good to say thats for sure. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE! 1) our room was no good because the shower was blocked. It took another 4 rooms before we got one ... n that still had a dodgy shower,but it 11pm by now. 2) The place was dirty. 3) Apart from 2, the staff we not helpfull, and hardly any spoke English. 4) No phones in rooms on 5th floor so beware! 5) The water system, especially on 5th floor,was a joke. Showers worked when they wanted, the water was cold, if you were lucky to get water flow it was poor. 6) Only midgets can access the lifts - no morethan 2 at a time, and without bags! 7)Breakfast was a joke. Their was no mention on websites of the dining room being closed. If you do book continental breakfast, hope you like apples n cold coissants! But what they dont tell you is you can get a ticket in exchange to have a cooked breakfast in hotel across road. 8) Oh, and they cheeking monkeys ask for payment when you arrive. DONT DO IT. Pay only on departure. We paid nothing and cancelled card the following morning so they cant take the money! Overall, i really enjoyed it ... NOT! it was disgusting. Fawlty Towers is Buckingham Palace compared to this s***hole. Thanks for ruining my birthday/engagement Queens Hotel -Hotel? Thats a joke!!!!! I should have guessed something wasnt right with the place when i checked in - as i walked in, 4 rats with their suitcases walked out.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had been warned about how tiny rooms are in Europe so tht was no surprise but that was not the issue here. The bed was horrible, with absolutely no padding left between you and the springs. The furniture was more in the way and the layout for the room could be much better at least for the room we stayed in which was in the dungeon-like basement. The walls were super thin so the troop of school children that decided to stay next to us one night kept shutting the doors loudly and came in and out all night long. I wanted to give their chaperon a piece of my mind the next morning. The TV which looked fairly new did not work andn seemed possessed since it would turn on for two seconds and the just turn off. There were also two light bulbs that were out which could have helped light up the cell-like area a bit more. Both these issues were brought to the attention of the staff but nothing was ever done. The bathroom is remodeled but the shower does not close all the way and you get everything wet so watch the really high step and make sure you don't slip on all the water everywhere. The day staff was very nice and tried to help. The night shift was cold and rude so we gave up. Breakfast was very average but we were not visiting London for the food we were saving our stomachs for Paris. Over all the only thing this place has going for it is its proximity to the Tube and interesting array of shops and food about two blocks down. Next time we will spend a little extra money at least for a decent bed so I can be more well rested!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are looking for a clean and comfortable, well located Hotel, at a great value for money price for central London, then this is the place for you. The accommodation is "no frills" but had everything that we needed for a site seeing trip. The buffet breakfast was good if a little busy (shows how popular the place is with tourists who all get up at the same time of the morning!). Reception service was quick (despite being busy) professional and helpful. They looked after our cases after checkout whilst we did more site seeing (Â£1 a case we thought was quite reasonable). Also in a lively area of London, but surprisingly quiet at night. Very handy for 2 tube stations and the parks for lovely walks too. We really have no complaints about this hotel. Ignore some of the frankly nasty and I think totally unjustified, comments lodged. Remember this is not 5 star accommodation but then you would not expect that for the excellent room rate for a budget hotel. Our only comments are minor niggles which were not really a concern to us but may matter to some people: The lifts are very small and cramped if you suffer from claustrophobia. It is a long trek up narrow stairs to the upper floors if you are not fit and able! The breakfast area though light, airy and quite spacious, is not able to cope with all of the guests wanting breakfast at the same time! If you don't want to queue or fight for your toast, coffee and cooked breakfast etc, then I suggest you get up early! The rooms though comfortable are not overly spacious, though the 3 of us were fine, it was rather cosy!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Convenient location for the tube and transport, and for Hyde Park (we were there for a concert). We paid Â£85 for the room including breakfast, which is very good value for London especially given that concerts were taking place and it was a busy weekend in the city. We stayed in the newly refurbished wing of the hotel and our room was very modern - wooden floor, smallish flat screen TV, double bed, desk, hairdryer, tea & coffee making facilities, and a sparkling new shower room. The bed was quite comfortable and we didn't hear any noise even though we were there the weekend of Hard Rock Calling and the hotel was very busy. These types of hotels in Bayswater are much of a muchness - Victorian style houses that offer B&B at good value (compared with other London hotel prices). If you want a plush hotel stay somewhere that costs you Â£150 odd (if you're lucky!). To put this in perspective this was cheaper than Travelodge for the night we stayed. Speaking of breakfast this was quite nice and included OJ, tea/coffee, hot food (sausages, scrambled eggs, tomatoes and mushrooms), toast, croissants etc. all buffet style. I would describe these hotels as being not hostel-like (have the people who have written these reviews actually stayed in a hostel?) but more like a B&B than a hotel. I would definitely stay here again if visiting London and couldn't find a bargain hotel... It was clean, pleasant and well-located, and breakfast included in the rate was a bonus. We were also able to leave our bags there after we had checked out, as they have secure storage for Â£1 per bag.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I took my parents to London in 2008 and booked this hotel due to its nice location half a block from Hyde Park and a couple blocks from the tube. The lobby looked nice but omg, once we got to the room we were horrified. There were white stains on the carpet (don't even ask me where I think that came from) and a rusty-colored stain on one of the sheets (blood?). The beds were seriously a joke...I felt each and every spring I couldn't believe the poor bed was still in use! Must've been as old as the hotel was. I would rather have slept on the floor, but the stains.... There were broken things here and there like the toilet paper dispenser which was not a big problem since you don't really need it, but nevertheless annoying because you'd think hotels would maintain their rooms a bit. However, I do have to say that the staff was really wonderful, hence the 5 stars for service. They were nice, brought up lots of towels when we asked for them and conversed with my dad for a while as though they were long-time friends. They also helped give us advice on where we should go, what tube stop would be closest, etc. Breakfast is also included which consists of toast, cereal, coffee, juice and some pastries. The service was actually really great cuz even during the help yourself type of breakfast, right when you chose a table they heated up toast and brought it right to you piping hot. I thought that was really thoughtful. All-in-all, fantastic location. It all would've been nice if I wasn't so grossed out by stains and if I didn't really need sleep (you won't get any on those beds)!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel through Hotwire for a very low price. The location is fantastic and is within walking distance to Kensington Gardens, Hyde Park and, if you're up for a bit of exercise, Notting Hill. There's also a lot of shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. However, as most of the other reviews state, the hotel leaves a lot to be desired. The elevator is ridiculously small- there's barely enough room for one traveler and a suitcase. You literally can't turn around in it and it's very slow. The room was also very, very small. I requested a two person room so I was given a very small double bed. There was just enough room for two people to lay side by side without much movement. The bed was like sleeping on sawdust as were the pillows. The restaurant is non existent except for breakfast- apparently you have to make an advance booking and even then, it has to be for a party of ten or more which seems a little pointless. The 'business center' is a computer and a chair in the lobby with access to a fax machine and copier if you ask. As the other review stated, the bathroom was miniscule. The sink is over the toilet and banging of the knees was a bit of a problem. The service was polite and efficient but not particularly friendly or helpful. Since our stay was for one night only, the Queen's Park was tolerable however, for longer stays, I would definitely not recommend it. Even if you plan to be in your room only to sleep, you won't really get a decent rest in these rooms- the beds are frightful and the neighbourhood isn't the quietest. While the price may seem low, sometimes it's better to pay a little more to get a decent night's sleep.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having booked last minute then reading the reviews i was dreading the stay andhave to say when they didnt have our booking on arrival things looked even worse. However, despte the booking error not being the hotels fault and them having a virtually fully booked hotel, they sorted the issue and within 20 mins we were being shown to our triple room. Please note the ritz this is not, it is presently going through an extensive refurb and as such on 1st appearances this place is a mess but the bedroom, albeit very basic was very clean as was the shower room / toilet with a TV with freeview that worked (to my daughters delight) with a great signal. Breakfast which was included was good; you have a choice of continental with fresh fruit and the obligatory toast machine or cooked consisting suasages, scrambled eggs, beans, mushrooms and tomatoes. (I had one sausage saying that day 1 and it was over fried and not very healthy so stayed clear after one bite!!). My gripe about breakfast was the mad rush that saw us wait 10 minutes for a table on day 2, day 1 was fine. The area was great and so handy (3 - 4 minutes walk) for Queensway tube station (3 direct stops from Oxford Circus) and a street load of shops/restaurants. Dont beleive what other reviews say about the area as we have a 5 year old girl and got in late both nights we stayed and didnt feel at all worried / threatened about the area. My only question about staying there again would be the cost, if you get it at the right cost (circa Â£100 per night per room incbreakfast) then everything considered its great value, anything more and Premier Inns plus special deals come into play. The hotel is not in the Congestion zone and an NCP car park at Â£25 per day is oposite the tube station.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel as a family group for one night as we were going to the proms in the park, location suited us, unfortunately we read the reviews after booking. A little concerned about the hotel taking payment from our card before we had arrived.Whenever we have stayed in hotels before we have always paid on departure,obviously this doesn't bode well if you try to get a refund,which I am guessing happens often enough for them to take payment first. Still I thought give it the benefit of the doubt. We arrived to check in around 3pm to find one of our three rooms wasn't ready (resolved after half an hour).In the twin room my mother found one of the beds had a soaking wet mattress, this must have been noticed when the bed was made as there were some towels under it in an attempt to dry it out. The occupants were moved into another room only to find out when we returned from the concert that this room had no electrics...you would think after the first room they would have made sure this one would be fit for purpose.So after all that they were moved into room number 3 at 1.30am. Our room was small but clean,one of the lights didn't work and the shaver point in the bathroom (I use this term loosely) wasn't working either. I have a feeling the hotel raided an old POW camp for the bedding, the blanket we were provided with was itchy and so not much sleep was to be had. If you suffer from claustrophobia then for gods sake give the lifts a very wide berth, someone has jokingly put a sign in them saying 4 persons..if you try this then I would advise you know the people you share with as you will be getting very intimate with them. Breakfast was ok apart from the fact they didn't have enough knives! When we asked for some more we were told they were all out? As with others who have commented when we asked to see a manager about a refund for my mothers trouble we were told no-one is here please call back tomorrow</p></li>
