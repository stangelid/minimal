For an amazing price we stayed at an amazing hotel nicer than any other place I've stayed in Vegas AND since I don't gamble I enjoyed the ambiance rather than watch peeps lose Thetis shirts. A definite recommend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel has a night club that plays music all night. The bass shakes the entire hotel and it's impossible to sleep. It's like your room is the dance floor, and it doesn't matter where in the hotel your room is located. You still hear and feel the music. Plus, our room was not ready when promised and we did not get the room we reserved.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very modern, reminds me of a Miami Hotel. Staff was awesome. I bought off tripres.com, they had a deal $199 for 3nites in the 2rm suite! However they had overbook, so they offered us a free room at the sister hotel, we really wanted to stay at Rumors so we declined. They upgraded us to the Swinger Suite for free! WOW is all I can say. Couch n flat screen in the bathroom, 2 person shower. Huge King and 2 sofas. Would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

Living on Key West we have great resorts as well, I just wish the owners of Rumor would open one here, I would recommend this resort to everyone !! My partner and I were there during "Shedonism" and felt very welcomed. One last thing, the beds are amazingly comfy (I wish I knew who the mfg is, hint, hint ). Thanks again !! Diana Hansen</p></li>

He personally took over and waited on us hand and foot, brought the chef out to meet us and saved the day.The meal, service, the setting and the people were awsome.

Just one or two blocks away from Planet Hollywood/Strip. So it's not too bad and especially when you have a car with you. Parking spot is limited I think there are about 15 self-parking spots. If you can't find one, you will have to take their hotel valet parking. It's included but you have to pay the tips for the guy. The room is not bad, everything is new and the shower room is new too. Enjoyed it.</p></li>

Excellent service. They need to find a good chef. Bar was cute, but service could improve. Met the manager, cool dude. I would most definitely stay here again. Oh, 4 stars for cleanliness because my tub was needed to be cleaned better, which, the maid happily did for me, and the floors could have been better vacumned. I'm sure if I requested the floors to be vacumned they would have been no problem.</p></li>

The waiter was also helpful enough to provide us with a recommendation for some where we could view the UFC the following evening.

There was always space to hang out there and I really liked the fact that it was never packed. However, they still had a bar and live dj during the day. It is a 15 minute walk up to the strip but i would defo stay here again, based on how nice the pool area was, followed by the rooms.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Rumor is nice and definitely different. The pool is ok but the music start a little on the early side (deep bass coming into all rooms at 10am?). The rooms are nice, not quite as nice as the pictures on their website. The occupancy % when we visited must have been really low. We saw only a handful of people at any time. We had one breakfast sent to the room and it was good. Nothing fancy. The hotel is near the Hard Rock and we did have a nice day at the pool there. However, you need to cab back and forth to the strip. Overall, nice option, but being on the strip is really valuable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here Jan 2011. Depending on your situation this may or may not be a good choice to stay. This motel is set up for a younger crowd so if you want peace and quiet and very good service this is not the place for you. However if you are ready to party all night long, this is a very fun place to stay. The beds are great, so is the shower and bathroom, some have balconies or patios. The Staff is very young and not knowledgeable at all about the facility so do not expect many questions answered. I would not recommend this property for a husband/wife for leisure unless you are party animals.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked a standard suite which we picked up for a great price. This hotel is around about 15-20 min walk from the crossing at planet hollywood on the strip. This is a great hotel if you dont want the hussle and bussle of the strip. Its so chilled out the staff and helpful and the pool party on a sunday is great well worth a view. I will say that this is a young hotel and very hip for a young croud. The room was great i coundt fault it at all. Our hairdryer wasnt working and within 15 minutes someone brought a new hairdryer. I will be staying at this hotel again if im looking for a chilled time in vegas.</p></li>

Not only did the staff provide great service, the rooms were refurbished with a cool sense of style that is hip to today's fashion trend. The layout of the suite was fantastic along with their amazing shower that I looked forward too after a long night of partying Las Vegas style. I was fortunate enough to meet the General Manager Matthew Krumwiede who graciously invited us back. All in all I really enjoyed my experience at Rumor and look forward staying their summer when the pool is all refinished. A+</p></li>

What we didn't know was the bad housekeeping, noisy club/lounge/lobby (situated right outside the rooms), inconvenient parking would come along with its convenient location! We feared our return to the hotel every night as we had to go past a very, very crowded night club and sleeping in the rooms felt as if we were partying along with the crowd!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed one night on December 9, 2011. Easy to find across from Hard Rock. Parking lot not the greatest - then again, if one is visiting Las Vegas, use Valet. Pleasant reception with quick check-in. Area felt safe and quite secure (not an excuse to lose situational awareness).Room was clean. Unexpectedly nice, however, the decor is simply not my cup of tea. I was not there for any other reason than to be up early for a flight out of McCarran, thus I cannot provide a rating of much else. I used no other services other than the bar for a shot of whisky. Knowing tastes of friends that would consider this an alternative place to stay in Las Vegas, I would recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I LOVED this hotel. The rooms were spacious and had very modern decor. The pool area was gorgeous and although it was too cold to do any poolside activities (I was there just before Christmas, 2011) I want to come back so I do some lounging poolside. I have no complaints at all and will definitely come to this hotel the next time I'm in Vegas. Also, it's right across the street from Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, but close enough to the strip that if you wanted to get there it's a very short cab ride or drive. So we were able to get away from the crowds on the strip and enjoy the laid-back boutique atmoshere, but could easily go party with the crowd if we wanted. GREAT HOTEL!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here sort of on a whim just to check it out. I liked the whole boutique / laid back style. I was here in January so it was off season for the pool area but the hotel was great. It's totally non-Vegas as far as size and style goes and there are very few amenities but I loved my stay. I had a regular room which I considered very adequate. The furniture was sleek and sexy though the view out the window left a little to be desired. Pool views are much more fun. The staff was very hospitable and friendly. The bar area is super cool. Food options are limited but there are so many great places to eat in Vegas who cares. It is NOT convenient to the strip if that's a concern.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our room was clean and the bed was very soft, the best night sleep that I have ever had at a hotel. The room looked exactly the same as the images online. Our room had a balcony that over looked the street, which was perfect for relaxing after a night out. The rain shower is amazing! Room service prices for drinks were insane!!! You are much better off walking to the liquor store that is in the next parking lot and buying your own. That being said, they do try and stop you from bring in outside drinks or food but you can easily get around that by putting it in another bag. The ice machines are hard to find and some were not working but with the liquor store next door and $2 bags of ice its not that big of a deal.</p></li>

We were told they forgot to turn them off and we should have phoned, well we had no working phone. Also there was cleaning staff vacuuming late at night which did disturb us. They tried to call us on the 2nd night to give us a free upgrade to a suite with a bottle of wine, but our phone was not working and sadly we did have to leave for home.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Rumor Hotel has much to recommend it. It is a new, two-story, non-casino, suite-style hotel, whose rooms look out on a curvy pool surrounded by palms and scattered cabanas. Its off the strip location, across from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, makes for a calmer stay but with throbbing action a short walk away. For an $8.00 fee you can also visit the extremely well equipped Hard Rock fitness center. The look of the lobby and rooms is "Euro-kitch-Phillippe-Stark-gone-amuck," but the rooms are very large, comfortable, quiet and well furnished. Like many Las Vegas hotels, rooms at Rumor can often be a very good value. If you don't mind a several block walk to thke strip, Rumor is a good alternative to the chaos of a casino stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was awesome. I had a basic King bed, sauna shower for about 50 bucks a night. The grounds were extraordinarily clean and the lobby was an explosion of color and style. The covered gazebos by the pool and Jacuzzi were just the right touch for the shade seekers. The bar was small but inviting, plenty of cushy couches and pillows to lounge on while you sip you "Black Orchid" Derek, was a “Master” bartender and Ed at security made everyone that walked by feel welcome. The Hard Rock café is 60 paces across the street for the gamblers and show goers. I would recommend this hotel to everyone and I have found a new place to stay in Vegas. This hotel only takes guests over 18 which I love. An Adult hotel…who would have “thunk it”. E. E. P.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room wasn't what we reserved online, which was fine. getting a cab was tricky since about half the time there weren't valets at the desk, but we just walked over to the hard rock to grab one. The restaurant closed promptly at 11, which was a little strange since we were at a boutique hotel and were hoping that they could serve us at 11:15, but i get that. I don't get the techno music though. starting at 10 AM both friday and saturday, they blared music from the pool. i assume it was for ambiance but since there were only 2 people at the pool it seemed a little over done. and it didn't stop until 6PM. with no one at the pool. either day. now, i like house music as much as any one not in a nightclub, but it made for a tough day to rest up for the night. probably not going back.</p></li>

The host was very pleasant and answered all our questions with a smile. we got to our room and this room was WOW!!!! so cool !! So modern so fun!! Our sunkin tub was a little dirty so we called the front desk and they said for us to talk to the manager Allen who said that he was so sorry and upgraded us the next night to a mega suite! It was the coolest thing I had ever seen! Not only was the staff so nice and friendly but the hotel is perfect for a fun get away especially if you dont want to be bothered with the crowds or casino. Cystal at the front desk was also very helpful and made this trip fabulous. We will be back for sure!! Simply perfect!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First Impression: We just arrived at the Motel 6 Second Impression: Modern, Chic and Gorgeous Pros: Hotel staff is friendly and professional from the front desk to the valet & housekeeping. There was a DJ the last night 2/13 they had our attention for 3-4 hours, he should be a staple. The Hotel is right across from the yummy Hard Rock Cafe, Around the corner from Subway, a Market, CVS, Chinese, Dim Sum, etc. By Vegas walking standards you can easily walk to the strip (10-15 minutes). Cons: The hotel charges a refundable per night deposit of $50.00 but does not include that information in their confirmation. (So my complaint is not about the reasonable deposit but the fact they hide what every other hotel discloses upfront) The iron/board is not located in the room and must be requested.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We checked in on the Sunday of Memorial Day Weekend, expecting it to be hectic. There was a DJ in the lobby (awesome!) and the front desk staff was fantastic. We even got upgraded to a Deluxe Suite--thanks Allen! The only downside was that we arrived later in the day and there were no roll-away beds left (I work in a hotel, so I understood that they are on a first come, first serve basis). We got to the room, and WOW! One of the nicest, trendiest, sexiest rooms I've EVER stayed in. The bed was beyond comfy, and the bathroom was very sleek and modern. We got 2 free drinks by booking on their website, and when we got to the bar/lounge, we were amazed yet again. Drinks were delicious and reasonably priced, especially for Las Vegas. All in all, it was a fabulous trip and I'll definitely stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is not your regular Vegas hotel. As you enter the lobby, it is a combination of check ins/out, bar, dance room, lounge/dining area; it's a multi-purpose room. This place does not have an elevator, so be sure when you come here with a load of luggages, ask for the first floor. The room itself, is not what you would expect if you were to stay at other hotels in Vegas. It is the same layout as you would see at Super Motel 8 or Motel 6. Although, I do think, a regular Motel would have a fridge, this place doesn't. It doesn't have a tub, so it's not a full bathroom. The room is functional but lack convenience because everything is still manual except for TV & AC. This hotel is good for rest only and avoiding the crowds as it does not have casinos & a lot of amenities that other Vegas hotel offers. No self-park; valets only.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First of all, rooms at newly opened Rumor are simply gorgeous - classy, beautiful, comfy, clean, actually one of the nicest we've stayed in. The pool area is very pretty (but was deserted our whole stay; we hardly saw other guests at all). However, there are also a few negatives and all in all I don't think I would choose Rumor again. The front staff felt very young and lacked a bit in professionality. Also it seemed their booking system wasn't working too well - we had to correct the price both at check-in and check-out, and still got a tiny bit overcharged (which they, however, promptly corrected when we pointed that out). And, importantly, Rumor is quite far from the Strip; it takes at least 15 minutes to walk, in the desert heat, so taxi bills add up. If you're new to Vegas, try to stay on the Strip instead, it's more fun.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Can't beat the price for Vegas, and I love the decor. It was best described as a 60s/70s Italian futuro moderno B-movie set and then add sexy to it. Everyone was friendly. The manager was very generous when they didn't have the original room I had reserved. Addiction restaurant had the cheapest meals too, and they were a bit slow, but good. If you're some boring, conservative, religious, Republican, you might want to stay somewhere else, because this place is "swingin'". My only complaints, no soap dish, and no shuttle service. But bus 108 takes you to the airport and 202? takes you straight to the strip, and if you want to fork over cab cash, then you won't have any issues. P.S. Don't eat at the Indian Restaurant nearby, ridiculously over priced. Take the bus to Grand Lux Cafe and have lots of food and drinks for the same amount.</p></li>

The potatoes were wonderful, the fruit fresh, and the unlimited coffee delicious! This place is an undiscovered oasis. Our friends stayed at Ceasar's which was smokey and twice as much $ and they had to rush to get up early to reserve a bad place at the pool. No problem at Rumor! We even watched two weddings there, too. The phone system was a bit complicated, but we didn't care that much about that. We had our cell phones. And we didn't have the best view in the house, either. But we got a great rate and we were very happy we stayed there!</p></li>

He was so helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We had a selection of appetizers when we arrived which were amazing - the Kobe sliders were to die for!!! We also had a two hour drinks package which was unbelievable value for money. We reserved the private dining area for our main meal which was great and my husband said the steak was one of best he had ever had!!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Rumor for 3 nights in January. We pre- selected suite 3 months before arrival, confirmed it three different times with hotel management, and when we checked in we DID not get the promised suite.! The excuse given was that current room occupant had decided to stay longer and they could not force em out(they could have had that party switch to the suite they gave us). Lost alot of respect for management there. On the good side: the food was awesome and reasonable..1/2 the price of the more expensive places on strip. Would go there to dine even if we did not stay there. The staff shared the chef is going to appear on the "Top Chef" TV show. No workout room on site but can use Hard Rock fitness facility for $8/day across street. Other thing this hotel needs is a dresser in room to put clothes in. All there is is a small closet with 5 hangers! Everyone complained about that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was happy to see that the new Rumor Hotel allows pets and spent time researching the property. I am relocating to Reno and will be spending one night in Las Vegas on my drive with my small, well attended feline. I love a good restaurant and pool and thought this would be a fun place. The web site clearly states that it it pet friendly and it is represented as such on trip advisor and Expedia. I could easily have made my reservation and arrived with my cat, expecting to be welcomed. It was fortunate that I called to confirm the pet policy because I was told by a hurried but nice phone rep, Lauren, that cats are not allowed. She added that this must be some kind of "bizarre corporate policy" and that she has several cats herself, which I appreciate, but do not consider to be a satisfactory answer to what is clearly a misrepresentation of hotel policy. No manager was available to talk with me.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel to save a little cash and it was good for that. Kind of a step between a budget hotel and strip hotel. The hotel has obviously been remodeled from an old hotel...and they definitely accomplished a different, current and more boutique look. The rooms themselves were cute. Probably our favorite part of the hotel. Not sound proof in anyway, including the constant airplanes flying overhead. The pool was promoted to have a chill out Dj on Sunday's but it was pounding commercial dance music (we are djs and love electronica...was still a bit much for us). The pool vibe/scene was dissapointing and we paid to get into Mandalay Bay's pool the following day instead. Room service was great, yummy with some healthy options and quick. The staff seemed very helpful whenever we needed something. Love that it's directly across from Hard Rock. Also, most of the cabbies seemed to need that as a landmark reference.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here for a few days for my birthday, December 7th and 8th. Our Deluxe Suite was beautifully appointed, well maintained, with a huge sunken tub and a super comfy king sized bed. We had a great view of the nicely landscaped courtyard with fun purple hammocks, heated pool and firepits.... great lay out! The staff was friendly and offered great recommendations to restaurants and attractions nearby the property. The icing on the cake is they have a quaint little cafe on site which serves ABSOLUTELY THE BEST PANCAKES I have ever eaten, light , fluffy with an incredibly lucious topping. The only suggestion I would offer is to have a small fridge in the suite. I'm sure the guests would appreciate this added convenience... But, seriously if you would like to stay someplace rrefreshingly different with a chic atmosphere, excellent rates, and off....,but near the beaten path (STRIP), Rumor is the place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sorry to say that this place is not quite up to what they say/appear to want it to be. The lobby is cute, the grounds clean, the rooms nicely decorated...but for what they are charging, it is not up to snuff. The check in/reservation was good and again, the room was pretty big and clean. It is the overall experience that is not up to the rates. I ordered room service, waited an hour, called and found out that the order had not even been placed (room service button on the phone did not work, had to hunt to find the actual number...and then got message saying the number was not available....finally got through). Housekeeping did not show up. Remote controlled A/C was nice, except the remote did not work. Toilet paper dispenser was coming off of the wall. Not let's be clear, this is a perfectly nice and clean place in Vegas, they just charged me as much as the strip and did not come close to the service/experience sorry to say.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First thing this place is everything I had been looking forward to for my 21st birthday! Modern, hip, and intimate. One of the things that really was disappointing was that I had been planning on eating dinner at the Addiction restaurant in the hotel and because there was a wedding the whole restaurant was reserved for the event. I would have liked some kind of advance notice to plan accordingly. The next morning I was planning on going to breakfast there and apparently on Sundays they only serve "brunch" which is a buffet and honestly paying for a buffet is a waste of money for me. Overall I was disappointed that I was unable to ever get to the restaurant that I had been looking forward to. The concierge was the BOMB and totally hooked us up! The feather pillows and king bed were a dream to fall into after a long night. SO close to the Vanity night club and took a nice walk up to the strip. I really love this hotel and plan on staying there again :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here once in the past, it was an out of the ordinary stay for me because I usually pick one of the station casinos, but they were all booked that weekend. I loved the vibe of this hotel as well as the friendliness of the staff. Our rooms however, were not as clean as I would have hoped. I am a stickler for cleanliness so Im not sure if I should grade off the curve or by my expectations. I used to clean hotels when I was in school and I always made sure to vacuum well and lysol the floor as well as the shower curtains and door knobs. This adds an extra touch of cleanliness to a room and doesnt take much extra time. I now travel with a bottle of my own lysol spray which I did use when I arrived to my room. If it had been cleaner, and maybe a bit quieter too (I agree that you hear almost everything) then this would get a five star from me. Im looking to travel to vegas tomorrow night for a one night stay and maybe I will give this hotel another chance since my other favorites have no vacancy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here a year ago - sorry for the late review. I loved this place. I loved the location, and the size of the hotel. It was beautifully decorated. The staff were great with the exception with one person (she was kind of a know-it-all and I could tell she kind of drove her coworkers a little crazy) but other than her, I enjoyed my stay here. I would definitely return. If you are looking for a place that's smaller, the employees know you and are very friendly - I would highly recommend it. The food was excellent. I'm the type of person who prefers staying off the strip as it takes forever to trek to get something on the strip and there's always line-ups for things... At Rumor, there was a CVS store close by, as well as various restaurants etc. I was able to walk to Planet Hollywood and it took about 10 minutes... A cab didn't cost that much either... I'm returning to LV in a few weeks - and my boyfriend wanted to stay DT - I would totally stay here again if it was my choice (this time it isn't :( )</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You get what u pay for. Luckily I got this room discounted under a promo as I paid for my room 2 weeks in advanced.. I wonder if my services were depreciated because of that. I had to wait 3 hours for my room just to get a dirty spa tub, roll-a-way bed, and rude staff. Again, I paid for my room 2 weeks prior to my stay! I requested an hour extended check out that didn't get granted because my room was taken, and I was blocked in my parking spot which happen to be handicap space. Another tenant decided to create their own parking space; therefore, I couldn't get into to my car w/ out pain (I'm disabled and I had to crawl from the passenger seat to to driver's seat to get into my car. Yes, that was explained to Brittne). When I brought this up Brittne, she was rude, snappy, rolled her eyes at me and basically said oh well, I can't do anything about you being blocked in, the room situation or extend your check. She never apologized. I'm ok about my few dollars not being worthy to them... Never again. Dr. Gigi</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from 3 days at this hotel and it was great! Rumor is very hip and chic with a fun atmosphere, amazingly friendly staff and great rooms. We got there late on Friday night and the valet, Brandon, was right there when we pulled up, very friendly and assisted us with our bags before taking the car. The front desk agent, Jose, greeted us immediately, was super friendly and got us checked in very quickly. We got to our room and it was perfect! I am a bit of a hotel snob and this hotel passed all of my "room inspection" for cleanliness. The bed is comfortable with great pillows. We had a pool view room and it was so nice being able to sit out on the patio. The housekeeping staff is fantastic and our room was always very well cleaned and stocked. This hotel is a must stay if you want to be close to the strip but feel like you are a world away. The pool area is VERY nice with lots of room, comfortable lounges and sun beds along with cabanas. They offer a poolside bar and there is a DJ on the weekend playing music.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We'll never stay anywhere else again! From the super fun and sexy decor to the amazing service, Rumor Boutique Hotel provided us with an amazing experience. The moment we checked in, our very disorganized and unruly group was treated very well. The rooms are downright amazing, with the best bathtubs and beds I've ever seen - even in the luxury hotels. Rumor sports a gorgeous pool area, complete with several lounging areas including cabanas, beds, hammocks, and such - making for a really fun evening atmosphere. 3 days later, our still disorganized and unruly group needed just about everything under the sun - cabs, late checkouts, directions, and concierge extraordinaire Britnee accommodated our every request, all with a smile on her face, leaving us with a smile on ours. All weekend long, the staff - from the front desk to the housekeepers and groundskeepers - were incredibly friendly, polite, and helpful. The price couldn't be beat, and the environment is super fun, sexy and young. We'll never stay anywhere else. Thanks, Rumor!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There is no other hotel like this one in Vegas. If you like South Beach or Palm Springs, you will be in heaven. The decor is the sexiest in Vegas....hands down. The lounge and restaurant is a perfect gathering spot for cocktails. I didn't get a chance to try the food but the menu looked top notch. In regards to food/beverage, I would recommend you grab some soft drinks from the CVS across the street b/c the vending machine was broken. The maid service did much more than I expected and actually tried to come back multiple times since I was sleeping in. I took pictures of the bathroom because we decided we wanted to rennovate our bathroom at home just like the ones at Rumor. The pool wasn't crowded which was relaxing and the music was exactly what we look for while on vacation (we get sick of hearing the same radio songs over and over....the music reminded me of being at a modern 5 star spa). I am suggesting this resort to my best friend for her wedding. The courtyard is ideal for a 150 room hotel wedding. We can't wait to go back!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Beware the hidden resort fees to pay at the end of your stay! The Rumor is in a perfect location with everything you need on your doorstep; the strip, shops, CVS, casinos, Hofberhaus, etc. However, the rooms are all identical, so no character and if you have a room with an adjoining door MOVE! We were forced to relocate in the middle of the night because the noisy neighbors sounded like they were sitting on our bed. Another note, the rain showers are amazing, but after a hard day pounding the strip in heels you may want to soak your feet and you can't. Also, they offer no anti-bacterial soap in the rooms. Only a Shea-butter face bar. If you're touching slot machines all day you need to disinfect. They have no business center either, which, I know is lame, but if you have boarding passes to print out it's helpful. We were on our Honeymoon and were offered no additional upgrades or services (free or otherwise) which is strange for Vegas. The restaurant Addiction was also sub-standard. We may stay again, but it's overpriced and thinks it's better than it is.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My brother and I were driving from Colorado to California and decided to break up our trip with a quick stop off in Las Vegas. We booked a suite at the Rumor Hotel for a night and decided to stay an additional night. The suite was clean/comfortable, the staff was friendly, and the hotel is located in a very convenient location right across the street from the Hard Rock. All of the standard Vegas attractions are either walking distance or a cheap cab ride away, plus you can head back to Rumor when you want to escape the mob scene at the strip. To get to your room, you walk through a small lobby which opens up to an inviting pool area with private lounges, hammocks suspended over raked sand, and a well manicured lawn. I found this to be a much more enjoyable experience than navigating through a casino floor filled with stale smoke, a sea of blinking slot machines and drunken tourists. At night, Rumor had a cool vibe and was a good place to hang out for a few drinks. Both my brother and I recommend Rumor as a lodging option for either social or business occasions.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for one Friday night...Upon arrival, you can valet park to the right or self-park to the left; however, there are only 15 self-park spots if you're lucky! Check-in was smooth and the room was easy to locate, as the property is relatively small. Room and Bathroom were very clean, air-conditioning worked well but had an older smell to it. The hot-tub in the room was clean but so old that the paint/plaster (?) on the inside was chipping off which made it appear not so hot; didn't try it for this reason! We had a Junior Suite, Oasis (Pool) view on the first floor. Our patio was practically at the pool; no privacy. Would defiantely recommend the top floor.The hotel lobby, small lounge area share an area with the bar and mini-restaurant. We had Chili-Cheese Fries and some drinks for a snack, not bad at all. Our visit was very quiet and the grounds did not seem that busy. Management is very helpful and responds to any questions or concerns you have via email and phone promptly. You can tell they try very hard to keep their guests happy and I thank them for this!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you want to avoid walking through smoke, casino's and crowds, this is the place for you. From the moment we arrived our experience here has been perfect. The staff is excellent, professional, friendly and are very helpful from sending extra amenities to your room and giving great advice about Las Vegas. The rooms are large, clean, comfortable and have a cool vibe to them. The beds are perfect. The bathroom has a great shower, they furnish you with robes, hair dryers and ample amout of towels. I adore the simplicity of the decor througout the whole hotel. Location is far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the strip but again close enough too. We didn't use the pool because it was raining most of our stay but the area surrounding it is well appointed with amazing furniture, great cabana's and is clean, clean, clean. We have stayed at several upscale resorts in this town but I have to say this place is truly a gem and we don't plan on staying anywhere else but here next time we come back. I hope the Rumor Boutique Hotel all the best and nothing but its success!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We usually stay at a hotel on the strip, but this trip we wanted to try something different. My friend has previously stayed here, and had good things to say so I we gave it a try. The rooms were exactly pictured as they are on their site. I really liked the decor and modern look Rumor had. Check-in was fast and with no problem. Our room was clean, except our bathroom. The room was spotless, however it seemed they did a quick clean up with the bathroom. Not horribly dirty, but it could of been cleaned better. The downside to this hotel is it's not walking distance to the strip. A quick taxi ride will get you there. The valet worker did awesome job waving down a taxi for us, minus the chaos of traffic coming from across the street (Hard Rock) due to a concert. I like having no casino in the hotel. I'm useto staying at a hotel with a casino, but I enjoyed the quite hotel and not smelling smoke from people smoking. I enjoyed our stay at Rumor and we got a great deal for our room. I would recommend this hotel to others if you want a quite hotel and don't mind taking a taxi to the strip.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">WE stayed here in Oct with my chn agred 8 & 10. The presentation is immaculate but service and staff need attention. Our beds were not made up when we went to go to bed., you enter thru main lobby , bar area which is not ideal with young children. The room was well presenteed but had NO FRIDGE or DIRECTORY! Asked for two blankets and room service arrived to tell us they only had one in the hotel , so they offered us an extra sheet. Outdoor environment is gorgeous and very inviting (pool and spa area are fantastic) but definately intended for youg party crowd only. Front desk staff not very approachable or knowledgeable and at times made us feel uncomfroatble on enetering and leaving (as if we were not there usual cliente) Valets were great! Sent feedback to General Manager but never received a reply. Hotel was at low occupancy but we were placed in a room with an overwhelming paint/ laquer smell..to the extent both myself and daughter were unwell. Front desk staff couldn't supply info on local area , ie transport or shopping locations etc Great design but staffing and rooms need attention.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were celebrating our 1 year anniversary and chose Rumor Hotel for a few reasons. Specifically because it did NOT have the noise and chaos of a casino hotel. We wanted something quiet and romantic. We live in Las Vegas and get enough of the Strip hotels, so this was a nice change. We have driven by the property many times and once we looked at their website, we were sold. The colorful, swanky rooms were very inviting, along with the jacuzzi tubs in the rooms. We were so pleased with the entire stay. The restaurant, Addiction, had amazing food, and we even got a visit from the Executive Chef, Michael Rizzo, who was extremely friendly and made us feel right at home. The entire staff from check-in till check-out was warm and hospitable. Crystal at the front desk, and Robert, property security, were super friendly and helpful. We especially appreciated Ben Ortiz, the Food & Beverage Manager, who treated us like royalty! He was such a hard worker and jumping in to help wherever necessary. We will definitely stay again at the Rumor Hotel. It exceeded all of our expectations!! Ron & Tiffany Las Vegas, NV</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am a certified hotel snob and this place was great on every level. I booked this for a friend’s bachelorette party and it had the perfect vibe for it. The rooms were fantastic; the service friendly without a bit of pretense and the most surprising part was the food! We ate there twice and it what shockingly good. Happy hour pricing was great. I felt like I was stealing it because the prices were so low and the quality was so high. Get the short rib sliders for breakfast. I wish I was eating one right now. My whole group was locals and we plan to go back just to eat. It was also great to be able to park near the room, no 10 minute walk to your room like at a casino. The pool was also great even though it was a little chilly. My friends still laid out most of the day. The only negative was that the sink had really high pressure and the bowl was oddly shaped. This combo made water spray everywhere if you didn't turn it on slowly. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to everyone, it is meant to be cool and some people (like my parents) wouldn’t feel comfortable. But for anyone who is into the vibe, it couldn’t be better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">THIS IS NOT A FAMILY HOTEL. DON'T BRING YOUR CHILDREN HERE. We stayed at Rumor for Christmas and really loved it. This is an adult hotel. It is not for kids. If you have children, stay at a place where they have things to do. Small dogs are welcome and they have a monthly "Yappy Hour", which according to the staff, is very funny and fun. The rooms are nicely decorated and the beds are comfortable. The tubs and showers are nice but I would have liked another nozzle on the shower, not just a rain shower head. The rooms are fairly large and they are comfortable. The staff is first class and they treat you like royalty. Trevin, the bartender is entertaining, informative and just plain fun. The Chef and servers are very accommodating and go out of their way to ensure you are happy. The food at Addiction is very good. Try the fried Nutter Butter! If you want casino action, it is a short walk across the street to the Hard Rock Hotel. We had a great time there, also. This was a very pleasant experience and one we will repeat several times this year. We love Las Vegas and Rumor Hotel fits the bill for relaxation and romance!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Rumor for 8 days. It is a really nice 3 star hotel, for the stars they have - it is an outstanding hotel. If you are looking for something chick on Strip, Rumor is not your choice, but if you are looking for something more relaxed, with nice pool area and funky design - it's your place. Room: Pros : great design, big and comfy bed, we had a hot tub, nice range of bathroom amenities, iron with board clean and nice. Cons: small sings of wear but really tiny, rainshower (I simply do not like it), not enough light (on the first floor opening shades during the day is not an option) Hotel and service: they did not have our reservation, but sorted out everything quickly and we ended up even paying less than planned, no free breakfast, hussle with complimentary coffee in the morning, maids did they word well, great pool area with cabanas, valet parking only is available. Location: 10 minutes walk from strip, but none walks in Vegas anyways, so we went to Hard Rock (across the street) for taxi, they had a line there. There are couple of restaurants nearby, pharmacy and liquor shop. Overall, we had great experience.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The rooms are well decorated but not kept up. It's pretty good for a 3 star hotel actually, but if you're used to 4 star hotels you'll likely be underwhelmed. Also, there's no free breakfast; not sure why trip advisor said that. Anecdote: We checked in our first of three nights and the somehow mistakenly put us into the junior suite when we paid for and reserved the deluxe suite. When we went to the front desk the next morning to let them know, there was zero apology, zero attempt at making up for the mistake and we were simply told that we would have to wait until 4pm and they would put us in the appropriate suite. This is a reminder why I don't stay at 3 star hotels no matter how well they're rated on Trip Advisor. The level of service is just embarrassing, Really disappointing. Generally speaking though, it's a very hip 3 star hotel and we were able to get it for a very good price from agoda. Forgot to mention that the doors might as well be missing as far as noise reduction is concerned. This is Vegas and people get in late. Were they whispering you could hear them while you lay in bed, but they definitely weren't whispering.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">my husband and I stayed at Rumor during the Plush party this past weekend and it may have possibly been the best Las Vegas trip we have ever had. the property is perfect for a group buyout like we part of. from the minute we pulled into valet til even after we checked out I couldn't have asked for anything better. Brandon the valet guy was wonderful super helpful everytime we arrived and left valet. Toni the young girl at the front desk was amazing it seemed as of everytime we walked by the desk no matter what time of day she was there and willing to help with anything we needed whether it be more towels, dinner reservations, helping us get on the VIP lists at nightclubs she was there with the biggest smile on her face. Brendan the bartender was also great he made amazing drinks and we had great conversations early in the monings. overall we could not have asked for anything more. almost forgot after arriving home we realized we had left a piece of luggge in our room when we called the hotel once again it was Toni who answered the phone she helped locate our bag and made sure to safely store it until a family member could pick it up.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My girlfriend and I had tickets to see Tiesto on the 7th and I was stoked when I remembered the little hotel that we saw last time we were at Hard Rock. I looked it up and was amazed by the prices for a weekend night. I've stayed at all the big ones on the strip and been to Vegas plenty of times so I'm over the whole stay on the strip scene right now. It's all about value and Rumor has the best value I've found so far. We only stayed for the night but enjoyed the pool for most of the day before we could check in at 4. I'm a dj so I rather enjoyed the music and the service of the waitress. It wasn't very crowded but I'm already set with my own lady so the amount of people doesn't matter much to me. The rooms were nice and worth every dollar. The tub wasn't holding water and first but a maintenance man came and fixed it right away. The Hard Rock is right across the way so finding a cab isn't tough and neither is gambling. OHHH, we had food at the pool and it was awesome. Compliments to the chef for my burger. I really enjoyed the room and my girlfriend loved it too. So much that were heading back there in June for EDC. It's gonna be wild!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed at Rumor several times with my boyfriend but after my last stay I decided I needed to write a review. I LOVE this hotel. I live in Vegas and usually like to try all of the different hotels but ever since my first stay at Rumor I haven't found a reason to stay anywhere else. The staff is always so friendly, my first stay the valet walked with me all the way to my room and took my luggage for me. The front desk is always very polite and accomodating. I've never been denied a late check out, unlike the Hard Rock where they surprised me with a $100 late check out fee. Rumor has the best courtyard with a charming pool and cozy hammocks all around the area. The decor of the lobby and lounge area is trendy and unique. The suites are beautiful and include unique touches like a fresh orchid(my favourite flower!), and a rubber ducky in the huge tub. I recommened this hotel every chance that I get! This last stay was the first time that I had eaten at the restaurant, Addiction, and the food was great! I'm a vegetarian and they even specially made my food :) My boyfriend is NOT a vegetarian and he enjoyed his food too. I'll be back soon!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I went to Las Vegas for my birthday and booked the room through hotels.com. When we pulled up there was no valet but we didnt care I just got my things and proceeded to check in as my boyfriend parked the car. I was able to check in at 1 which was cool. I was really impressed with the room. It was awseome. I was bummed that the pool was closed for construction but the pool at the hardrock was way nice. I had only two problems with the hotel one was the fact my room was right by the lobby and there was a dj playing until 430 am. Becuase of this there was drunk people screaming and running into my door to my room. I would request a room on the other side of the hotel. The other problem I had is I called and requested someone to open my safe because the code I entered would not work. I waited around for an hour mind you its my birthday and I am in Vegas then I walked up to the front desk and asked the manager to please have them open the safe because I had reservations for dinner. Besides these two things everything was fine. I loved the fact we could lounge in our huge tub and watch a movie. The rain shower in the bathroom was nice as well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for a long weekend, paid on average $50 a night through one of the comparison sites. Hotel was gorgeous, from the lobby to the rooms. The central garden and pool area was divine. Staff here are great. The free valet parking was a nice treat, and all staff were lovely. Particularly worthy of a mention was Shaughn, one of the reception staff, always a friendly smile and chat, offered good locality advice and even personally delivered fresh towels to the room at 1am. One of the best features is the pool area, deck chairs, outside beds and cabanas all included, lovely size pool and good size hot tub. And the best thing, the pool is open 24 hours. And with the heat Vegas can get to, you'd be surprised how welcoming a 2am swim can be when you get back from the strip. Location for me was perfect. I wanted to be off strip, however this hotel was not too far away. Only 20 mins walk down to the strip and the MGM and the Bellagio. Or if you want to hop in a cab the fare is only about $6 Overall, loved our stay and look forward to returning here again. ...... and the purple M&M's at reception are delicious... it's the little touches that count.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I LOVE THIS PLACE. The decor, the service, the food and the value were all top notch. I can't wait to come back during the summer and enjoy the beautiful pool. Although the pool and hot tub are open in the winter...the weather was a bit chilly during our stay. I used to live in Vegas so I have stayed at a lot of Las Vegan hotels (the Artisan, the Venetian, New York New York, the Trump and the Stratosphere) but this place is my favorite! My fiance and I had an amazing dinner here for 1/3 of strip prices. Front desk, valet and bellman service was top notch. The place was very empty during our 3 night stay over Super Bowl weekend so sometimes there was wait staff other times not...but the resturant was open whever we were hungry. If they didn't have a server then the bar staff filled in. During the winter months it is ideal for any kind of travelers (even families with kids that want a pool to themselves) but with the warmer weather expect a wilder crowd, pool parties and loud music. If any of that bothers you then, what are you doing in Vegas ;) ? I only hope that when this place is discovered that the level of service won't be too compromised!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Wedding Weekend”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel for our wedding weekend as it was a hotel off the strip and did not have a casino. Hotel staff,particularly Britney at the reception desk were wonderful. Allowed us to take pictures in the lobby with a large party as well as pulling two very large limos into their very small parking lot.All of our guests stayed at the hotel and enjoyed as well Room faced the pool and had a balcony and a soaking tub. Very Nice. we experienced no issues as other folks have stated with loud pool music at night nor did airplane noise keep us up. Hotel has a very small but cozy bar and a small and cozy restaurant. We did have lunch and the food was good and very reasonable in price. The hotel is a little ways away from the strip and will take 15 or so minutes to walk to. Otherwise a cab is about 8 bucks. If you dont want to go that far, Hard Rock across the street has casino,restaurant and spa. The hotel does have a policy against outside food or drink but the policy is not really enforced as it seemed most guests had at least drinks in their room. Thanks to The Rumor for making the hotel portion of our wedding very easy. WE WILL BE BACK!!!! Dave and Mindy</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I really wish I could give this place a better review. My room had some problems that indicate housekeeping is not really on the ball. iPod dock was missing, safe was dead, phone was dead, and a couple other things. To their credit, facilities took care of things pretty quickly, but it was annoying that I had to discover all these things and call front desk. The location of the hotel is pretty good, Hard Rock Hotel and Hofbrauhaus are adjacent, as are 24 hour convenience store and several good but affordable restaurants. The design of the hotel is creative and very hip, as is the crowd. No gym at Rumor, but you can pay $8 to use Hard Rock's gym/spa, which is a good deal. The pool hours at Rumor are a huge downer... the pool closes at 6pm, and there is no shade except for rental cabanas, so if you don't like frying in the sun, you're totally out of luck. During the night they play soft music in the courtyard, and it's a good place to chill out post-club. I wish the pool were open then! I didn't experience any noise problems. I would stay again if they can get on top of the room situation and if they extend the pool hours to something reasonable like 9 or 10 pm.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Lovely boutique hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Rumor Hotel is off the strip, but just a few minutes drive, in front of the Hard Rock Hotel. I like hotels with great design, so when I entered Rumor Hotel, I was immediately impressed. My room was a suite with a courtyard view, not huge, but quite large with a tub in the bedroom, a white sofa, very comfortable, pleasant with a small balcony in front of the pool. The courtyard has a beautiful garden with palm trees, and the pools. It's a lovely place where it's really pleasant to stay, day or night, even more enjoyable with good music (but not too loud). It's hip, relaxing, peaceful, the kind of place where you want to stay for hours as it's such a nice place! Food was good for breakfast (not a huge choice on the menu, but very good). The service was excellent, very friendly. The only drawback are the corridors, with a kind of motel feeling (Rumor was a former motel, but entirely renovated, with great success). Of course if you're looking for a big casino resort hotel, you may not like the Rumor, but if you like smaller hotels with great design and ambiance, it's an excellent choice. Rumor Hotel will be my first choice when I will return to Las Vegas, without any doubt.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Due to our busy schedules we have not been able to take our annual vacation so we decided to stay in town and check out Rumor. From the moment we walked in the lobby decorated in all white with unique art work was like a spot right out of Miami. Stephan at the front desk greeted us with a warm smile and checked us in quickly. I had the pleasure of meeting Rob the GM not your typical GM he was friendly yes that's right friendly, he sat down and spoke with us for a while he mingled with guest and I even saw him clear dishes off a table. With that attitude alone you should check the place out. Our room was nicely decorated with a upscale modern decor. When I opened the curtains one morning I honestly forgot I was in Vegas it reminded me so much of the Caribbean; sand, grass, palm trees and hammocks. It was great! We had dinner at the restaurant Chef Vic is crazy amazing with his food. You have to try the short ribs with candied yams, sliders, sticky chicky, fried Mac and cheese. Not only is the food amazing the service Chef Vic and Paul gave was phenomenal. We have found our new local get away. Congrats to the entire Rumor family. FYI...you have access to the gym at Hard Rock.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A stylish hotel without the constant racket of slot machines? I'm there.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Rumor feels like the little Nevada cousin of The Standard in West Hollywood. Over the top, tongue-in-cheek style, but with a much friendlier staff. And thankfully not a jangling slot machine in sight. The recent renovation did well with plentiful, cushy pillows and comfy bed, modernist bathroom (but, oddly, nowhere to hang a towel), waterfall shower, and in-room jacuzzi (which I didn't use, but the yellow rubber duck was a nice touch). Restaurant food and service were enthusiastic and mostly good, if a little uneven (they're still a new crew, so I won't hold that against them). TIP: A club vibe is helped along by house music piped into the common restaurant/pool area. If you want to head to bed before 11pm, bring earplugs or request a room without that view. The only downside is the location -- far enough from the Strip, Monorail and Convention Center that a taxi ride is usually more realistic than walking. But given the reasonable room rates and calm in the middle of Vegas' usual overstimulation, that's a tradeoff I'm happy to make. Once word gets out, this place will be booked up; I just hope they'll be able to keep their chill style once they're no longer a best kept secret.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has beautiful rooms, which is why we decided to stay there for a last-minute mostly unplanned trip to Vegas. My husband and I are not the type of hip or trendy people that the hotel is meant to attract, but we decided to stay there anyway. The other reviews about the music blaring all the night are not exaggerating at all. We weren't out partying at the pool and somehow did manage to eventually get to sleep on Saturday night though. Sunday night there was no music, so we enjoyed it more. Our first room, a Junior Suite, had a soak tub which I was really looking forward to, but the air conditioning unit was broken. They came to look at it right away and offered to either waive the resort fee or switch us rooms. We decided to switch rooms, but it meant a room without the soak tub. The bath products are nice, and the rainfall showers are a treat. The hotel is not really our usual type of place, but we knew that when we selected and decided it would be an interesting experience. We were also able to watch a short wedding that took place just outside the balcony of our second room. It is mostly valet parking (complimentary) with a small self-park lot that was usually full.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Rumor over the weekend. Over all we had a great experience. I'd love to give it a 5 stars, but there are few things I'd like to see the improvement. -Check In: Check in was a breeze! Unlike bigger resort, there was no long queue at the reception. 'Niki' was very professional, she had the paper work and keys ready for us. -Room: Very nice decors and we loved the bathtub. However, the lack refrigerator and small closet space were a bit of a disappointment. We didn't care much about the bed neither, it was too soft and provided no support. -Room Service: We ordered breakfast from 'Addiction'. The food was average. But, I'm sure it could have been better if we dined in person. -Resort Fees: This is a Winter and the pool was closed! $11.99 per night can really add up and we didn't even use the internet. They should consider waiving the fees during the off season. The hotel is across from the Hard Rock and close to the Strip. Getting to and from the airport was very easy, it was only minutes away. We loved the ambiance of our room and the reception area. Valet parking only. And, if you need a cab; they'll flag one for you. That was a nice touch. We'll definitely stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just stayed at the Rumor hotel this past weekend and let me just say I wish we stayed somewhere on the strip. The front desk botched up our rooms and gave us a complimentary upgrade. Awesome right? No. We had 8 girls and they said they could not gaurentee more than 1 cot, fine. But they did say they would gaurantee to give us enough blankets and towels.... funny thing is, they ran out of blankets!!!! What hotel runs out of blankets? So we had to use sheets to sleep on the floor! Also when we called for towels we would have to call 3x to finally get them! To add insult to injury, the next day we go lay out at the pool and want a blended drink. The guy outside says he doesn't have a blender and to go inside to the lobby bar. My friend asks the guy assisting the bartender if they can make blended drinks, so he walks over to the bartender and ask her and she says out loud "I'm not making blended drinks today! I'm just not making them!" My friend walks over to her and asks if there is an issue, and she says she just doesn't make mixed blended drinks and says "Fine! What do you want!" My friend just walked away. Now we know to stick to hotels we know have great service, Rumor definately doesn't have it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at 4pm to a lobby filled with guests waiting for their rooms. We were also told that our room was not ready due to late check-outs and informed that we would have to wait. We were told to have a drink or food in the lobby (no offer to comp the refreshments was made) while we waited. After waiting an hour (we were told it would be 30 - 45 minutes) and seeing that others were getting rooms, I got back in the line. The room we were assigned was 2103 (DO NOT accept that room!) The trance music from the lobby pulsates up through the floor and went until 3am on Friday night and until 2:30 am on Saturday night. The outside speakers on the patio began blairing towards our windows at 8:30 am. Other cons: No housekeeping showed on Saturday (the friends that we traveled with didn't have it at all). The phone worked inconsistently. The pool was under construction but we were not made aware of that fact until we saw for ourselves (not even at check-in). If you rent a hotel room for sleep, avoid 2103 at all cost). Cheap, uncomfortable couch in "Deluxe" room. Pros: Trendy, I suspect (based on the pulsating rave music) that if you have the means and desire to stay up all night rolling you would love this place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There are very few bad things I would have to say about my most recent trip to Vegas, and even less bad to say about the Rumor. First off, excellent location. The Strip has become an absolute nightmare to traverse. The Rumor is just off the strip enough to be outside of the gridlock but close enough to walk (or take a very cheap cab ride to!) Next, while the Rumor is an older motel that has been gutted and retrofitted into a boutique hotel, the new look is so hot it burns your retina just by looking at it. As far as the staff is concerned, they are the absolute top of the heap as far as customer service goes. I have never felt so taken care of as I have at the Rumor. Every little thing was taken care of, most of the time without me nor my companion needing to say anything. There were very few things that were not terrific about our stay, the paint was quite new in our room and there was a definite fresh paint smell everywhere in the building we were in. Also, I nearly lost a fight with the ultra modern shower controls trying to find the temperature I was comfortable with. Outside of that, an absolute dream and we have already booked our next week there! By far the best experience I have had in Vegas in over a decade!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I chose to stay at Rumor after we noticed it this spring when we stayed at the Hardrock. We were pleased with our decision as soon as we stepped out of the car. The valet almost treated us as if they had been expecting us and were excited we were there. The girl Tony who check us in at the frontdesk acted even more excited and took the time to ask us about our trip and even recomended some shows and places to eat. We were amazed at how chic the rooms were and even joked about how our Yuppie friends in LA would be jealous of our great find. Later, on the way out, Tony greeted us as we were walking through the lobby as if she knew us personally and even offered to help us book tickets for a show! A major surprise for us since we were so use to being almost invisible to te frontdesk after check-in at other, large hotels. We regret that we did not eat at the resturant that was located in the lobby, but before we knew it- it was time to leave. I felt as if I was leaving friends behind, but both of us look forward to our next stay! If you are looking for a small hotel that makes you feel as though you've found a secret spot in Vegas were the staff becomes your friends, I absolutley suggest staying at Rumor. The secret Is out!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Rumor is located off the strip right across the street from Hard Rock. It was about a 15 minute walk to the Strip. I went with 5 other friends, and we got 2 2-bed suites. The rooms were incredibly clean and accommodating. The beds were comfortable. I was a little worried because the hotel is right in the flight path of the airport, but once I was in the room, I did not hear the planes that much. The staff here rocked and were incredibly helpful and they always seemed to be in a good mood. There were only 2 things that I did not like about this place- 1) the shower had very little water pressure, so for girls with thick hair- showers took forever. The bathroom was pretty, just not 100% functional in that regards and 2) every night there seems to be a dance party in the lobby that you have to fight through to get to your room. It is not a big lobby, so this was kind of annoying. But once you got past that, everything was fine. The pool was closed during out stay, which worked out because it wasn't as warm as it could have been, but I didn't see any notices about that on the website when I booked. I may have not stayed there if I would have known that. Overall though a very good experience. I personally prefer staying on the Strip, but would stay here again because the price is right.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Last night I was at RUMOR and my good friend Nancy hosted her Birthday party there. The room was filled with several event professionals and we all had the best time. Working in the hospitality industry I get the opportunity to work with some of the most hospitable people though RUMOR out did itself last night. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. I would especially like to acknowledge Brian at the bar, he did a great job on making sure that drinks were flowing at a steady pace throughout the evening and he always had a smile on his face. Secondly Vince, not sure what his title is but he was the master of it all. Everywhere I turned he was helping to tend the bathrooms (inside and out), moping floors, cleaning the bars, helping people at the front desk, greeting people and cleaning up after folks that couldn't hold a drink in their hands. At one point in the evening we were in need of a tool set for a prop that was brought in and he ran to his car and brought in his own kit. He even assisted in putting it all together. This man is someone who we all wish to have on our team. He was a true team player and helped out where he needed to. Thank you RUMOR for a fun and memorable night. These event professionals will never forget this evening and the superior service that we received.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hip, imaginative updated hotel. Great friendly staff. I went there for a 4-day conference and wanted to stay just off the strip. Must say I felt welcomed and well cared for by the staff. Staff, although still new (hotel had been open 9 weeks), is very friendly, helpful and thorough. There were some operational snafus but the genuine concern and quick rectifying of problems turned potential lemons into lemonade. I'd stay there again in a NY second. The beds are very comfortable with real down pillows, both a rain shower and the large in-room tub are great. Robes are comfortable, maid service is great. Pool area is hip and beautiful with white cabanas and totally mod furniture. Check out the 3-chocolate purple M&Ms at the front desk. They had lost my reservation, the hot water went out the first night I was there and there were no vegetables in the kitchen when I asked for a late dinner. However, they honoured the reservation, called the chief engineer at 1 in the morning to fix the hot water problem (he did) and found 2 large sweet potatoes for dinner (at a very reasonable price). From David the doorman to Hailey to all the staff, they worked to make sure my stay was the best it could possibly be. It takes time to get everyone trained at a new hotel and to get all the systems in good working order. These guys are working hand. I'll be back next year.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I made the unfortunate mistake of staying here on a business trip...and had already had one sleepless night on this particular trip in another hotel in another town and had to be up and ready to go at 5 am, so I was tired and I needed sleep. Unfortunately, this seems to be the party hotel for the locals. There was a bachelor party or something involving girls coming and going all night in the room next to me and unfortunately they went to bed about the time I had to be out. The walls are paper thin...I could seriously hear their conversations through the pillows and the wall. It felt a little sketchy. I also had to choose what to leave plugged in so I could charge my cell phone and use it as my alarm...which meant the phone was unplugged and I didn't want to fumble with it to call the front desk at 2 am. Why is it so hard to get outlets by the bed at hotels?!?! Anyway,the people at check in were very nice and the decor is fun and trendy and the pool area looks like fun in the summer, but I don't care how cheap it is, I will never stay there on business again. It is nice that it doesn't have a casino and the hotel itself is a bit quieter than any of the places on the strip, but at least even the noisiest hotels on the strip have soundproofing so the rooms are quiet. I might stay here for a cheap weekend getaway for fun, but I think I would prefer an older outdated place on the strip for the same price if it meant I could get a little sleep.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the rumour midweek in July. We truly enjoyed our stay. Hotel location is great. Close enough to the strip but far enough to be away from the masses. Parking valet is easy free and friendly. We arrived late 11pm and check-in was a breeze. Off to our room to find a nice bottle of champagne for having book online. What an unexpected bonus!! Our room was facing a parking lot. This did not bother us as it surely is more quiet than those facing the courtyard with the music. Our room was spacious with 2 queen beds, a couch an armchair and a table with 2 chairs. Nice bathroom with a water closet and a large tiled shower but dimly lit. They could use some towel racks. :) We LOVED the beds. They were soo comfy. The breakfast at Addiction restaurant was delicious and affordable. Looking forward to having dinner the next time we come. We enjoyed our stay so much that when checking out we asked about booking 2 rooms for our wedding in October. She told us it was full for October and the only rooms available were 3x the price. So she suggested we try booking directly online. Upon our return, we were happy to find 2 rooms availble when booking online However, I'm disappointed that I have not receivced a reply to the 2 emails I sent. Because we've read that the music can be very loud on the week-ends, I want to ensure we have rooms close to each other in a quiet area. Otherwise, staff was great and we are looking forward to our return trip in 2 weeks.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the moment we walked into the lobby I thought I was in Heaven. From the decor to the cleanliness I knew I saved the best hotel for last during our 8 day stay. The staff (especially Brendan, Dave and Cailey - sorry if I got the spelling wrong) were personable, friendly and just wanted I needed after staying at two of the "bigger" properties. The drinks at the bar (especially the Cucumber Collins) were delicious and priced just right. The breakfast at Addiction was just like home (and I'm a good cook). I had the waffles with bacon mixed in and topped with peanut butter and maple syrup- I was on vacation after all. The hotel was exactly as I expected - a chic boutique hotel. I can't even begin to describe how lovely the pool area is. The weather was in the high 80's but hardly anyone was in the pool. I felt like we had it all to ourselves. The only downside was the Housekeeping. The first day our bed never got made at all. The 3 nights we stayed no one ever vacuumed the bedroom/living room area. We had to ask for an iron and ironing board (which I found rather odd). The only other downside was that they have no magnifying mirrors - it was a bit difficult to put on make-up (especially at night). Other than that I would definitely stay again, especially at the end of a trip. It felt like we were enough away from the Strip for the "quiet" aspect (we could walk across the street to the Hard Rock if we wanted to gamble) but only a two minute ride (10 minute walk) if we wanted to get to the Strip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Although I'm a retired travel professional,I have always taken pride in the places that I recommend not just because of the diamond rating but,how the customer is treated which by far is the most important. The Rumor is a little secret, that no one seems to know about directly across the street from the Hard Rock. If you are looking for something nice,quiet,clean, and relaxing this is your place. It's a short drive over to the strip,walking distance to a little strip mall with CVS,johnny rockets...etc and close to nice restaurants. Lawry's is over on the next block. The rooms are spacious with balconies and to top it off the rooms have showers and this huge jacuzzi tub. Please note that I do not work for this hotel but the service I received from the time I checked in (Thanks Chrystal) was great. I had a problem and my room had to be changed at 2:00 am and the night staff ( Thanks DaNiva, Willie, and Andy) was extremely accommodating. I lost my charger to my phone and the head of housekeeping(Thanks Linda) assisted me in finding it(Too many lemon drop martinis). (Thanks Dana for the parking information!!!) I can say that I don't have to stay at the Signature, Palms Place, or the Hotel , when there is a Gem like this in town take advantage!!! Trust me you won't be disappointed. If you have a small pet there is a little dog park on the grounds and you can walk your dog in the morning before you head off on business or to the Strip. Shaw Thanks for making my stay in Las Vegas one of the coolest in a long time. I will be back in a couple of months. Thanks Christmas Guest in 2004</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Good: Property is renovated & looks good Pool area is nice, but not a lot of people so its not a great people watching place to be if thats what you want The bar in the lobby is nice place to grab a quick drink before you head out The room has all the basic ammenities you need The property is in a good location accross the street from the Hardrock Hotel There is a CVS around the corner if you want to buy alcohol for your room! The Bad: The Furniture in the room is tacky- the pillows on the sofa are attached by a buckle so you can move them. The television in sitting room portion of our suite was tiny- even for a guy with 20/20 The air condition requires a remote control & our room didnt have one. We had to wait 40 minutes to get one, but eventually it came. The Ugly: Service is less than satisfactory We ordered room service & it never showed up. Called back & found out the kitchen was closed. Call the front desk to report & they said there was nothing they could do about it. Our room was not provided service for 2 out 3 days during our stay and no I didnt leave the "DND" sign up. We actually called for service and were told we would get it but didnt. The Recovery: Upon check out we requested the manager but he wasnt on the property, but he did speak to me on the phone. He owned up to not meeting some basic expectations and cut us a deal on our rate, which was very fair. And because of this reason alone, I will give this property a second chance, but before I recommend it, I have to stay here again to make sure that my experience was an anomaly. With that being said, the property does offer a good value in Vegas.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at Rumor many times, and really enjoy the ambiance and amenities of this hotel, but I finally had a bad incident that, people who are considering staying here, should be aware of. I was in a rush to check out (having spent several days there on business) and forgot to clean out one of the drawers I had used, which had some expensive clothing items in it. I realized my mistake when I got home four hours later, and immediately called the hotel. I was told that they would go and check my room and call me back. They didn't. I called back the next morning to ask if someone could please check my room or housekeeping so I could get my clothes back. I was told that my room still had not been cleaned yet, but I would be contacted. I was, once again, not called back, so a few hours later I called again. THEN I was told that housekeeping had not found anything left in my room, which I know for a fact is false. I know exactly what I left behind and where. Now, I know that it is my fault for leaving personal items behind, and that Rumor is not responsible for that. However, it is clear that someone in their housekeeping staff is untrustworthy and a thief. So, if you're planning on staying here, make sure you lock up your valuables, and you might even want to not unpack your clothes, but keep them locked in your suitcase. Since they have employed an untrustworthy person who is doing this when people accidentally leave things behind, it's likely this person will start taking things when people are still staying there. Do I plan to stay at Rumor again? Yes, because I do like the feeling of this place, and it suits my needs and mood. But I will make absolutely certain to never leave accidentally anything behind again, and I will keep anything I care about locked up in my suitcase!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Should have been a clue when our cab driver was not familiar with the name of this property. When we arrived at the hotel the valet/uniform services attendant was extremely friendly and unfortunately it went downhill from there. Friendly is not a word I would use to describe the front desk person. More business like and to the point. Almost put out to have to check people in. Also this was the first time I have ever experienced having to agree that we would not bring in any food or drink from outside the property into our room. Valet took our luggage to our room and when we entered, it was clear it had not been cleaned as the bed was not made. The smell in the hallways was musty..... We were then upgraded to another room although I couldn't really see a difference. In this room the toilet paper holder had been pulled out of the wall and sitting on the flush. We left and went to the strip. We also noted that portions of the pool area appeared tobe under construction and not available for use. A few hours later we received a call from our friends who also checked in and found their room dirty with dirty towels laying on the floor. One customer was upset about the pool availability and was told they could go across the street to the Hard Rock and use their facility. Nice - not! So at this point we decided if this is any indication of our stay we needed to move to another hotel. When we got back to the hotel to discuss with the front desk there were at least 4 other people sharing very similar experiences either room not clean or room was not what was reserved. As we were headed back to our room to gather our belongings there were about 8 employees hanging out in the courtyard chatting and not engaged with any customers. While I never actually spent a night there I saw enough to know I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.</p></li>
