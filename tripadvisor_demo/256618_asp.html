<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed for three nights in an Opera Deluxe room. What a view! This hotel is simply incredible,;the service, the location, the view, the rooms. The only fault I can think of, is my room was not far from a very noisy outside bar, which didn't quieten until midnight on the Friday night. Not particularly pleasant. However, at over $1,000 per night, it's not exactly a budget option!</p></li>

We stayed in room 344 which had the benefit of direct views of the Opera House. Dinner in the hotel restaurant is highly recommended. One very minor grumble was the need to queue up to put your bread in the toaster at breakfast â€“ although you could order it from the menu at extra cost!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I came here for breakfast and could not have been happier. The service is prompt, friendly and professional. The waitresses and waiters did everything they could to make sure we were happy and comfortable. The food was delicious, my order was a bit specific with dietary needs, however the staff made sure they were all met. The view is beautiful, food lovely and good coffee.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent part of our honeymoon here back in nov 2010 and I was amazed at how well insulated the rooms were from the hustle and bustle of activity outside. A bottle of sparkling wine chilling on ice was a nice touch and appreciated. The bathroom was beautiful with marble everywhere, with a separate bath and shower which could easily accommodate two people. Finally, we had the breakfast which was superb, and I would highly recommend you order off the menu as well as partake in the breakfast buffet laid out for you.</p></li>

We left for a couple of days and they only had a Opera Deluxe room on our return, that was not so quiet, but had a stunning view. Everything was great until I got the final bill, they had charged me $150 for 7 phone calls, never lasting more than a few minutes, to my friends' Sydney cell phone number! I was shocked, especially since I checked the hotel book, local calls it said were $1.25. Be warned of this old hotel trick of charging you unreasonable prices for phone calls.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We're currently staying at the Park Hyatt Sydney. Our room (King with a view of the Opera House) wasn't available at 3pm check-in, so the receptionist invited us to have a snack in their restaurant for 20 minutes. She offered to pay for the snack and get us when the room was available. An hour later, the room was still unavailable - and the new person at reception said that we would need to pay for our tea and scones. The room is nothing special. The bath is cramped and outdated. The bellstaff are terrific -- but the rest of the staff need to be retrained.</p></li>

Excellent location, right in the middle of everything. Service as one would expect it. Although we stayed in a City Harbour room, and we would have loved one looking at the Opera House, we had nothing wrong to say about the room. Reception staff courteous (could smile a bit more!) and efficient. Concierge was great with advice on restaurants around the area. Now, in the words of the song: "if I was a rich man", I would be staying here more often!</p></li>

He showed us the features of the room and answered all the questions we had. (Thank you Ryan!) Park Hyatt has the best location in the Circular Quay area by far! We stayed in room 333 which gave us a great view of the Sydney Opera House and the City at the same time. Rooms are very quiet and the bed is a comfortable one. We only stayed one night but it was worthwhile and I recommend everyone spend at least one night here if you can make it happen. The Park Hyatt is definitely a 5 star hotel.</p></li>

The service and concierge was outstanding and the food at the Harbour Lounge Bar and Grill (hotel restaurant) is incredibly fresh, creative and delicious. Our room (Opera King Deluxe) was very spacious with 2 balconies, sliding glass doors and a postcard worthy view of the harbor and Opera House. It was hard to leave the room. This is a fantastic urban hotel. I have traveled the globe and my husband and I both agree this is one of our favorite city hotels.</p></li>

The main restaurant is not top class but is rarely find that in hotels that can also cater for business. But the hotel is in walking distance of Some of Sydney's best.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The recently refurbished Park Hyatt Sydney is simply amazing! From the moment we arrived to checkout, the level & quality of service was just incredible. The room furnishing are high grade and the bathroom is over the top! This upgrade will raise the bar for the competing luxury hotels in Sydney. I especially liked the use of a dining table in the room in lieu of a traditional desk. We enjoyed a very good dinner in our room looking out over the harbor. The breakfast buffet does not offer as many choices as I would have expected at this price range, but the quality is high. I absolutely recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed at the Park Hyatt on a number of occasions and have always loved it. Big comfortable rooms, very warm reception, great breakfasts, big marble bathrooms, great views, and great location. One of the best places in Sydney to simply wind down and relax. I can vouch for the absolute pleasure of a single malt scotch in the bar of an evening in the olde world atmosphere. NIce to be able to park the car at the hotel when you arrive, and not use it again until you leave, as the hotel is central to the city, and walking around the foreshore is a pleasure. Can't recommend it highly enought to fellow travellers.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We finished our tour of Australia with four nights at the Park Hyatt, and what a way to finish. Painless check in, as our driver had phoned ahead to say we were on our way, and stunning room with fantastic views of Opera House and harbour (and the bridge if you lent out !) from our double balcony. The room was spacious and comfortable. The staff were very helpful, and the breakfast fantastic, with lovely views over the harbour and opera house. The location was perfect for exploring Sydney, and wonderful for a an early morning run around the harbour to Mrs. McQuarrie's Seat. Expensive - but we thought it was worth it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was undoubtedly the most professionally run hotel I stayed at in Australia. Although the other hotels claimed to be 4* and 5* this was the one of two that lived up to its 5* rating. The staff were properly trained and there were plenty of them, hardly any seemed to be Australian to judge by their accents ( Eastern European, Far Eastern?) perhaps they knew the difference between laid back and poor service. The position is superb, right on the water front and close to all facilities and transport links. Because it is close to the bridge the traffic can be heard from the balcony but the double double-glazing cuts out all noise.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I walked into my room to see a backdrop of the Sydney Opera House--it was stunning. I have ot admit it was hard to leave my room as I just wanted to sit on my balcony and watch the boats pass by in front of the opera house. The rooms are large and very comfortable. The staff was excellent. I don't care for first floor rooms--the first room I was assigned opened out onto a very nice courtyard, but ultimately I asked to be moved to something on a higher floor. They accomodated my request immediately. Food was alright and location is a little removed from the heart of downtown, but still easily walkable (Circular Quay is right there).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Park Hyatt completely lived up to it's 5 star status. The hotels recent renovation has created a cosy yet elegant environment. The hotel staff are superb, we had a few small issues during our stay but they dealt with it brilliantly. The rooms are simply gorgeous and offer sublime views of the Sydney opera house. The rooftop pool is also excellent and offers a great vista. We used the hotel restaurant one morning, the food was lovely and not too over priced for a 5 star. The only problem with this hotel is that it will heighten your expectations of all other 5 star hotels. We will without doubt stay at this excellent hotel again</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel's location cannot be beaten. It's an easy walk to the train station at Circular Quay. The biggest selling point is the waterfront views. The cityscape, the Opera House, the Bridge, and the water are just picture-perfect from our balcony. It's worth every dollar. The unique thing is that although the hotel is in the midst of the tourist sites, it's quietly tucked away on a small lane. The only noise you'll hear is the boat traffic and the chimes from the clock tower but it's a pleasant one. Don't forget to visit he pool on the rooftop. The views from there under the night sky is absolutely spectacular! We would love to come back but it's a long flight from America!</p></li>

Sparking and near perfect bathrooms, beautiful linens, unobtrusive room make-up and turn down, speedy room service and requests for transportation arrangements etc. were handled timely and accurately.

We flew into Sydney from the US and stayed at another hotel for a couple days then explored the rest of Australia. Once we saw the Park Hyatt sitting under the bridge we agreed we needed to stay there on our last night in Australia, so the last night we stayed here and were not disappointed at all. The service was great, the location and views were wonderful. It definitely needed a renovation but was still very clean (They were closing later in the month to do a full reno). I am excited to go back and even though the price is way higher than anywhere else in town I would stay here again. It's worth the experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent 5 days there in early September 2009 on the occasion of our wedding. The hotel - and in particular the staff - was amazing. Nothing was too much to ask for, they did everything they could to help us with the preparations and sort everything out (delivery of the cake, limousine, champagne, restaurant reservations, etc). In particular the concierge team truly deserves to be described as "simply the best". They seemed to share our excitement and during preparations checked regularly whether everything was fine. On the day, in addition to all the other logistics, they sorted out a separate room for my wife and her stylist to do the make-up, etc. I have never felt better cared for and looked after in a hotel. A true gem.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had our wedding night here and it was gobsmacking! The rooms are so funky yet classy and very modern with leather chairs and bed. The marble bathroom was larger then my bathroom at home, heaps of room and very glamorous. Spectacular views of the harbour and Opera House. Double glass sliding doors that block out any noise. The kitchen in the morning cooks up a storm with ANYTHING you order-I asked for an organic omelette with no oil and they and it and it tasted delicious. The only down side was we had such a short stay there we arrived at 10pm and left at 8am.. Still dying to get back and experience it in full and not be in a hurry this time. Highly recommend, yes its very pricey but your worth it and will rave about it for years afterwards.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Husband and I stayed here in November 2008. It was our 26th Wedding Anniversary so we were looking for something special. We chose an Opera King Room which was lovely. Because it was our Anniversary we were given a complimentary bottle of Sparkling Wine which was very much appreciated. Breakfast was included in the our package. and it was very good. We don't normally order room service when we stay in hotels, but on the night of our Wedding Anniversary we decided to treat ourselves to dinner in our room. We are very glad we did as the food was great and the meal was very well presented. We found the staff to very effiecient and approachable. This Hotel although pricey is value for Money. And for a special occassion with a wonderful view I would recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel has the best location in Sydney. You wake up in the morning and open the window and you have the opera house looking back at you. I was lucky enough to have a clear view but some rooms don't. This is a good hotel and i want to give it 5 stars but i can't. The service was good, the food was good but the place lacked any real atmosphere. Also the premium you are paying for it's location is quite high. The room was very modern and quite trendy, nice Lcd Tv, great bathroom, everything you would expect. The SPA is not really a SPA is has some treatmnents and a nice plunge pool on the roof. While this was nice it did not feel 5 star, and it had a slightly forgoten feel to it. Overall: best location in Sydney, good rooms, good service but not worth the premium you are paying.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In a recent first trip to Sydney, we had stayed at the Shangri-La which is very good but the Park Hyatt has some nice extras that make it the best in town. Location is definitely one of the best in town and the service is wonderful, very accomodating to every single need and detail. Our room was not ready at the time they had indicated so they invited us to drinks at their opera-looking bar. if you can treat yourself to an opera-looking room in the third floor, go for it!!!! It is wonderful to wake up and see the opera so close. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant, great view and great food. One minor detail: people going from reception to the bar or viceversa tend to walk through the whole restaurant which is a bit disurbing to those having a meal; there is an alternative way but not well indicated.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On March 7 (12noon Sydney time) I faxed the hotel directly trying to get a special group reservation. My friend had special rates for guests attending his wedding. On March 8 (12noon Sydney time again), no response from the hotel, so I faxed them again. On March 9, no response from the hotel, so I called the hotel's reservations directly. Deanna (in reservations) said she did not see any faxes or reservation & told me that there was no information for wedding party rooms. However, we know for a fact that the person getting married HAS bought out most of the hotel from 4/18-4/22! I will be sending the General Mgr of the hotel a letter informing her of her hotel's shoddy (or lack of ) service. This could be an indication of bigger problems with frontline operations & service.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sydney from London at Christmas time is not the easiest of trips! You are over tired and harassed by all those last minute jobs. But after a long and disturbed journey (a family with hacking coughs and small children in adjacent seats) it was an enormous joy to arrive at this excellent hotel. The welcome was efficient and peaceful and apart from a change of room, due to a previous occupant having been a big smoker, something I find unbelievable in this age, that someone would do to a glorious hotel room with a view to the Opera House across the water. We were given a delightful harbour view, large room with every calm comfort that you could want. The magic of the ferry boats crossing the harbour on an unusually wet and cloudy day have lulled our jet lagged bodies. The Park Hyatt offers a fantastic way to be introduced to Australia.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Truly an exceptional property with the views being the strongest draw. Our room was on the 3rd level in the middle of the hotel and upon opening my eyes in bed , opening the curtains, there was the fabulous Opera House in full majestic view, so close it almost looked like I could reach out and touch it. We were in Sydney for the recent short hail storm and the sky before the storm was a multi-color hue of blues and oranges reflecting around the Opera House, just fabulous. The rooms are nice, elegant with marble baths and modern furnishings. We had 3 in the Opera View king and it was a little small but for 2 would be perfect size. Refurbishing the exterior hallway carpet, or a good cleaning, is the only shortfall I saw. The staff were all helpful, friendly and welcoming. A short walk from wharf, CBD and many restaurants. Worth every dollar of the cost.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Park Hyatt is the place to stay if you're after a luxurious, beautiful hotel that is right on the harbour. In saying that, when you are paying $700 a night for a hotel room, I think that the internet should be free people!! My hubby used the internet for around 15 mins and we were charge $25 for it. The only other gripe I had was the breakfast. For $45, my poached eggs were completely hard and tasted only of vinegar - a little disappointing considering the price. In saying that, the perfect view of sydney harbour and the opera house while eating my hard vinegary eggs made it all ok. The rooms are big and the furniture is just lovely. The bathrooms are great and the electric curtains/shutters are awesome!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in November for 4 nights, after checking out from Quay West Suites (see review). The whole Park Hyatt experience starts from the moment you arrive until you leave. Check in quick and efficient, any changes/amendments to the booking were made on the spot and with instant confirmation. Concierge (Cameron) was one of the best I've dealt with, accommodating any single request or answering any questions always with a nice smile. He even recommended me to his counterpart in Melbourne, as that was the next leg of my trip. Rooms were very well decorated and spacious, great bathrooms and walk-in closets. Didn't make use of the restaurants but the bar, views were unbeatable and it has a decent cocktail list.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we arrived at the Park Hyatt after a dreadful journey via Los Angeles. What a delight to arrive in our harbour view room! We were blown away by the sheer scale of the room, the view and the comfort. Our two children had an adjoining room, smaller but with much the same view. Our room was just fantastic though - two balconies, enormous, deeply comfortable bed and beautiful bathroom. We found the staff unfailing helpful, esp the concierges, and always went out of their way to help (even provided us with the name and location of a local launderette so we didnt have to pay hotel prices for laundry!). Restaurant staff v helpful at breakfast (we ate out at night). Ideal position in the Rocks area of town - can walk to Opera House and harbour for ferries and otherwise excellent bus connections. We loved Sydney and would love to return and would def stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location. I have also stayed at the Intercontinental Sydney and while the Club floor has a great view, the Intercontinental does not compare to the Park Hyatt. My wife and I got an Opera View Suite which was around 600 SF. Two balconies with great views. One of the coolest things was we cam home back from dinner at Otto's (I recommend) and there was a Michael Buble concert at the Opera House. We were able to listen from our balcony while having some wine. The food was OK and very expensive. I recommend walking around the corner to Pancakes on the Rocks and getting some Chocolate Pancakes with Ice cream and strawberries for dinner. In addition there are cafe's all over the Rocks District. The workout facility was clean and while it had limited equipment, there was noone using it, ever. Go to the Rocks Market on Saturday/Sunday from 10AM-5PM for great souvenirs.</p></li>

Standard rooms where very dark. the best thing for us was to have a balcony and be able to have windows open en no need for airco. excellent service from reception to concierge and restaurant. we spent Newyears eve at the hotel restaurant second seating. quite expensive for nothing really special. good and flexible service. we appreciated the strawberries and champagne in the room. swimmingpool area is way to small for such a hotel (spa did not appeal at all going there). breakfast was included : buffet was very poor and boring for such a high standard hotel. every day the same, very long to replace empty trays this really needs improvement . this was the poorest buffet from our 3 weeks in different hotels in Australia.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at The Park Hyatt Sydney last year and we had a terrible experience. The service was horrible and the room and amenities were dirty and poorly maintained. For 700 USD/night I expected much better service and a much cleaner room. The room was covered in dust, the hair dryer was old, dirty and clogged with grime, and the shower was clogged with muck and flooded. Hotel staff did not refill shampoo or shower gel and gave us a hard time when we ask for them to follow up. The Park Hyatt Sydney was so bad that my wife and I moved out and into the Westin where we had none of the problems we encountered at the Hyatt and paid significantly less. I sent a letter to Park Hyatt telling them about my experience. They sent me a letter asking me to go back, spend another 700 USD and "give them another chance". Sorry Park Hyatt, for 700 USD you should have got it right the first time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You could not get a better location than your bedroom, meters above the blue Pacific harbour and right opposite the spectacular Opera House. You can walk 'round the quays, take a boat anywhere and you are downtown. The rooms are stunning. Each like a small suite large TV, DVD, in room bar. Breakfast in your room with the sliding doors open with a view like that is just wonderful.Ther is a huge marble bathroom, very large shower and bath, huge towels. Large floor to ceiling windows give you a magnificent view of the harbour and as the hotel is built on historic land, it is only allowed to be three floors high. There is a pool on the top floor. You lie there in the sun sipping a cocktail looking at a view that is stunning. The staff are young and very attentive with a typical Aussi informality. Their restaurant is one of the finest in Sydney. We have stayed there six times now & we live in Paris.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at the Park Hyatt on the last night of our honeymoon. We were not willing to spend $800 for one night (we'd rather have had two more nights on Green Island instead), but we got the night free with a Hyatt promotion. The place was simply amazing. Best view of the Opera House in the city, opposite a private pier where no ships can dock to block the view. From our balcony, we looked left, and there it was. Right below the Harbour Bridge too (we recommend climbing the steps to the South Pylon observation deck), in the heart of The Rocks--fantastic! Great entertainment in the bar, and excellent staff. The room itself was superb, with a marble bathroom and very comfortable bed, even with remote-controlled curtains! Is it worth $800? Again, I'd take two nights on Green Island instead in a heartbeat, but if you have the means (or get lucky like we did), the Park Hyatt can't be beat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Have not stayed here for years but were impressed with our reception. An early check-in was no problem even though an early business meeting meant we did not require this. Divine room with balcony view onto the inner harbour. We stayed a long weekend and it was a delight to observe all of the weddings below when we were at our room. Despite the opening balcony doors the room was so quite and dark at night - easy to catch up lost sleep. Bed was divine and room extremely good value. As we love to walk a lot the bath was really appreciated to soak in at night. Next trip will use the excellent spa facilities. Staff were very helpful and pleasant but unobtrussive. Check in/out was very low key - much appreciated. We dined out with local business colleagues but you would be wise to check out the restaurant menu - excellent choices if you are gastronomically challenged. Looking forward to a repeat stay next month.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for only a night, using points rather than paying. I'm not sure any hotel is worth what this place charges, but it is certainly a lovely, top-of-the-line hotel in an ideal location. According to our very impressed taxi driver, it's the best hotel in town. Our room was beautiful, big and elegant but not over the top. Great views. It's not a marble-and-mirror palace; they've got Eames lounge chairs in the lobby. Classy, ya know? I read some of the other reviews of this place and I want to point out one thing: the staff here is great. Very friendly, not haughty or obsequious, but kind and attentive. The concierge found us a nice restaurant (Aqua, highly recommended) that was even sort of kid-friendly. We're not the target demographic for the Park Hyatt; we had two little kids in tow and didn't hang out at the bar. But the staff were great with our kids and made us feel at home, albeit a luxurious home.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have visited Sydney on a number of occassions and always promised we would treat ourselves to the Park Hyatt, overlooking the Opera House. What a disappointment! Hugely overpriced ($700+ per night RO) for what you get. I have stayed in other Hyatt hotels and assure you this is the WORST. Rooms are small and grubby and the service is dreadful. Even trying to get fresh milk and tea bags from Housekeeping was like getting blood from a stone. We all know hotel phone charges are high, but a $5 charge wether or not you actually make a connection?! $30 for internet connection! Its free in the cafe across the road in the Rocks. After an awful breakfast with dreadful service we tried a number of cafes in the Rocks, it was 1/4 the price, better and included freewire internet service. Best recommendation for breakfast id the Patisserie My advise.. try an independant hotel in the Rocks or even the Mantra hotel is better on Bond St.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For a hotel of this calibre, not to mention price, we were disappointed with several aspects of our stay. The location and view may be inspiring from the guest rooms, but try getting a cab at any time of the day or night and the doorman will advise you to 'walk up the road and try at the Four Seasons; taxis don't like coming here!' Not a great recommendation for a five-star hotel, especially if you are wearing high heels. Our pre-booked morning newspaper failed to materialise and took 45 minutes to resolve; a pre-booked and much-needed massage appointment at the Spa was messed up and we were simply advised to 'come back later'. And the parting gift was an additional $75 bill, sent by mail, because the housekeeping staff had incorrectly tallied our minibar account. All in all it was a thoroughly ordinary experience, despite the view of the Opera House. If you are contemplating a stay at this hotel, consider the Four Seasons instead (where I have also stayed and had much better service)!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked accommodations here based on recommendations from fellow travelers. There's no doubt that the Park Hyatt enjoys the best location in Sydney. It's why you book your admittedly expensive room here. After leaving through the hotel's rear door you're just steps away from some of Sydney's finest restaurants. And within sight and a short walk away, you'll find the handy Sydney ferries and a rail station at Circular Quay. Our king room, while not exuding the pure luxury of some other Park Hyatt properties inclduing their hotel in Tokyo, was good sized and comfortable although a bit dated. We really enjoyed the balcony with views of the world famous Sydney Opera House. With so many nearby local dining options we did not try the Hyatt's restaurant for dinner. We did have breakfast there one morning but it is pretty steep. $40 Australian for a continental and if you'd like made-to-order eggs with your meal, add another $5. We highly recommend a stay here and certainly enjoyed our five day stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a wonderful place. We stayed here on the second leg of our Honeymoon and the hotel staff made everything run so smoothly with a personal service, you didnâ€™t feel like another number. Our room was amazing and we looked out directly over the harbour onto the Sydney Opera House, It was that close I felt that I could touch it! As a great lover of Sydney I could not have asked for anything else. The bathroom was in keeping with the luxury of the hotel with some lovely toiletries and the power shower was wonderful for staving off the jet lag! Everything about the hotel was run beautifully and the breakfast was cooked to order perfectly. The location is fantastic for getting around and about and it took no time to walk across and round the area of The Rocks to the Botanical Gardens. On the downside it is very expensive, even though itâ€™s a fabulous place I think you are paying for the location primarily and some of the cheaper views donâ€™t have the view we had, I only wish we could afford to stay there again on our next trip!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Like another reviewer I went to the Park Hyatt on a Saturday night to enjoy the music in the bar and the wonderful views. The Sydney Opera House was being used as a light show, so we had a feast of attractions to make it (potentially) a memorable evening. The jazz music was very good - they were quite well-known Sydney musos - but unfortunately the very ordinary bar food, high prices and ordinary service didn't match the music or the light show. My wife's bloody mary was undrinkable, and while they tried to "repair" it, no one seemed perturbed that it was left untouched. The wine list was - not surprisingly - on the expensive side, which fails to take into account that wine (Aussie and overseas) is at historically low prices. In the end it was a good night that could have been much better. No other hotel in Sydney has such a prime location, but you can't just wrest on your laurels and assume that's all you need do. By the way, does anyone know other places in the city which have similar lounge bars with live jazz where you can actually talk without shouting?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having only recently discovered, and taken advantage of trip advisor I thought it time to write a review. My wife and I regularly visit Sydney and for the past four years have always stayed at the Park Hyatt. Location is extraordinary - worth the extra $ for a room with a view of the Opera House. Service throughout the hotel is always spot on. The concierge service in particular is worth taking advantage of; have helped organise a variety of side trips for us over the years. One that will never be forgotten was a two night getaway via seaplane to Jonah's at the northern beaches of Sydney. Being on Sydney Harbour you can organize a water taxi directly to Manly, Rose Bay (where the seaplanes take off and only ten minutes from the hotel) and just about anywhere with a wharf. The inhouse restaurant is worthy of its location but don't forget there are half a dozen one, two and three hat restaurants with-in walking distance. Concierge can be very helpful with last minute reservations. Suggest - Guillaume at Bennelong, Aria, Galilao and Quay. Cant talk highly enough of the place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Even better than the location of the Park Hyatt Sydney is the service. The concierge staff was extraordinary in their efforts to meet any request and provide any service, including giving minor first aid to our scared toddler. They secured a private driver for us, recommended restaurants, gave helpful transportation advice and helped in many ways. The rooms were very good, looking out at the Circular Quay and (from the balcony) the Opera House. I enjoyed just watching the light change on the view by the hour. And the location, tucked under the base of the Harbor Bridge, at the edge of The Rocks, gives quick access to restaurants, shopping, water taxis, ferries and walks on or across the bridge. Only small nits: the connecting doors between our rooms could not be unlocked, so gave us the potential of having kids locked in one room and adults in another if they inadvertently closed the door - which they did once! The hotel restaurant's breakfast was good, but other meals and room service offered sort of ho-hum choices. But the proximity to other good food made this less of an issue.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived by night in Sydney, check-in was a casual, relaxed affair and we were shown to our room and were wowed by the amazing view across the harbour to The Sydney Opera House. The hotel is perfectly situated at The Rocks in Circular Quay. The room was spacious and comfortable, but a little dated. The hotel is closing for a six-month refit at the end of March, so I would say it will be spectacular when it reopens, as all of the common areas were very nice. We had a drink and some bar food, in the old fashioned bar which was a lovely spot to unwind from the days travelling. Breakfast was wonderful, overlooking the Opera House, Bridge and Harbour. The rooftop pool and patio were a little small, but a pleasant place to chill. The hotel staff were really first-class, they could not do enough for us. The concierge arranged some brilliant, inexpensive tickets to the Ashes for us, a great day. Julien was very attentive waiting on us for breakfast. And Grant was amazing, above and beyond, to reinstate us with left items. Would definately return, I am sure it will be amazing after the renovation.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We've had a tough 2 weeks with three disappointing hotel stays. Arriving from our biggest disappointment at the Park Hyatt in Melbourne, our expectations were somewhat reduced. But, as soon as we pulled up to the entrance of the Sydney Park Hyatt, it was clear this was a whole different story. There was not one aspect of the service at this hotel that disappointed. Door men, valets, front desk clerks, restaurant service staff, concierge...all performed beyond expectations. We complained about the prices at the Melbourne Park Hyatt. In Sydney the prices were the same, but we did not feel taken advantage of. At the Sydney Park Hyatt, you pay for the quality, but the quality is worth paying for. The food quality is excellent, the location is outstanding for downtown visiting (though a bit tough to get to since it is the furthest point you can go through generally very slow traffic), many of Sydney's attractions are within walking distance as are the ferrys and many great restaurants. Take the ferry to Manly Beach and have lunch at the recently opened Manly Pavilion restaurant! It is a great experience...and, of course, don't miss the Opera House tour.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has a perfect location! We booked an Opera View room and we were not disappointed by the view! It is within walking distance to much dining and stores in the Rocks area. We felt very safe there at night walking around also. The room itself was nice but nothing out of the ordinary for the price ($700+ a night). You are paying for the view which we felt was worth it. I had written the hotel two letters ahead of time saying we were celebrating special occasions (our son's wedding in Australia, my birthday, and our anniversary) but they did nothing for us which most hotels will have something to honor this. I did write about this in my comments card and found an apology letter when I got home from the manager saying it wasn't on my reservation. This could not be true, unless someone did not record it, as I sent it twice and all the other hotels on our trip responded to this. As we had an early sightseeing tour one day and an early flight the next, we ordered room service which was on time but pricey. We also had a drink in their lounge which was very pricey ($18 a drink). I would chose this hotel again as I felt you cannot get a better view or location!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here over the easter weeked, a break from Sofitel where I usually stay. Likes - Very polite, genuine and friendly staff; definitely the highlight of the hotel - Excellent view and location; hard to fault looking at the Opera House every time you look out the window and right down at the Rocks so easy to get around. - Very good amenities from Vive - Good quality food at the restaurant - Good Amex FHR amenities (3 course lunch for 2 once during stay and contintental breakfast each morning (upgrade to full cooked buffet for AUD$5). - Good size bathroom and wardrobe Dislikes - Not as luxurious as some other Park Hyatt's, rooms well maintained but could do with a make over - Pool area is very 'Holiday Inn', it's on the roof which is fantastic but small pool and tiny spa. Couldn't see any changing rooms at the pool, no bar facilities etc. - Pricey internet - AUD55c per minute. Overall this is a very good hotel and I really enjoyed the staff and the location but it's not the most luxurious hotel in Sydney and maybe not worth the price unless you get a great deal (maybe AUD$350 per night). Having stayed at other Sydney hotels I think that there's maybe better value elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here over Christmas and we wish we had booked a longer stay. We had a completely flawless stay. The service at the Park Hyatt Sydney is probably the best we've ever experienced. One manager in the restaurant "Lucas" took the time to tell us all about Australia and Sydney. He gave us some great advise and as a result, our whole trip was perfect. It didn't matter which staff member we talked to, they all took the time to help and say "yes". Even the valets outside the front door were polite, and helpful 100% of the time. We didn't have a single "no, I'm sorry..." the whole time we were there. All the rooms are beautifully appointed with breathtaking views. And the food is first rate. It's an expensive hotel but, as one other reviewer said, Why should it be? With such service, quality, and location, one would expect to pay for it. We have stayed in many many hotels all over the world, with and without our kids, and this was hands down the best experience yet. I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you Park Hyatt Sydney!! (**Just as an aside, we went to the Hyatt in MELBOURNE for a few days after Christmas, and it was total crap in every way. There is No comparison to be made whatsoever.)</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was eagerly anticipating my stay at the newly refurbished Park Hyatt Sydney as I had heard good reviews and that it has Australia's best guest rooms. Well I was disappointed!!! The lobby is tiny, unimpressive and is an impersonal desk stuck in the middle of the main walkway of the hotel!! However I could not fault the service at check-in as the staff where impeccable at the front desk. The rooms are nice but lack that real sense of class that the hotel says and thinks it has. The furniture in the room was nice but nothing great, there's an arm chair in the room that just looked like a nicer version of an ikea arm chair. The breackfast was very good, probably the best thing about the hotel, however I ordered room service one night and they forgot a couple of things and I had to call them to bring them up. At$900 a night for your basic standard room the hotel is very very very overpriced!!! Yes the location is nice. Yes the service is good. But this hotel does not have Australia's best guest rooms and the hotel shouldn't boast that it does!!! I don't mind paying $900 a night for a hotel room and I have done so many times the world over, but Im sorry Park Hyatt Sydney you are not worth much a night!!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great location but needs renovation.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">To begin...we were extremely excited to be staying at another Park Hyatt. We had stayed in the Park Hyatt in Melbourne a few weeks before and LOVED it! Unfortunately the chain is not consistent. This hotel is one of the most expensive hotels in Sydney. It's location cannot be beat. It has a great reputation, but lacked in most areas. The room was old and worn. We had a room with the view of the opera house and that was AMAZING. It's fitness/spa center is tiny and the pool area lacked any amenities. We had spa services. There was only 2 massage rooms, a sauna and a steam room which is used by everyone in the hotel. There was no "relaxation room" so we decided to use the jacuzzi prior to getting our treatment. The treatments were, standard, and the ladies were sweet, but it was nothing to write home about. The hotel staff, in general, was snooty and did not seem to want to be bothered. We are used to this attitude in the USA, but after we had been in Australia for a month we were more than disappointed in their hospitality.

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is simply stunning - easily the best location in Australia, with stunning views of one of the world's most beautiful harbours. Our checkin was handled with discrete, personalised service, and our room was ready upon arrival. The room itself was magnificent, and among the finest of all the Hyatt properties I have stayed in around the world. Unfortunately, the quality of room service was poor. It took 90 mins to deliver a small (250ml) jug of fresh milk (and then only after two reminder calls). Fortunately, the $4.50 charge was reversed at departure. It took 1 hour 15 minutes to deliver a cheese platter - thus causing us to be late for our dinner engagement. No apologies were offered. (We ended up consuming the cheese platter after we returned!) It was such a shame that the very slow in-room catering let down the rest of the team. I sincerley hope this is a "one-off" incident, as I would hate it to degrade what is an otherwise outstanding 5 star property. Valet parking was prompt and courteous, and my wife was thoroughly impressed with the facial she received at the spa. Overall, we did enjoy our stay and recommend it to other travellers - notwithstanding that for us, the in-room catering was not value for money.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived tired and jet lagged in the early hours of the morning and our room (understandably) wasnt ready - but were welcomed by the manager (a 'celeb' was on the same flight/in same hotel as us - I cant imagine he would normally do that - but it was nice) but they treated us to a complimentary breakfast and we watched the sun rise over sydney opera house from the comfort of our breakfast table. The location and the view is amazing. We went out for a walk and they phoned us a couple of hours later to say our room was ready - having fast tracked house keeping when the previous guest had checked out. The room was well appointed and comfortable - worth paying the extra for a harbour view. The concierge staff were helpful and attentive and sorted things out when our pre-booked trip to the Blue Mountains failed to show up - they made them come back and fetch us :-) They booked us fab trips and made great eating out recommendations. Customer service at reception and breakfast were first rate. Laundry service excellent but a little pricey. Overall a wonderful start to our grand tour of Australia. We went a few years before the date indicated - but it wont let you "back review" and ive only just got properly into trip advisor - which is a great website.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I felt compelled to write this because I use Tripadvisor a lot to research where to stay next, and always trying to filter negative from the positives. I could not believe the amount of positive response for this hotel. This hotel is touted to be one of our best and maybe it is but comeon everyone what are you seriously comparing this to? I travel twice a year and check into all the top class hostels and resorts. Either the previous reviews have never been anywhere outside Australia, or it is not the customers who are providing the reviews. There is a clear lack of interest by the staff which is not unusual for Sydney hospitality generally. Also there was a touch of arrogance on top of this which was noticeable. The breakfast was fair but no wow factor at all. Our toilet seat lid kept falling off in our room. There was definately no value with this stay and will not be going back. We wrote a letter to the hotel to state our disappoint and issues with a very flat response. The room itself was reasonable and the view and location pretty good, so if this is what you want then if you pay enough, which is too much, then you get it. My suggestion is to try the fourseasons. The rooms are about the same, the service and food much better and the views are spectacular.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for 3 nights in a city harbour view room. Donâ€™t be expecting the view shown on the website with this category of room. I had to lean over the railing and look to the left to see the Opera House. Loved the balcony and would of loved to sit out there but the seat cushions were soiled and the table was less than clean. The room itself was OK. Loved all the shelves. The lights in them do make the top surface warm so watch what you place on them. The automatic curtains would not close all the way. The light wood is pleasant but it shows every mar and scuff. The bed was one of the most uncomfortable I have experienced. I think the pillow topper was missing as it was very firm. Even our friends that came to our room made mention of it so I knew it was not just us. The bedside clock did not have a light so you could not tell the time after dark. Huge bathroom with great amenities. Slight mildew issue at the base of one of the glass walls in the shower. Toilet seat opening is quite large so beware. Some of the TV channels came in less than focused. Wonderful closet. Common areas were good with the exception of the area near the bar that smelled of stale smoke. The Staff are beyond wonderful! They are some of the best I have ever encountered. They along with the location are what make this hotel. If you put the building anywhere else it would not command such a price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent three nights at the Park Hyatt as part of a five week round the world tour. The torrential rain which greeted us and llasted for two days did not detract from the enjoyment of our stay and we made good use of the nearby harbour ferries to visit friends at Greenwich and Manly. We dined in the restaurant for the first night and for the next two days for breakfast which was very good. There is a great charade about getting a window table which have the best views but by negotiation we managed to progress over two days from the inferior rear row of tables through the middle row then to the front row. When we asked on the second day if we could take one of the front row tables which were empty we were told these were reserved. We asked if we could reserve one of the front row tables for the following day, only to be told that they don't take reservations! After a few minutes we were then told that one of the empty front row tables had beome vacant so we eventually got what we wanted. This hotel is expensive and we booked one of the more expensive full Opera House view rooms which was on the third (top) floor. Watching one of the large cruise liners depart majestically to the sound of music from our balcony was majical and there is so much activity in the harbour. All in all, a great hotel with excellent service, but you do have to work to get front row seats in the dining room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After travelling 24 hours from Western Europe to Sydney, with a full day of meetings looming at you through the gloom of what will most certainly be a night of jetlagged half-slumber, you want an hotel that is laid back, comfortable, and spacious. The Hyatt is this place. Check-in is painless and the staff are courteous, discreet, and accommodating. The hotel is located in the Rocks quarter of Sydney, just below the Harbour Bridge, with a beautiful view to the CBD, the Opera House, and harbour suburbs. The rooms are exceptionally spacious, the beds comfortable, and the bathrooms large and equipped with a great tub and separate shower. I have stayed in this hotel on numerous occasions over the past 10 years. The property has aged well and the standards of service are, I think, amongst the best in Sydney. Breakfast is a real treat, with beautiful views of the harbour from every table. The buffet is a bit pricey (aren't they always), but you can order an excellent "flat white" and some Greek yogurt with berries and get away only A$ 20 lighter. There's a decent gym facility, and if you're a runner, all you need to do is put on the trainers and step out the door to be on a great footpath that will take you as far up the harbour as you want. There are also a number of good restaurants steps away on the waterfront, and the ferry terminal to other areas of interest on the harbour is a 5 minute walk.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was skeptical as to whether it would be worth the money but I have to say between the fantastic views (opera view suite), great location, and superb concierge I am now sure it was. The staff was so friendly, when we came in from our international flight early in the morning they let us use the spa facilities to clean up so we could enjoy the day instead of waiting around for our room. The greatest thing, though, was the concierge. We booked several dinner reservations through the concierge including one reservation that I was told was "unavailable" by the restaurant. I think what sets apart a luxury hotel is the service and they didn't let us down. The rooms are slightly dated, but the hotel is now closed for a six-month renovation, so any defects (I thought the room was nice but it did have a 90s style bathroom) should be cured. We enjoyed the restaurant, but we did only eat there for breakfast and one lunch - as I recall now we had a really nice waffle one breakfast (so many places can't do them right or manage to serve them hot) and a fantastic burrata appetizer at lunch. I also used the spa for a massage and the masseuse was good (I had a deep tissue and you need to get someone who knows what they're doing for that) and the massage room was beautiful. Over our four day stay we really had no complaints - ok one, they need to stop charging for internet access it is just ridiculous at their price level- and would definitely come back.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall a nice hotel but would probably try another next time in Sydney, particularly as the price is top of the range. The hotel is celebrating its 20th anniversary & it shows a bit - everything is sparkly clean and nothing is tatty but it all just seems, well, very 1990. Pale ash furniture & lots of mirrors in the room, none of it very stylish, leaves you with a cold feeling. Hotel only has 3 floors so the scale is intimate & every contact we had with staff was perfect & genuinely warm & welcoming. Views of the harbour & depending on the room & how you crane your neck, the Opera House, are nice. Big problem may be the location - Circular Quay area is very touristy & the hotel is well out of the way of things tucked under the Harbour Bridge. We live in HK but are from New York & it felt like we were staying at the South Street Seaport - which, if you aren't familiar, is just a major no-no (think mimes, break dancing exhibitions, deranged seagull attacks & screaming teen tour groups). Because it is so out of the way, you need to trudge through that street performing & other nonsense for at least 10 minutes to get into the CBD & find anything resembling real city life going on. By taxi, the winding route to The Rocks will cost you an extra AU$ 5 to 7 & 5 -10 minutes for every ride to & from. To sum up, it's very clean & everyone treats you like a welcomed guest, but at these price points you probably want a little more, beginning with some style & a better, hipper location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had always yearned to stay at the Park Hyatt Sydney and at last I had accrued enough Hyatt Gold Passport points to book a room as a birthday treat. Booking in was a very easy experience and sitting at a desk in the lobby made you feel important. On checking in, the charming young lady inquired if we were celebrating any special occasion and on hearing that it was my birthday she had no hesitation in arranging for a nice bottle of champagne to be sent to our room. As I had secured the booking on points I was half expecting a room with a lesser view but we were blown away with both the room and the view of the Harbour and the Opera House. They also provided us with vouchers for a welcome drink in the hotel bar which was also appreciated. We did not eat at the hotel as there are any number of quality restaurants within minutes walk all providing great food and matching views of the Harbour Bridge and Opera House. My only negative of the room was that I considered the bed to be a touch hard for my liking but I still managed to have a good nights rest. The electric curtains were a nice touch as we didn't have to get out of bed to open up the magnificent view of the Opera House in the morning. All staff in the hotel were friendly and obliging. As the regular room tariff for the hotel is $700+ , the biggest test is, would I pay that much to stay there or is there better value quality hotels in Sydney. To put this question to the test we checked out after one night and checked into the Shangri La which is about 600 metres away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We cashed Hyatt Passport Points to stay at Sydney Park Hyatt. What a big different from Y Hotel Hyde Park! (Read my previous review of Y Hotel Hyde Park). The hotel is about 10 minute walk to Circular Quay. We did not get the Opera room, but our room faced Circular Quay and International Cruise Terminal. I was told that to use the Wi-Fi, I had to log on with my last name and room number as password. When I opened a browser, the log on screen was automatically populated with first name and last name of the guest who stayed in different room. For privacy reason, it wasnâ€™t good. I explained the system issue to the front desk. Internet is free for Hyatt Platinum members. One day the front desk helped me to mail several postcards free of charge but the next day other staff asked me â€œwould you like to pay $2.10 for the postcard stamps or bill to the room?â€� The heat wave caused the temperature to jump to 42 C. It was the perfect time to try the roof-top pool. I notice a popular restaurant â€œPancake on the Rocksâ€�, just 5 minute walk. We did not eat there because the line was too long. We decided to dine at Hyatt Harbor Kitchen. We ordered McLeay Valley rabbit braised in balsamic with fregola, marjoram, pecorino and Tasmanian wilderness beef short rib with tamarind, molasses glaze, watercress, horseradish. The sauce was so overwhelming that I could not taste the meat at all. The food was unappealing (see photos) and looked like what Fiona serves Shrek every morning. Overall, the hotel and restaurant service were excellent but food is not good.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed twice at this Hotel in the past five years. First time around it was just superb - in many ways jaw-dropping; fabulous location, magnificent rooms, wonderfully efficient, discreet and thoughtful service, good food...all was wonderful, fully justifying the top-notch price. Second time around the price seemed to have accelerated fantastically, while the Hotel itself had regressed in several significant ways. We sensed resting on hard-won laurels, an assumption of being "The best in Town" without any longer exercising the painstaking attention to detail which would first win, and then retain, such an assessment. Superbly furnished, very well equipped and comfortable rooms still prevailed - customer service had fallen off considerably - and it showed. When key swipe cards failed to work we were told "You must've done something wrong" . In an allegedly world-class 5-star Hotel a default mode that the customer has it wrong might justifiably be judged...inadvisable. We thought standard of food and cafeteria - not restaurant - service had also declined. Feeling after previous wonderful experience of this Hotel was of disappointed regret. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, these things can be cyclical, and every staff member can have an off day...or weekend. Our impression, however, was of a general malaise, general decline. Advise is to expect the very best, but be braced for another "off day". Rooms and location should not disappoint, however. In essence, a great Hotel...offering standards that, in our experience, have great pitential, not consistently fulfilled.</p></li>

<li>Second time around the <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">price</span> seemed to have accelerated fantastically, while the Hotel itself had regressed in several significant ways.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were lucky enough to stay here for our wedding night and I'm glad to say that it was perfection. We got a Opera View room and were allowed to check in an hour early so that everyone could get their hair and makeup done (although they would not commit to this until that morning which added a bit of nerves). The room itself was an Opera View room with a lovely view of the Opera House. I am very particular with my hotel rooms but I can honestly say that this was perfectly appointed with everything I could ever want! The bathroom was huge and had a separate bath and there was a sizeable walk in closet where I could hang up my wedding gown. The leather chair with foot stool was gorgeous (I really wanted one for myself, I saw one for $4,000 at David Jones) and the TV had a great selection of channels. Rooms are very well soundproofed which helps on a Saturday night when people walk past the hotel. When we came back from our reception at midnight we were greeted with Lindor balls, strawberries and sparkling wine. The next morning we awoke for the breakfast and if I can be critical, this was a smaller selection of breakfast goodies than I have previously seen at other breakfast buffets. The food was a little disappointing and the fruit was quite unripe and hard. I've actually had a wide standard of meals at the Park Hyatt from hideous (think Deb instant mash and microwaved thawed meat) to sublime (the Good Good Month dessert menu). Other than that, the Park Hyatt has wonderfully accomodating service and the rooms are absolutely top notch with stunning views and the best Sydney has to offer.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was probably the most expensive night of our honeymoon but my goodness it was worth it. Our package included champagne, breakfast and a dessert plate. We arrived in Sydney after a pretty bad and sleepless flight and took a cab straight to the hotel at about 6am. I could have kissed the receptionist when he said that our room was ready for us as I was exhausted. The room was spectacular with large marble bathroom and walk in wardrobe but the star was the view; our room looked directly across the harbour to the Opera House. It was absolutely stunning. As we were on our honeymoon the hotel had kindly given us a bottle of champagne and some strawberries to celebrate so with the package we already had we actually had two bottles of champagne. After a quick sleep we went to the hotel restaurant for a delicious breakfast with the view over the harbour. Weâ€™d definitely have breakfast there again even if not staying at the hotel. We decided to have dinner on our balcony that night as we thought we wouldnâ€™t find a restaurant with a better view. Room service was very nice and we also had our dessert plate and some champagne. The next morning we went for a swim in the pool on the roof which was lovely; itâ€™s just below the bridge so there was another great view. The hotel also benefits from a business centre with free internet for the first 30 (I think) minutes so that was enough to send a few emails. The hotel is right on the quayside and an easy walk to the train station even with baggage so Iâ€™d get that to and from the airport. If I had the money Iâ€™d definitely stay here again. It was sublime.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband & I started our 3 week Australia itinerary with a 3 night stay in an opera room at the Sydney Park Hyatt. We arrived 7 hrs. late because a huge dust storm caused havoc with our flight from Los Angeles, but check-in was very fast & attentive. Little coupons we had for complimentary refreshments were redeemed, plus welcome champagne & chocolate-covered strawberries from our travel agent were already in our room when we entered. It's as if the staff quickly assessed our travel weariness & got us settled without fuss. Despite our 40 hour travel ordeal, we revived is less than a half hour. The room was wonderful--very, very clean, airy, comfortable, nice bed, perfect linens--everything you would expect of a 5-star property. Of course, the incomparable view of the Opera House from the balcony made us forget our fatigue & we began to enjoy our holiday from the very first moment. Despite our speedy check-in, we had very little time to get to our reserved Bridge Climb & the concierge assisted us most ably. We loved the concierge here as they helped us also with our day trip to the Blue Mountains as well as with little & big recommendations throughout our stay. They seemed to pick up on our interests & preferences very quickly. They also never failed to ask us how our plans went--it made our stay very warm & personable. We only ate breakfast at the hotel, but it was wonderful. I had stayed here once before in 2004 & breakfast was abysmal at that time. Now it was good & with a better entrance to the dining room. Service & check-in has improved since 2004 as well. We can't imagine how anything could have been better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I arrived about 2:15pm for my two night stay and went through check-in where I was told that the room wasn't quite ready yet. As I was in my home city and not coming off a long flight or similar, this wasn't a problem and I went and had a drink in the bar followed by a nice walk around the park and pier surrounding the hotel. The room became available just after 3:30pm and I was escorted to the room by the same friendly person who checked me in earlier. The room was on the second floor, at the curve of the main building that comes around to face the Opera House. The views of the harbour from the balcony were wonderful and definitely a prime attraction of the room. The double doors were effective in keeping the noise of the harbour out during the night almost entirely. Some of the furniture items might be in need a bit of refurbishment but it was still very comfortable. We had breakfast in the hotel on both mornings, we ordered off the menu rather than the buffet, delivery of the meals was quite slow on both occasions - but to be fair the restaurant must have been close to, if not full both times. I really enjoyed the truffled scrambled eggs, rocket and parmesan with a side of Barossa Valley "Schultz" bacon and my girlfriend had two different egg dishes that I was told were nice, so it was worth the wait. Not much else of interest to report - a repair person turned up around 5:30pm on the first afternoon asking if there was a problem with one of the doors closing, but we hadn't had any problems. A late check out was granted which was appreciated. All in all, I found the staff to be brilliant and the room and location were spectacular. I'm very much looking forward to my next stay here later this month.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a classic example of the best of times or the worst of times. The rack rate of AU$600 per night we paid for a "Park King" is in my long experience of hotel staying the biggest ripoff ever. A glorious location for a hotel where having paid AUS$600 for an early check in we were shown to a room that can only be described as a dungeon. A small window with an upward view of the Harbour Bridge. After complaining that this was totally depressing we were offered a room at the end of the long building that had a window looking at a tree and the street below. One could only envy those lucky guests who would enjoy the prettiest view in all of Sydney. A word of warning to all.. do not pay this kind of money for an ordinary hotel room just because your neighbors are enjoying themselves. Check out time is a ridiculous 11AM. An offer to stay until 13:00 was made for a charge of AU$130! Only after our frustration was made palpable did the same receptionist finally offer a later check out, "complimentary." The nicest gesture made in 4 nights. Staff were polite if imperious. A sense of importance filled the air apart from the poor scum like us who had to hike to the far end of the hotel to our sad rooms. Probably the longest corridor in the western world being served by only one elevator!The price here compared to The Four Seasons is ludicrous. The restaurant/bar food was disgraceful as was the service. I had wanted to stay at this hotel for years. I regret having done so and strongly urge any potential guests to clarify completely the location and view of the room before putting down the hefty price for a room in this much overrated hotel. I am sure it can be glorious here if one is lucky enough to have the chips fall in the right place. They did not for us and we shall never return.</p></li>

<li>One could only envy those lucky guests who would enjoy the prettiest <span style="background-color:#808080" title="p=0.999">view</span> in all of Sydney.</br></br></li>
<li>A word of warning to all.. do not pay this kind of money for an ordinary hotel room just because your neighbors are enjoying themselves.</br></br></li>
<li>Check out time is a ridiculous 11AM.</br></br></li>
<li>An offer to stay until 13:00 was made for a charge of AU$130!</br></br></li>
<li>Only after our frustration was made palpable did the same receptionist finally offer a later check out, "complimentary."</br></br></li>
<li>The nicest gesture made in 4 nights.</br></br></li>
<li><span style="background-color:#ffd8b1" title="p=0.999">Staff</span> were polite if imperious.</br></br></li>
<li>A sense of importance filled the <span style="background-color:#911eb4" title="p=0.996">air</span> apart from the poor scum like us who had to hike to the far end of the hotel to our sad rooms.</br></br></li>
<li>Probably the longest corridor in the western world being served by only one elevator!The <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">price</span> here compared to The Four Seasons is ludicrous.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">restaurant</span>/bar food was disgraceful as was the service.</li>
<li>The restaurant/<span style="background-color:#46f0f0" title="p=0.990">bar food</span> was disgraceful as was the service.</br></br></li>
<li>I had wanted to stay at this hotel for years.</br></br></li>
<li>I regret having done so and strongly urge any potential guests to clarify completely the location and <span style="background-color:#808080" title="p=0.999">view of</span> the room before putting down the hefty price for a room in this much overrated hotel.</br></br></li>
<li>I am sure it can be glorious here if one is lucky enough to have the chips fall in the right <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.996">place</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>They did not for us and we shall never return.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I stayed at the Park Hyatt Sydney on 27 July 2010. The experience was so positive that, after benefiting from countless TA reviews but always never getting around to reciprocating, I am finally doing my first review. I have coveted staying at this hotel for many years but it's not exactly within our usual price range. If I couldn't hide out in the Maldives or Morocco for a big birthday, then staying overnight somewhere special in our own home town would have to do. I really didn't expect, though, for the reality to fully live up to the "dream" or the hype or even the cost, but thankfully I was wrong. Maybe it helped that it was a quiet time of year, or that I wasn't jetlagged, or the complimentary bottle of sparkling wine that was delivered to our room after the concierge learned of our special occasion, or the late check out. One can also become fairly blase about an icon such as the Sydney Opera House when it's in your own backyard, so to speak. But at the opening of the remote controlled curtains of our Opera View Room, the Opera House looked sensational and new. The staff at the Park Hyatt were also among the friendliest I have experienced, impressing as quite genuine in their attentiveness and care. Alex in the Club Bar, and Ronnie, one of our concierges, were particularly helpful and friendly. The only negative to the night also ended up with a positive. We decided to dine in our room to get every cent's worth of our stay and the view. The cost of the meal was waivered, unsolicited by us, when one of the steaks was not cooked quite to our original request. Overall, the hotel is at the high end of the Sydney price range and, of course, we deserved to get what we paid for - it was just very nice indeed to actually have that outcome. Definitely recommend this hotel if you can afford it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Husband and I stayed here for a week on a two week holiday in Sydney in March 2009. Could not find a single fault with the hotel. First, the location of this hotel is incomparable. Just on the edge of the Rocks and Circular Quay, we were always a few yards away from things to do and food to eat. Second, the rooms are spectacular. We booked an Opera King and got upgraded to the larger room facing the Opera House. Every morning, we took photos of the sun rising over the opera house - the view was absolutely amazing. The room was perfection. Huge marble bathroom, giant walk-in closet, enormous sitting area, heavenly king bed, etc. Amenities were fantastic. We were given complimentary wine on arrival, and daily fruits and chocolates. Mini-bar was well-stocked, but we didn't use it since they gave us free water every day. We ordered room service almost daily, and it never took longer than 20 minutes, despite the fact that our room was the furthest from the elevator. The room service operators were the perkiest people we'd ever spoken to. The attached restaurants are also very good. We enjoyed several meals there and never had anything bad to eat. Business center was available 24 hours a day and free. Hotel wifi in our room was a bit expensive, but we're used to that in hotels all over the world. Taxis were called promptly. We did not try the pool on the roof. It looked small but clean. The staff were incredible. They knew our names, and also understood (without us telling them) that we would be returning to the hotel in a week for one additional night prior to our flight out of Sydney and asked (without any prompting) if there was anything we wished to leave behind in secure storage until our return. We can't wait to return to the hotel. It is lovely without being snooty. It will feel like home. A very posh home.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Where does one go to celebrate a special occasion in Sydney? Which hotel has the best view in Sydney? The Park Hyatt in Sydney has an unrivalled view of the Opera House, Circular Quay and The Harbour Bridge so that was where we headed to celebrate a special birthday. The checkin was smooth, the room was modern and had all the amenities one could wish for and the view from the huge super king sized bed was super spectacular. This hotel afforded us an opprotunity to play at being tourists in our own city and what a beautiful town it is. After we checked in and examined our room we walked out of the hotel for a stroll around the Harbour's edge. To warm up after our walk we stopped by the hotel coffee shop for a coffee that was served hot and with some nice bikkies before retiring to that Opera View room that had cost us so much. Sitting on the balcony drinking a bottle of French champagne (brought from home) and watching the sun set over the Opera House as Sydney ferries popped in and out of their moorings at Circular Quay was a magical experience. As the room was so well equipped we stayed in for a room service dinner and watched a couple of DVDs we brought from home on the inroom DVD player and flatscreen TV. The dinner was warm well presented and delicious. During our stay we took advantage on a couple occasions of the deep tub in the marble bathroom; the towels were large and fluffy and the bathroom lotions and potions agreeable. When we announced on checkout thast we were attending a family lunch at the nearby Doyles restaurant at The Quay the staff had no hesitation in offering us complimentary parking for the rest of the day. The service, amenities and location of this hotel were excellent ... and so they should be for the price. We may never stay here again but would recommend it unreservedly to others for a special occasion.</p></li>
