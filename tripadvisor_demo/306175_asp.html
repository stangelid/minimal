<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent 4 nights here in November - travelling on business. The location is spot on - in the heart of the city with easy access by taxi or MRT to all points. Loads of shopping and restaurants nearby. Rooms and bathrooms very good and very clean. Didnt try any of the food. Little pricey compared to other Singapore 5star hotels. Would choose to stay here again for sure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed here several times now and find the guest experience to be consistently good. The lobby area and rooms are excellent, although not to everybody's taste, so I can understand some of the other reviewer's comments in this regard. The staff at reception could be friendlier but they are certainly professional and efficient, which for a business hotel is just fine.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One of the best run hotels in the world and difficult to fault. Great position and great food. But Singapore is expensive, the night club downstairs full of intimidating ladies so not relaxing for a drink and the air con in the rooms often feels clammy/damp. Executive floor is worth the extra for great breakfast and snacks. I would not stay anywhere else in Singapore if visiting on business.</p></li>

We had a regular room but it had all the conveniences we needed for a pleasant 3 night stay. It was roomy and had provisions for businessmen like internet connection.. etc. The bathroom was impressive with its separate shower, bathtub and toilet areas. The hotel is located on Orchard road, so all the shopping malls were close by. It's very easy to get around in this area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here mainly for the location, which is great. Near shopping and subway. However, for an expensive 5 star property, my room (on the exec floors) was shabby. It was well kept, but its age showed. The toilet did not flush properly. I could hear neighbors on either side of me. That room was certainly due for a renovation. I did have a great dinner at the mezza9 restaurant. Great selection of Western and Asian dishes from one menu.</p></li>

We returned every evening to a clean, fresh room and it truly was a luxury when you've been out the whole day. The kids really enjoyed the room and that meant alot.

Nice spa. 4. Quiet rooms. Cons: 1. Don't get the sense that the hotel is managed or that anyone is in charge. This particularly applies to reception. 2. The hotel rooms have low ceilings and appear poorly maintained. In short, they are more of Hyatt Regency standard than Grand Hyatt. 3. Service (front desk/concierge) very inconsistent.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was a bit hesitant in booking the Grand Hyatt becuase people were complainingab out the lines for the taxis and getting mobbed by people going to Orchard. I never actually experienced any of it when I was there. To be very honest I was very happy, being upgraded upon check in to a Grand Deluxe Room and being close to the malls, I could easily drop my bags and rush out again. Actually everything was good...would be the top of my list if ever I visit Singapore again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a great hotel! I stayed in Singapore prior to my meetings in Vietnam. The hotel staff was great. The rooms were very nice and spacious. I highly recomend paying for the upgrade to an Executive Suite and adding in the Grand Club. I've been in many hotels over the years, and this hotel had the best concierge floor! The food was great but the service was even better! Great location for prime shopping and entertainment. Bring light clothes as Singapore can get quite hot!</p></li>

I am greatly impressed by the newness of the room and the spacious open layout. The service is also top quality. After one night of stay here, I tried out the Hilton Singapore. What a big disappointment. The service staff (esp. front desk delivery men) was extremely slow and with poor attitude. Hilton was in a totally inferior quality category.</p></li>

Worst part of the hotel, it's they charges SGD25 buck for 24 hours for internet access in the room, doesn't matter if you only use it for 1 minute, they still charge you for 25 bucks, which I think it's too expensive.</p></li>

Yes, there are newer hotels, fancier hotels and all that (not to mention the Sands mega-complex) but this one has all the right attributes for me.

I loved the renovated rooms, the super comfortable bed, the immaculate and beautiful showers, the sumptuous breakfast and many, many other things. It's a hotel I'd find a way to stay at if I were you. Hyatt should be proud to have this wonderful hotel in its family. The only small issue I would have is that the service is not all that warm, especially if you compare to Bangkok but compared to 98% of the rest of the world, it rocks.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in the Grand Hyatt on the way back from Sydney. We had booked our accomodation 6 months in advance and on checking in we were placed adjacent to a building site. The property next door to the hotel is being developed (as it most buildings in Singapore) so make sure you stress to the hotel you would prefer a garden view! However, the hotel staff were polite and did upgrade us to a lovely room. They could not have been more helpful, especially when my child became ill and we had to change our flights. I would recommend this hotel highly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am in Singapore frequently and have never stayed at the Hyatt... Until now! What was I waiting for?? Great location, excellent F&B (which I had enjoyed numerous times before) and a new wing with fantastic rooms. Great new design with rain shower, plasma, and great linen. Awesome! The price is great too. I used to stick my nose up at Hyatt properties (except Park Hyatt) and I have to say, this place is among my favorites anywhere. Service outstanding too. I will not stay anywhere else for a while (that is until the newness wears off!) Very happy...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 2 nights in a Grand King room. Early check in was granted and was appreciated. Bellmen, check in was great. Bags delivered quickly. Room was large, big bathroom, very comfy bed. There is some construction going on between the hotel and the Marriott and the noise was noticeable at times but not disruptive. Good safe and desk. Restaurants were good; location was great for shopping at Tang’s and DFS. Pool was going through a refurb but was not here long enough to fret over it. Granted my request to delay check out and quick check out. This hotel met all my needs and then some.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having seen the recent reviews we were a little hesitant to book here but we use Hyatt Passport so went with it. We requested a newly renovated club room so review is based on this. Likes - Good size room - Great decor in the Club Lounge (with free WiFi) - Location - StraitsKitchen! Dislikes - Maintenance issues in the bathroom (door handles and plug both broken) nb they were quickly repaired - Limited food range for breakfast and cocktail hour in the Club Lounge; especially when compared with other Hyatt's (eg Taipei) Overall - A pricey hotel, if you get a new room then is probably worth the money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Grand Hyatt has a very pleasent ambience with staff which is very friendly and attentive. Rooms are very well arranged and we personally liked the rain showers in the bathrooms. There is lot of variety for food but it is very expensive and outside market you get very hygenic and pocket friendly tasty food. Grand Hyatt has taken care of every necessity that a tourist will need and has provided everything in room. Overall I highly recommend this hotel. Note: If you are staying in Grand Hyatt better is to use train to commute within Singapore as TAXI will charge you for additional toll of Orchard street.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything about this hotel is fresh, modern and enjoyable. I have stayed here many times for work and pleasure and it is one of my favorite hotels in the world. The service is outstanding, the food is excellent, the pool is gorgeous and the rooms are fabulous. I love the location. Straits Kitchen is so good you must have a meal there. I am a fussy traveller who is spoilt and I think this is one of the best hotels around. The only downside is that the public areas are often crowded. A testament to the quality of the property but at times a bit overwhelming. Treat yourself to a club tower room it is worth the extra expense.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was a one day stopover trip to Singapore for me, and i wanted to stay at a place which is close to the tourist spot, and gives me comfortable stay. I have stayed in Hyatt in other locations before and this experience at Hyatt also turned out be good. The hotel is close to Scott road metro station and thus provides a very good connectivity with the airport. I took the metro too to come to Hotel. The Hotel has a great ambience. Room was pretty decent size with windows facing towards Scott Road. The Hotel staff is very courteous. Food and drinks are great too. Lots of choices for breakfast. Would recommend this hotel to everyone.</p></li>

Since I was quite busy in the hotel for conference, the location was great for a quick shopping after.. as it is very close to Orchard Road. And if you need to take the MRT, it is just a bit of walk to get there. The business center was really well equipped and I love the fact they serve illy coffee!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in the Hyatt for two nights in early Nov for a business trip. Location - is great; very centrally located, and also close to Orchid Road - mecca of shopping. Room - was really large. A pleasant surprise. Nice study table on the side with great views, and a large bathroom. Almost looked like new. Service - didnt have time to order from room service. Restaurants - The Straits Kitchen downstairs is amazing. The widest selection of food I have seen in a while. Service also was very prompt. Perhaps this is a Singapore thing. Reception - check in/out was very prompt. In sum, whether for business or leisure, this hotel offers excellent value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This Hyatt is a fantastic hotel, but gave us the feeling to be more of a business hotel, then a place where you want to spend a romantic couple of days. The rooms are spacious and full of luxuary, high speed internet works perfectly and was added free-of-charge. We could also get an early check-in at 9a which was great after a night of flying from Chennai. The restaurant is inside without garden and with rather cold and dark atmosphere, not very cosy. No bar. The garden and swimming pool are nicely done but not very large. I spend a couple of months earlier in the Shangri-La and would recommend that one for leisure, the Hyatt for business travel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has one of the best location in town and is very convenient for the whole Orchard shopping area. It also features a great restaurant upstairs and a martini bar. The new renovated rooms are very spacious and comfortable and finally a hotel which thinks about business travellers who need to plug 3-4 different things in! The overall experience was very good and you can feel the high standards of Hyatt including the nice executive lounge, the only small thing I would mention us that the service was at some times not a good as I would have expected, it seemed that the staff was sometimes not that customer oriented or responsive to queries and problems.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had a stay recently at the Hyatt in Singapore and loved it. They have renovated the pool and pool side BBQ which was a wonderful oasis from the city outside. And the best part is that the busiest part of the city and shopping is literally just outside. The location is brilliant for business and tourists alike. I also tried their new gym and spa and was truly surprised by this new part of the hotel too. Its not a cheap massage place, this is a serious spa location that ranks up with all the best in Singapore and some of the best in Asia (esp for city and hotel spas). And the gym was about the best hotel gym I have every used - and I have used plenty of them Great hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife, 3 year old son and I stayed at Grand Hyatt (Scotts Rd) for 4 nights for the second time in 3 years. This hotel offers luxury comfort, great service, friendly staff and a beautiful pool (for all ages from toddlers up) and fantastic food. Nothing is too hard for the staff and management and everything is aimed at making sure guests return time and time again. Grand Hyatt is located near the corner of Scotts and Orchard roads in the heart of the shopping area of Singapore and is a short walk away from all ameneties. With the recent opening of the ION mega mall, which is just a minute or two away through an underpass, Grand Hyatt's location is even more attractive than before.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was definitely the most value I got for my money spent on accommodation. My room was ready even though I checked in an hour or so before the given check-in time. The rooms were very spacious, neat and clean, with a separate living room to my surprise. The location couldn't be any better if you wanted to be close to the malls for shopping. This hotel is not even a minutes walk from all the big malls on Orchard Road. The concierge was extremely helpful in making us plan our days. The staff otherwise too were courteous. The food within the hotel was great. Being vegetarians, my wife and I had no problems. The perfect hotel to stay in while visiting Singapore for shopping and food.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The friendly people and great service will keep you coming back to the Grand Hyatt Singapore. Rooms are clean and you can always count on a great night’s sleep. In room check-in is an awesome service that other hotels need to adopt. The concierge was able to arrange dinner at several very exclusive restaurants on short notice, a service that is worth its weight in gold. I would recommend the booking rooms on the Executive Level whenever possible because the nightly cocktail hour and snacks are excellent. However, this is also my only complaint about the Grand Hyatt Singapore... the people working the lounge aren't very personal or responsive, so if you want special attention you should stay elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed on the Club Level and my experience was spot on: the room was clean and modern, and the food on offer in the lounge of a high standard. The gym and pool in the hotel were well-equipped and beautifully designed. The location of the hotel is perfect for getting around, i.e. close to the train station, and great if you want to shop at the major department stores/ shopping malls. My only qualifying comment is that while I felt very accommodated during my stay (i.e. gluten free bread was arranged for my breakfast as soon as the hotel was made aware of my food allergy), perhaps the service was a little perfunctory from the majority of the staff I encountered? Saying that though, in general, I loved it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very much enjoyed my stay in one of their Junior Suites. The hotel is very nicely appointed and all the usual luxury amenities are in place. The gym is quite new and well equipped. Did not try any of the F&B outlets in the hotel, as there is so much to choose from nearby. Enjoyed the band in the hotel's nightclub (BRIX), but prices down there are quite hefty (however beautiful girls are plentiful also). Particularly I was impressed by the service of staff (Grand Club Staff, Concierge, Housekeeping). One of the best Hyatts I have stayed in. My stay was using GoldPassport points, so I can't comment on value but it's probably not very cheap. Might not have stayed there if not on a business trip or (as in my case) using loyalty points.</p></li>

Unthinkable and shockingly bad, for a 5-star establishment... Modern, stylish room except the WC, which has exposed pipework :-S Nice, airy lobby but there is nowhere comfortable to sit so one has to go to the coffee bar upstairs... Room service food was bland especially the Hainanese Chicken Rice... Good selection of freshly cooked Asian and Western food at buffet breakfast saved the day! Fantastic location just off Orchard Road, with two 7-11 within a minute walk. Better than Shangri La but I might give Fullerton a go instead next time around...</p></li>

First of all the genuinely friendly staff that always greet me with a big smile. After staying there in 2 different occasion they already remember my name and bump me up into a suite! No joke, i am paying for the deluxe room for 5 days and they bump me up into a a junior suite for 5 days. Never have any problem with late checkout request, Very helpful staff! Great breakfast selections! Fantastic Gym and Spa with 2 pools. Location is also very convenient right in the heart of orchard road not too far from ION mall. This hotel is just home away from home!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This must be one of the best luxury hotels in Singapore. While price can be somewhat daunting, the hotel is worth every single penny. It is located very close to major shopping areas, some 5-10 minutes away from Orchard MRT Station. The real highlight of the hotel is the outdoor pool which seems to be open until midnight. While during the daytime, the humidity is crazy and spending time at the pool is not the best idea, spending time after 18:00 at the pool is just what a body may need after a long working day. The room is spacious, clean, and modern. The style is minimalistic, but efficient. I did not try breakfast, since there were other (cheaper) options to have meal outside the hotel. In sum, for business travellers, this is a great place for a short stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Well, it is a great hotel from 6 am until 11 pm. Great facilities, comfortable rooms, wonderful food. However, after ~Midnight they parade of hookers starts. The night club (Brix) is a well known (reported by my taxi drivers) hang out for hookers. from my driver "The club is full of Lady-boys from Viet Nam, they will put something in your drink and then rob you." So transvestite, transsexual hookers are not my idea of a good time. If you happen to come in on a late night flight and find yourself checking in at ~1:30 am you will see stumbling (drunk? drugged?) businessmen being escorted by women (questionably) to their rooms. The clerk was noticeably embarrassed. If you stay in at night, you will not see this. OH and one more thing. A 330ml beer is SG$16, a bit steep.</p></li>

Presenting spacious clean comfortable rooms and suites, provided with extra luxury, quality bed, mattress, comforter, pillows and linen with strong sun blocking curtains as standard. Making the deal here very much in the patrons favor. Beware of the standard rooms offering very poor insulation from the noise of rooms next door and the hallway, which is why I can only recommend the suites here which are free from noise pollution/ Highly Recommended suites.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I need to tell that all my expenses were paid by my company so I am not quite sure of the daily prices. Location is perfect since it is in the middle of everything. By walk you can go shopping or cover your instant needs. Rooms are very clean and every single need is covered around (like ironing table, funny but It saved my day). There is not much view because of the buildings around. Restaurants are clean and foods are delicious but expensive. There is a mid-end bar very close to the hotel( I am not sure if it is a part of the hotel but it seems so). The small waterfall inside is good to have but does not make you feel much localized. The lobby is crowded and noisy and the staff is not that much professional. That is the first thing suprised with Hyatt. Overall it is a high-end beautiful hotel to stay at.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a good hotel but there are much better options in this price range in Singapore. The location is fine if your main interest is shopping on Orchard Road but if you are on business the approach to the hotel can be time-consuming by car due to the one-way system and traffic congestion. I also noticed quite lengthy queues for taxis. My room was located in the wing at the rear of the hotel. The size was below average for this hotel class, the view was onto a series of appartment blocks and the decor was aggressively minamalist. The bathroom was good and well equipped but the temperature of the hot water at 8.00 a.m. was only just acceptable. Bathroom noise from the next room was audible. There is a good range of dining options in the hotel but prices are very high. I found the concierge service rather off-hand.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt during the Indonesian school break and my family had a thoroughly enjoyable stay. It was truly grand and the rooms that we had was a junior suite in the front building. The room was spacious and the connecting room was sufficient for the kids. What I like about the hotel is that they do not discriminate the fact that I had kids with me, like some hotels do. My only complaint , well it started as a complaint, was the Straitskitchen was full during one of the nights. I had heard so much about it and wanted to try. The manager on duty on hearing that I was checking-out the next day went through great lengths to rearrange the seatings so that my family can try the restaurant! Straitskitchen did not dissappoint, great design and concept. I love the noodle and Indian section. Truly recommendable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When we first arrived at the GHS at about 2 a.m. after our long journey from the U.S., we were surprised by the amount of activity at the hotel: lots of young and beautiful people dressed up for the nightclub attached to the property. Inside, though, is very calm and tranquil. The staff are friendly, courteous, and attentive, including the concierge desk, which offered us several good recommendations on restaurants and activities. As other reviewers have noted, the rooms are surprisingly spacious, with well-designed bathrooms. We enjoyed little perks like the free shoe shine service the hotel provides. The location of the hotel really can't be beat -- near Orchard Road and the MRT. The main floor restaurant has an excellent evening buffet showcasing food from the Malay, Chinese, and Indian cultural influences in Singapore. Great property.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt Singapore recently whilst in town to celebrate the Lunar New Year with family. The service was top notch from start to finish. We stay at quite a few Hotels and the the arrival experience was very welcoming, friendly and efficient. The room was spacious and stark and contemporary (a style I like very much). The rain shower in the bathroom was a treat. I like that more and more hotels have this put in. We dined at Straits Kitchen, Mezza9 went to the bar and would highly recommend Mezza9; the food and service in my books scored 100 out of 100. Really very very good, try the steamed fish, green veggies in oyster sauce and chicken fried rice for sure, very YUMMY! Compliments to the staff at the Grand Club, The front desk, concierge and the pool side, all were excellent! We will choose the Hotel again, for our next trip there!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel right in the centre of Singapore city (corner Scotts & Orchard Road) so you can walk to all the shops or public transport. You are also only a 5-8 min cab ride from Clarke Quay which has some great restaurants/nightspots. The hotel is set up like a typical Hyatt - catering to the mass tourist market, with a particular focus on business travellers. But it does this very well. The service is always good, rooms clean and well maintained (albeit the decor is a little generic and uninspiring). The room sizes (including Club Exec) are excellent and I have also stayed intheir smallest Suite which is ridiculously big, so whichever room you select, you will never have an issue with size. The hotel gym is absolutely fantastic. There are issues with internet connection in the room at times (I have had others in the group within which I was travelling say the same thing).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I recently stayed at the Hyatt for 2 nights with our 6 month son and we found the service and the hotel excellent. Rooms are spacious with modern yet comfortable decor. When we arrived at check-in they confirmed the pre-reserved baby cot I had ordered and within minutes of setting foot in the room we had a call from Housekeeping apologising for the cot not already having been set up and that they would send someone right up. The one minor issue we faced was when we requested a bottle steriliser for the baby bottles. Housekeeping initially didn’t think that they had such things but a few hours later it they found one and sent it up to the room. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom very large with separate bath and shower. The gym is well equipped as expected and furnished with the latest Technogym equipment. Water, juice and towels were all available in the gym.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When you arrive at Grand Hyatt Singapore it's a relief to come to a quite place in such a vibrant city. The receptionist was very efficient and I got upgraded to a club room by adding breakfast and WIFI to my pre-booked room rate. The room itself was very spacious on the top floor with separate living / bed rooms. Remarkable about this hotel was the complete invisibility of any room service personnel, but still the rooms where made up perfectly. I can also recommend spending some time at the pool, which is surrounded by a tropical garden with waterfalls etc.. Also try the various restaurants at the hotel. They all offer great food. I had a very late departure and although I could only extend my checkout until 2 p.m. the hotel issued me a key card to let me continue using their facilities (club lounge, spa, pool) until my departure late at night. Great service and good value for money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location: Could not be better - right at the intersection of Scotts Rd and Orchard Rd. (smack in the middle of the major shopping and entertainment area) Restaurants & Bar: Beautiful F&B outlets and especially Mezza9 is highly recommendable. Huge menu selection and especially great charcoal grilled meats. Mezza9 Bar is very cozy and relaxing with a great selection of international beers. Rooms & amenities: Spacious and well-appointed, nice bright bathrooms with good amenities. Internet is chargeable at 25$ which I thought was very expensive considering that many places are providing WIFI or LAN for free these a days. Service: Overall very attentive and hospitable staff. Had a small problem with my booking and was passed from one person to the next which could have been handled much smoother. A “one stop shop” would have been much appreciated here. Verdict: Very good but could be excellent!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Grand Hyatt (It used to be the Hyatt Singapore earlier) is right in the middle of the action that is Orchard Road. Its location on Scotts Road within a minute's walk to Orchard is even more divine. They have renovated most of the rooms and most of these are now modern with all the amenities you expect in them. There are also nice extras in the room including amenities that you can think of in the Bathroom. I have eaten in the Straits Kitchen which serves Breakfast and Linch and Dinner Buffets too and the food, service and choice is absolutely to die for. The Italian restaurant (I think Pete's Place) again serves great food. The only thing is that the decor hasnt changed in the 15 years that I have been coming. The location makes it great for lots of quick shopping and which also means that there's always a croowd around Scotts Road. Once you are in the Hotel, you are in a different world.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Grand Hyatt is well located in the middle of the main shopping district and within a block or two of several malls. We stayed at the Regency rooms which was high tech., well lighted and very spacious. The bathroom was large and also very well designed with an excellent shower. The breakfast on the floor and the evening snacks were very good, and most adequate if one wanted a light breakfast. The swimming pool was set up in a tropical garden setting, complete with and indoor/outdoor, very substantial menu that one could enjoy with many of the local foods. The water was warm, and very comfortable. At times the pool was a little crowded, but other than that, it was an excellent spot to relax as was the health club and spa. I would return here again, and the only draw back was that it was not part of a mall so one would have to brave the hot sun for a couple of blocks, unlike the hotels at City Hall.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for three nights during our shopping trip to Singapore. The Grand Hyatt Singapore has a great location at downtown Orchard. Service was meeting my expectation for a 5 star hotel. I didn't spend that much time at check-in counter and the staff was extremely helpful. The rooms were very spacious with a big and comfortable bed, a very good sized bathroom and nice sensible work desk. I was lucky to get a room with pool-view, one of the best hotel pools that I ever experienced. We had our lunch at Oasis pool bar and the food was excellent. The hotel is surrounded by array of shopping malls and restaurants. Since it was our shopping trip, this location is so ideal!!! We often took breaks in between our shop rounds, went back to drop stuffs & rest in our room, and then continued with next rounds,haha.... Heard that their Damai Spa is fantastic but such a regret that we could not have time to try out.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A little problem with the Air Condioning met with a RAPID response and when the result was not adequate followed up with an upgrade and a very present, concerned management staff. I've travelled a lot and cannot remember any hotel being so concerned that I was happy and satisfied! A phone call, a little box of chocolates and a sincere apology have turned me into a Hyatt devotee! From check in to check out the staff was OUTSTANDING! The less expensive, newer rooms have a cool desing with two way closets, a drawer safe that will fit your laptop and artful touches. Pool area is very nice. Stayed in room in new building wish was terrific and in the older "junior suite" building, also fabulous! The breakfast buffet is SPLENDID, varied and abundant. Location: if you are a shopper you can't do better. For cultrual interests perhaps closer to the marina or the Raffles hotel would be better. But mass transit is efficient and easy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent weeks in total for the last years at this hotel and always appreciated the professionalism of the staff and the overall quality of the service. The breakfast is the best in town (I tried most of the five stars in town) in terms of food choice and freshness at the Straits Kitchen and their Mezza9 restaurant is excellent too. The only weakness is the view from the rooms which is a bit disappointing (the Balinese garden is too often in renovation and there are building under construction all around the hotel) but globally this hotel is the best choice in Singapore for a good mix business / leisure unless you look for pure business (then chose the hotels close to Raffles Place) or pure leisure (then chose hotels on Sentosa Island). Its Club floor is quiet and ideal for business meetings. The hotel has an excellent spa centre (clean, modern and well equipped) and a quiet swimming pool area (not deep though as everywhere by Law in Singapore) in the middle of a nice garden.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed here a few times and love its location - in the city centre and shopping street. Major department stores are in the same street, including duty free shop opposite to the hotel. Easy to access - subway 3 minutes walk and taxi stop in front of the hotel. The room are big and simply 5 stars hotel standard. I personally love the big & clean bathroom - bathtab and shower seperate; one side of the bathroom wall are covered by huge mirror. There are also provide powder table with several mirrors....if you are enjoy make up and dress up, you will love this bathroom. Bed are comfortable. Suite room has a living room with another TV and working desk - such a big room. The restaurant for buffet breakfast (open for all meals) is big and have variety of food - chinese, indian,western etc. I also had a buffet dinner here; enjoy all the food and very fresh juice. The Italian restaurant is also good with a friendly staffs. I always come bak to this hotel same as all my friends. Recommened.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was staying here 10+ times over the years. Like all Grand Hyatts in Asia, it is a professional upscale business hotel. Centrally located just 2 minutes from Orchard among busy streets, it has a large area of tranquility around the pool. Try to get a room in the back building with pool or garden view if you like it more quiet. Those rooms are more modern and nicer in terms of design. However, the rooms in the front block are all suites incl. separate bed- and living room for almost the same price. They are a bit older, but bigger. With Mezzanine and The Straits Kitchen the hotel has excellent restaurants for all tastes. The Champagne brunch at Mezzanine on Sunday is a must! If you want to try more, just cross the street where you find Les Amis and other great chinese restaurants. The bars are good too (Mezzanine and the pool bar) where the Fresh Berry Mojito is a must try at the pool bar. All in all, a very good hotel right in the city centre with high quality standards in all aspects.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located in a perfect location on Orchard Rd, within close walking distance to shopping at Ion Center, Wisma Atria, and Takashimaya.There are great food courts there too. Check in was quick and friendly. I had booked a club king room which includes breakfast and evening cocktails. I highly recommend this if you plan on drinking. A beer can set you back 18.USD. FYI, Buy the drinks at the duty free. Very fairly priced. Breakfast had a very nice spread of juices, fruits, pastries, and hot items. At cocktail time, there were delicious canapes, dim sum, ceviche, and lots more.Our server named Jun really took care of us. Coffee cups were always filled and dirty plates were promptly removed. Rooms are spacious and cozy. I really like the large bathroom because of the vanity table. I can spread out all my make- up. Since it was our anniversary, the staff had deliver a very nice bottle of wine and chocolate cookies. So happy! We really enjoyed our dinner at the Straits restaurant in the hotel. Great food and service!</p></li>

So I asked to change room and I got another one a little better located but nothing special at all. Interior is minimalist in a cheap way and remind of some Novotel. Service is something comparable to soundproof, to get something or just to get a reply it takes a long time. Club lounge very small at least in my tower wing , but service there is okay. Breakfast (beware if you take it in in the lobby they charge you in full even if you as club member you are entitled of continental) offers a wide selection but also there staff need more training as they are quick only in bringing you the bill . Scott's bar okay, attentive service .Altogether this structure is old with nothing special , nothing Grand Hyatt .I have been travelling several times to Singapore but this was my worst experience.If you can avoid it ,do it.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is fantastic, from the moment you get out of your cab you are welcomed, taken personally to check-in and introduced to the staff. Even the basic rooms are of a really high standard, and the turn down service at night is a bonus (they fill your ice bucket, tidy (again), close your curtains, change towels etc). As your Do Not Disturb is electronic, once you switch it off and leave the hotel they usually clean your room straight away - i went down for breakfast and half an hour later came back to a spotless room. Breakfast was amazing, the curry was to die for, so were the freshly made pancakes and waffles. Room service was also fantastic, and minibar prices were lower than in less expensive hotels. The pool is beautiful, staff serve you iced water throughout the day. I also went to the gym which was well equipped. Oh and if you have any dry cleaning take it with you, it is priced on a par with UK but your cleaned items are back with you within the day, fantastic! Didnt try the bars or restaurants (other than room service) as the hotel is so central there are plenty of places to go at night. Later moved to Pan Pacific Marina Bay, still nice and good location but nowhere near as good as the Hyatt.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Singapore for 6 nights in January 2011. As soon as you arrive, you are impressed by the grandeur of the reception hall, flowers displays etc...The check-in was very fast . We had 2 interconnecting rooms : a grand king + a grand twin.Booked under " The family plan", you get a discount on the second room.The rooms are spacious and beautiful.We overlooked the swimming pool area. We often choose Hyatt hotels as we are a bit fussy with bed comfort and we have never been disappointed.The bathrooms are also spacious with all amenities.There is a desk area in the bedroom with a safe big enough for a laptop and a bit more. Breakfast in ' Straits Kitchen is fantastic ! You could spend your whole morning there ! The choice of foods is unbelievable and the staff friendly ,courteous and extremely professional. We had room service a few times and loved it too. The location of the hotel is perfect.You can't avoid shops in Singapore so, Scotts Rd is a good starting point !!If you'd rather catch cabs than walk, it's so easy in Singapore...Cabs are everywhere.But, there is the metro just a few hundred meters away. Our stay in this hotel was perfect on all aspects.I would go back to the Grand Hyatt tomorrow if I could !!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There is no doubt that this is a good hotel. In a good location just off Orchard Road. Paid $S380 for one night and $S400 for the next. Nice big modern comfortable room with king bed, and a great huge bathroom. LCD widescreen tv on the wall with lots and lots of channels. Nice touch was that the wardrobe had too doors one in the main living area, and one in the bathroom. Made it easy to get to stuff from both sides. Very well though out. There are plenty of well labelled connections on the desktop that allo you to connect video sources, ethernet, fax etc. Very well thought through. The internet connection was very fasy, a cheapish, but no working iPass. I needed to stay later, and they extended my stay until 2pm (from the regular check-out time of 12 noon) - no problem. And then I camped in the free desks in the business centre in the lobby, and worked from there for a few hours until my flight. Really not much to complain about - it's really quite good - just lacking a bit of edge or soul - it's another bland 4/5* hotel - and if that's what you want that's fine. I would stay there again however, as it really is a great location and is very comfortable. Brix bar in the basement is "interesting" and quite expensive - but has good bands.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This review actually I should have posted by end of last year. But however will be useful for other members. My traveling time was during a peak season last October 2010, after the Islamic Lebaran. Singapore must have been roamed by Indonesian travelers and every hotel was fully booked and busy. Thats might be the cause of such disappointment happened in the late afternoon (6.00 PM) and our room (Junior Suite) was not ready yet. I traveled with my senior aged parents for general check up in Spore, my mom at her 67 was tired and upset since the room was not ready... (we booked a month in advance). But Hyatt led us to use the club lounge but then we found out it was not the club lounge but the meeting room across the lounge (what a joke), then after called on the reception staff they provided us with other spare room for us to lay down till 9.00 PM when our reserved room was ready. Well, this was not good start of the 1st night with Hyatt, but then they compensated us with this and that to express their apology. Well it worked and accepted the offers. It was their best to welcome us staying there and I appreciate how they handled us and respected my mom's condition who stayed there to see her doctor. Very high standard of service of Hyatt The rest was just a pleasant stay and relaxing. Its very Hyatt... Love to stay there again and no worries for how they will take care of us</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having stayed in several Hyatt properties over the last few months, I was pleasantly surprised by the space and fresh new look of the hotel. If you are in Singapore as a tourist, this is well located as it is just off Orchard Road and the hop on hop off buses all stop in front of the Marriott, which is next to the Hyatt. Although I do not believe the hotel is new, the room was nicely renovated and SPACIOUS. I booked a standard king size room and it included a sunlight filled nook where the computer desk was located as well as a sitting area with a couch on the other side. I like the modern look of the room with the beech wood accents throughout. The bathroom is especially spacious and includes a double access closet, separate shower and tub, along with enclosed WC within the bathroom. The toiletries are in abundance. I do not like hotels where they skimp on giving you adequate shampoo or shower gel. I appreciated how the safe was as well as minibar were integrated into the drawers, which created a very visually appealing and clean look. The Club Lounge was also spacious and lively. The evening hors d'oeuvres were substantial.The breakfast was abundant. I appreciated the "generosity" of this hotel as water is plentiful as well as daily fruit and chocolate. Room service is bit costly; however, everything is quite costly in Singapore. With that being said, the service was efficient and the food was excellent. I would return to this property.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in an excellent location, with Orchard Rd on your door step, the convenience of it all is brilliant. I got upgraded to Club Room (which is like a mini suite), which was spacious and entitled one to partake of happy hour (mix/pour your own drinks and finger food) and rather excellent breakfast at the Club Lounge. Fab views from Club Lounge accompanied by a glass of red at the end of a long working day was heaven indeed. The same can be said about fabulous rooftop gardens on Level 3 leading to the gym. It is particularly spectacular all lit up at night, including the 3 storey waterfalls, so if you are there on a romantic getaway, don't miss out on the opportunity to wonder there at any time, but especially at night. The service at reception/check in-out is ordinary; door men are excellent and show genuine concern for the guests. The service at the Club Lounge was also attentive and excellent, which is more than can be said for the gym. The restaurants downstairs and the one on the mezzanine are very good and service excellent. The biggest complaint I have about this hotel is the gym is opened only till 10pm, with rude staff kicking one out at around 9.40pm. I find it difficult to believe that a 5 star hotel in Singapore, in this location, does not have 24/7 gym, or at least access to one with security pass. No flexibility on the issue does not help. I hope they change this and very soon so they are in line with the rest of the world and the Hyatt chain!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our experience at Grand Hyatt Singapore was truly amazing n splendid. Personally, Grand Hyatt is our most favourite hotel. We stayed there a couple of times and we witnessed the improvements in the customer service after we gave feedback to the management via the feedback form. We were impressed with the commitment that the management had on customer service. We booked our 1st two stays under the Explorer package. This was a very worth for value package as it includes buffet breakfast and dinner at the Straits Kitchen. Our Grand deluxe King room was very spacious and comfortable. The only drawback was the small TV screen at the living and bed room. We had to strain our eyes to watch the shows. The equipment and quality of the Gym at Damai Spa was impressive. The treadmills and cross trainer from technogym and had touch screen with cable TV and ipod attachments On our 3rd visit is a complimentary night at the Grand room, we noticed that the customer service at the counter staff of the Straits Kitchen improved tremendously. We were greeted warmly and we felt at home. Upon our check-in, front counter staff automatically gave us a double upgrade to Grand Deluxe King and Club access. Anted out request to check in early and check out late till 6pm, this is of course on an availability basis. My wife and I were very pleased with the flexibility that the management has empowered the staff with. The experience at the Club Lounge was overwhelming. Upon our 2nd visit to the lounge, we were greeted by our 1st names. The staffs were very proactive, helpful and friendly. Food and beverage quality at the lounge was also top notch.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I really liked this hotel. I stayed in one of the newly refurbished rooms. It was equipped with very modern accessories, like the wall mounted flat screen TV and DVD player. One corner of the room had these floor to ceiling windows angled towards the corner. The workspace area was in this corner, which made it quite inviting, and I imagine would be great to use if you were here on business and had to take work back to your hotel room. In fact, it would have made my old days of working in hotel rooms very pleasant. The bed was huge and the bedside tables had a very user friendly control panel that controlled the lights/TV etc. My favourite thing about the room was the bathroom. The bathtub was huge, and even had a waterproof pillow at the head of the tub to use if you were soaking. The walk in shower had one of those huge ceiling mounted rain shower-heads that were the size of a dinner plate. The toiletries came in a black box. There was a nice vanity table and chair in the bathroom that was separate from the sink area. This was so comfortable to use when putting your make-up on, and ideal if you have numerous cosmetics and toiletries. I was a regular guest at this hotel about 10 years ago, and it has changed so much. The hotel bar is good as well, and has a large variety of interesting cocktails. The restaurant mezza9 looked very inviting, which is why I went. The décor, atmosphere and service was good, but the food just average. It was fun for people watching though. The tables were so closely placed together that you could very easily eavesdrop on the conversation taking place at the tables next to you. The only downside is that the rooms are very expensive.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Superb business hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently had the opportunity to stay at this great hotel. Opportunity I should say as some-one else offered to pay. As a self employed business man, budget is always a concern, so when the offer came in, I could not refuse. The rate of S$ 530.00 (Euro 265.00) per night is not something I lightly overlook when making accommodation decisions. I must add, this rate gave me access to a Club room overlooking Scotts Road and access to the lounge for breakfast (excellent) free all day coffee and tea and afternoon cocktails and snacks. The location of the Grand Hyatt is equally excellent within reach of all major shopping malls and convenient for business. One evening I dined at Mezzanine, possibly one of the most interesting and unusual restaurants I have been to, with a large variety of food choices and great service. It is in essence a six star food court and an absolute must should you get to stay at this hotel, or if you choose to stay at another hotel, pop in, you will not be disappointed. The guest room I stayed in had a bed room and lounge area with a large bathroom. The lounge boosts a B&O tv set, a good work desk with power adaptors built in and broadband internet access. The latter is expensive and hotels in Asia still need to catch up with the USA on free internet. Not a big ask I would say, if you pay Euro 265.00 for the room, internet could be thrown in. The staff is very good, friendly and helpful. it is also good to see that expat management acknowledge you (Mezzanine manager and the Exec Chef). it makes you feel welcome, even if it is a nod, a smile and a "prego". I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel and should I make enough sales, I will become a regular.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My previous stay at the Grand Hyatt Singapore was very good and based on this I decided to stay again during my last business trip. Surprisingly I was disappointed. Check in was slow, to their credit they were quite busy, but when it came to my turn a woman who had not been waiting rushed up to the desk and was helped first. Not a big deal but after being made to wait I felt it could have been handled better. Once I got my room key I was really surprised by the size of the room, I now think I must have been upgraded during my last stay because there was no comparison in room size. While efficient and clean the room was very small, and the bathroom even smaller. There was only a shower, the toilet crammed between that and the tiny sink. This is compared with my last stay where the room was very spacious. Overall the rooms are kept very clean but are showing their age and need to be refreshed. The rate paid was certainly not worth the room when there are so many other options in Singapore. We ate at the Straights Kitchen the first night which is a unique take on the standard hotel buffet. I'm not a buffet person but the various areas all featuring a different Singaporean cuisine (Malay, Chinese, Indeian etc) was very well done. The hotel bar was also very pleasant and the service was great. The hotel also has a night club in the basement that seemed to be a prime pick up spot and prositute hang out, we left after seeing it. We saw quite a few guests taking women up to their rooms which was not really meshing with the image of a 5 star hotel. All in all not a terrible stay, but it could be so much better. In future I'll be looking for other options before staying here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Decent hotel but check in process is disgusting”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at Grand Hyatt a couple of weeks ago for three nights. I travel quite frequently to Singapore but this was my first time at the hotel. What really disgusted me was their really painful check in process. Somehow the check-in staff took almost 10 minutes per pax for check in, which is shoddy by any standards. Having waited for more than 20 minutes, I finally got my turn. Having completed check-in, I was left all to myself to find my lift (least expected in a 5-star hotel). What made things worse was that they have apparently added some rooms to the hotel recently, but with different access points. So I spotted a lift and landed up on 6th floor looking for room 660 while the floor plan showed room nos. only up to 645 or so. After taking a round of the complete floor and also feeling disgusted, I called up reception and they told me I had taken the wrong lift! Apparently my lift was located in some obscure corner of the hotel and there was no one to guide me there. There weren't even any directions to help a first-timer to the hotel. Finally, I came to the reception and blasted the staff for not letting me know about the lift. They started apologizing and one of the staff members at the check-in counter left his seat in a flash to guide me to my room, much to the anguish of the person who was being checked in at that point of time. Rooms though small, are decent, beds are comfortable. But view of the room I got was really bad as my room window was pointed towards a street and residential apartment. The area surrounding the hotel is definitely good, and is well suited for those looking for some quality shopping and cool nightlife in the Orchard road area. But overall, if you are looking for pure pleasure and want to get yourself pampered during your stay, there are much better options available in Singapore compared to the Grand Hyatt.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the GH Singapore for 2 nights in the beginning of August for holiday. Chose the hotel for its location and proximity to the shopping district. Stayed at the FS last summer which despite its location was a very nice property. The GH is like any typical GH and it reminded me very much of its sister location in Tokyo in Roppongi Hills. Stayed in a Grand Deluxe King and the size of the room was fine. Toiletries definitely need to be upgraded to a brand name. Room service was efficient, friendly, and tasty for my 3yr old. My biggest disappointment would be my dinner at the Straits Kitchen. After watching and hearing about the restaurant on No Reservations, I wanted to try this "hotelized" version of hawker cuisine. During my last visit to Singapore, the restaurant was fully booked and was not able to dine there. This time, I made sure to reserve my table early. The interior was nice and the food stations look very clean and modern. The main issue was with the food. Don't get me wrong, some of the items were delicious, but I was disappointed that they did not present Singapore's main food items. I was expecting either chili or pepper crab, but they offered crab in black bean sauce. That was a real disappointment. The popiah was wonderful, but the rojak salad could have been better. The barbecue section was nicely presented, but the roast chicken, duck, and other cuts were not as tasty. The indian food corner was probably the best area, but their roti prata was not light and fluffy, but almost as hard as the naan they offered. Malaysian corner was decent, but overall the variety was not as much as I expected. Fruit/ Dessert section was large but not that great. I did enjoy the Teh Tarik and Coconut Juice, but overall, I was not happy with my meal. I was full, but I felt that I was not satisified by what I ate and regretted my meal later on.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked on the Hyatt website, a grand deluxe suite for a week of relaxation in Singapore. Booking conditions included charging your credit card by 2pm. I advised the hotel of our late arrival. However, when we arrived the only suite they had left was on the 6th floor overlooking a building site and were warned of the noise. For $S510+++ per night! We were offered a club room at the same rate but declined and after 45 minutes were shown to a grand suite. The suite was slightly shabby, overlooking Orchard Rd with two bathrooms, living room, kitchenette etc and LIGHTFITTINGS HANGING FROM WIRES DANGLING FROM THE CEILING. By this stage it was 3am so we unpacked for the night with the knowledge that the next day we were to transfer to the room type booked. Later that morning we were shown to the room of the type we had chosen and packed our bags. It was just like the pictures on the website. We returned to the hotel later that night to find our room not so cool, but were really tired so I showered and turned back the sheets to find them soiled !My husband screamed from the shower as he couldn't regulate the temperature. I called the duty manager and demanded he came to our room with maintenance and housekeeping. We waited an hour for the faults to be rectified and received many appologies. However it was our second room and our second night of disrupted sleep in the hotel. We asked to see the general manager in the morning. We saw a senior manager who was also very appologetic, offered us various incentives to stay, credited our bill for one night's accomodation and provided a hotel car to transfer us to the Shangri La [the hotel we booked that morning which was subline]. I was not willing to pack AGAIN and try a third night in a third room at the Hyatt. At the price we expected better. Why wasn't our room allocated if it was guarranteed by our credit card? Why was the hotel in such disrepair?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Drove down to Singapore with my wife and our 14mths old boy on the weekend of 29 - 31 Oct. Upon arriving Grand Hyatt Singapore's main entrance, with heavy pedestrian traffic, there were sufficient Hyatt bellboys to help unload our luggages efficiently and also a concierge staff to direct us to the 20th executive Club floor lobby for our quick check-in. Car parks for hotel guests are ample if you are planning to drive to Singapore or rent one during your stay here. This Hotel really exceeded my expectations. Location can't be any better. Scotts & Orchards Roads are literally on your doorsteps. Accessibility is great. Great shopping, excellent restaurants and 24hours convenient stores are all just few minutes walk from the Lobby. There are also many good restaurants such as Mezza9 and Pete's Place (check out weekend brunch @ Pete's). We compared rates on several travel / hotel websites but found the official Hyatt Website to offer the best deal for our Club Deluxe King room. Consider the Club rooms if possible as its well worth the extras and the Grand Club Lounge is amongst the best of any hotel's executive club lounges in terms of decor, ambience, food and beverage selections. This Grand Club is ideal to unwind after a day long of shopping, business meetings or even hosting some friends. Check out the evening cocktail too. The room is spacious with a separate hall. All tastefully appointed and functional as described on its official website. The FOC crib we pre-ordered for our boy when we booked only arrived after we got in to the room. No big deal but would've been better to have prepared it before our arrival. Whilst it only mentioned availability of "high speed internet access" & "Dataport", complimentary WiFi is available throughout the Club Floors and Grand Club Lounge. The recently renovated swimming pool and its surrounding is very nice. Our boy had a great time playing on the vast shallow water area with me while his mummy relaxed in the cabanas. We will surely come back.</p></li>
