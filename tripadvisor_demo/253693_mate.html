<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">went on a cruise 12/12/10 so stayed the 11th at the hotel. NO coffee in the rooms and no pool- didn't mind not having a pool but feel coffee is a must and no room service before 8AM- we rise at 6AM so this was not good. Roof top is nice but the rooms need updating. Would not stay there again.</p></li>

Extremely large spotless room, recently updated with beautifully tiled bath. Front desk staff was fantastic, even during an onslaught of incoming/outgoing cruise passengers. The only thing lacking was a pool. Quiet, convenient location and the largely residential neighbourhood had some beautiful homes.</p></li>

A totally pleasant experience, and we are recommeding this hotel to all of our friends who will be visiting San Juan. This Hotel is quiet, the staff is pleasant and the rooms are fantastic for the price. We are looking forwarding to staying here on our next cruise from San Juan in 2010.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for 2 nights before cruise and staff was great with directions, nice little bar and restaurant on site. No pool but just 10 minutes in cab from Old San Juan and close to airport and pier. Quiet, clean and a great price per night. Great restaurant called La Casita - make right out of hotel then next right - up the street on left side at end of the block --opens at 6 each night. Authentic food and great staff.</p></li>

We weren't sure what to expect, but... WOW ... Hotel Miramar was a wonderful surprise. From check in to check out, the staff was warm and helpful. The room and hotel were spotless and the food in the restaurant and room service was great! It ended up costing us about a third of what we usually pay when we stay on the beach.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was decent. It was clean, friendly staff, offered a continental breakfast. There were several restaurants and a grocery store in the immediate area, and the bus stop is right across the street to get to Old San Juan ($.50.) If you take a cab it's $14 for a 3 minute ride. The hotel was clean, decent decor, had a restaurant, rooftop area, business center and a fitness center. I think the cost could be a little lower for what it offers, but I would recommend it to people who are trying to stick to a budget.</p></li>

When I'm there, I feel like I'm at a mini Ritz Carlton!! The service is great, the staff is friendly, the rooms are a nice size and more importantly very clean, the decoration is lovely, and the newly renovated bathrooms are gorgeous!! Even though there is not a pool, there is a fantastic roof top terrace, where you can sunbathe and relax with a beautiful view of the city and the sea!!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My twelve year old daughter and I stayed at the Miramar for one evening before our cruise. We had a very large room, and the beds were great. We thought the location was great -- close to old San Juan, and still easy to get to the cruise terminal. The customer service was good -- the folks at the desk were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was an adequate continental, nothing special, but it was free. On the whole we thought it was a great hotel for the money, and I have booked it again before our cruise in two weeks.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel the night before a cruise departure and give it my highest recommendation. Huge comfortable room, reasonable rates, and lovely staff. Juan Sanchez at the front desk could not have been nicer or more helpful. I misplaced the only sweater I had brought along somewhere in the hotel and had mentioned this to Mr. Sanchez when I checked out, heading for the cruise pier; he found my sweater and actually had it sent to me in my stateroom on board ship before it sailed! Thank you for this thoughtful effort, Mr. Sanchez!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was the worse hotel I have stayed in. Starting with bed bugs, old and deteriorated bathrooms, the hallways and room had a weird smell. My friends and I wish we had Lysol. One of my friends even sprayed one of my perfumes. Top of all were the rude staff and manager or owner (Juan). Instead of admitting that his staff made a mistake; he treated all of us like criminals by making threats to call the police. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. Everyone in Puerto Rico was very friendly except for the people in this horrible hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a week's stay at the Miramar. Our room was wonderful with a micro and refrig that we used alot. I requested a quiet room and it was perfect. It is indeed easy to get to Old San Juan from here via bus. Sylvia and her staff were most friendly and helpful and PERSONAL. It was not the feeling of a big resort. A car is needed for most other sites(rainforest, ferry, etc.) and Sylvia helped us get one when their availability was tight. The neighboorhood seemed safe and the proximity to a grocery store was helpful. I can't say enough about the staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located about 5 minutes from Old SanJuan by bus, this hotel is located in the center of some of the highest rated restaurants in San Juan. The bus cost is just $.50/person each way, or $1.00/day /person. A great deal for convenience and ease of travel! We covered the Old San Juan area from El Moro to Ben and Jerry's from the free trolley which picked us up at the bus station, a nice way to orient oneself to the area before setting out on foot! . This was a perfect getaway for a long weekend. The inhouse restaurant is the best value and quality in the area, it is called 606.</p></li>

We had a blast the hotel staff is excellent, clean room and towels everyday. The hotel is near a supermarket on the right and right on the corner you can find taxi, and if you want to go by bus it's only 0,75$. Naxt to Pueblo Supermarket you can find, subway, a chinese restaurant, a restaurant about taco's and there's a pharmacy across the street and a beauty saloon. So we found the hotel very good. In the lobby there's free internet for 30 minutes. And a cute yellow bird. And I forgot to take a picture of the bathroom next time :-)</p></li>

It is an older building, but well maintained and with a pleasant ambiance and a nice ocean view from the terrace. The rates represented great value, and the Miramar location permitted very easy bus routing either to Old San Juan, or to Isla Verde (the best San Juan beaches). The staff were very friendly and accommodating; very willing to make schedule changes and provide useful information about how to see and dine in San Juan. We found it to be an excellent combination of comfort, convenience and economy and would certainly recommend it for those reasons.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in Hotel Miramar March 14, 2010. It was a quality stay, all things considered. Located just on the mainland, it is a short 10 minute cab ride from the center of Old San Juan. The room was clean, quiet, and large enough for our party of four to hang out in during the day. The price was very competitive compared to other hotels nearby. The staff was helpful and accommodated our request for an early check-in. The man behind the counter even walked down the block to find a taxi for us upon check-out. Friendly staff, clean and roomy accommodations, competitive price..you really can't beat it. Recommended!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The first 2 days were pleasant. However, on the 3rd day my rental car was vandalized at the hotel's valet parking, which consists of 4 spaces. Once the 4 spaces are filled the use the street parking as valet parking. If this type of experience isn't disturbing enough, to say the least, the hotel staff's lack of concern, empathy and courtesy was very disheartening. They had the key to the car but didnot move the car to another location. The windows were broken but the did not want to move the car and rather it stay on the street where it was vulnerable to further vandalism. The hotel is in a very dangerous neighborhood!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 2 nights before boarding a cruise ship. The room was large, clean and quite. It had a fridge, but did not have coffee/tea making facilities. All the staff, in particular Sylvia, were extremly friendly and more than happy to assist with any enquire. There is no need for a car if staying in the city, as public transport is regular and cheap. There is a bus stop across the road from the hotel and a supermarket one block away. A great location for sightseeing as it is a short trip by bus to the Old Town. Once in the Old Town, there is a free bus service that takes you around the town and to the Fort. It's a hop-on-hop-off service.</p></li>

I just wanted a place so I could get to know San Juan not a resort. This hotel has some charm, clean, and the sevice very good. No pool, and the beach is a 15 min walk. But the rooms are large with a refig and microwave and a flat screen TV. They have a free continental breakfast and internet in all rooms. The staff was great told you where the bus stop ( right across the street) was and tips on where to go. There is a grocery store 1 block away and some places to eat . They have a roof top sun deck which is grat at night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at Hotel Miramar because it was the least expensive one that was closest to the Puerto Rico Convention Center. The room was equipped with a queen size bed, night stands, desk, chair, microwave, refirg., combination safe, big closet, lg screen TV in a dresser, and free WiFi. The bathroom was small but spotless. This is not the most modern hotel but the staff was incredibly helpful and friendly and every one of them greeted all the guest with a smile and a "Hello". A continental breakfast of juice, toast, rolls, coffee, and pastry was included. Again, not the most modern but was incredibly clean. This is a great deal for a nice room compared to other in the area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found this hotel on Trip Advisor, read the previous reviews, and then booked it. It was an excellent choice. It is about a 10-minute bus or taxi ride to old San Juan and is in a nice business and residential mix neighborhood. The staff was very friendly and there is a restaurant attached to the hotel, and several others in the neighborhood. There also is a movie complex just up the block with first run films. Our room was large and very comfortable. Our only concern was a certain mustiness upon entering the room. We suspected the air conditioner filter needed to be changed. A couple of other guests that we talked to also noticed the odor. Overall, a very good value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Let me clarify, Miramar isn't a bad hotel. Not by any means. But it cost $150/night after taxes (Friday night) - and we waited far too late to book so most hotels near San Juan were full. The hotel was clean, the location is not bad (parking is tough, but doable). You have to drive to Old San Juan and Condado... but there are a few restaurants within walking distance if you are just there for the night. The management was helpful enough and the room was okay (elevators really small and beds not that comfy.... but okay). Overall I'd say if you have no other choice you'd be fine here - but I'd opt for another hotel were I to go back. PS - the "breakfast" is a joke. It was bread and fruit and coffee.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you're looking for a hotel that is reasonably priced, has very good service, and the rooms are comfortable and clean, this is a very good choice. There is a small bar and restaurant on site and the food and drinks are excellent. There is a great new restaurant around the corner called "La Casita." We were only in San Juan 3 nights before our cruise but wound up eating there twice. It was recommended by the hotel desk clerk. The 8th floor rooftop has tables for outdoor cocktails (bring your own up to the roof) with a very pleasant view toward Condado and the ocean. You do have to walk up stairs from the 7th floor to get to it, however. It's a 75 cent ten minute bus ride to Old San Juan from the hotel.</p></li>

Sometimes you never know what to expect when booking online... but from the very moment we step in the door of the hotel... we felt like we were home away from home. We were greeted by Manuel Medalla the hotel representative and he was extremely welcoming and helpful. He took the time to assist we all of our questions & even took the time to give a quick run down of the city and best beaches. The rooms are spacious, clean, comfortable and affordable. I would definately stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Hotel Miramar for 3 nights. The staff is courteous and very helpful, they gave us good recommendations on local joints to eat, tours to take and where to find convenient and cheap parking in Old San Juan. The rooms could use a little updating but they are clean and adequate. We had a king size bed, microwave, fridge, hair dryer(much needed :) ) and iron. The neighborhood seemed safe with pharmacy, grocery and restaurants within a block and 10 mins drive to Old San Juan. The hotel is on a one way street for cars so we had to go around few blocks to get to it, got a little tricky the first couple of times but it shouldn't be a problem if you don't have a car. They offer free parking which was a plus.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved staying at Hotel Miramar! Stayed for a little over a week in the end of March beginning of April 2011. This is the perfect hotel for a short or long stay. Hotel staff was always friendly, and caring. Stayed with a group of 3 women ranging from 22-68. We always felt safe in the area. There is a bus stop almost in front of the hotel, a grocery store right up the block, and some great little places to catch a quick lunch or a nice dinner. Our room was in the front of the building so we had a beautiful view of the ocean. The roof top deck was the perfect place to spend time in the evening/night, and the rooms are HUGE compared to most hotels I have stayed in. I can't wait to get back and explore more of Puerto Rico!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here while she was competing in the 70.3 Ironman San Juan. This is a European style hotel, right down to the bistro off the lobby (which by the way serves excellent food). The staff was more than helpful when it came to storing the wife's bike, providing information and ... just being friendly. Our room was clean and comfortable (it was next to the ice machine, but after a day it was not an issue). If you are looking for a Marriott type hotel, don't go here, but if you want a neighborhood locale and a boutique style experience where the staff recognizes you when you come "home", this is it. Grocery store down the block, a Condado Lagoon beach just down the block (no pool) and local restaurants nearby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is very quaint, not too big, with a great view of the harbour from the attractive roof patio. Rooms are clean and very comfortable. Hotel is in the process of remodeling all bathrooms. Very close to the port, if you are cruising, with local bus (50 cents) right outside front door to old San Juan. The staff (Sylvia) are extremely friendly and all are most accommodating. Surrounding area, although looks a bit rough, has good restaurants and grocery shopping..."area is safe". Small restaurant and bar on property...breakfast, all we ate, excellent. Not a lot of frills but offers great value with very comfortable accommodation. No hesitation to recommend this hotel...we will be staying there the next time we go back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just recently i traveled to San Juan on a business trip, but was a little disappointed because I could not get a reservation at the hotel i normally stay in. However, I have to recognize that size and fame aren't always best. From the moment I arrived at the Miramar Hotel with the warmest personal touch, a smile that one could feel was genuine and sincere. Rooms though not very large are adequate but very clean and service was more than i expected. But have to give a special thanks to the front desk personnel for all the help they provided me during my 4 days there! Though smaller than most in size, TheMiramar Hotel is certainly larger than most in servitud and equal in quality. I'll never again judge a hotel by its' size!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Miramar in March 2008 before we left on a cruise. I viewed some of the Trip Advisor photos and there must be a difference between the "Hotel Miramar" and "The Courtyard Miramar" because the photos of the Courtyard looked much nicer than where we stayed. Overall, our stay was pleasant. This hotel is in a dangerous part of town so do not venture out alone at night. This is an old hotel, but kept up well. My main and only complaint would be that there was a lot of hair in the shower (and I mean a lot- 10 or more pieces) and there was hair in the bathroom sink. The blanket on the bed was also very old and worn looking-- I would not touch it. This is a 3 star hotel... so once again you get what you pay for.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is just a wonderful place to stay. You can get to any destination easily either on the bus or by taxi. We did not rent a car so we traveled by bus the whole time we were there for .50 cents a ride. We arrived at the Hotel early but were still able to check in and were also given all the information we needed to direct us to all the great places we could want to visit. The staff was fantastic and so friendly and gracious. The room was great and very comfortable and clean. Continental breakfast was very good and more than I needed in the morning. During my stay there I had a personal crisis and the staff there attended to me with the most wonderful kindness and caring. I will come back again and again and suggest you try it too!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had written this when we were there but isn't showing up. We stayed at the Hotel Miramar for two days before a cruise and one after. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. The hotel is small, old fashioned but in all the right ways. Spotlessly clean with incredible staff. Noelia, Silvia, Jill all did their very best to help us. Sent us to great local spots, including the Castilla Miramar, an incredible restaurant. The hotel is in a very convenient neighborhood, with a pharmacy, grocery, organic deli and movie theater within a block. And it is on a major bus line, so for fifty cents we could go wherever we wanted. The staff gave us great directions, recommendations and service. I have seldom seen a staff as helpful and friendly in my years of travel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has Old San Juan charm and tons of customer service! The rooms are spacious but the beds are a little hard. Only one elevator so be ready to use the stairs after you get your luggage to your room. The roof top view is wonderful and we had a very relaxing time with our group of 10 just sitting and having beverages which were easily purchased at the grocery store 1/2 block away. The front desk was more than helpful with getting taxis and giving area information for the bus to Old San Juan just a mile away. Then it was just a 5 minute ride to the Royal Caribbean port which cost us about $5 a person for 5 of us with all our luggage. The breakfast is nothing to brag about and takes some time to get waited on but didn't bother us as we had plenty of time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Miramar for 5 nights, I have travelled well and to many hotels world wide. This is a family run hotel similar to the small hotels you find in Europe. The room had a microwave and small fridge, ironing board and iron. The room and bathroom were very clean, good ambiance, excellent staff, more than a continental breakfast with hot oatmeal, pastrys, local bread, cereals, fruits. Good for cruise travelers or bussiness travelers, close but not walking distance to Condado, Old San Juan or metropolitan area. Helpful bilingual staff will get you a taxi to these areas. There is nothing near to walk at night, it is a quiet hotel. Would happily stay again and reccommend to friends. I saw many europeans staying there and many pre cruisers and they all had good comments.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The front desk, Juan and his assistant were so warm and wonderful to everyone. They really made us feel welcome and were helpful in every way. The building is quaint and just right for a smaller hotel. There is a grocery store a block away and a few little cafes with very good food. The hotel offers a nice breakfast with the room in a nice dining area. There is a nice quite computer room with a lovely lounge arera. Also, there is a sun deck and laundry machines available. The room had a microwave and refrigerator. Very clean room and hotel. You can ride the local bus into Old San Juan for just .75. There is a small beach across from the hotel. We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to our friends. Thank you, Juan, for taking your time with all of your guests. :~)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My name is Erick M, and I'm a new pilot to the Caribbean, and will be traveling to many different locations on a regular basis. My hotel experience in San Juan was with Juan and his staff at Hotel Miramar. I had a wonderful evening, as the rooms, the lobby downstairs, and the friendliness of the staff is better than any hotel I have experienced. Their breakfast of fruit, breads, and cereals in the morning is great, and the dinner menu/bar prices aren't bad at all if you are looking to dine in at the hotel for an evening. I'm sure that I will, as a pilot, have to return to San Juan on a number of occasions, and if I do, I will always have the request from my clients to stay at Hotel Miramar. Cheers to Juan and his great group of staff members for such a lovely hotel. See you again soon!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My friends and I went here for our spring break last week and we had an amazing time. We were on a budget, so we didn't expect much from this place- and were pleasantly surprised. We spent a lot of time on their roof deck (eating various meals- or in between activities). The staff is all very helpful and kind- and gave us really great recommendations for places to eat, or go out at night. It isn't a luxurious resort but it is clean, well kept, and really close to everything we wanted to do. It only costs $16 plus $1 per bag to get a taxi to the airport. The only problem we had was that the hot water ran out fairly quickly- but since it was hot anyways none of us found this to be a really big issue. I would really recommend this place- I think that you get a ton of value for what you pay.</p></li>

Bus stop near hotel took us into Old San Juan and staff was very helpful in giving us ideas for daytrips and good local restaurants (some within walking distance) The hotel was very fresh, clean & updated with some spanish antiques and flair. We thought the rooms were very spacious and our toddler was very comfortable. We thought this hotel had the best rates in town!!! Cute restaurant downstairs served us a quick breakfast in the morning and had a pleasant aura. We were a little dissapointment with the extremely laid back almost absent waiter during breakfast but we figured he was probably tired from working a night shift up the street.

Located down the street in walking distance from restaurants and supermarket. We ate at Lima restaurant, very good though slow service. Stayed one night before cruise and it was quite acceptable. 16. dollar taxi ride from the airport.Can catch a bus across the street -.50 cents per person-and ride to bus terminal to old town San Juan. Then take free shuttle that goes around all of old town--get off and on at many points. We had ocean view from our room #401 and close to cruise terminal. I think it was a 6 dollar taxi to cruise ship. Xmas through Jan 14th there is the Festival of San Sebastian--streets close in the afternoon and shuttles stop running. not far to walk though back to bus terminal.</p></li>

Even though it does not have a pool, it has a big terrace at the top of the hotel with a great view of the surroundings and laggon. Here they have functions and parties. We were lucky to enjoy a function while we were ther Great location as well. Is in the middle of San Juan with in minutes of the "old san juan". The satff was very frindlly and since is a small hotel, they were able to deliver fast and accurate service. The sapce was very, very clean. Also, great restaurants within the block as well as in the Hotel. The owner, Juan, is friendlly and wants you to have a great experiance in Puerto Rico and offers great recommendations of sites to see, food and night life. We had a great time. Will recommend to everyone.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from Puerto Rico and the Hotel Miramar! I had a fabulous time! The hotel was nice and clean, the room was a nice size and the microwave and fridge were great. The beds were hard but I like it that way. There was a hair dryer in the bathroom and an iron and ironing board. The complementary breakfast was enough but if you wanted more the omelets was very good for about $6. The sun deck had just the right amount of breeze! The staff was the best. They took care of our every need from allowing us to check in early, late check out, helping us with tours and directions, suggestions from where to eat and what to do. They welcomed us “home” when ever we saw them. It felt like we were friends and they cared about us! If I find myself in Puerto Rico again I hope Sylvia, Samuel and the rest of the Hotel Miramar staff will be there to greet me when I get there!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I had to travel for one week to PR to take care of some family issues and pick up some things we'd left since we moved to the states. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with big smile by Sylvia who was great. We were very happy with our room as well and the fact that because the hotel is small, there's more personal attention. All the staff was great and friendly especially Miguel who went out of his way to even drop off a package for us at the post office. The sun deck had a great view and would've been great for tanning, if we'd had the time. It was quiet but yet very accessible to all of the centric areas for night life. The only thing we would've wanted was more variety for the continental breakfast but the breakfast we did pay for was great. My husband and I both agree we will be there again for our next getaway and even plan on taking the kids.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went to Puerto to catch a Carnival Cruise.This was a pretty decent hotel considering some of the others we had seen. The room I had requested was 2 queen beds but we only got one king, and with 3 children two had to sleep on the floor. The room was really clean but was outdated. The hotel staff were really nice and helpful and the continental breakfast was pretty good. The only problem was the location,there were hardly any resturants around and it was far from the airport and the cruise port. We had to take a bus to go downtown and a Taxi to go to the cruise port and they were scary. We had a crazy guy trying to tell us to get on the wrong bus, I think he was going to lead us to a bad part of town and jump us, luckily I asked the bus driver to tell us the right way. Everyone drive crazy there!! I can't say I would every go back to Puerto Rico, it wasn't a pleasant experience!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not only is this Hotel in a sketchy neighborhood but their attitude is terrible. After I booked an ocean view ( overtop of some rundown buildings ) room that the manger said had a pullout couch I was told that my young daughter couldn't sleep on it. I was forced late at night to rent a 2nd room ! Just to make things ridiculous the clerk told me he just spoke to the MGR and the MGR wanted to make sure that we wouldn't have 5 people in the room !!! This after we just paid for a 2nd room !!! can you imagine leaving the 2nd room empty after just paying a stupid last minute rate for it. Had he been up front I could have booked 2 cheaper rooms instead of the room with the pullout couch ( chair) When leaving it took us half an hour to get the 1 slow elevator they have and then after waiting with 20 other people in their small lobby to check out we ended up just leaving. Book anywhere else in SAN JUAN</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My mother and I took a mother-daughter vacation and stayed at the Miramar for a week. It was a wonderful place to stay! The hotel was beautiful and the staff, especially Ramon, Sylvia, and Jorge (and others that I can't remember their names) were very accommodating and helpful! They gave us directions, recommendations on places to eat, and wanted to hear of our adventures daily! I loved the area that it was in as I wanted to see more of authentic Puerto Rico than the Americanized version that I felt I would've gotten at the Hilton, etc. There's a pharmacy across the street with some very reasonable souvenirs. Los Pinos Cafe, also across the street, had some wonderful Mofongo. The hotel had a very nice continental breakfast and since parking is so hard to find in San Juan the private parking was a lifesaver! The sundeck has a beautiful view! Overall, I wouldn't have wanted to stay anywhere else!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There was a group of nine of us who spent 4 nights here over the 4th of July weekend. The hotel was great. Rooms were big and clean. The rooms in the front of the hotel have great views, the smaller rooms in the back have windows that look out to the building next door. All rooms are bright and get great sunlight. Rooms have fridge and microwave and internet access. No noise from traffic or other rooms. Theres a nice outdoor terrace on the roof. Was a nice place for our large group to just hang out together, without having to be in someones room. Parking was not a problem at all. There are a few spaces right out front, and more along the sides and back. Easy to get to major roads, easy to get to Old San Juan from the hotel. Breakfast is included. It's not much, muffins, danishes, and bread, enough to hold you over until lunch. Everyone at the desk was very nice and helpful. Would definatly stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got a good deal with Expedia airplane and hotel. I checked the reviews and it seemed OK. We couldn't complain the hotel room was spotless clean. Yes, it is old, i didn't smell any mold though but I noticed the carpet and the comforter were worn out. I liked the fact that we had a microwave and a mini fridge that we stock w drinks. Our cleaning lady was super nice, she always left our room clean, bring us fresh towels and ask us if we needed help. Same with reception. I could have pass on the breakfast though, the food not that good. It is continental breakfast, cereal and fruit and after a couple of days I was tired of it. To go to the beach or to Ashford St you have to walk like 10 min, not bad, a lot of people ( even locals) are walking out at night and we saw cops too. However you have to pass under a dark bridge though. Next time, I would choose a hotel in Isla Verde, the beach is WAY nicer than Condado.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here two nights and really enjoyed it. The rooms were somewhat outdated (nothing special), but did have a refrigerator, microwave, and free Wi-Fi. We had a great view of the Condado Bay and skyline from our room and an even better one from the beautiful rooftop terrace. This hotel is walking distance from Condado and a 75 cent bus ride to Old San Juan. We enjoyed being just outside the tourist area, because we could walk to a grocery store and a couple of nice cafes serving Puerto Rican food at reasonable prices. The hotel's free breakfast is just a basket of bread and small pastries, but you can apply your voucher for $2.50 off any other breakfast they serve, making it the cheapest breakfast (and quite good) in the area. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially Sylvia who allowed us to store a suitcase there for a few days while we went to Vieques. This place had a very local, friendly feel. I would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Knew the hotel was old so there was no surprise. However, when we arrived the elevator was being renovated, which meant a walk up to our room on third floor, sun deck and gym on 7. Rooms are large and clean with small fridge and micro. The staff was extremely helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations. A free continental breakfast buffet was served every morning in the restaurant (currently only open for breakfast). Hilton hotel is a 10 minute walk, casino 15 minutes, 45 minute walk to Old San Juan. You can catch a bus in either direction in front of hotel for 75 cents. This is not a luxury hotel, no room service, pool or beach. However, if looking to save some money it's the place to stay. Keep in mind, your view could be a vacant building or car lot. We had a good time. Take a bus to Marriott if you want to sit by the pool. P.S. We got an extreme bargain on this hotel. If we had paid full price we may have been more critical.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">visited Sept. 23 before a cruise booked to return for a couple of days after cruise. After staying one night, I cancelled before the ship left Puerto Rico. Our AC was not working well, desk person came up and AC got cooler. Small ants were in the bathroom and crawling on nightstand. I was bitten by one. No hot water from basin, just a very loud noise(Rm 301). The comforter fell off on the floor during the night exposing a nice size dirt smear on the sheet. Sheets and pillowcases were dingy. The bathroom was very nice. We visited several floors and sweated badly because the hallways were so hot. Received a call about 9AM from front desk telling us to close an open window because it was raining. No windows in our room were opened. A couple of nice stores down the street and a small restaurant but I would not return here. Nice view of the city on roof top. Free breakfast but very small bistro had about 3-4 tables to accomendate guest. I didn't even go down.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having read reviews on Trip Advisor about this hotel we booked and were not disappointed. Hotel staff were great, even giving tips on nearby grocery store. The breakfast is very continental but sufficient for getting the day started and then if you wish more you can always order from the menu. The hotel is old and therefore has been renovated so does not have the shiny look of the Hilton however the ambience is great for the area. A taxi to the cruise port is only about $20.00 and also to the airport. There is a small area for parking behind the hotel but it is free. We went to the grocery store and purchased a chicken and some pita bread and were able to pack a lunch for the 7 hr flight back to the states which made the flight a lot more enjoyable, not having to purchase less than fresh $7.00 sandwiches and stale snacks. If you want internet, you need to ask the front desk to hook you up. There is a fitness/pool on the 5th floor which we did not use but is available.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked our stay late and had trouble finding other hotel options in San Juan. Pleasantly surprised. Not a beach resort by any means but alright for in the middle of the city. We were able to take the bus into old Jan Suan city to walk and see the sights. The hotel desk lady was very nice and accommodating even though we arrivbed late at night. The rooms were fairly spacious and clean. The hotel is next to an abondonded building but we felt safe even walking at night. There is also a 24 dinner across the street which is nice if you arrive late or depart early. We have friends who have an infant and were checking in at the same time. They had not menitoned the baby earlier but the front desk lady quickly left her desk and set up the crib and bedding (happily). Dont' stay at this hotel for a week. But passing through San Juan for a night or two nights to explore the city you will find it workable and convienent. Do not stay here if you are expecting a resort or beach front hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived the hotel late on january 19th. An elderly man meet us, checked us in, and pointed out the elevator for us. We stayed on the 4.th floor, to the left out of the elevator, and in the last room on the left side of the hallway. A large room with two large beds, a small fridge, tv, a comfortable chair, and a bathroom. We have nothing to complain about regarding the room, and we slept well in the beds. The aircondition were a little bit noisy, but did not ruin our nights sleep. We went down a couple of floors and found the ice machine. I am glad we did not have a room there. It made a lot of noise. Also fount a soda machine there. Did not have breakfast there, but walked to Wahlgreens a couple of blocks away to get some soda and water for our upcomming cruise. Checked out just before 12, and a nice man at the desk rang for a taxi to pick us up. Overall not the best hotel we have stayed on, but most certainly not the worst. We could easily stay here another time, just for one night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First off, you will be landing in a shady looking neighborhood. There is no obvious way to reach the hotel unless you drive against traffic or use the bus lane. I booked a king bed room through hotels.com. When I arrived, two hours after check-in time, it was not ready. I sat around in the lobby for a bit. When I got it, I was surprised to find I got a two full beds room. I called front desk about it, to no avail. Since I had booked online, I had no claim. The girl at the front desk asked me to bring a copy of my reservation so she could read it to me. Surely enough, this was an additional humilliation I did not want, so I sucked it up and asked for nothing else. If you are staying here, know there is no parking for your car, no hot water in your faucet, no coffemaker; and although there is a microwave and a small fridge you will not find mugs, plates or even a spoon, so bring your own. There are a lot of nice places to eat within walking distance. Be careful if walking around late, there is quite a few unoccupied buildings around the block.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Cab cost $26 to Hotel Miramar for all 6 of us. There was a nice restaurant just around the corner but it was already closed since it was past 10pm. We later found out that another couple said they had a wonderful time at that restaurant the night before. We went down the street, within visual distance of our hotel to another restaurant for locals. Diagonally across the street is a bar. Hotel Miramar is close to the Pan American pier if you are leaving on a cruise. If you are active and don't mind hauling your luggage, you could possibly even walk to the pier from there. The interchanges are a bit confusing around the hotel though. I think I would stay at a beach resort next time to enjoy the water/beach. However, the staff at Miramar was excellent and friendly and they even let us check out as late as 3pm. We hung out on the rooftop prior to checking out, it was a partly cloudy day and not too hot. We found the contenental breakfast to be quite adequate. They had milk, cereal and many pastries. All in all, a great place to stay for the money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I used this hotel for two nights after a holiday cruise. I just don't know where these terrible ratings are coming from. Hotel staff couldn't be friendler or more helpful, fast internet, and respectible rooms. No this is not a new place, but if you have ever traveled Europe and stayed in smaller, family operated hotels, this is very nice. Has all of the amenities one could want. Yes, the building is dated and not in a "hip" area but bus transportation right outside the front entrance and was only a 5 minute ride from the cruise ship pier. The roof top deck has great views too, laundry available and vending machines that don't charge 3x the going rate. That being said this isn't a perfect hotel. The rooms have seen too many coats of paint, water pressure is low but all of the fixtures are clean, the carpet new, A/C VERY quite. Avoid rooms ending in 01 or 02 as they face a busy street. Beds also a bit tired but still comfortable and the lines were cleaner than on my cruise ship. Sizzler, Subway, Papa Johns, and Wendy's all within walking distance</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked a double room for one night before our cruise. After checking in we inspected the mattresses for bed bugs. We didn't find any bed bugs but instead found a dead cockroach under one of the beds. We called the front desk and were offered to change rooms. When we expressed a concern that there may bugs in that room as well the managers got very agressive and we were told to leave the hotel immediately. He took a real offence that we inspected the beds for bed bugs. We asked if we could at least use the internet at the hotel to find ourselves another hotel, as it was late and dark outside and we didin't know the area. The manager refused. We were also told that we would be charged for the room if we left. We were worried that we may not find another hotel since this is a busy time of the year for cruise passenger so we elected to stay in a different room. Needless to say we didn't sleep much that night. We have never been treated so poorly in any hotel before and we travel a lot. The hotel is not in a great area and we didn't feel safe walking around at night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed in this hotel countless times in the past for business reasons, and it has never occured to me that I should properly write a review about my experience. I guess because most of my previous visits only spent a night or so at the hotel. Anyway, this time around, I did stay for 3 nights, so... The staffs are very friendly and accommodating. Since I do not personally speak Spanish, they are willing to teach me a few words for me to get by. Great location, about 10 to 15 minutes away from Old San Juan. The bus stop is just a block away. A few restaurants and a supermarket (if you need grocery for an extended stay) are just up the block. The room is clean and roomy with microwave and refrigerator. I especially love the rooftop terrace. It offers a great view of the city and plenty of fresh air. The only concern seems to be the water in the shower. A few times, the water did not come out hot enough, well...it was not exactly cold, but I guess given the warm weather in PR, it shouldn't be much a problem. A great value for the overall experience and will stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here one night before going on a cruise. We arrived at 3:00PM; which was listed as check in time. Another couple arrived at the same time. The manager went up to check the rooms for readiness. In the mean time the clerk issued us keys for a room. Upon arrival, the room was not ready, but the manager waived us down the hall to another room and told us that he would bring new key cards up in a few minutes. Before he got back, the other couple used their keys to let themselves into our room. They went back down to find out what was going on, we never saw them again. The room was clean, moderately sized and well equipped. The staff friendly and attempted to be helpful, but a broken printer at checkout and lack of communication with the cleaning staff made things more difficult than necessary. It was a $15+ (cash) each way taxi ride to everywhere we wanted to go to in the city. There was no good way to walk to any attractions or the beach. The taxi rides got to be more expensive and used more cash than we had anticipated. The Bistro 66 attached to the hotel served a very good breakfast and had excellent service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family of four, one 16 year old, 12 year old and husband and I stayed at the Miriamar from May 8 through the 12. When we arrived we were tired and hot from the trip. We registered in and were told we had a room on the third floor. But guess what we had to walk up to our room and carry our luggage. Now if any one knows a women and a pre teen girl can bring a lot of luggage. So up we all went with all this stuff. Went into our room and to our supprise it was a room with a king. I did tell them we needed a room with double beds. Found the maid in the hall way and tried to explain to her we needed a bigger room, she spoke no english and my spanish is not the best. make a long story short we did get a room with two beds. We did notice the room did have a musty smell and the AC did not work well. The house cleaning was not at all good. The tub backed up and the maid never cleaned the bath room good. The tub had a ring around it and the beds were not made. The view from the top floor was great, you saw the water and the kids loved it. The breakfast was ok. The front desk staff were helpful and nice. Would we stay again, no. I would go somewere else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I spent 3 nights at this hotel prior to our cruise. We thoroughly enjoyed the stay. All the front desk personnel and dining room staff we had contact with were friendly, gave very helpful travel and sightseeing directions and recommended good eating places. They also drove me across town to help find a credit card I had left at a restaurant. Our room was very clean, pleasantly large, quiet and had a small microwave and fridge. The hotel is centrally located within 10 minutes walk of a beach, grocery store, pharmacy, and fast food places; 5 minute bus ride to Old San Juan and several galleries/museums; and with almost instant taxi service. The free continental breakfast was all you can eat and had more variety than often available. We ate once at the Bistro. The food was excellent and reasonably priced although a little slow in delivery. The hotel is a small independent business and to us that was part of its attraction. If you want big chain and luxury and 2 steps to the beach don't stay at the Miramar. If you want outstanding value for your dollar, helpful and friendly staff, and a convenient location then we recommend the hotel without reservation.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at Hotel Miramar for one night before a cruise. My extended family had about 7 rooms booked. The hotel is in a nice area with a grocery store less than a block away where you can get any items you may need. The room was nice size with a nice flat screen TV but the bathroom is where the updating needs to be done. The bathrooms were small and also quite a few of the rooms shower did not drain resulting in your standing in a pool of water at the end of the shower. After my wife showered it took over 30 minutes for the shower to drain and I ended up using my parents room to shower since their drain didn't clog. The elevator is very slow and very old. The maximum people you can put on the elevator is 4 and it takes forever to serve the entire hotel and is overwhelmed. The breakfast was a joke, evidentally they had a large group show up the day before a day early (60 people). Well that day they ran out of food and warned us, instead of I guess buying more food the following day to not repeat the same problem the next day it happened again. I went down at 8:10 (breakfast opens at 8am) and there was 1 muffin left on the muffin tray. Overall great staff just an old hotel in need of some changes that would make it a nice hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On the outside the hotel looks small. We got a double room which was spacious with a beautifully tiled bathroom. A refrigerator was a good accomodation because we were able to go to the Pueblo grocery store a few blocks down to get some fruits, juice and yogurt to reduce our dine-out bill. It was a little pricey but convenient. Our online room rate was honored, but they did not give us our discount. We believe it would be better to obtain any discounts directly with the hotels. We ended up spending about as much for our hotel as we would have booking at one of the nicer hotels in Condado a much nicer district. The hotel was conveniently located a few miles from the Old San Juan tourist district. The only other drawback was the smelly carpets which we sprayed with air freshener. My husband liked the nice decor inside. This was an average hotel with nice decor. We were pleased with the size of the room. Although parking was limited with our small car we were able to squeeze in the small lot in back of the hotel which accomodates 4 or 5 cars. Our online discount rate with taxes and fees was $288 for 3 nights we paid $327 instead. The rate was $86 per night but the tax and tariff was 21% and there was a $5 room surcharge per night.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were stay two days at Miramar before cruising with RCCL. We arrived in the evening and we were from the beginning well taken care of. The room was quite big, clean and the standard was ok. The location was very good, about 15-20 min from the airport and about 10 min to the port. The are a very nice supermarket very close to the hotel that you shop whatever you want.The bus stopped right outside and there were taxis waiting to. What I think is great is that all the fares with taxis are already set so there is no confusion what it costs. We paid US 15 from the airport and 1USD a bag, and I think 1-2USD because we travelled in the evening. At the pier it cost about 12 USD. The breakfast is the thing that I think could have been better. Im not really used to this breakfast which was included like pastries, toast, jams etc and if you wanted something else you have to pay for it. We were hungry within 1 hour, so we have to buy something outside. I really recommend to visit Plaza Las Americas, the largest shopping mall in the Caribbean with 3 floors. A lot of stores, restaurants etc. Just a trip with taxi 12 USD. Don´t miss that! To summarize; Nice stay for this price, very good location and the breakfast could have been little better</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Considering the prices of five star hotels, we decided to try this hotel for a couple of nights before going to the El San Juan Hotel & Casino. It was clean, the rooms were large, and the staff was helpful. The artwork on the walls in the rooms was actually nice, and the room included a fridge & microwave. Continental breakfast was included which came with fruit, cold cuts, cheese, cereal, coffee, rolls, etc. For two breakfasts, it was nice. They had pretty plants in the tiny lobby and a few birds and a computer in a room behind the lobby. The restaurant next door is where the breakfast was served. We also had dinner there our first night (it included a free drink) - it was pretty good. For a lower-end priced hotel, this one was fine. The only negative was that the area wasn't close to much. We took the bus to Old San Juan, which was good, and we walked down the block through a few souvenir shops. Other than that, you're in the middle of no where. If you need to hang out in your room, it doesn't have the right feel to want to stay and relax. It just didn't feel that safe. (They locked their front door at night and had someone let you in). For a short stay, it's acceptable. The hotel itself had some charm. If you want to be in the heart of everything, though, this location leaves something to be desired.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After our cruise we opted for a 1-day lay-over to see Old Town San Juan. From Hotel Miramar, 10 minutes by city bus (50 cents per/person 1-way), will get you to Old Town SJ. --Hotel Miramar is an old hotel. My main objection was with the bathroom; it did not have an exhaust fan. Thus, mold / mildew was built up on the ceiling over the shower. The proprietor tried to paint over it, but you can't get rid of mold with paint. We tried opening the bathroom window to vent the shower steam, but the outside air was just as humid as the inside. Also, the bed sheets were scratchy, cigarette burns in the bedspread, and the pillows were hard as a sack of potatoes. With that said -- if you stay here just know that you are not staying at a plush hotel...it's just a place to spend the night. The hotel was mostly clean, conveniently located with several restaurants within walking distance, and it was quiet; no street noise. The manager was very helpful, friendly, and accommodating. We dropped our bags off at 9am, returned at 2pm and our bags were waiting for us in the room. I had difficulty rating this hotel -- if you just need a convenient place to sleep...you'll like it. If you are accustomed to luxury...you may want to keep looking. ---- p.s., I have photos, but they are no different than the ones already posted.

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Hotel Miramar for one night during the weekend. We ended up arriving in San Juan much earlier in the day than anticipated and absolutely exhausted, so we decided to stop by the hotel and see if there was any chance of checking in early. It was about 8 in the morning, and I'm sure that Sylvia, the wonderful woman at the front desk, was very surprised to see us showing up that early to find out about checking in. Although the normal check-in time is much later, she was a great help and was able to get one of the rooms cleaned for us right away when the housekeeping staff came in. We were checked into a room and able to crash within an hour, and words can't express how grateful we were to her. In addition to the very caring and helpful staff, the hotel itself is quite nice. The rooms are large, clean, and nicely furnished. While the complimentary breakfast is not extensive, you can request for cereal, toast, etc. in addition to the fruit and pastries that they have available. There is also a small workout room on the top floor with the basic necessary equipment. The hotel is very conveniently located for heading into Old San Juan, the bus stop is directly across the street. Depending on the bus route, it's about 50 or 75 cents a person. We were sad we couldn't stay another night, and will definitely be back the next time we are in San Juan.</p></li>

<li>We ended up arriving in San Juan much earlier in the day than anticipated and absolutely exhausted, so we decided to stop by the hotel and see if there was any chance of checking in early.</br>

<li>It was about 8 in the morning, and I'm sure that Sylvia, the wonderful woman at the front desk, was very surprised to see us showing up that early to find out about checking in.</br>

<li>Although the normal check-in time is much later, she was a great help and was able to get one of the rooms cleaned for us right away when the housekeeping staff came in.</br>

<li>In addition to the very caring and helpful staff, the hotel itself is quite nice.</br>

<li>We were sad we couldn't stay another night, and will definitely be back the next time we are in San Juan.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Things we liked about this hotel and its location include: - Perfect weather (72 to 82 every day during our 5 day January vacation) - Reasonable rates -Comfortable, clean, quiet room with a refrigerator and microwave - Free parking although mostly the hotel staff parked the car in the street - 10 minute, 50 cent bus ride to Old San Juan a few feet from the hotel - A nearby grocery store and several good restaurants including the one in the hotel - A rooftop patio where you can relax and view the ocean (plus smoke if you like) Any complaints have more to do with the neigborhood or San Juan in general than the hotel: Many of the nearby properties appear abandoned or neglected and several nearby restaurants that are listed on the internet simply do not exist. In addition the hotel is near a nexus of several high speed roads an overpasses which hinder walking in several directions. For example there is a Sizzler steakhouse overlooking a nearby yacht club within a few hundred yards of the hotel but it took me three days to figure out how to walk there without risking suicide by crossing the highways. Finally, virtually every private home in the area is surrounded by a razor or barbed wire topped wall or fence so crime must be a big problem. (PR has a hundred murders a month out of a population of 4 million. and private security guards and police are everwhere.)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Unfortunately my experience with Hotel Miramar has been very bad. Here are the main reasons: * their wireless internet is a joke. The signal came from a crappy wireless modem attached to the hallway wall just outside one of the guestrooms. I know that because it went down on my second day there and the hotel management didn't do anything about for the next two and a half days (needless to say, I really needed the connection). * the AC in my room was really noisy (I checked and the same type of AC's were in other rooms as well). It was actually so noisy that it would wake me up during nighttime. And you do need your AC turned on in PR. * even noisier was the ice making machine that I had on my floor. I might have been unlucky to be on the floor with the ice making machine, but that means that all other ten rooms on the floor were affected. And boy, that was one noisy ice making machine! * one of the reasons I chose this hotel was that the breakfasts were apparently included in the room price. Not true. They actually give you these coupons which give you $2.5 discount off the regular prices, which are really inflated e.g. they charged $7 for basic scrambled eggs which is A LOT by PR standards * talking about the kitchen / "restaurant", the guy taking orders was quite rude and low class, behaved like he wanted to punch anybody around him at any time... but hey - you get what you pay for...</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three days in Oct 2010 for vacation. Our stay was otherwise satisfactory, except for one episode which reflects very badly on the hotel’s attitude towards customer service. We were told that it had *free breakfast* every morning so in the next two days we took our breakfast at the hotel. The service was strange because they put drinks by window so you can help yourself, but food had to be served by the attendants there. They provided each customer two pieces of bread and two pieces of pastry, with a few pieces of watermelon. However, on the last day morning, when we were in a hurry to catch a ferry to the island Culebra, we asked the attendant to give us *one* share of bread and pastry so we could bring them with us and hit the road. But, this time, the attendant told us that the breakfast was actually a buffet, which meant we couldn’t take out any food. She consulted with a manager at the front desk and got the same answer. In the last two days when we had our breakfast, nobody told us it was a buffet so we could have as much as we wanted, now when we need only *one* share of food to go, suddenly they told us it was a buffet. The manager who talked to us had very poor attitude. Instead of empathizing with our situation, he asked us if we knew what a buffet was! Finally he relented and allowed the attendant to give us the food, but not before wasting much valuable time, which caused us to get stuck in traffic in San Juan and almost miss the ferry.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were looking for a hotel for a day in San Juan prior to a cruise. Most were sold out that had reasonable locations to the cruise terminal. We also like to check out small boutique hotels when visiting locations. After some searching we found Hotel Miramar. We made a reservation for a room called "run of the house" for $99. This means you get what is available when you arrive. We were lucky enough to get a room with a king size bed, close to elevator, and the room was clean. Upon our arrival which was a short $25 cab ride from the airport we met "Sylvia" who was extremely busy and pretty much overloaded, but she took care of us immediately even though we arrived before check in time. Sylvia as well as the rest of the staff we met were very pleasant and helpful. The great parts of the hotel are its convenient location with a drug store, super market, and cafe within steps of the hotel. Want to go to Old San Juan ? Jump on the bus just outside the hotel. Cost 50 cents VS $20 cab ride. Clean and safe. There is a laundry in the hotel which we used so we had all clean clothes when we got to the ship. The roof top is pretty cool with a view of San Juan. Down side of the hotel is that it is dated, there was a slight odor in the room but I think it was just something they clean with. Again, bathrooms and room were clean and no sign of bugs ! big thing with my wife. Lastly there is a small cafe next to the hotel. We had lunch there and it was excellent !! awesome soup, great local beer, nice wine !</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “One night at Miramar”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a good experience at Hotel Miramar. We stayed for only one night before we departed for our cruise. Check in was no problem, and the women working the front desk was very friendly and helpful giving us tips on nearby dining, and getting us down to Old San Juan. She recommended a VERY nice resturaunt that is a 2 minute walk, it had a castle theme/name (sorry can't remeber exactly) but it is the only one nearby. We had a wonderful dinner there, I highly recommend it$15-$22 per plate, but well worth it. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel that goes to Old San Juan ( a 5 min ride) for only 75 cents. There is some local shopping, and a grocery store as mentioned in other reviews right down the road in walking distance. The rooms were nice, clean, beds were fine. Bathrooms were nice with the tile work, my only complaint was that our shower drained slowly so my feet were in an inch of water when I was done. There is a roof top area that has a beautiful view of the city and water with lounge chairs and a table. It was very nice. On check out day we went to Old San Juan and we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel. I was concerned because of a review I read on here, but we had no issues at all with this, and I appreciate being able to do this so I could go see Old SJ...which you should do too, it's beautiful! Especially the forts which is only $3 per person to walk through. Amazing. Anyway, overall I felt like I certainly got my moneys worth, and I think Miramar is a lovely place with nice rooms and very helpful staff. If I ever make my way to Puerto Rico again, I would certainly stay there.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Horrible Experience at the Hotel Miramar”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Hotel Miramar with my family prior to our Caribbean cruise. Thankfully, we were there for only 1 night. It is by far the worst experience at a hotel that I have ever encountered. We requested one room for a family of 4 and were given “the biggest room”. Granted, the room is relatively spacious, but none of us felt comfortable at all to really get good sleep. For starters, we found hairs on the bed sheets, as well as stains on the bed covers. Because I tend to get cold at night, I reluctantly still pulled the covers over me. As I started to fluff the comforter I started to smell this…odor. When I took a sniff I realize the odor came from the stained, dirty, and now stinky comforter. Needless to say, I just opened my suitcase and grabbed a sweater and slept in it instead to keep warm. The toilet itself is so dirty and filled with grim that I wish there were toilet seat covers provided. The bathroom itself just gave us a really unclean sense of feeling and I felt showering in it might get me dirtier. In fact, all of us opt to forgo the shower, so we can leave this “hotel” as soon as possible and get on our cruise ship! Despite paying extra for the 2 additional people, breakfast was only provided for 2. I did not go for breakfast, but those that did, said it was mediocre at best and we all still went out somewhere else to grab a bit. The area around the hotel doesn’t necessary feel unsafe, but I surely will not stroll around there at night with my family. Over, this was a HUGE disappointment of a hotel. I would never ever stay at this hotel again, and will not recommend this hotel to anyone.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I booked for a night after our cruise. We paid $13 from the Pan American Pier to the hotel. We arrived at 10:30 in the morning. They said that the rooms would not be available until 3 p.m. They allowed us to leave our luggages there while we explored old San Juan. There was a local bus stop located across the street on the left of the hotel. All you have to pay was $0.50/person. It took us to the main station in Old San Juan. We came back at 4:15 thinking that the room should be ready. However, they said that it wouldn't be ready in another half hour. There was not much to do around the hotel so we walked to the supermarket on the right of the hotel. We came back at 5 but the room was still not ready. The receptionist said that we have to pay an extra $3 per person and $5 per night stay. I said that I already paid all the taxes and others charges when I booked for ONE night stay. She then pointed to a sign on the top of the counter and said that the travel agency might not know about these additional charges. I looked at it and it said that the charges commenced on October 1, 2006. And now it is 2008!She insisted that we pay before we she gave us the key. I paid and I asked for a receipt and she printed one for me. The room was big but the fridge didn't work, The chair almost fell apart. The lamp was barely attached to the light fixture. There was mildew smell in the room too unless you blast up the A.C.. When we checked out the next morning, an old man asked us to pay AGAIN because he couldn't find it on the computer nor it was checked off that we paid. It was too much of a hassel to stay in this hotel. Anyway, the taxi fee to the airport was $15.</p></li>
