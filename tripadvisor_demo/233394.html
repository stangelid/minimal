The entire team was extremely welcoming and passionate about their beautiful hotel and city. The personal attention made it truly seem like we were visiting good friends. I look froward to a future visit and there is not a chance we would consider staying anywhere else! Thank you for the hospitality Matteo,Oliver, Armondo and Rosalba!!! Ciao for now!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect place to stay. Venice was beautiful at this time of year and we were especially lucky with the weather - brilliant sunshine every day! Matteo & his team were the usual excellent hosts and after our 4 night stay I felt we had completely unwound and relaxed. We stayed in one of the suites with an amazing view of the canal and it was definitely worth paying that little bit more. The only bad point - we had to leave!</p></li>

The staff make you feel like you are the only one staying in their hotel. Every place they recommended for lunch and dinner were excellent and they even called the restuarant before we went. The breakfast each morning had everything one could desire. Each evening we had drinks on the terrance, which is right on the main canal!</p></li>

Perfect location, stunning views, beautiful rooms, amazing service, best breakfasts that we had on our holiday. We were only able to get their most basic room with a courtyad view and the room was still lovely. The view from the hotel balcony was worth the trip to Venice. Thank you Al Ponte Antico Hotel - our stay in Venice was perfect - you really do deserve top placement on Trip Advisor.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just like every review before this has described, the terrace and the view of the Rialto bridge (only a stone's throw away) is fantastic. We had the room adjacent to the terrace and most evenings we were the only couple out there which was very romantic. Matteo's passion about his hotel and Venice itself is very obvious and charming. I probably wouldn't stay here again purely because of the cost, but it was a very memorable boutique hotel which enhanced our Venice experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for 3 nights based off the reviews on Tripadvisor and I can say they are all true. Its an amazingly nice hotel with unbelievable service. Honestly if you visit Venice and don't stay here you are barking mad. Only downside is that if you don't water taxi direct to it, it is a little bit hard to find as it is hidden at the end of a small alley (we walked past it twice before finding it) though because it is near the Rialto it is very easy to find again from almost anywhere in Venice because the Rialto is so well signed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Al Ponte Antico is a converted 14-century palazzo in the Cannaregio district that is run by a couple of brothers who insist upon personalized service for all the guests. The hotel and its rooms are absolutely gorgeous. Breakfast was the best we had in Italy (especially the made-to-order crepes) and the breakfast terrace overlooking the Grand Canal is stunning. Cannaregio is not nearly as touristy as San Marco but offers plenty of shops and restaurants. It's a short 10-minute walk to the heart of Piazza San Marco. Love the Al Ponte Antico!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was a great find on TripAdvisor. We arrived on foot and the directions given to us were excellent. Oliver and Matteo welcomed us to the hotel and we had a beautiful room overlooking the Grand Canal. Oliver helped us with our sightseeing and gave us great suggestions for restaurants. We enjoyed having a drink with a snack in the afternoon on the terrace watching the busy canal. Our room was very large with high ceilings. The breakfasts were great with a crepe or eggs cooked to order. Look forward to returning sometime in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a fantastic stay in this butique luxury hotel. Even though we had no reservation with them the owner himself picked us up from the Rialto Bridge and gave us a good rate. The hotel staff was very welcoming. They all called us with our names and I think that shows caring and respect. The service was beyond excellence that sometimes we felt "Is this for real". After staying in this hotel you expect more from other hotels too which sometimes can be a problem:))) I can not thank enough for the hospitality they have shown to us.

The warm welcome with champagne for our celebration,the helpful advice, the lovely little talks and the beautiful clean rooms and superb breakfast. The most beautiful is the balcony that everybody can use. We had a room with view on the Canal Grande but you don't need it, you can sit the whole day on the balcony and watch the traffic. Tip: spend money on a watertaxi to get to the hotel, it's worth it! Matteo thank you again and we hope to come back. Hubert and Dorien</p></li>

Matteo the hotel owner and all his staff were so welcoming and friendly, always available to give us directions and telling us where to eat. Our room was beautiful with a view to die for, and the terrace with the view of the Rialto Bridge, just watching the world go by whilst having breakfast was an experience not to be missed. After a day of sightseeing and walking it was perfect just to come back to the hotel and sit on the terrace. Would highly recommend this hotel as it has everything on a wish list.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here for two nights recently as part of our 25th anniversary trip. The only reason I didn't give a perfect score is that I don't believe one goes to Venice for it's value and our room had no view. Our room was categorized as a "classic room". Having said that, I agree with all the good things that have been said about this hotel. It's a cozy boutique hotel. The owner and his team treat you as if you are special guests in their home. We have never been treated so well in a hotel. We had an absolutely wonderful and relaxing time and would definitely return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is expensive, but other than that there's nothing to complain about and plenty to love. It's in a lovingly-remodeled old palace right on the Grand Canal, with beautiful furnishings, an ideal location very near the Rialto Bridge, and wonderful views from the canal-side rooms and from the hotel's canal-side terrace. It's very small and family-run, and the owner was clearly very proud of it when he showed us around after check-in. The breakfast buffet was wonderful - many many dishes, including some hot dishes made to order. The staff was always extremely helpful and welcoming.</p></li>

The primary reason for the perfection, has to do with the people that run this magical place . The people that work at any business are really what make or break it (a hotel, a restaurant a shop) this is no exception. The fact that it is beautiful, the food and drinks are delicious, the location is ...........PERFECT and the beds are comfortable only add to the reasons why I will always return.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This small boutique hotel is right on the Grand Canal near the Rialto bridge, perfect location for exploring all of Venice. Everyone seems to know you as soon as you walk in the door! The staff is friendly and helpful and make you feel right at home. And Matteo, the owner, is full of helpful information on seeing Venice and is a great person to chat with. The breakfast, complete with eggs cooked by Matteo fresh from his grandmothers farm, is delicious and made even more enjoyable when sitting on the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal. I'm sure I will be back in Venice sometime, and will not stay anywhere else but here!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wow, we had the pleasure of staying at Al Ponte Antico hotel for 3 nights and we weren't disappointed. Its a beautiful small hotel, in a great location but what did it for us was the exceptional service we received from the owner Matteo and his staff. Situated on the grand canal, beside the Rialto bridge the location is superb, you are within walking distance of everything Venice has to offer. Matteo and his staff were the friendliest we'd ever encountered. They recommended great restaurants too helping us to avoid some of the more touristy places. Our room was very comfortable and the breakfast was really delicious. We can't wait to visit again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having booked this hotel based on the reviews on Trip Advisor I was confident the hotel would be what we were looking for. The many great reviews still do not do this hotel justice. The hotel is beautiful and charming, location is fantastic and the service is absolutely impeccable. Having stayed in many hotels in Europe I have never experienced service and hospitality as that at the Al Ponte Antico. I could not recommend this hotel enough, with only nine rooms you are looked upon as individuals, not room numbers. The staff are so friendly, I guarantee you will not get a hotel experience like this anywhere. Don't stay anywhere else, this hotel is simply The Best.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Unbelievable service and location! They were marvelous in all areas of their establishment! We were greeted by the owner and given a short tour with details of the restoration of the property. It was absolutely beautiful! Our very large suite had a king and a also a queen sleeper in a separated sitting area. Our three windows opened directly onto the canal at the Rialto Bridge - gondolas came gliding by regularly as did the vaporettis. The windows were new and bocked all sounds when closed! The location was premier fr walking everywhere, which is the way to see Venice. Breakfast was wonderful - omelets, meats, etc. - and was included! We can't wait to stay again!</p></li>

It has made our stay wonderful and we are planning the trip and saving the money to come back next year!! If you ever go to Venice don't hesitate to stay in the place as it's based on Grand Canal and you are in the heart of wonderful city of the mystery and charm! You can enjoy the Grand Canal in solitude from this place and if you are not the one for the tourist crowds try it out! Unforgettable holiday indeed! Memories will be cherished forever!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I agree with all that has been said here. The experience of this hotel compares to none. It starts when they greet you by name when you step in the door of the hotel. Sitting on the balcony in the morning, overlooking the canal, with breakfast, watching all the deliveries by boat as the city awakes or at the end of the day with a Spritz, watching the activity of the canal, this was the place! The only complaint, we were in Room 4 and the ceiling into the bathroom was very low, my husband who is 6'3'', hit his head walking in the doorway to the bathroom and was unable to stand erect in the shower due to the low ceiling. Small annoyance compared to everything else wonderful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed in this hotel to round out the last few days of our vacation. The service was impeccable, and the location was great. The rooms were decorated in true Venetian style and thankfully had "air conditioning". The bed was a little hard, but we slept well after walking and sightseeing all day. This boutique hotel only has 9 rooms and we got one of the rooms with a view of the canal. We could see the Rialto Bridge from our window. It was also great to step out of our room and have breakfast available. This hotel has a neat sitting area along the canal and you can just enjoy watching the boat traffic. I definitely recommend this hotel for anyone who wants a great hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Al Ponte Antico the second week of January with our college age daughter. Originally, we had booked at their sister hotel Locando Orseolo, but were given the choice to "upgrade" to the Al Ponte Antico, which we gladly accepted. We were given a junior suite overlooking the Grand Canal. Our room was beautifully decorated, and our daughter enjoyed the view from the windows in our room. Matteo and his entire staff were very gracious and made us feel very welcomed. As others have posted, breakfast was delightful, from the fresh eggs to the crepes. I would not hesitate recommending this charming hotel to anyone. Thank you to everyone at the Al Ponte Antico for a truly delightful stay!</p></li>

It is by far the best hotel we have ever stayed at and people who haven't even been there should not really be permitted to leave reviews (how can you actually comment on accommodation, sleep quality, location etc!!) I can sympathise with people being upset over events of the last few weeks, but that is nothing to do with the hotel, they are still a business and that is why you have travel insurance! We are booked to return at the beginning of September and we can not wait - our advice is believe the hype and rebook if you can.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My bride and I started off the Italian leg of our honeymoon at Matteo's hotel. Perfect location yards away from the Rialto Bridge. It's also probably the only hotel with a veranda on the Grand Canal. Sitting there watching the traffic go by with a glass of white wine was perfect. The room was fantastic: Matteo's attention to detail and design were evident in the textiles, chandeliers, glassware, etc. The staff was A+ as well. Matteo had excellent recommendations for dining as well as helpful advice on best times to visit Venice's busy tourist sites. Although our USD took a beating, this hotel was worth every penny. Our highest recommendation for this hotel. Thanks Matteo for an incredible start to our honeymoon! J and J Burke</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 4 nights in Feb. The location, beside the Rialto bridge is superb - everything within easy walking distance. Our room (No. 102) was lovely - high-ceilinged and spacious with chandelier, comfortable couch and armchairs and two beautiful, tall windows that opened onto an unobstructed view of the Grand Canal. The bathroom was small but perfectly adequate. The hotel has free wireless internet access in all the rooms and the service is, as other reviewers have said, truly special . Matteo and his staff were unfailingly convivial, generous, courteous and thoughtful and made us feel as if nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was delicious - unlimited coffee, a buffet of all kinds of everything, eggs or crepes cooked to order if front of you. Overall, a great place.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Favorite hotel in Italy”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was by far our favorite hotel in Italy. It is a gorgeous hotel right on the Grand Canal and a stone's throw from the Rialto Bridge. I cannot imagine staying anywhere else in Venice. For what you pay (very reasonable), I can't imagine getting a better hotel. Owner/operator Matteo was so gracious and friendly and sincerely interested in us having a good time. I swear I think he would cry if we weren't happy. The room was huge, ornate, and beautiful. The view out of our window was of the Rialto Bridge. The location was ideal. One of the best things about it is the breakfast. After 6 days of Italian breakfasts, we were so happy to be offered eggs and sausage. You can take the guy out of America... This was definitely our favorite hotel in Italy and we can't wait to go back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a fabulous place...our group of two couples from the US planned to stay here strictly on the basis of TA advice. Spot on! Fabulous vacation. Immaculate property. Friendly, personalized service...I cannot think of ANY downsides...except that Matteo won't find room for us when the crowds finally realize that this gem exists within his beautiful city. If your budget allows, spring for the rooms on the Grand Canal...perfectly soundproofed while all of Venice floats past your window! The breakfasts on the terrace became a meeting point for all the guests...there are only a handful of rooms, so we got to know everyone quite well. It was a PERFECT experience! (For a treat, go out to the terrace late at night before turning in...I would sneak out in my pjs after my husband fell asleep. It was magical.)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just spent a most enjoyable 3 nights at the Al Ponte Antico. It is in the most perfect location right next to Rialto bridge. Breakfast or Cocktails on the terrace overlooking the Canal and Rialto must be one of the best viewing positions in Venice. Expect to be photographed by the many boats passing the terrace. The staff at the hotel, led by Matteo are as good as I have experienced. They cannot do enough for you and are always available and helpfull. Advice on trips and restaurants proved very successfull. Some of the rooms can be a bit dark and the beds are a bit hard - but I guess that is what you get in Venice. The rooms facing the canal are awesome although they are 100 euros more expensive than a standard room. We chose the hotel because of previous reviews and we had a fantastic weekend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This has to be one of the best in town. Excellet views from the balcony available to all guests. Ask for a Bellini or a house red wine and sit on the balcony and watch the world go by. Owner is a wine buff, so anything he recommends will be good. The location is great for shopping and make sure you get some recommendations from the satff for eating out. A real treat to stay here, and rumor has it he is opening a new place in Tuscanny later in the year. If the level of service and attention to detail is replicated in Tuscano, it will be a great place to visit as well. Were certainly looking forward to his latest offering and would certainly stay at Al Ponte Antico if we are lucky enough to return to Venice. The City is great and thsi really tops off a great experience. If you want to impress your partner, definitely stay here.</p></li>

Every word is absolutely true. You have to experience it for yourself to understand how wonderful and unique a stay at the Al Ponte Antico really is. All there is really left to say, is a heartfelt thank you - To Matteo and Oliver and Tomas and Rosalba and all of the wonderful staff there - for making our stay in Venice exceptional. ( I think my eleven-year old daughter still has a crush on Matteo : )) I can't recall ever feeling sad to leave a hotel before, but this time it was, with Matteo and his staff waving goodbye as our water taxi sped away down the Grand Canal. We will definitely be back and look forward to trying the new Peruch Family hotel in Tuscany when it is completed. Bellissima!</p></li>

It was wonderful - the reception we received was so welcoming and helpful and the hotel is just gorgeous, what a treat! We had a spritz before heading out for our last night in Venice and returned to our delightful room, we had chance to enjoy the terrace the next morning and a fabulous breakfast cooked by Matteo himself and then had to head off to the airport - would have loved to have had a longer stay at this hotel and we plan to return for our ten year anniversary all being well. All in all we would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel as something special.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the moment we entered Al Ponte Antico we knew this was a really special boutique hotel. The team were welcoming and knew our names and could not do enough to ensure we enjoyed their Hotel and their City. Our room overlooking the canal was magnificent and close to the terrace offerring a stunning view over the Rialto Bridge. Matteo and Bruno and all the team were perfect hosts and so pleased to help us when we asked about directions, vaporetti etc etc. In a city where tourist restaurants abound they also offered us wise suggestions on restaurants which meant we ate like Venetians not out of towners. This really is a brilliant hotel and I have to say is probably the best I've stayed in; including some big hitters in various cities. So perfect was the view from the terrace I abandoned plans to propose in the Piazza and did it here instead. A special memory of a perfect hotel.</p></li>

This hotel and the staff made me fall in love with Venice like I didn't think was possible! The staff were honestly nicer than any staff of any hotel I have ever been to. To say they make you feel truly welcome is an understatement. The view from the terrace (where we spent many hours) was mesmerizing.And the Spritzes served are wonderful (perfectly strong and tasty). Breakfasts were beautiful (lovely omelets). My parents had a room right next to the terrace and we had one next to the landing dock (one deluxe and one superior room) Both rooms were quiet and dark thanks to very good windows and shutters. Arrive by private water taxi right to the hotel for a lovely start to your stay.My mother said this was her favorite hotel in the world...followed by the Villa Ducale in Sicily. It was unforgettable.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You can be assured of a very warm welcome at this lovely hotel and the best service from Matteo and his staff. The hotel is very centrally located and only a stones throw from the Rialto bridge. You can watch the world go by on the Grand Canal from the hotel terrace. From the hotel you can easily walk around the city and enjoy the sights of Venice. The service is fantastic and Matteo is on hand with lots of local knowledge if you need any advice. He will tell you about the best place to pick up a gondolas or recommend or book a restaurant for you if you wish. The hotel is exceptionally clean and smart and the home cooked breakfasts are very special. You can arrive at this hotel in style as the water taxi lands at the hotels own landing station. It is a great experience to pick up a water taxi at the airport and travel up the grand canal to the hotel. I think we paid 80 euros for that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a wonderful experience at the Al Ponte Antico, our first trip to Venice. It was a special trip so we studied numerous hotels and chose this for location and great reviews. Still you never can tell until you arrive but this was everything and more we had hoped for. We felt very lucky to be stopping in a beautiful suite with french windows opening on to the Grand Canal , watching Venetian life pass by. The staff were unbelievable led by Matteo and his personal touch, nothing was too much trouble. He spent lots of time making all feel welcome and he is rightfully proud of the breakfasts he cooks each day , particularly his family's eggs. There are undoubtedly larger and more famous hotels to stay in but we would definitely have this as our first choice again. I do fear now that vacancies will be hard to come by but it is only fair people get to know about this special place.</p></li>

<li>We felt very lucky to be stopping in a <span style="background-color:#ffe119">beautiful</span> <span style="background-color:#ffe119">suite</span> with french windows opening on to the Grand Canal , watching Venetian life pass by.</br></br></li>
<li>The staff were unbelievable led by Matteo and his personal touch, nothing was too much trouble.</br></br></li>
<li>He spent lots of time making all feel welcome and he is rightfully proud of the breakfasts he cooks each day , particularly his family's eggs.</br></br></li>
<li>There are undoubtedly larger and more famous hotels to stay in but we would definitely have this as our first choice again.</br></br></li>
<li>I do fear now that vacancies will be hard to come by but it is only fair people get to know about this special place.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We visited Venice for our 25th Wedding Anniversary - it was the most wonderful return after 25th years! Matteo and his team of staff were so helpful and hospitable hosts. Situated right on the canal we had the most spectacular view of the rialto. We sat with a glass of champagne waving at all the gondoliers passing by - it truly was as good as that! The canival was on during our stay and although at times very busy it was wonderful to see all the fabulous costumes. The breakfast room - one of the old palace rooms - elegantly furnished but all gave intimacy and the staff waited on us each morning with a great smile and full of chatter for the day! They were always able to suggest places to visit and give us great advice on where to eat each evening. We were never disappointed. The perfect place to stay with the perfect hosts - a real family run boutique hotel - 5* standard! We hope to be back ... thank you Matteo!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for four days in this Hotel. We were delighted! This is a small hotel that made our stay in Venice a dream come true. The location is excellent: close to the Ponte Rialto. From there is easy to walk all around the city. The place is beautifully decorated. The service was fantastic! Mateo, the owner and his crew were making sure that every detail was taken care off. Mateo cooked breakfast one morning, and we could tell that he enjoyed making the guests feel at home. Every one from the hotel greeted us (all the family) by our names and gave us great recommendations for visiting places, restaurants, etc. You won't find this kind of service in any "standard" hotel even if it is much more expensive. The hotel has a patio that overlooks the Grand Canal were we had breakfast and some snacks when we came back. Visiting Venice staying at Al Ponte Antico made our trip so much enjoyable that next time in Venice this will be my first choice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I were staying in a non-tourist town outside of Venice for a week (I was there for work), and we were not having a good time. The people in the town and the hotel in which we were staying were not very friendly, and we felt very uncomfortable and uneasy. Once my work was done, we stayed at the Al Ponte Antico for 3 days, and it completely changed everything. Everyone is so helpful, and Matteo and Oliver gave us great advice as to where to eat and when to go to the sights we wanted to see. We will never forget sitting on the terrace in the afternoon, having a drink, and talking with Matteo about life in Venice. When we were looking for a hotel before we took our trip, I thought that this place was a little expensive. However, every review I read talked about how great it is, and after staying there I couldn't agree more. We will definitely return to Venice, and we could not imagine staying at any other hotel.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sadly we only stayed one night at this wonderful hotel. Believe me it is the most fantastic place to stay in Venice and that is due to the warm welcome & amazing staff at the hotel. The wonderful Matteo is extremely proud of his hotel and the staff fall over themselves to make you feel at home offering all kinds of useful advice and greeting you by name. I would say this is probably the best hotel I have ever stayed at in terms of personal service and the sincerity of the staff, Matteo serves the best coffee I have ever tasted from his unusually bizarre and unique coffee machine.The hotel is ideally situated right near the Rialto Bridge on the Grand Canal with fantastic views of it from the terrace. It is easy to see why it has been voted as one of the best hotels in Europe for service. Many other hotels could do well to watch real professionals in action and this is how it should be done. I would love to return here one day and hopefully for a much longer stay,</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's hard to think of anything to add since all the other glowing reviews say it all. I can only say that yes, they are all true and yes, it really is that good! The location is fantastic and that terrace on the grand canal a real gem. People going by on the vaporetti were looking at us and pointing as it really is unique to have a terrace on the canal and right by the rialto bridge as well. It is the most fantasic spot in Venice to have breakfast, a coffee, an aperitif or nightcap. The bulding is renovated beautifully in traditional Venetian style with gorgeous fabrics, glass and frescoes. The staff are great. - more like staying with friends than hotel staff. It was fantastic to arrive by private water taxi as it drops you off right in the hotel - expensive but worth it for the experience (the alternative being to walk from the vaporetto stop with your luggage up and down bridges and through the crowds). I absolutely loved this hotel and would definitely recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay at Al Ponte Antico was our first of two nights in Venice as part of our honeymoon trip. We came in from the island of Burano by water taxi, which allowed us to have a spectacular view of the gorgeous Grand Canal all the way from the Laguna to the Rialto Bridge. And there was our hotel, right after the Rialto, very charming. As honeymooners, we had reserved the junior suite with a large window on the Canal. Tourists passing by on vaporetti must have thought we were locals as many of them were just waving at us... The room was of course spacious and artistically decorated in the Venician style (this room can be seen in the hotel's website). The personnel was very friendly (Walter would cook his special omlet for us the next morning) and gave us valuable information and tips about the main sightseeing points in the city of Venice. We could enjoy more of the view on the Grand Canale at breakfast (which was taking place on the terrace overlooking the waters and the Rialto). Enchanting city, enchanting stay...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We took a water taxi directly from the airport to the hotel dock (90-100E), well worth the price for convenience if you are not travelling lightly. We were warmly greeted by Mateo, the hotel, who propmtly took our bags inside for us. Our stay at Al Ponte Antico was simply fantastic! Mateo and all his staff knew us by first name. In the morning we would wander out onto an amazing balcony overlooking the Grand Canal, and the Rialto bridge. We were served a lovely breakfast, with outstanding coffee (doppio espresso my recommendation), and eggs done anyway fresh from Mateo Aunt's farm. In the afternoon, we would enjoy a glass of wine on the same balcony before heading out to explore options for supper. Mateo was always ready to help with suggestions, or arrange tours on our behalf, etc.. The only problem with staying at this hotel is that everywhere else we stayed in Parma and Bologna for the rest of our trip seemed a bit dull!!! This hotel is amazing, mainly due it's owner Mateo, who has a true passion for what he does.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the moment we arrived at the waterside entrance to the hotel to the moment we left the same way with the owner Matteo waving us off we were made to feel as if we were the only guests that mattered. The hotel is decorated opulently in a traditional Venetian style which is streets ahead of the chain hotels you can also find in Venice. Situated directly next to the Rialto bridge you find yourself in the heart of the city yet in a secluded Venetian bubble of tranquility with the best scrambled eggs for breakfast I have ever tasted. . Apart from a very slightly dodgy shower in our room (no number next to the breakfast room and directly overlooking the Grand Canal) there was not a hiccup on our brief twenty four trip. Matteo is definitely the 'icing' on the cake, an impeccable dresser his suave and elegant style brings the sophistication of Venice to the forefront of your visit. So , Matteo's father, if as I understand it to be the case and you read this review, your son is a tribute to you. We will definitely be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I couldn't thank Matteo and his staff more for their hospitality and friendliness during my stay in Venice. Upon my arrival, Matteo surprised me by calling me by my first name without looking at any record. Perhaps I am relatively easier to identify because I am Asian - but the fact the he made the effort to remember the name of the guest really greatly impressed me. The hotel itself is beyond my description (I uploaded a couple of pics)... it's really a gem by the Grand Canal with a really short distance to the Rialto Bridge, which made my stay in Venice very easy transportation-wise (either by foot or by the water bus). Breakfast is fantastic with some items cook-to-order (I had a great freshly-made omelet), not to mention that you can have the breakfast or drinks by the canal at the terrace. I stayed at another hotel in Venice which has a pretty high ranking on TripAdvisor as well - but my experience at Al Ponte Antico is really so extraordinary that I wouldn't choose anywhere else if I visit Venice again in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a fantastic find! We decided to stay in a hotel in Venice following a 1 week cruise. As always, I was concerned that the service we recieved on the ship could never be replicated by a hotel. How wrong I was. We arrived very early on Saturday morning with the intention of leaving our bags in the hotel and start our sightseeing. After a brief check in we were shown upstairs into the restaurant area whwere we were duly offered breakfast (for free). We settled for a cup of coffee and by the time we had finished our bags were in our room and the keys were given to me. The service in this place in awe inspiring. I have been to America several times and there standards of service are great but this was just another level.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There is no doubt that the staff at this intimate, unique and charming hotel on the Grand Canal offer a service that is second to none. Personally, as a shy and self-conscious English woman, I found Matteo's personal attention over effusive and uncomfortable but I realise that the issue is entirely mine and that Matteo's enthusiasm for attending to the needs of his guests and his passion for his city is both sincere and inspirational. His staff are equally helpful and friendly and welcomed us with genuine attentiveness. The location of the Al Ponte Antico is perfect and the views of the Rialto Bridge from the terrace are unforgettable. Do not miss the opportunity to linger over a glass of wine and watch the sun set over the Grand Canal. Our room with views of the Grand Canal was beautiful, spacious and clean. Within seconds of stepping out of the hotel you are absorbed into the maze of enchanting alleys and streets and within very easy reach of St Marks Square. I thoroughly recommend this exquisite hotel and wish you a memorable stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Al Ponte Antico was the first place my husband and I stayed during our honeymoon in Italy. It was the perfect choice! The view of the grand canal and Rialto Bridge was unbeatable, and we spent almost every evening in Venice sitting on the balcony outside watching the boats go by. The decor of the Al Ponte is also breathtaking - from the restored ancient wooden ceilings, to the Murano glass chandeliers, to the fine art on the walls - no expense was spared. Between the buffet and the made-to-order eggs and crepes, the breakfasts we had at Al Ponte were the best we had during our honeymoon. The bar was complementary and open 24/7. The service at Al Ponte was also exceptional, providing recommendations and helping us make reservations whenever we wanted. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Venice, especially those on their honeymoon or looking to make their stay extra memorable. And a word to the wise for anyone going to Venice for the first time - you need to wander down some of the smaller alleys to find the entrance to the hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at the hotel by water taxi, docked right out front...the hotel is located on the Grand Canal. We were greeted by an extremely professional and hospitable young man, our bags were attended to and we were introduced to the owner of the hotel. He was extremely friendly and helpful and was eager to tell us all about the hotel and show us around before showing us to our room. We felt that anything we needed or wanted could be arranged. We booked a Deluxe Room with a view of the Grand Canal for one night. The room was amazing, with a great view. The bathroom was very no-frills but clean and did its job well. The bed was hard, but we had no issues falling asleep. The free wi-fi was great. One of the best parts of the hotel was the terrace overlooking the Grand Canal and the beautiful parlor with bar. When we were at the hotel, we spent most of our time here...and the staff was always very willing to provide us with anything from the bar, and even gathered some breakfast for us when we woke up late. I would love to return to this hotel as soon as possible!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Iâ€™m looking for a room for the Heineken jammin festival Police concert, June 22 2008 I love the Police. The mix of Stingâ€™s grooves, Copelandâ€™s hi-hat spicy playing and Summersâ€™ harmonics mistress make me crazy. But the tour date in Venice is also the chance to come back to meet Matteo and all the staff of this little hotel with a strategic location. We stayed here in April 2007, during the start up of Peruch management. We're so lucky. In this context we discovered how deep a man can love his job. Matteo knows Venice inside out an is a gold mine of advices: you can ask him everything about corners to visit, typical shops, cafÃ©s, bakeries, markets, restaurants, etc. They all are so kind and can made your holydays deeply special. The balcony with its wonderful view on Grand Canal and Rialto Bridge is unforgettable. From this point of view you can spent hours feeling the pulsating daytime life of Venice (the market is on the opposite side of the Canal) and the peacefulness of a romantic moonlight evening. We agree itâ€™s the best choice for lovers on honeymoon. Giuseppe e Maria Antonietta Rome</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our party of 3 families wit teenagers stayed for 2 days at the Al Ponte Antico on our last stop of a Mediterranean cruise. Matteo and his dedicated staffs reminded us Asian top hotels are not the only ones who understand how to make their guests feel welcome. They helped us with our 15 pieces of luggage, directions to restaurants and attractions, free internet access .... and more, always with a pleasant smile and patience. Breakfast in the lounge with Matteo cooking your egg dish in his bespoke chef's uniform was particularly memorable. Location was also perfect, at the end of a quiet alley no more than 3 minutes from Rialto Bridge. We had the junior suite in the lower floor which was very spacious even after adding a rollaway for our teenage daughter. The only slight problem was that Wifi access was spotty but the computer on the 1st floor is just as good for checking your email/facebook. It is an aged building and it shows. Our canal level room has obviously suffered some form of flooding or moisture invasion. If you are the type who prefers modern fixtures to character then this may not be your cup of tea.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Virtually every previous review more or less says it all, but wouldnt want to miss the opportunity to add a few words. Great location, fantastic view of the Canal from our junior suite, delightful and varied breakfasts..... but the staff!!! The most welcoming, pleasant, charming hotel staff I have ever come across, anywhere in the world. From the moment we arrived we were treated like long lost friends. Within about 10 minutes the staff all new our names and introduced them-selves to us in a most engaging way. Matteo, as owner and very visible manager, effused charm and knowledge of his adopted city. It could have been sickly and over-done, yet it never was. A minor issue on the room was that there was a fairly thin wall at the rear to an adjoining room, but some noise from children who were occupying it was quickly dealt with by Oliver on reception. This isnt a cheap hotel, but worth it if you want to be treated like Royalty. And three tips......firstly take Matteo's advice on restaurants, secondly, if you see one church, go to the Frari , not St. Marks, and third: take a private water taxi from the airport to the hotel...its 95 euros but absolutely the best way to get to the hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Last October we stayed for 4 nights at the Al Ponte Antico Hotel. We found this wonderful boutique hotel through Tripadvisor. The hotel is located in an old venetian palace right at the Grand Canal and has been rejuvenated with a lot of love, taste and attention to detail. Our room was very cozy and the service was outstanding. The terrace where one can have breakfast or drinks in the evening offers a splendid view on the famous Rialto bridge and the always busy Grand Canal. The owners, Matteo and his brother Bruno, both multi-lingual, gave us such a warm welcome that we felt like coming home. During the entire stay they provided a first class service which made our visit to Venice an extremely pleasant one. Matteo and Bruno answered all our questions promptly and gave us excellent advice (on museums, markets, restaurants, shops, boat trips, etc.) going well beyond what a travel guide book normally offers. One important highlight of the day was the FUNtastic breakfast. Wonderful coffees, tasty omelets, crepes, fruits, etc., etc. Breakfast in paradise can not be better. We recommend with great pleasure the Al Ponte Antico to anyone who would like to experience a joyful visit to Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Al Ponte Antico for 2 nights prior to a cruise. I booked this hotel a year in advance and the anticipation of staying there exceeded my expectations which were high to begin with. The deservingly proud owner, Matteo, greeted us warmly by name and showed us our room which was a suite on the first floor. Our room was a little above water level and I felt that I had a front seat view for all the wonders of Venice. Gondolas drifted by right in front of us and other boat traffic went about their everyday business. I liked the location very much. I felt it had more of a neighborhood feel then the area around St. Mark's. The newly renovated breakfast room was gorgeous with an enormous shiny brass espresso, cappuccino machine which made the best coffees. The buffet breakfast with the chocolate banana crepes was a great way to start the day. Drinking my new favorite drink, the spritz, on the terrace and watching the boat traffic was a relaxing way to end our days. Everyone who worked at the Al Ponte Antico went over and beyond trying to please us. They were a happy bunch of people who always had a smile on their faces. I hope the Al Ponte Antico gets kicked up to the #1 spot on tripadvisor. It deserves to be there and more.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of 4 stayed between Xmas and New Year and this was the highlight of a 7 week european holiday! We booked because of the comments on tripadviser and even these can"t match reality.So many hightlights - Our room looked out over the grand canal with a little patio and wow even with the cold weather you could have sat there for hours. Matteo and Oliver and all the staff wher amazing! Yes as soon as you arrive they greet you by name,they made our 9 yr and 18 yr old girls feel very special during our stay.Matteos breakfasts are wonderful (esp as his 90 yr old grandmother supplies the eggs from her farm for breakfast) My husband is still talkng about his scrambled eggs The dinner recommendations where wonderful which made for some memorable evenings with my cousin and husband who were also staying. If you stay dont forget to start your evening with one or two of Matteos Spritzers -AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. The hotel is central to most things a truly beautiful place on the planet to stay. . We departed by water taxi which added to the magic. We will be back for a longer stay next time maybe for a week or two as you feel you would be returning to stay with old friends.Thanks to Matteo , Oliver and all the staff the memories made are very special .</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “The Best Terrace in Venice!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We cannot recommend Al Ponte Antico enough. Matteo and his delightful staff made our first visit to Italy the most unforgettable experience. We left Venice with massive smiles and a warm feeling that we had made special Italian friends. Nothing was too much for any of the staff and the friendliness from every single person was impeccable. Without even mentioning my birthday all the staff wished me Happy Birthday and Rosalba brought me a bottle of Proscecco on ice to my room singing "Happy Birthday" - so wonderful! We sat on the terrace in the afternoon enjoying our bubbly and watching life on the grand canal. Priceless! The hotel itself is spotlessly clean - it felt home from home. The decor was stunning with a very tasteful regal touch. It has a grand feel without the stuffiness - its has a wonderful comfortable and relaxed atmosphere. The terrace was just so unique we enjoyed the best eggs (cooked by Matteo from his Grandmas farm!) for breakfast overlooking the grade canal. Having its own dock was the icing on the cake using the water taxis to and from the airport was expensive but so worth it. Matteo should be very proud of what he has achieved and we wish him all the best for his chain of boutique hotels - we are looking forward to visiting them all! Martine and Scot - London UK</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel has an amazing, outstanding location - right next to the Rialto Bridge, which make it easy to find your way back (there are signs to Rialto all over Venice, plus the water transport all goes there). There are loads of good places to eat nearby, sights, shops etc. The view of the bridge and grand canal is an absolute highlight, whether you're having breakfast, an afternoon coffee, an evening drink etc. Breakfast is quality, well served. The parlour, with it's period furnishings is gorgeous, charming. Service from everyone was exceptional, faultless, talking us through Venice and helping with restaurants, transport etc (Thanks Matteo and Barbara especially!). The only issue we could fault was that the airconditioning was stuck on a level that we found much too hot, and this could not be adjusted. It was so hot that I found myself waking at night etc, not really able to relax in the room, and really hard to get air through our room (tiny windows etc). The fridge could also use upgrading. Other than that, the room was great, with a spacious, nice bathroom (roof pretty low, but hey, it's OLD). Overall, it's an outstanding, classy hotel that really made our time in Venice a pleasure - go for it if you can. When we return (no plans, but we will, maybe with friends/family) we'll organise our dates around this Hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have to agree with previous reviewers - there is something very special about this beautiful little hotel. Matteo lived up to his reputation as I walked in the door with six of my friends. He had memorized our pictures from the passports we left at check in and knew each of us by name, as did his staff as we met them during our stay. The hotel is lovely. Two of the three rooms we had booked had beautiful views of the canal - unfortunately ours only had a view of an inside alcove of some sort. This is the only critique I would make is to ask ahead of time what the view is if this is important to you. We felt completely at home here, spending a great deal of time in the beautiful room where they served breakfast. And the breakfast and coffee service was 5 star. Matteo can cook but word to the wise - don't walk around with your coffee cup - as I was informed of my "American" nature - coffee is to be enjoyed sitting in Italy and not "to go" as we do in the US - good advice! Matteo made many arrangements for us including a private tour of one of the Murano glass factories and water taxi back to airport). On check out day we were not due to leave until nearly six. We were welcome to spend as long as we wanted sipping wine in beautiful wine glasses watching the boats go by in the Grand Canal. Thank you all for your impeccable service!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nothing ever is quite as good as the brochure/photo/reviews/website - except Al Ponte Antico. I have learnt that what TripAdvisor reviewers seem to like is highly personalised service; a sense of being a family member. I don't like that at all (being somewhat anti-social) but the reviews of Al Ponte Antico were so good and the photos so incredible that I booked it to celebrate my 40th birthday. It was an excellent decision. I booked the cheapest room and it was still the largest hotel room I've ever stayed in (for a European city, not counting US) and stunningly beautiful. The staff, as advertised, were clever, slick, well-practised in their speeches and actually genuinely endearing. Matteo is hilarious! If you are stuck for amusement (you won't be), try betting on how many times he and his staff will use your first name during your stay. I guarantee you'll under-estimate it, but it's all part of the incredible show and it would be really churlish of me to resent it. Everyone says it but the little bar and terrace are absolutely the icing on the cake. We sat there as much as we could, raising our glasses of spritz to the tourists on the vaporettos' as they pointed and took photos. It really was heaven and so troublingly perfect that I was actually relieved when I noticed that the toilet seat was slightly broken! I cannot recommend this hotel too highly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You can't really describe how wonderful this beautiful boutique hotel is. It was our honeymoon and from the moment my wife and I arrived we were greeted with genuine sincerity and warmth by Oliver, one of the hotel's many brilliant staff. Matteo, the manager, has trained all his staff to greet their guests by first names and they really went out of their way to ensure our stay was excellent. Matteo himself cooks the amazing breakfasts in a beautifully elegant dining room that leads out to a terrace, which are quite rare in Venice. The view is outstanding - on the centre of the Grande Canal, you overlook the Realto Bridge and can savour some gorgeous sunsets. The rooms are decorated in classical Venetian style and are kept immaculately. The hotel location is less than 5 minutes from San Marco square and in what feels like one of the most prestigious parts of the city. In addition, the staff at Al Ponte Antico all know some really great gastronomic finds that are neatly away from the bustling crowds. Having stayed in hotels across the world I can honestly say I've never in my life experienced hospitality like this. It really was the finest example of a hotelier taking the utmost pride in what he does. I would thoroughly recommend staying at this hotel, but book ahead - it's no suprise this place is booked up well in advance! We wish Matteo and his staff the very best success and look forward to his new ventures!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location and the staff service provided by Al Ponte Antico place it with the very best in Venice, but at substantially lesser cost. The second floor terrace overlooking the Grand Canal has a superb, probably unique, view of the Ponte Rialto, and the jousting between gondolas, vaporettos, water taxis and working boats, provides continuous ever-changing entertainment. Matteo and his staff provide superb service, with Matteo himself doing breakfast preparations, offering a wide selection, finely done and served on the terrace. He has had sommelier training and is most willing to share his knowledge (and excellent cellar) of wines. He is also most willing to recommend the best sights, excursions and restaurants and follow-up with appropriate reservations. The building itself is an architectural delight, with its painstaking and meticulous restorations superbly well done. Our very spacious room was on the ground floor with windows that opened directly onto the Grand Canal. It doesn't get any better. The sights of Venice and the lagoon (I recommend a vaporetto trip to Torcello by way of Murano and Burano to see a 1200 year old cathedral) are, of course, unique in the world, making decisions on what to do next challenging (do some advance reading because there isn't time to do it there). Whatever is selected turns into a marvellous new experience. Hotel Al Ponte Antico has provided us with vivid memories that will last a life-time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you experience one hotel stay in your lifetime it should be the Al Ponte Antico Hotel. The overall beauty and warmth of the hotel is only surpassed by the wonderful people who make your stay unforgettable. Upon arrival Oliviero welcomed us as if we were family. After showing us around this magnificent property we were made to feel as if we were truly royalty!!! My husband and I were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and upon entering our beautifully decorated hotel room we found a silver tray with champagne. But the best is yet to come. We were fortunate enough to meet Matteo, the owner, who we had heard so much about. He is one of the most charming people you could ever have the privlege of meeting. Matteo, the rest of the hospitality industry should come to Al Ponte Anico for a lesson from you. Breakfast, where do i start... Matteo makes your omelettes to order with fresh eggs from his family's farm. If you prefer crepes there are none better. Rosalba was always there to fulfill any need you may have. Croissants, cereals, juices, yogurts, fruit, coffee, hot chocolate, etc. I could go on and on but the only way to understand is to visit. We dined on a terrace overlooking the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge, what could be better. Venice is beautiful but without Al Ponte Antico we would not have had the same experience. Thank you Matteo, Oliviero and Rosalba for the most unforgettable 30th anniversary one could wish for. Caren and Stan</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Al Ponte Antico is an unusual hotel. It so nearly gets it right in so many ways, but it is still far from the perfection so many reviews seem to show. The welcome is overwhelming. God, they're SO friendly. First names, a brief rundown of the family Perruchi.... all very nice, very courteous, but possibly not to everyone's liking (especially if you're tired, as we were, on your arrival and just want to get to the room and have the long chats later)! Nevertheless, can't fault the effort on that front. The room we had was a large, ground floor room right by the canal. This could have been a great room with some basic idea of interior design (not something the Italians are normally lacking), but it was utterly charmless. Dark, dingy, smelly, no pictures or decorations on the walls whatsoever, slightly weird furniture, a down-at-heel feeling and a very basic bed. But large without question. The bathroom was pretty poor considering the very high prices charged, and certainly in need of updating. Breakfast is very good. Drinking prosecco on the balconey overlooking the Rialto Bridge is matchless. The Perruchi family need to spend some of the money that they are clearly putting in to marketing into renovation and upgrading. If they can do that, they'll have a truly fine hotel. Biggest positive - location Biggest negative - utterly charmless room Biggest challenge - timing your dash past reception to coincide with the 'phone ringing to save a 20 minute "chat".</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Absolutely the highlight of our summer vacation!!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were fortunate to stay at this property both prior to and after a summer 2007 7-day cruise, and even now, several months later, our entire family counts our stay with Matteo and his staff as a highlight of our entire vacation. It is a small 9-room hotel located directly on the Grand Canal just a few meters from the Rialto Bridge. Although it was still in the process of renovation at the time of our stay (Matteo had just taken over the property a few months earlier...) we loved it. Getting around Venice is incredibly easy from this location. Our stay included not only a junior suite (directly on the Grand Canal), but also a triple room, as we were traveling with 3 adult children. The hotel easily accommodated us, and similar to the experience of many other writers on this forum, Matteo personally greeted us by name upon our arrival by private water taxi at the hotel's dock. He and his staff made numerous valuable dining, touring and shopping reccomendations during our stay. We were treated like favorite family members the entire time. Even when one of our children was taken ill, Matteo graciously moved him to a quiet third room. Perhaps my favorite memory was the look of total awe of each of my family members as they first entered the junior suite. We could easily have passed a glass of wine to a passing gondoleer; the room was that perfect! Ahhh, the wonderful terrace and those famous omelets need no further accolades! . Thanks, Matteo! We hope to see you soon.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Al Ponte Antico for 3 nights in July as part of a three week trip through Europe. The Al Ponte Antico has a fantastic location on the Grand Canal and our room had a view of the Rialto Bridge. The room itself was very large by European standards and was exceptional in every respect. I should mention that last year we were in Venice and stayed at the Ca Dei Dogi which we thought was a fantastic hotel. The fact that the Al Ponte Antico exceeded that experience is a tribute to the owner and staff. What sets this hotel apart from others we have stayed in is the service. The owner, Matteo is tireless. He gets to the hotel around 5 am and doesn't leave until around 10. Not only does he see to it that each guest is comfortable, but he does everything from personally cooking breakfast including omeletes and crepes, to serving evening cocktails on the shared balcony overlooking the Grand Canal. I have to share an experience which shows what a great host Matteo is. We were traveling with my parents who decided to stay at a different hotel. We all arrived at the Al Ponte Antico and after checking us in, I asked Matteo if he could give us directions to my parents hotel. Instead of simply giving us the directions, he actually walked us to the other hotel over a series of bridges, down a street and a couple of alleys. In fact, he carried my parents luggage and refused my request that I carry the luggage. I cannot use words strong enough to recommend this hotel. It was fabulous in every respect.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Like most others who have stayed here, we cannot say enough positive things about this hotel. Matteo, the owner, and the rest of the staff make sure that every detail of your stay is taken care of, from airport-hotel transfers to restaurant recommendations and sight-seeing and shopping tips. The hotel itself is lovely; we were in one of the supposedly smaller ("classic") rooms, which was still quite large and beautifully decorated with king-size bed and an immaculate, fully appointed bathroom (hair-dryer, towel warmer, toiletries, etc.). Breakfast is wonderful, with custom-made omelets or crespelle as well as a buffet including fresh fruit, vegetables, breads, yogurt and cereals. Although the hotel does not at this point have a public bar or full kitchen, the staff is always happy to pour a glass of wine or to brew a latte for you to enjoy on the patio [shared by all guests] in the afternoon or evening, and the view of the Grand Canal is incredible. All of the staff speak impeccable English and know the city intimately, and their enthusiasm for Venice is contagious. A note to anyone who is not familiar with the hotel rating system for Venice: I was somewhat hesitant to stay in a supposedly "three star" hotel when I first booked at Al Ponte Antico. However, this is "merely" a three-star hotel ONLY because it does not have the kitchen and other public facilities that are a prerequisite for higher ratings in Venice. It easily equals (and in the important ways far surpasses) four and five star hotels I have stayed in in other cities.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Al Ponte Antico delivers the ultimate Venetian experience -- awakening to chocolate/banana/creme crepes and cafe latte overlooking the Grand Canal and Rialto bridge, gazing upon gondolas as they glide up the canal. Does it get any better than this??? This petite, restored castle along the Grand Canal welcomes its guests with warmth and expertise. The walls and flooring are in pristine condition, and artifacts along the ceilings of the main room are being restored to their original castle condition. All on staff are professional and knowledgeable, finding us those special dining gems where the true Italians spent their evenings, giving us a glimpse of the true experience. The guests who share this space are the most discriminating, so many joy-filled hours were spent chatting it up with Brits and Scots on the deck, to the wee hours of the morning, enjoying fine wine and beer. Matteo and Oliver are two of the finest hoteliers Iâ€™ve ever experienced. They guided us through Venice, adding joy to our trip! My son and I stayed in the deluxe room (blue and gold) featured on the website -- just off the patio, it is an ideal location with a view of the Grand Canal. A fine choice! It was quite large, with a sitting area -- perfect for relaxing after a warm summer day out in the bustle. Everything was spotlessly manicured. Nice robes and complimentary slippers provided. The buffet was to die for!!! Best of all was the service. If youâ€™re looking for a special spot to be pampered and spoiled, you have found it! Your wish is their command! I canâ€™t imagine staying anywhere else! I had considered the Danieli, but it was a tad too lavish. This is the perfect spot, although well-hidden.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have to say that having visited many hotels with my wife this has to be the best. You couldnt ask for more. The owners attention to detail, passion for his work and eye for what a hotel should offer are beyond expectations. There are many exceptional features of the Antico and I will try to summarise the most important. But still this review will not be enough to do it justice. You simply must visit as the experinece is ineffable. The second we arrived we were overwhelmed by the hotels beauty, charm and the way in which the owner (Matteo)has lovingly restored this old venetian palace. He has spared no expense for its extravagance. The terrace is a real beauty and offers a perfect way to start the morning with breakfast. I cannot say enough how beautiful the view is and how much it added to the enjoyment of our experinece. The view is perfectly complemented by the fact that MATTEO lovingly makes breakfast for all his guests with his own personal and unique, impeccable manner. He made us omlette with eggs from his grandma's farm. They were great. The standout feature of this hotel is the SERVICE. I dont belive I have received service like it. Matteo has trained all staff to greet you with your first name from the moment you arrive. It seems like the staff cant do enough without it being too intrusive. Their only concern is your enjoyment! As you can tell from the review we loved the hotel and anytime we visit Venive we will not stay anywhere else. Matteo has created an unforgetable Venetian experience. He clearly has a gift and he and his staff have ensured that me and my wife we return time and time again. The hotel was flawless. You must stay here. Finally Thannkyou to Matteo and all his staff. See you soon Phil and Jo</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here at the begining of November for 3 nights as a celebration for our's and our friends anniversaries and had a marvelous time. It well deserves all the lovely things that are said about the hotel, the staff and the location. We arrived by water taxi at the hotels own entrance from the Grand Canal, at the recommendation of Matteo, who I had spoken to before we arrived. He also made a reservation for us at a fantastic restaurant for the night of our arrival, as it was a Saturday and we had heard that it might be difficult to get into restaurants if you hadn't booked on the weekends. His courteous and friendly manner set the tone for the whole trip. The staff were always happy to help you, whether advising on where to go around Venice, or serving a wonderful glass of wine in the evening, enjoying the view of the rialto from the sitting area. Breakfast was enjoyable, always plentiful and Matteo's famous egg dishes were cooked to perfection. The loction of the hotel is great, every important site easily accessible by a few minutes walk, and arriving down the Grand Canal makes you feel like a VIP. There are even umbrellas to borrow, as it rained for 2 of the 4 days we were there, at least we got to walk on the raised platforms! The rooms are decorated to a very high standard and always clean, we stayed in a classic room. The only niggle could be that they are slightly on the small side, but please do not be put off. I've heard most of Venices hotel rooms are like this and you don't spend that much time there as you've got the wonderful city to explore. Overall, this is a FANTASTIC place to stay, I would recommend it to all my friends and the praise for Matteo is deserved. He was helpful when needed, talked to us to keep us company if that was required and left us to ourselves when we wanted it. BRILLIANT.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A very well run small hotel in a great location”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at Al Ponte Antico for four nights at the end November. This was our first trip to Venice and I spent quite a bit of time researching options online (including reading numerous TripAdvisor reviews). We were looking for a higher-end hotel with a room in the â‚¬400-500 per night bracket. In many locations this would not be a problem, but in Venice this was a bit of a challenge. Looking through all the well known luxury hotels I was disconcerted by the number of reports of poor service that guests received. I selected this hotel based on its good service reviews and then hoped for the best. Luckily we weren't disappointed. We caught a water taxi from Marco Polo airport to the hotel. This a great way to arrive. First impressions were good, with Oliver taking great care to make us feel welcome. The hotel itself is small, with only 9 rooms. We booked a junior suite, overlooking the Grand Canal. The room was a resonable size and pleasantly decorated. Its main downside was the bathroom, which was very 'cosy' with a small shower cubicle and a shower that only delivered warm (rather than hot) water. I enjoyed the view over the Grand Canal and agree with other writers' comments that it's a pity the Rialto Bridge is covered in graffitti. Obviously that not the hotel's fault! Positives of the hotel are: - The staff. They are outstanding at their jobs and provide the sort of welcome that all small hotels should offer. - Location. Overlooking the Grand Canal and in such close proximity to the Rialto Bridge. - The breakfast/bar area. There is a nice small buffet in the mornings and they also cook pancakes and omelettes to order. - The building and its decor. There aren't really many negatives. The hotel doesn't have a restaurant but there are so many places to eat within a few minutes' walk that this isn't an issue. Overall I feel this is a tremendous hotel and wish Bruno, Matteo, their family and colleagues the continued success that they deserve.</p></li>
