The bathroom would be my only complaint as it was showing wear and needed to be fixed. The paint was peeling and just generally worn out. Other than that, you cannot beat the location if you are going to Universal. Again, the staff made the trip for us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Really enjoyed our time here as it's a great location for the Universal Studios visit. Had an executive club suite which was huge and well appointed - disappointed with the club offerings at cocktail time as alcoholic drinks weren't gratis . We headed downstairs to the excellent bar where we met a Hollywood screenwriter and chatted for about 3 hrs -what a blast.Staff all very professional and another quality Sheraton offering</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 3 nights as we were planning on visiting Universal Studios. Was so close we were able to walk or catch the shuttle bus that left at regular intervals. The young guy we got for our check in was really friendly and helpful and as our flight was leaving late happily gave us a late check out. Probably the only annoying thing is no free wi-fi in rooms and the cost of car parking but overall we where happy with our stay.</p></li>

It was my son's 8th birthday and everyone made the weekend extra special for him, including the timely delivery of a birthday cake for him with a birthday card from the hotel! The room was clean comfortable and had a great view. The staff could not have been better and the location made it easy to get to all the places we wanted to visit over the weekend. We will return....maybe for his 9th birthday.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good location. Convenient to freeways and Universal City Walk and Universal Studios. There is a free tram to the above locations that is supposed to run every 10-15 minutes but is solely based on the driver schedule for breaks and meals so you may wait up to 45 minutes like we did. The hotel staff is not upfront about possible delays. They state that they don't control the transportation so they are not responsible for the timing-very poor attitude.</p></li>

Really enjoyed my stay and Universal Studies being 5 minutes away meant that I could stay n the park all day and not worry about shuttle buses. My only minor problem was that my room was difficult to find as it was at the rear of the building. Once I knew where I was going it wasn't a problem. Lots of conferences going on at hte hotel which meant the bar/restaurant was always busy. Easier to eat out on the city walk.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect location, beautiful lobby, great exercise room .... and nothing else. Our first room was on the 20th floor. Carpet was stained and M&M's were left in a few spots on the carpet. Obviously a great cleaning job by housekeeping. On Friday night, there was a band playing for a wedding directly above our room. It was too loud to talk! The management was surprised we found this disturbing but eventually moved us to another room. The bell hop told us it was this way every weekend night! Overall, this hotel was a major disappointment.</p></li>

The 18th flr had an amazing view of the area - Modern, well furnished rooms with comfy beds and pillows - Great suites and jr. suites with large open spaces - Starbucks coffee for the in room coffee makers - Extra in room portable fan despite good HVAC system - Restaurant and breakfast bar downstairs - Easy freeway access</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nothing can beat this location if one is headed to Universal Studios and the whole tourist thing in LA. For such a large hotel the employees and services were pretty darn good. Room service was efficent n well priced. Kids and teenage sport teams abounded, yet finding a semi-quiet adult bar area was simple. Lots of dining options,easy park access, and little shops make this Shearaton a nice option, especially if you have teens who want to go back n forth. It's also nice to be able to eat or drink non-park(rip off)items in the room or hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Although this hotel is quite out of the way for most So Cal attractions, if you're going to Universal and don't mind being out of the way, it can be the perfect spot. A shuttle is by every 10 minutes during the day to take you to Universal and City Walk where restaurants, shops and attractions abound. The hotel itself is very clean, a little old, but well maintained. Rooms are spacious and updated, the lobby is large and the lobby bar is a great place to grab a cocktail and appy before heading out (especially for happy hour during the week)!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent seven nights at the Sheraton and had a fantastic stay. Everyone we dealt with from reservations through check out was very accommodating and service oriented. We upgraded to a junior suite package which included parking and breakfast each day and was worth the additional cost. The room was updated and very clean and comfortable. The location was very convenient to Universal Studios, Hollywood, and other great LA attractions, but you will need a car. The only downside was the elevator issues, but not a big deal. Thanks for a great week!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a 2 night (dec 28 - 30) stay with my wife and kid. Staff were courteous, the size of the room is ok but the t&b is a bit small. One major complaint however is their aircon. Especially during the wee hours of the morning, both nights my wife and I woke up because the aircon is simply not enough to cool the room. Maybe that is the reason why they have a small fan inside the closet. I have read a complaint from another site with the same problem. The thing we like most about the hotel is the great location. Easy walk to Universal studios.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A short walk to Universal, and short distance to many of the sights makes this an excellent place to stay. The rooms are clean and functional. The staff friendly. The staff did more than you'd expect from a Sheraton. The room I was in had a noisy neighbour and the staff went out of their way to move me. Then checked the next couple of days to be sure. The only negative comment about the whole place was that the bar served the worst gin and tonic I've ever had anywhere. Won't take much to fix that! I look forward to staying again next time I'm in Los Angeles.</p></li>

It overlooked the pool and we were able to see the Next Top Models line up for auditions, which was fun. The rooms on our floor were having new room photos and mirrors installed at the time we were there, but they were quick. Starbucks coffee in-room and in the lobby.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Obviously close to Universal Studios, but not much to offer beyond that. We stayed in a junior suite which was nothing more than a regular room with some oddly placed extra space added on ('L' shaped room). Rooms are run down and in need of a renovation. Service seemed alright - with one exception. In the club lounge, watched a kid playing with the ice cubes intended for drinks with his hands and then putting them back in the bucket The club lounge attendant also watched this. I would have thought that the attendant would have changed out the ice? Nope. Needless to say, warm drinks that night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband, 14yr, 6yr & I stayed here for a trip to Universal Studios. The hotel room was fine, no complaints. We needed extra towels & they were promptly delivered within minutes of calling front desk. There is a shuttle to Universal Studios but we did not use it as the park is extremely close. If you are not completely out of shape or elderly, the walk should not be a problem for u. It's probably 5 minutes away.... We'll probably not return to Universal Studios again but if we did, we would definitely stay here. Btw, I was lucky enough to get this hotel using Priceline's "Name Your Own Price" feature :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am a SPG member and this is my second time coming to this hotel. Last year tthe Sheraton had complimentary beer and wine. Not this year. I must say too many children running wild with no supervision. No wonder kids get abducted, anyways - The club level is a disaster - No where to sit, dirty little hands touching everything, limited selection and the wonderful laughter of the precious children. The morning was worse. I get free nights so I shouldn't complain, but what the heck. I will continue to use my points, but i will not splurge on the Club Level.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved our Stay at the Sheraton Universal City. The staff was wonderful, the lobby is fun and hip. Lots of space to just hang out and relax outside of your room. The restaurant down stairs was wonderful. They have a great breakfast buffet, $21.00 adult, $11.00 for kids 12 and under. Wonderful service (Thanks Roman and Julieanne) It is walking distance to city walk and universal, the sub station is right at the bottom of the hill. Close to everything in LA. I have stayed at the Hilton in the past, but the atmosphere here was way more my style and If they continue to treat guest as well as they treated us they will do well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this hotel as it was near to Universal Studios. However, everything here you need to pay additional for, such as internet in room, breakfast, and parking ($18/day, with in-out privileges) They had a good number of computers where you can surf the web for free at their business center downstairs but it's usually full during peak times. Fortunately I was jetlagged so I was down there by 4am and nobody would be competing with me for the computers :-) They also had in-room starbucks coffee, and free newspapers at the business center. All in all, average / ok hotel, no wow factor, wouldn't recommend or NOT recommend to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for 7 nights (2 adults and 3 teenagers). Hotel staff were friendly and the rooms were of a good standard. The breakfast was also good but the restaurant can get a bit crowded. Universal studios and city walk is just 10 minutes walk away. LA traffic can be a bit of a nightmare, so use the metro which is just 5 minutes for from the hotel. We used it to go to the staples center and to the Kodak theatre and could not fault it ($1.50 for single journey or $5 for a day pass). Other reviewers have stated have a room facing the pool to avoid traffic noise, we had a room on the opposite side to the pool and we could not hear any traffic noise.</p></li>

The front desk , valet and bar lounge staff was very helpful and attentive but the rest of my hotel experience was very disappointing. Several days I waited over 20 minutes for the elevator. My first night the voices, noises and smoke from the room next store made it impossible to sleep. Most nights I heard all the conversations going on in the room next store.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for one night in February 2012. Hotel is conveniently located next to Universal Studios, very easy access from the highway, good parking facilities, and offers pretty nice views on both sides. We enjoyed a very large double queen room on the 12th floor, probably a Club Room (we are SPG Platinum members). Bathroom in comparison was extremely small, and offered very limited amenities. We were quite disappointed by the Club Lounge, where we had breakfast, with very average selection of food, terrible coffee, not even expresso nor capuccino. The staff was quite friendly and welcoming (reception, concierge, butler at the lounge).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'm not sure if real stars have actually stayed here, but it was good enough for me. The proximity to CityWalk and Universal Studios was nice for getting out and away from the hotel during free time (I was there for work). I don't know when the rooms were remodeled, but they still had a pretty fresh feeling to them. The lobby was also very nice and good for hanging out in groups. I thought that we would have been a little closer to actual "Hollywood" attractions, but they were only a short ride away. I'd stay at the Sheraton Universal again if I was in the area for any reason, or if I wanted to take my family to Universal Studios during a SoCal vacation.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The strongest point of the hotel is the fantastic location. It is a very comfortable 10 minute walk from the studios. Yes this isn't the cheapest hotel but the standard is excellent and the location is really worth paying a premium for. The room was first rate with a great view over the studios. We actually got a really good deal booking online but I notice that for other dates it was much more expensive. Highly recommended for families visiting universal studios. Very convenient for subway and the drive into Hollywood was much quicker than I had expected to be so can also be used as a base for visiting LA more generally. All in all a fantastic location.</p></li>

I have repeatedly raised a concern to the front desk every morning of my stay regarding the broken air conditioner but have not had any success. It has been quite an unpleasant experience. I have one more night to stay here and I'm actually looking forward to leaving. The hotel staff has not made one attempt to remedy this situation. Very disappointed. Next trip to LA will be in a different hotel. For how much they charge for these rooms, I am appalled at the level an ld quality of service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My stay at the hotel was great, almost everything you would expect for a conference facility. The staff was friendly, hotel seemed in good shape, fitness room was well equipped, room was clean, 14th floor room had a great view and was clean, great A/V staff. All was great until I was packing my suitcase and pulled back the bed sheet. The bed seams were full of black residue ( see pictures below). We were running out to LAX so I did not have time to mention it to the manager. Absolutely disgusting. I'm just glad I didn't get bed bugs. Also, the chairs for the convention could use updating. Everyone of my colleagues complained about them and how their backs were hurting.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the time we arrived we had nothing but wonderful feelings about this hotel. Though we self parked the valet attendants were friendly and eager to help. Front desk staff were great and our room on the 8th floor gave us a great view of the pool area. Though we didn't use the restaurant we did use Starbucks for breakfast which was just fine with us. There was a pool party on when we arrived so we headed down for music and food reasonably priced. The shuttle service was excellent to Universal and Citywalk provided lots of restaurant choices. The rooms were the cleanest I have ever seen and the decor modern and attractive. Best stay in a two week roadtrip. Loved the shampoo!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">During a recent stay in LA we spent time at 3 different Sheraton hotels. This one was the best. It had the most comfortable (newest?) beds and was very convenient to area attractions. While checking in I mentioned to the desk clerk that I needed to ship souveniers home. Without my asking he immediately googled a local FedEx storefront location and printed driving directions for me. This little step was a very nice touch that really helped me. My wife was also very impressed with this hotel and we both would stay there again if in the area. She agreed it was the nicest one we stayed at during our vacation, even though it appeared to be the oldest of the three. It was well maintained.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you're planning a visit to Unversal Studios, this is a good hotel to stay at. It's about a 10 minute walk to get to Universal Studios or the Citywalk from the hotel. I recommend booking club level. You get light snacks in the evening and a light breakfast in the morning. Don't expect too much for breakfast...not hot items to eat. If you're looking for a good breakfast, you'll likley need to dine at the restaurant on lower level. If you're planning on using the gym, it's a decent set-up consiting of treadmills, stationary bikes, dumbells, and strength equipment. The only issue I had was the lack of airflow. The morning I worked out it was very hot and the A/C didn't seem to be working.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Sheraton Universal is in a great location to get to lots of different things easily in LA. We stay here all the time and we are treated like family by all the staff. The hotel does get very busy on the weekends with events and guests so beware of longer elevator waits but other than that the hotel has everything you need. The rooms are very quiet. The club level lounge is amazing! The pool and gym are nice. You are within walking distance to all the City Walk restaurants and to Universal Studios which is very nice! You are minutes away from Ventura Avenue and all the shops and restaurants that it offers. I suggest flying into Burbank and staying at this hotel! You won't be disappointed and it's hassle free!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed during a family vacation. Breakfast was served long enough that teenagers could actually eat. The hotel is within walking distance of Universal (there is also a shuttle) and is convenient to Hwy 101. Rooms are very clean, beds wonderful. What really made the difference was the staff. Very helpful with any little problem or question about amusement parks. We stayed in the lanai rooms, excellent view of the pool and made it seem like a much smaller hotel (we never took the elevator during our 4 day stay). We didn't get breakfast included in our room rate, and that was a mistake. We found that it would have been cheaper to book through the hotel rather than hotels.com, but that's hardly the hotel's fault.</p></li>

A special thanks to Fernando, the conceirge, who helped us with all our questions and booked our tickets for the new, Cirque del Soliel, IRIS. He even took the time to show us the quick way from the hotel to the subway in order to get to Hollywood and Vine to the Kodak Theatre where the show was being held. It was only $3.00 round trip. The room at the Sheraton was clean and the beds were VERY comfortable. And, yes, this is the hotel where ELLEN has her guests stay during her shows. A very enjoyable stay, but way too short. We will certainly keep this hotel in mind if we ever return.</p></li>

Now this hotel has been renovatet and we found out many of the Sheratons are going through renovation. The room was very nice and spacious and since I love Starbucks coffee I was happy to see the room was equipped with a coffee maker and Starbucks coffee :-) There is a nice pool area, not big but not overcrowded so after the gym and a shower it was great relaxing there. Location is good eventhough you do not want to go to Universal Studios etc. (which we did not) The staff was very friendly in all areas and we did not experience any problems at all!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just a quick update on our review for November 2011, having been in contact with the Manager (Randy) he has promised to make sure we will be OK next time, which will be Feb 2013! Will keep you to this Randy, I see in one of the replies he says it is a 'secure' car park, sadly not 'that' secure, on our last visit, our rental car had the number plate (licence plate) bent upwards by 90 degrees, not much, but annoying all the same, but we did not mention it, when we took it back, the rental co, did ask, but we said we knew nithing about it, and must have been in a supermarket! Hoping for a really nice room next time (Randy !!!) nive and high with a good view, this Hotel can't be that bad, although we have had 'issues' this will be our 5th or 6th stay with them :-)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros: The best thing about this hotel is it's proximity to Universal Studios and Citywalk. A 5-10 minute walk, or there is a shuttle which we did not try. The Hilton is actually 2 minutes closer. Would stay here again for this reason alone. Rooms were clean and comfortable. We overlooked the pool with a balcony, not sure if this was an upgrade or not for SPG status, the check in person was not particularly forthcoming. We were also given Club Floor access when I asked, which translates to a continental breakfast in quite a busy room. Rooms are well furnished though on the small side. Cons: There is essentially a $30 a night surcharge to stay here. $18 for parking (not discussed at check in) and $10 for internet - with taxes is $30. I hate being nickel and dimed.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here 3 nights while on business in Glendale. Bed was very comfortable, I had a great view from the 17th floor. Room was very bright, lots of natural light - which I loved. Front desk staff were friendly, housekeeping does a great job. Room was very clean and smelled great. Towels were bright white. Overall a very nice stay. Gift shop in the lobby is also open late and has snacks, toiletries and souveniers. They also gave me internet for free since it was my first time staying here - very nice! I will certainly return on my next trip to the area. I also discovered on my last night that there is a small shopping center around the corner (Riteaid/CVS, gourmet grocery, Starbucks and some small shops.) Very convenient place for breakfast/coffee and take out.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I feel pretty sure this was not worth the price of Aprox. $200. The room was on the small size. The first room we were given had a gigantic red stain on the carpet, one dirty sock and a body sized grease smudge on the window. The moved us to another room and gave us free parking for the inconvenience. But I think they could have offered more. The restaurant had a very small menu. The rooms around the pool looked nice, but in the tower where we stayed, it was small and cramped with windows that needed a good wash. I was excited to stay in this hotel as it's close to universal and it has a shuttle and looks really nice in the pictures. Everything is much smaller (the room, the pool) in person. I do happen to stay in Starwood hotels frequently. I will not return to this one.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this property for five days during a conference. We received an excellent event rate. The room wasn't huge but it was nicely appointed with dark wood furniture, flat screen TV, and a pull-out couch. It didn't appear old or in need of updating. I obtained a "Lanai Room" which overlooked the pool with a balcony -- I was told by other conference attendees that their regular rooms weren't as nice as ours. Maid service was thorough and efficient. The restaurant, bar, and gift shop were nice but over-priced. There are your typical conference rooms as well as a small bank of computers. There's a small bar by the pool. The customer service at this hotel was truly first-class; I didn't encounter anyone who wasn't exceptionally friendly, helpful and highly professional.</p></li>

Though the rooms are meant to be smoke free, they smell of smoke, admitedly not as much as the corridor or entrance area, so if a smoke free environment is necessary this is not the hotel for you. Its close proximety to Universal Studios was our reason for booking, unfortunately it did not live up to our expectations, as the sheets were torn or stained and the water did hot flow down the plug hole but built up in the bath. The restaurant is worth mentioning, food was great, the staff were attentive and listened to our needs. I do recommend eating here rather then at Universal. I also appreciated the Bell staff, their sunny but professional approach, and care they took with our baggage, was exemplery.</p></li>

Checkin desk service was top notch and we got a nice room on the 18th floor with a million dollar view of the San Fernando Valley. But: the bathroom was very compact, the bed felt very comfortable when I first lay down but I woke with a severe back ache. The room was too hot all night long despite the fact the air conditioner was working. In the morning my wife noticed that there was a portible fan in the closet which leads me to believe other tourists had complained about it being too hot and our discovery was too late to help us. Neither of us got a good night's sleep. Note that self parking costs $18 a day and there is No street parking available. You do have in and out priveleges with the parking.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent a night at Sheraton Universal after a couple days in Disneyland and our engagment! A great stay this hotel has a beautiful lobby, free internet via wireless or desktop in their Link@ setup in the lobby. Nice restaurant for breakfast, lunch, dinner and room service. Universal is about a five minute walk away so fine if the weather's fine, otherwise there is a shuttle bus that runs from Universal. I wouldn't say the walk is any farther from Sheraton than Hilton though. We were up on the 16th floor facing north in a corner suite. Nice view and enjoyable surroundings. Clean and well presented room. The bed was amazing!! Best sleep we had had all trip. Went for a swim the next morning but it was pouring and pool/hot tub is outside so that brought an end to that! Perfect Starwood stay - highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had a reservation to stay at this hotel, and then my daughter got sick. I had spoken to the manager when I re booked. He promised me that he would take care of it completely, and that he would call me back. For about weeks, I waited and called, without a call back. and then when I finally got him on the phone, he promised he would make my reservation and call me back the next day, or by Monday. Well, its Tuesday. I called him today and he could not care less that he did not make the reservation yet, and when I told him that I was not happy with the way he treated me, he said, "fine". I said he could forget about me staying at his hotel. He was fine with that too. I told him that it just confirmed what I thought of him, and that he does not know how to treat people. I wanted you to know what kind of person is managing this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On a trip to support my daughter in a beauty pageant several weeks ago, I stayed in the Sheraton Universal where I had a very bad experience. To make a long story short, a waiter got our check mixed up with another check. The problem, mistakes happen, the problem was, the other person's card had already been entered, and my bill charged to their account. The other patron had complained, how they didn't have a lot of money, because my check bill was 4 times what they should have paid. The problem was the Manager, Mr. Coss, insulted the other patron, by telling them they were poor...and something to the fact, they shouldn't be eating here at the Sheraton. This was very uncalled for and insulted the other patron. I believe managers should have more respect for customers. I will return to the Sheraton, however; I hope that Manager receives some Management Training.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I returned again for a yearly convention. Last year I had only one complaint about a dirty bed. This year everything was not just better it was remarkably better. The room was very clean and the staff was the most pleasant I have EVER experienced. Every single staff member was cheery and honestly cared. Not the fake smile one is often greeted with. Another surprise was the prepared lunch. I had the veggie option and it was delicious. Two things to watch out for; 1 is the elevators. Sometimes the traffic gets very heavy and it might take a while to catch one. Just plan ahead. 2. When the outside temperature drops below 53F, the A/C turn into a heater. This doesn't make a lot of sense since the windows don't open and the room temperature then becomes over 80F at 3 a.m. Kudos to the manager and staff for exceeding my expectations by a long shot. But please update the A/C situation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently stayed at the Sheraton Universal for the 3rd time. As always my stay was excellent. The hotel is easy to get to as it is near Highway 101. Check in was a breeze. The bed in the room was nice and comfortable. The TV was a nice size. Bathroom was clean and so was the whole room. Had a nice room with a view of the pool and the houses on the hill. I enjoyed the pool a couple of times. Plenty of places to sit and lots of towels available. Had breakfast a couple of mornings. The buffet was very good. There was a variety of foods to choose from. Billy the waiter is outstanding at his job. He is friendly and attentive. Used the shuttle to get to Universal Studios. It is also a short walk to get from the hotel to the park. Dai the concierge is exceptional at his job. Dai was very helpful to me. I always saw him busy with guests when I was in the lobby. I will stay at the Sheraton Universal when I'm in the area again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for two nights. Wanted to be close to universal studios...couldn't be closer, could see studios and filming locations right from our bedroom window. Free shuttle takes you to and from universal all day and up until 9.30pm. After this time you can walk back, takles about ten minutes and is downhill. Staff superb. Nothing too much trouble. One of our group was poorly with ear infection, staff were great at organising taxi to a drs surgery etc. Very helpful! Breakfast was great. Most of us ordered off the menu, but buffet also good. Upgraded to front of line pass for universal studios. Well worth it, queued for 30seconds to 1 min for the rides. Whereas other queues approximately 50-70minutes long!! We organised a private tour of the sights, for family of 5 this was cheaper than using open top tour bus...which in the heat would have been awful! Would definitely stay here again if we were going back to universal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for 10 days last month and enjoyed it- The hotel seemed to be well maintained, and the staff was very professional and helpful. The Concierge was able to make dinner recommendation for restaurants NOT on the City Walk, and the bellmen were always ready to help any way they could. Two people made my stay extra special; the housekeeper on my floor who lit up each morning I passed her and wanted to know how I was doing, and the Club Room attendant at breakfast, who wanted to make sure I had everything I could possible want for breakfast. On my last day, the Club Room attendant said she was going to miss me, and hoped I would be back soon. I hope so! The bar also makes a great mojito! The other selections are very good as well. The only down sides were: The hotel restaurant. The menu looks like it came from the "My First Restaurant" kit: Salmon, steak, chicken, Caesar salad... The food tasted very basic as well. And the parking- about 20 bucks a day!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Close to Universal”</li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at Sheraton Universal for 2 nights in mid-April 2011 with my mother and young kids (aged 8 & 5). It was so close to Universal Studios! Absolutely fantastic. To get to Universal, you can cross the street & head into the parking garage to take the escalators all the way to the park entrance, or you can walk up the hill and cross the pedestrian bridge. The metro (subway) is just down the hill and across the street and it takes you right to the Chinese Theatre and Hollywood Walk of Fame. Perfect location. The beds were clean and our room was ready even though we arrived before lunch. Staff were friendly. The pool was nice but shady in the evening. I only had 3 negatives ~ (1) no fridge in the room (2) our room faced the road and freeway so it was very, very loud at night (2) the restaurant was very expensive for breakfast and nothing was open in Universal City....a staff recommended a family run restaurant which was cheap & great, but we had to walk a very long way to get there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Travelled with Virgin, Arrived at the Sheraton and found it be a modern look hotel. On our arrival was given a room that was not ready and as an apology without any hestiation they offered free internet access for the holiday. With a teenage daughter who wanted to keep in touch with friends on social network sites that was very usefull. We were given room 818 which had a lovely view of the hills, The breakfast was buffet but more than enough for what was needed. There didn't seem to be many breakfast diners close by which you find in other parts of the States. Location wise could walk to Universal studios without any hassle. The hotel is located on the side of the freeway with ease to travel towards the Pacific Coast but noise from the traffic which in LA is considerable is not a problem. The Hotel has well equipped gym and light and airy bar. All the staff were friendly and would recommend this hotel to others. Parking on site was $18 a day but that in that part of LA was not extortationate.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent 8 nights at this hotel and was very impressed with the level of service from all staff members. From check-in late on a Saturday night til checkout on Christmas morning everyone was totally responsive - front desk, valet, housekeeping, buffet attendants, even parking lot attendants. If I asked for something it was handled within 10 minutes. The only complaints would be the noise from the toilet tank running on and off all night long and the $18 per night for self parking (a bit high). They did do a repair to the toilet which helped but keeping the door closed at night handled the noise problem. The breakfast buffet (Club level) was good with sufficient choices and the staff there was very accommodating. Had some very pleasant conversation with several staff members and they never made me feel rushed. The room was decent size (very small closet) with a very comfortable king bed. The views of Universal City and the San Fernando valley were outstanding. Again, very impressive and I will return.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent 5 nights there. I rated this hotel with just 3/5 stars as I think you have a right to expect more from this chain. The most annoying was problems with internet – any browser couldn’t open the login site, neither from laptop nor smartphone. I finally called quest service, they transfer me to external tech-support company and I spent like 20 minutes with very nice guy who helped me login into internet.. But it shouldn’t be like that. Then breakfast – you pay like 20USD for buffet but the choice was very limited. So for me – another “-”. Location – if you are going to visit Universal City or Hollywood – very good choice (one stop by metro from Hollywood blvd. – Kodak Theatre). If Santa Monica or downtown – take another one. Be aware – 100% no smoking hotel. There was also strike of some employees during my stay - just in front of the hotel – bit loud … but ok, it happens - appreciated that the hotel manager addressed quests with letter explaining situation and apologies. So generally – hotel ok, but from Sheraton you expect more…</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed on a Sunday/Monday night business trip to the Burbank area. This hotel is nice on the inside - the lobby and the rooms are updated and have a nice "old hollywood" feel to them. I would say though that the service stinks for a business traveler and they clearly are overwhelmed with irritating tourists. The lobby is packed with kids (as is the pool) - wild and not very well attended. On Sunday nights they have multiple weddings on the top floor, making the entire place buzz. The top floor are apparently very loud to sleep in until 1AM when the weddings end. When I first arrived, even though I am a preferred guest, I was given a room on the bottom floor, overlooking an unlit patio that had a sliding glass door that was broken and would not lock. I called the front desk to get a new room and I was really hassled by the front desk. Although they eventually helped me, I felt like the hotel staff was overwhelmed and unable to really accommodate the level of visitors they have - especially for those of us wanting hassle free business travel.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from two nights @ the Sheraton Universal. We got a great rate through a "name your own price" website (midweek stay probably helped) and we were not disappointed. The front desk employee was polite and he gave us our bedding choice "even though we booked through a third party"... The room was a bit small but very quiet, the beds were comfortable, linens and pillows were nice, and room & bathroom were very clean. No fridge, but our cooler sufficed. Free shuttle to Universal runs every 20 min (or less) and drops you off at the center of City Walk (very close to park entrance). We did not eat at the hotel, but we did use the fitness center and although small, the equipment & facilities were clean and very nice. Our room was on the 8th floor of the tower and had a pretty pool & hillside view. My only issues were that they charge extra for everything (parking, internet etc) and that they did not make up our room the first day, but they brought us extra towels and coffee very quickly when we requested them. Overall it was a great stay and very convenient for visiting Universal and the Hollywood area.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed 2 nights at a VERY busy time of the year. The first room that we were given had a minor problem which I reported to the front desk with a request for another room. We were given a lovely upgraded room for our trouble and in addition we received breakfast vouchers. I was very impressed with how the front desk staff handled the issue. I also received an email the following day asking if everything was OK and if there was anything they could do to improve our visit. The front desk staff on Thursday DEc 29th was excellent. In addition ALL of the staff were extremely courteous and friendly througout our stay. We wanted to stay an additional day but the hotel was sold out. The gym was clean, there was a variety of equipment, and we did not have to wait to use any of the equipment. The location is great expecially if you plan to visit Citywalk or Universal. We were visiting a relative in Hollywood which is right over the hill...about 10 minutes by car. We will definitely stay here again next year but I will book earlier so I can get the extra night. Also concierge was very helpful on Friday Morning.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When I first arrived we received a warm welcome from the valet parking which was a great start to our LA stay. The room, on the SPG level was great, with good views, however, it would have been nice to have had a fridge of some sort. This hotel felt safe and was perfectly located for Universal Studios and the City Walk. There is a complimentary shuttle to the Studios but it is a 5 minute walk, if that. Prior to coming to this hotel I had phoned, from the UK to get a treat arranged but was bitterly disappointed when we got to the room that this had not been arranged, and was even more dismayed that when I went to the gym and spoke to a young lady on reception she appeared disinterested, however on speaking to another receptionist, Cherry I think my faith was restored with a complimentary gift to the room. The SPG lounge is clean & pleasant and you can keep yourself stocked up with bottles of cold water from the fridge. If the sky lounge is not being used for a function I can highly recommend going up there, especially at night where you will get some stunning views. I will certainly chose this hotel if I go to LA again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lat stayed here two years ago. Hotel is still IMO the best play when visiting Universal Studios. The park is in walking distance and the hotel shuttle runs daily from 9am to 8pm. We never waited for more than 5 minutes . Hotel staff are very friendly. Plenty of bell men to get your bags. No line at check in, arrived at 8pm. We ate in the bar area, which is generally quiet. food was tasty and service friendly. We were in room on 10 floor. View of pool and hills. 2 queens with a sitting area. Perfect size for family of 4. Decor was nice and room very clean. Had Club privaliges. This is the only area we noticed any changes.Breakfast was fine but not as good as last time. The small single juice bottles in several varities were gone. Instead just a large Orange juice pitcher. No more single serve cereals and strawberries were only put out once. Evening service like wise was scaled back. Some veggies, dip, and chicken wings. Pool area is nice, with plenty of chairs and towels. The pool though is not heated, which made it impossible to swim in. Internet is still not free. $.9.99 a day. And self park is $18 a day. Still a nice hotel and we will stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Being a frequent corporate business traveler, I really look for comfort and service when I am away from home and my family. This is my second recent stay at the Sheraton Universal, and I am still convinced that this is a great property. The aromatherapy scent that is common in all Starwood properties greets you when you enter the lobby. I was upgraded to a nice sized room with a king bed on the Club floor. The room was freezing cold when I checked in, but when I called the operator a hotel engineer contacted me immediately. He came upstairs and got the heater working-I just wish I remembered his name because he was very professional and made sure I was satisfied with the situation before he left. The 9th floor lounge is well appointed and offers an evening reception with beer and wine for sale, along with light appetizers as well as a free continental breakfast in the morning. After getting caught up on emails, I was not motivated to leave the hotel for dinner and ate downstairs in the restaurant. While nothing on the menu jumped out at me, the chicken with tossed parmesan asparagus was delicious. I look forward to returning on my next trip down the coast.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My holiday company booked two standard rooms which we needed one of the rooms to be a double but the request did not get to the hotel. Being Easter the hotel was full. Really helpful staff arranged a put-u-up bed for our first night and the next day arranged a twin room on the same floor as our other room all free of charge. Rooms were good (really nice beds thinking about ordering one from Sheraton!) and had spectacular views looking over LA (fl16). One night the next door room occupants came back at 3.00am with all of their friend and stayed up talking for ages keeping us awake and yes the walls are quite thin. (Still the next day the do not disturb sign disappeared off their door!) Very helpful staff the concierge could not do enough for us including information on trips and directions and sights to see. For Breakfast we had a voucher as part of our package. The selection was ok but by morning five it was a bit repetitive. Little annoying thing was no rubbish bin for the empty cereal packets. Universal is not that far away but is uphill so we took the free regular bus from the hotel and walked back. All in all a real good stay and would recommend this hotel</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Universal Sheraton was excellent. The location is very good and significantly better than I'd anticipated. Obviously it's very close to Universal Studios and Citywalk, which is a big bonus. There's a metro stop just down the hill, which is very handy and Disneyland is a very, very easy drive. If you don't mind using the metro it's very handy. The service in the hotel was superb - I can't speak highly enough of the concierge service, especially the lady whose name I have unfotunately forgotten. They were able to book basketball tickets, arrange a hire car, give us all sorts of help and advice, directions, you can buy Universal Studios tickets (front of line pass) there and I could go on and on. Our most sincere thanks go to them, the best concierge desk I've experienced. In fact all the staff were excellent - just one example was that there was an LAPD conference on a couple of the days we were there and when the queue for lifts was extremely long the security guard took us up in the service elevator so we didn't have to wait!! Genuinely one of the kindest gestures I've ever received in a hotel. I'd highly recommend this hotel, the rooms were spacious and comfortable and the service was superb.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed at this hotel and I have to say I was not left too impressed by the service. From reading the reviews here it appears that if you do not stay at club level you receive no service at all!! The hotel itself is a great location with the shuttle bus running to Universal Stuidos which is a great help. The rooms were clean but small, we had 4 adults in one room and don't be fooled by the advertised room sizes, it was cozy!! When we arrived there were not enough towels in the room for the number of people staying there, when I called reception they said they would send some extra towels... they never arrived. The next morning and another phone call to guest services extra towels arrived. We did order room service the night we arrived as it was late and we were tired, food was lovely but expensive for what we got. The concierge desk were very helpful when we were leaving to drive to Anaheim and provided us with maps and the best routes to take. The location of this hotel is great but I think if you want to make your stay a little more special you may need to book a room at club level. We had to wait a while for the lifts but it wasn't too bad. we self parked and they do allow in and out privilages that you are not charged for.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fluffy bed- check. Fluffy towels- check. Complimentary coffee and tea- check. Room service- check. Prices are rather steep (conference-specific rate $169/night), but you are near Universal Studios. Fourteen percent occupancy tax and Internet is $10/day of access in your room, just so you know. Food prices also high-- expect to drop at least $16 on breakfast alone. Room service for breakfast- very nice with a congenial waiter. Lobby-- a bit smaller than most business hotels (more like a living room), but that meant the walk to the elevator was really short. Liked the lounge chairs. Toilet was a little wonky-- often the lever didn't return back to its original position on its own after flushing and had to be pushed back into place. The restrooms in the lobby area had better operating toilets. TV account statement channel wasn't working. I stayed for 4 nights. First night had a loud couple getting it on next door. The next 3 nights were fine. Location was really close to the CityWalk, where decent restaurants could be found. You could probably get more bang for your buck in, say, Holiday Inn Express, where Internet and breakfast are included in a lower price, but if you have no car and rely on conference shuttles to take you to places, this is a really good location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for a conference but brought along family. The only claim to fame is the proximity to Universal Studios and to get there on foot you have to take an iffy elevator up to the Hilton Hotel next door and walk through their ballroom area to get outside. Crazy. The elevator stuck twice while we were there. Not good. Checked in and the room was ready. No washcloths so immediately called down for some - they never arrived. Next morning called again and finally got some. No extra toilet paper so we were very careful. LOL Concierge was helpful and sold us Universal Studios tickets with no fuss. They have a Starbucks "outpost" in the lobby, but it's part of their actual bar. The person didn't make drinks, just pointed me to the filled canisters lining the booth and I made my own. Weird. The restaurant downstairs has a breakfast buffet that I really enjoyed. It was pricey, but the waitstaff was incredibly nice. Told the kids what they should do at Universal Studios and in what order and they were right! The restaurant makes their own salsa, so if you go, be sure to ask for that - it was phenomenal! I put it on the scrambled eggs from the buffet and really really loved it. Buffet had just about everything you'd want and ended up being cheaper than ordering off the menu. Probably wouldn't stay here again, but wasn't horrible.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I and 2 of our young children stayed here for a weeeknd to attend my husbands grandmother funeral serivce. The weekend turned into a horrible disaster but the staff at the Sheraton could not have been more accomodating or pleasant. We were to stay for 2 nights, 3 days but only ending up staying for 1 night because my husband got a horrible gall bladder infection and we had to fly him home for surgery. On Saturday at 2am , not knowing what was wrong withmy husband, we needed our car from valet ASAP and without hesitation, valet had it pulled up and we were on our way to the hospital. When we discovered we had to head home early after a long day at the hospital we were passed the checkout time, I told the front desk of our weeeknd not expecting him to cut us any slack, and quite honestly I wasn't asking I just needed to get home and he very gracioulsy didn't charge us for the extra night and wished us a speedy recovery. He offered his condolences and hoped we all got back safely. It was just those words I needed to get me through. A total stranger taking the extra time to say a few words of encourgement meant a whole lot after the ordeal we had been in. Aside from that, the room was super comfortable, roomy and valet was excellent. The business center was great and convienent, especially since I needed to use it to get an emergencey flight home for my husband.</p></li>

Again at the end of the week, there was some sort of convention, and we were kept up until 0245 in the morning with laughing and doors slamming shut, this was mentioned to the desk who did apologise. The other thing that annoyed me, and one of the reasons we went back to this Hotel, after the last trip, we had a letter saying that we would be given a free entry to UNIVERSAL, this latter was emailed back to them a couple of weeks before went, but the desk knew nothing, and the offer was never given to us. Parking was about $20 per night, but even as guests you do not get priority/resevered areas, thus on a few nights when events were on, we ended up on the very top deck squeezing in, and on one moring, some nice person had bent out licence plate through 90 degrees... why ? ! Would i stay again, possibly, it is handy for City Walk and the Freeway (101) Rooms are clean, Staff are very freindly, it's the little things that can really spoil the vacation,</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Excellent location and "Sam" for taking care of me and my daughter...”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went there from January 14-16. My daughter and I wanted to stay close to Universal Studios for our long weekend getaway. I mentioned when I reserved for the room that we will be arriving late, so when we got to the reception there was Pancho forgot his last name. He seemed like he had a long day because he was in a hurry to get us checked in. I asked him if he could give us a nice view since it was our first time... he said yes yes.. when we got up to the 11th floor ... it turned out we got the freeway view.. not very nice. He spoke so fast, at 8pm.. after a long day of traveling, you cannot comprehend everything he is saying. Then I said until what time does the tram run.. he quickly replied..9 pm.. The night before I got an email from Chris Murdoch and he cc'd the other managers stating that if there is anything I need to notify them. I emailed the managers and I got a quick response from Sam. She was quick enough to take care of me and my daughter. I have stayed at Sheraton Anaheim, Sheraton Norfolk, other Sheraton properties and I must say you have an excellent staff.. esp Sam. except for Pancho. The other plus is the fact that the tram drops you off at the City Walk away from all the crowds. You have your own drop off spot. The breakfast buffet was excellent as well. Breakfast staff are excellent service as well. I highly recommend staying at Sheraton Universal. Thank you so much to everyone and especially to Sherry "Sam"</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As flights from Australia arrive into LAX early in the morning, I contacted the hotel quite a while in advance and requested early check in. We booked 3 rooms and requested them all to be together. I communicated with a lovely man from the hotel before our trip and he sounded so positive and helpful. Of course upon arrival (with 4 feral children!) NONE of our rooms were ready and the receptionist didn't try to help us at all. A very dissapointing arrival. The rooms however are lovely and the beds are extremely comfortable. During our 3 days we never saw the shuttle bus to Universal Studios and this was a huge problem as I have multiple sclerosis. The walk is just too far and difficult (for anyone really!). Taxi drivers got really annoyed at us because the drive was too short. The Hilton is definately closer and an easier walk. Next time I would stay there as it is much more convenient. I wish other reviewers mentioned that! It is definately worth getting the club lounge as the continental breakfast is lovely and fresh. I would also like to mention that I left a US$250 brand new tracksuit on the bed as I left. I was silly to not check the room before I left. There were kids running around and we were running late so it's my fault. We phoned the hotel 1 hour later and were put through to lost property. They found nothing. We phoned again the next day and spoke to reception and lost property again - once again, nothing. Very sad that someone would find it and keep it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We visited LA from Oct. 27 to Oct. 30th for Halloween Haunt Night, a USC game and to visit friends. From the moment we checked in at 11:30 at night, the superb staff made us feel welcome, the bar was actually open, and the room was amazing. We got a corner room with a 2 walls of windows (thanks to being Starwood Owners I'm sure!). Great bed, while the bathroom is small, it's fully functionable, and we had a great view of LA. Valet service rocks, as they run to your car and are so nice and helpful. Location was perfect! We took an hour walk to Warner Brothers for a VIP tour (very fun experience) on a beautiful October day, enjoyed a great choice of restaurants on the walk there (recommend Paty's at Toluca Lakes) and walked through lovely residential areas. Took the free shuttle up the hill to CityWalk, did Universal's Halloween Haunt Night (get the Front of the Line pass), and walked back to hotel late at night. Did a USC game, while only 15 miles away, it did take an hour to get there, so have patience! On last day of trip, took a 20 minute drive (through West Hollywood) and went to eat brunch at the Marmalade Cafe at the Grove (outdoor shopping center and farmer's market) where they film Extra everyday. They were preparing for Halloween and Christmas in the same day. Very fun. Overall, great experience. We will return in a heartbeat next year. Great customer service, great room, and with so many fun activities/places to see surrounding the hotel, it's a win-win for a great vacation!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 3 nights in Feb 2012. We arrived at 2345 at night after a lond flight and there was no food availiable within the hotel (not even a vending machine). Front desk suggested we send out for pizza. We were assigned a room that the reception staff assured us was one of their better rooms as it had a balcony. On arrival at the room the main thing we noticed was the noise from the freeway outside the balcony (not sure why you would ever want to sit on it and overlook the traffic). The problem was that the glass patio window was not airtight and not at all soundproofed so the noise from the freeway was loud at all times. We phoned back to reception and asked if there was an alternative room availiable. We were told that no, the whole hotel was fully booked out. We were also told that we should be grateful for having the balcony as people who were higher up were always complaining it was too hot and the air conditioning did not work - at least we were able to cool the room down via the badly fitting windows. We then wondered what kind of run down place we were staying at. The room itself was great, really comfy bed, lots of storage and a good bathroom. Breakfast was adequate though the buffet area was very small (for the size of the hotel) and continously ran out of stuff. Service was erratic, one morning we were waiting so long for our drinks we had already finished the food. Its an OK place, the room is comfortable. Just avoid the traffic facing rooms with the balcony (on ground level floor 3) or the hot rooms in the tower (as reception suggested). Free wireless internet was a bonus also.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We traveled to universal studios and decided since we have a baby it would be great to walk to a close hotel and we chose the Sherwton Universal. The location is excellent and only about a 5 minute walk to Universal Studios. We had 6 adults staying with us and my baby and we were put into an executive suite which I was told it had one bedroom and a queen size bed in the living room area and a couch that would fold out, and about 600 sq ft of space with balcony When I heard this it was perfect especially for the price I was quoted. I walked n and was very pleased with the room only to find out though that there was no bedroom for me and my husbands privacy and the couch did not fold out. I thought where would we put all these people?! Went downstairs thinking they gave me the wrong room but no they said that's only the presidential suite. So I thought why would I make up what the room is the lady told me over the phone. Of course I was upset the only thing they did was offer me one cot free of charge which I accepted but the other adult slept on the couch. Over all the hotel is nice inside and clean, staff is nice. But with then knowing I had 6 adults they should have told me to either get two rooms or upgrade. I asked how much for the presidential suite they never provided me a price and I didn't get the other cot until 4 hours later I had to go back downstairs and ask for it. I would stay here again but make sure the room u get is the correct one just verify it with the rep. My overall experience here was good despite all the adults in a smaller room. We stayed on the 11th floor in room 1109. :) have a great stay!!</p></li>

<li>We had 6 adults staying with us and my baby and we were put into an executive suite which I was told it had one bedroom and a queen size bed in the living room area and a couch that would fold out, and about 600 sq ft of space with balcony When I heard this it was perfect especially for the price I was quoted.</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 0.999&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>I walked n and was very pleased with the room only to find out though that there was no bedroom for me and my husbands privacy and the couch did not fold out.</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>I thought where would we put all these people?!</br>

<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 0.948&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Of course I was upset the only thing they did was offer me one cot free of charge which I accepted but the other adult slept on the couch.</br>

<li>Over all the hotel is nice inside and clean, staff is nice.</br>
<span style="background-color:#4363d8">CLEANLINESS</span>: 0.970&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>But with then knowing I had 6 adults they should have told me to either get two rooms or upgrade.</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 0.879&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>I asked how much for the presidential suite they never provided me a price and I didn't get the other cot until 4 hours later I had to go back downstairs and ask for it.</br>

<li>I would stay here again but make sure the room u get is the correct one just verify it with the rep. My overall experience here was good despite all the adults in a smaller room.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Steps from Universal Citywalk and the similarly named adjacent theme park, the Sheraton Universal is arguably the most convenient hotel in the San Fernando Valley.  A subway station for the Metro Red Line which is a 10-minute walk down the hill to Cahuenga, grants quick access the Hollywood attractions and downtown sports venues.  If you care to park on the freeway with 10,000 of your closest friends, the 101, the 134 and the 170 are close by. Universal Citywalk has some great family-friendly restaurants like Wolfgang Puck, Tony Roma's and the Hard Rock Cafe.  And, you can catch Jay Leno filming the "J-Walking" segment of the Tonight Show  right around dinnertime here.     From the exquisitely polished brass handrails on the exterior walkway to the Zen-inspired front lobby, the hotel welcomes the weary traveler with a aura of sophistication and serenity.  I have only been to a handful of other Sheraton properties but this is the nicest by far.   The people who work here rock!  Every staff member we encountered was completely capable and Sam, one of the managers, truly went above and beyond with regard to getting us an extra room for a co-worker at the last minute so we could all be at the same property. I had a very nice room with a view of the Cahuenga Pass. The room was cleaned well with the somewhat troubling exception of pubes in the bathtub.  The Club Lounge was stocked with an ample supply of snacks and beverages and the host and hostess ensured the food items were well presented.   Sadly, this is my last stay as a Platinum member before losing status with Starwood next year.  "Thank you" Sheraton Universal made it great!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Family Trip to Universal”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked a AAA Travel package to the Sheraton Universal for two nights. We arrived just before noon and was able to check into a room right away. The service was great with our bellman offering a free fridge for all of our snacks/drinks that we brought. Parking for our car was included in the package, but runs around $18.00 for self parking. The room was located on the 17th floor with a nice view of the park. Although small, our accomodations seemed recently remodeled and clean. We quickly unpacked and headed to the park. By foot, you first take an elevator up to the next level (where the Hilton is) and then take a short uphill hike to the park. Total time about 15 minutes. There is a shuttle that picks up at the Sheraton but we never used it. Universal was not packed during our stay, and we easily covered everything in the two days. One evening we took the Metro to Hollywood/Highland (one stop from Universal Station) to see the Graumans Chinese Theater and the sights. On the return trip back to Universal Station there is a bit of an uphill walk to the Sheraton. It seemed safe as there were others walking. The next morning we decided to try their buffet breakfast downstairs and it was one of the best buffets we've had in a long time. Although not cheap (around $25.00/person) we enjoyed the breakfast faire. The big breakfast precluded us from eating much in the park that day until we had dinner that evening. That evening we spent at the City Walk next to the park. The recent acquisition of the Sheraton Universal by the Shenzhen group may bring some interesting changes to the Hotel. As a Starwood member we would definitely consider staying there again in the future.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Let me start by saying that they seem to focus on customer service from initial e-mails checking to see if your require assistance, etc. We were happy with the cleanliness and proximity to Universal Studios and the free shuttle they offer. We upgraded our stay to an Executive Suite. I have to say, for the extra money it cost I wouldn't bother. Basically all it does is get you a living room area and a continental breakfast. The bathroom was still small just like the regular rooms (I think when your check out bill for one night is $350 the bathroom for a suite should be a little more impressive). Also, I can't believe that a suite didn't have a refrigerator??? Our only other complaint, other than the size of the bathroom, was the "Starwood Breakfast" experience. We walked in and only about half the tables were occupied. But the remaining tables that were open were all dirty. And, basically remained dirty with other people's dishes, etc. for the entire time we dined as well. I will say the young man that was working the room was extremely well mannered and well spoken---a great employee. However, he was obviously frazzled trying to keep all the breakfast items stocked as well as trying to keep tables turned over. It really needs two people working it. One to keep the tables clean and turned over quickly as it really is a small room for the amount of people that come through there every day, and one person to keep all the food/beverage items stocked. It's definitely too much to expect one person to manage everything. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay here and obviously the management takes pride in trying to keep their guests accommodated and coming back for future visits...</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We actually checked out of another hotel to come to Sheraton but were very disappointed- should have stayed put where we were. We paid for a room that was supposed to be a more 'desirable' room because it had a balcony facing the pool- we were told by the reception " people pay more for this room". Firstly, to get to the room, one has to go up some 4-5 steps or so- there are no elevators to go to this part of the hotel- not good if you have some heavy luggages. Upon entering the room, we noted the carpet was stained in several areas (see pic). We then realized the wood panel on the door frame to the toilet was almost falling off (see pic). We went back to reception to ask for a different room but was told there were no other rooms available that were equivalent to the price of the room we paid. We were offered a room without a balcony but there will be no refund or upgrades. The receptionist went to speak with his supervisor and came back with nothing except the reassurance that his supervisor will follow up with us; of course no one followed up during our 2 night stay! The parking is shabby not attached to the hotel, you have to walk across a lane to the hotel for $15/night and the parking elevator smelt of urine. Room comes with 3 towels- there were 4 of us (2 kids) and so we asked housekeeping for more towels- they were prompt and brought us 4 extra towels but unfortunately 3 out of 4 towels were heavily stained (see pics). It was disgusting, adding to our disappointment. The only good thing was it's location if you are going to Universal Studios. You will be within walking distance to US. We were very disappointed especially considering it was a Sheraton. Will not go back there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 1 night at the start of our honeymoon. Checking in was easy and everybody was friendly and helpful. Since we arrived early our room wasn't ready but the desk agent gave us a key to a lower room (no view) and said if we were okay we could have that room or else wait for our room with a view. Well since we were not there for the view we checked out the lower room and it was fine. We went back to the agent told him it was okay and so he upgraded us from that room to a low floor with the pool view which I thought was way better then the room we were supposed to have because this had a balcony. Also, since it was our honeymoon they gave us a comp breakfast coupon. The property is very nice as you would expect for a Sheraton. Location was perfect for going to Universal Studios. Short walk or you can catch their shuttle. Conciege desk was very helpful in giving us ideas for things to see along with maps on how to get there. The bell desk was helpful and valet parking guys were great and even wiped down our windows for us. I have no problems recommending this hotel to other and would gladly stay here again. If I had to find something negative to say I'd say it was finding our room the first time. To get to the lower level rooms you have to go down the hall (passing rooms) to an elevator. There is no sign on the outside saying elevator down the hall. So we walked down the hall as that was the directions given, saw rooms and figured it was the wrong way so turned around before getting to the elevator. Then after checking all areas we asked again and was told to pass the rooms to find the elevator. It wasn't bad just confusing and something to laugh about as we should have trusted the first directions.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my second time in Sheraton Universal. At this time, we had a Club Lounge room and we could see the hotel was remodeled , but the staff still do an excellent job. From your arrival, the front desk people, the concierge and everybody that works there pamper you . If you need an information, they give you a complete map, explaining very well all the stuff you need. The breakfast was fair, with eggs, ham, cheeses, breads and muffins, coffee, tea and juices. Also they offer cereals and fresh fruits. You really don't need to have breakfast anywhere else. On the other hand, the happy hour - between 5;30 and 7;00 P.M. - is good if you don't drink alcohol. Soft drinks are free but you have to pay (and it's expensive) for any glass of wine or beer. As we can see, it's an unhappy hour.... But the appetizers were very good, mainly the shrimp appetizer.... Also to get the Port of Los Angeles you have to do a long trip - more than 50 minutes ! and if you call the Supershuttle, you have to go first to the Airport, and then, to the Port... The best thing is: you are almost facing the Universal Studios Hollywood! So, you can choose different things for dining and you don't need to have a ticket to go to Citywalk... If you like the rides, you can spend the whole day for fun... At Citywalk you can shop and dine, isn't lovely? The real problem we had at the hotel was with neighbors screaming, running and slamming doors at 1:30 A.M. I tried to knock the wall, asking for silence and they began knocking the wall like mad people. I called the reception and less than one minute ( the time to get the lift) I've heard the security calling the neighbors and I've got silence to sleep... I liked very much the readiness of the security...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed occasionally at the Sheraton Universal over the years, and I have to say that in spite of recent substantial renovations, the hotel is feeling a bit tired. On my last two-night visit, I was on a high floor with spectacular views, and had a comfortable night's sleep on a most comfortable bed. The check-in was pleasant and attentive. Questions were answered knowledgably and courteously. The lobby was as attractive as I always remembered it, but with no real sitting area unless you went into the bar section. The decor in soft beige tints was pleasant both upstairs and down. Self-parking was good value at $18 per 24 hours, as was the internet. Yet, there was also a motor hotel feel feel which was new and unwelcome. The room maintenance was bizarre in my case. It was no more than perfunctory, if that. After my first night I returned to the room after several hours away and found that the bed covers had simply been pulled up — and not much more. Dust balls on the carpet evident when I checked in were still there 24 hours later. In the bathroom, I had left one towel in the tub because it needed replacing. When I returned it was now on the bathroom floor, along with the bath mat which I had carefully folded and draped over the tub in the morning. There was soap scum in the wash basin. Also. I suspect that easy access to restaurants up the hill on City Walk has had a negative effect on food services at the Sheraton Universal. Again, the staff in the sole remaining restaurant was pleasant and attentive, although not especially professional. But it was essentially a coffee-shop menu and coffee-shop quality food. However, the tortilla soup can be recommended. For breakfast, unless you want a traditional repast, the coffee and Danish bar in the bar area is your best bet.</p></li>
