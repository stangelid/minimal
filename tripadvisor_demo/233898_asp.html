<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Beautiful hotel, with excellent staff.

There was quite a bit of noise from traffic, but it didn't spoil it for us. Well recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect location for a trip to Venice - only 15 minutes from St Marks by boat, and the boat station is right in front of the Hotel. Well presented rooms (if a bit small) great staff (helpful without being pushy). No restaurant in the evenings and the bar closes as 2100h, but the local recommendations from reception were fine. Great value out of season, but I imagine a rather fuller price in the Summer. I certainly plan to stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice rooms, most with some sort of view of Venice, charming and friendly staff. It's directly next to the landing stage for the boats to Venice and the airport. A roof terrace offers excellent opportunities to photograph Venice with a telephoto lens, and I guess would be very nice in the summer. The airport is one hour away on the Alilaguna boat (â‚¬15). Venice is a few minutes away by water bus, served by lines 1, 51 and 52 (at least).</p></li>

We have just returned having stayed for 3 nights in one of the superior rooms which was well worth the money. We had a large spacious room with gorgeous bathroom with whirlpool bath. All the hotel staff were extremely helpful with everything we asked about and were not even bothered about us taking a pizza and a bottle of wine to our room one night. Highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Would highly recommend the Panorama if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Venice. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are well furnished, if a bit on the small side, but you don't spend that much time in your room anyway. The Lido is a nice alternative to central Venice with a number of shops, bars & out door cafes, but only a 10 min ride into Venice. The views of Venice from the Hotel, especially as the sun sets are amazing, worth the stay alone. Enjoy your stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved staying at the Hotel Panorama, Lido. Cheaper than central Venice but offers much more for your money. Stayed in the Junior Suite which had the most amazing view over the Venice Lagoon to St Marks Square and the Grand Canal. The room was very clean and spacious. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Enjoyed the unseasonably warm weather and loved sitting on the first floor terrace drinking beer from the bar overlooking Venice. Just perfect!!!!! Would highly recommend as right next to the waterstop and only 15 minutes boat ride from central Venice!</p></li>

Lido is the only place with beach so one tip is not to use it on weekends as all locals use beach so it was very busy. Food is expensive in many restraunts and menu is very much the same, so would highly recommend chinese restraunt round the back of hotel which was very enjoyable and half the price.Would recomend Hotel if you are staying on lido ,we really enjoyed our stay.</p></li>

(But avoid the top floor if you have paid for a lagune view - you have to climb a small staircase to look out of the window...) The vaporetto - water bus - is docking directly across the street from the hotel. There are plenty of shops and restaurants in the area, and the heart of Venice is just a short vaporetto-ride away. On the other side of Lido - a short walk across - there are excellent beaches, both public and private (hotel Panorama has a private beach).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I went there in Nov 2008. I loved my trip to Venice and this hotel was the best I stayed in Italy. It is very well decorated, clean, the staff is very helpful. The location is very convenient, right across from the vaporetto to Venice. If I had stayed at a more expensive hotel in Venice (and probably not as comfortable), I would have missed all the fun in Lido. Nice neighborhood too, a lot of shops and restaurants nearby and much cheaper than Venice. The breakfast was excellent, and they even had satellite TV with all the main US channels. So much fun riding the vaporetto, this is the way to go around the area.</p></li>

Room was large, clean and comfortable with a nice en suite bathroom. Breakfast was the usual continental spread of cereals, breads, meat and cheese....more than adequate to keep you full for a day spent walking around Venice. This is a four star hotel and the location of it is what makes it a winner. The lido on which it is situated is lovely and a nice break from the busy touristy Venice. I'd recommend hiring bikes and cycling round, it's very pretty. The beach is a short walk from the hotel and is clean with a nice cafe.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our third trip to Venice in the last five years and the first time that we have stayed at the Lido. We chose Hotel Panorama because of its conveneient location very close to the vaporetto. This made it very easy for us to visit the islands in the lagoon - in particular Torcello which is a mystical place! We used the Hotel Panorama beach access several times and it made visiting the beach very easy for us. A good 10 - 15 minutes walk away from the hotel but plenty of space when you get there. I would recommend this hotel: it is clean and comfortable; a good continental breakfast; very helpful staff and a convenient location.</p></li>

Whilst the street traffic is close by, general noise level decreased after 2200 hours. Overall, we rated the Panorama as ticking most of our boxes & would not hesitate to recommend to friends/family.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We really enjoyed our 3 night stay in Hotel Panorama. The staff were welcoming, helpful and friendly. As soon as we arrived, they went though main attractions and tours on both the surrounding islands and Venice. They also advised the best travel passes to buy, and arranged a water taxi to take us to the glass-blowing island free of charge. The location is a great retreat from the crowds in Venice, but close enough to enjoy the beauty of the island. Main spots on Lido are within walking distance, however you can hire bikes to tour further parts. All in all, it was a really relaxing and unoforgettable stay, and the hotel made it all the worthwhile.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 5 nights at this hotel.Room small ( 203) partial view of lagoon, fine for a shortish stay.Loved the breakfast and loved the street cafes in the locality.Nice tourist menu at the Gran Viale Restaurant,19 or 26 euros per person from memory depending on 2or 3 courses.Watch out for the yellow machines when you authenticate your Vaporetta passes for the first time on the Lido,it wouldnt return my pass,30 euros worth,so i guarded it against further use until a ACTV man could attend with his keys,it all worked out in the end ! Consider late September or early October for visiting Venice,the evenings started to get chilly when we visited (10th Oct )</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here after a co-worker from Italy reccommended it. Amazing place. Small yet nice. The rooms were very clean and because they were underbooked we got a free upgrade. Nice included breakfast, all cold pasteries, yogurts, juices. Just as easy to go to the supermarket around the corner and get some terriffic fresh bread. Great location. We had an amazing view of Venice from our balcony. The #1 vapretto stops right across the street, just a 10 minute ride to Venice. The concierge was amazing, spoke 5 languages and could help you with everything! Such a help. I would totally stay again! But would check out the island of Lido more....</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After having two very nice hotels in Milan and Verona I found this one to be a disappointment. Small touches like having to pay for certain coffees in the morning were a bit much. The room was quite small. Before we were able to access our room we were taken to other rooms to see if we wanted to upgrade for an exra 40 Euros a night. So, when we finally were shown to our room we were told, "you see, this room is not as nice and much smaller." I found that to be a less than favorable introduction. I was willing to go that extra ride on the waterbus in order to find a nice hotel, but I would say don't bother. This is a very average hotel at a higher price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were upgraded to the top floor suite on our honeymoon. I'd never expected skylights and a full view of all the islands of Venice! Close to the water bus and yet far enough away that you don't hear all the dock noise. This place was charming and quaint, perfect for a getaway from the hustle and bustle of tours on Venice. The staff were polite and truly helpful. Still amazed at how many languages they speak fluently and handled every request and question with grace. The only draw back we had was there was no stand up shower, only a tub and a stool to sit on to shower with. The sloped ceiling of being in an attic made it difficult to bathe, but we made do.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Panorama offers friendly, attentive, helpful, and honorable staff. The rooms are very clean and comfortable offering peaceful and cozy decor with well-maintained furniture and bathrooms. This hotel is located directly across the street from a docking station for water taxis and water buses making it extremely easy to access with luggage. It is also within walking distance of many excellent shops and restaurants. The island of Lido is a short water taxi ride from Venice and offers a much more relaxed evening environment than the main island. Members of our family have stayed here in the past, and their experiences were the same as ours. Excellent!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed for 4 nights. It was our first trip to Venice and after the 1st day touring the city, I was so relieved that we had chosen to stay in the much quieter and peaceful Lido. We had requested a room with a view over the lagoon to Venice and that's what we got. The view was amazing. The room itself was lovely and very clean. The only slight complaint would be that the shower cubicle is tiny, but it was adequate. The hotel staff were very, very pleasant and nothing was too much trouble for them. The hotel is only a short walk from the beach where we had a lovely, quiet day. If I return to Venice I will definately stay at Hotel Panorama again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It is a very nice hotel, placed at Lido Island, closed to Lido Vaporetto-stop, from which it is possible to reach Santa Lucia main railway station in 45 minutes, and San Marco in 20 minutes (day and night connections). Room is elegant and comfortable, and sights to the Venice Laguna are good, although a new Vaporetto-stop is being built just in front of the hotel. Second floor is therefore recommended, as in the first one sights are not so good. Breakfast is basic, not very varied for a 4-stars hotel, and internet connection is not free. Price is good in comparison with other hotels in Venice, but Venice itself is not a cheap city. Probably I would come back to this hotel, and I would recommend it for any visit to Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our recent stay in Venice, before a cruise, started with 2 great days at the Hotel Panorama. It is very easily accessible by vaporettos, which stop 100 feet from the hotel entrance. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Our room was on the small side, but we had a nice view of the lagoon. We had a nice complimentary breakfast buffet every morning, which included juices, coffee, tea, pastries, fruit, breads, yogurts and more. They recommended a few dining options and each turned out wonderful. Unless you have a real need to be on the island of Venice, save the money you would have used for more expensive hotels and use it on tours or dinners. It was well worth the 10 miunute vaporetto ride to us. Thanks to the great staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here in September having stayed in Venice itself in July and found the hotel to be just what we expected. All the staff wer very friendly from the moment we checked in. We booked a superior double because the web site said it would a view across the lagoon towards St Marks square. We were not disappointed as the reality was just that. The room was spacious, well appointed and had everything we wanted. The hotel is near local restaurants, being just a stroll away and with the Vaporetto station being just across the road made getting to the Venice island and Murano/Burano very easy. St Marks sq is just 15 minutes away and the Vaporetto runs every 10 minutes till late at night. We would certainly come back to the Hotel Panorama on our next visit to Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel is about 15 steps from the water taxi station and has excellent views of Venice in all her splendid glory. You don't need to struggle through 5 million tourists to get around the hotel either, because it is located on Lido, which is about 10 minutes from the Piazza via waterway. An added benefit is that you can drive here from the mainland via the ferry, so there is no luggage issues (drive right up and drop off). Tour director brought us here and it was well worth the cost. The room is decently sized with good internet access (10 EU for 24 hours of access), soft bed, and clean bathroom. The AC doesn't work all that well, so be prepared to open windows at night to cool the room down. Breakfast is included in the bill, but is of the cold variety, so don't expect much.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a lovely hotel with great staff. Clean, quiet and wonderful breakfasts. Stepped straight off the boat and walked into the hotel just a few yards away. Ticket offices right there too. The beach just ten minutes walk is an added bonus with relaxing music being played at the beach cafe that served snacks and wonderful hot chocolate. We were there in February for Carnival. It was cold but sunny and we had just the best time. Good restaurants and snack bars near by too if you do not want to pay Vvenice island prices. Went on a tour of off the beaten track Venice too with a half hour Gondolar ride and Hot chocolate again thrown in for about Â£32.00 each. This was brilliant. search the web and book before you go as this is much cheaper than sorting it out when you get there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved staying on the beach Island of Lido. It was away from the huslte of the main tourist area and the 6 cruise ships docked in Venice! The front door of the hotel is just across from the boat "bus" system to Venice. It is a short, beautiful ride to the tourist area. Our room was older but comfortable. There were few unused electrical outlets to charge our phones (due to them being used for SKY TV). The wifi is NOT included in the price of the room but is available. We had a wonderful view of Venice from our room window. The bathroom was clean. The front desk was always helpful with questions about schedules etc. We enjoyed the roof deck. It too looked out onto Venice. The breakfast was nice; tea, coffee, juice, cereal, yogurt, meat, cheeses, pasteries hard boiled eggs, toast etc.</p></li>

They were friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived. Unfortunately my husband was ill after our first day and spent the remainder of our few days break in bed. Our flight was not until the late evening but the hotel offered to move us to another room (ours was booked) between check out time and flight so he could stay in bed. They charged us no extra and booked us a water taxi and personally carried our bags to the stop to help us on our way. Would definately stay there again - hopefully in health next time.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was the ideal base for our first visit to Venice. The location couldn't be more convenient with the vaporetto stop right across the street and direct connections to the airport, St Marks, the Grand Canal and Murano. The staff were friendly and helpful, the breakfasts were better than the norm, and the view across the lagoon to the city skyline from our second floor room was well worth the premium price. Our only problem was that we were wakened during our first night by the loud banging of the window shutters which had come loose during a freak summer thunderstorm. Securing them in the face of the driving wind and rain proved to be impossible which led to a very disturbed night. So, keep an eye on the weather forecast and secure the shutters before retiring if it looks like there's a storm brewing!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I really like staying on Lido because it is away from all the tourist attractions of Venice. Lido is a beautiful little island just across the waterway from Venice. It is an easy water taxi ride to all of Venice. Our hotel room was large with a skylight and open window to enjoy the evening breezes. The room was well appointed with a jacuzzi and shower and a separate room for the bidet and toilet. Our breakfast was included and it was a bit dissapointing as the coffee was from a Nescape instant coffee machine and was terrible. They had an espresso machine, but did not offer it although I asked for it once. For Italy, espresso should be the coffee served, not instant. The hotel staff was helpful, yet reserved. They were always availble to make suggestions and help us with trying to get our airline tickets printed out.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We satyed in room 203 for one night and it was a nightmare. That room had a partial view of the water and at night time it was super loud. The room was small and the TV didn't have CNN or any english channel. We were up most of the first night and in the morning we asked if we could change rooms. At first the lady at the desk said they only had a suprior room facing the water. Then some other guy asked us a few question and spoke to the lady and decided to change our room. The second room was quite and the TV had the English channels!! The breakfast was Ok, OJ was awful and a couple of times we found dead flies in our glass. The staff was helpful, but next time I will not stay in Lido. The weather was cold and windy, so we were forced to stay in at night. We had lunch at Trattoria Favorita (Lido) our first day and the food was Ok.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed in Hotel Panorama for two nights. It is located on the island of Lido, which is just across from the main center of Venice. While it's kind of a hike from the train station (take the #51 vaporetto - ~45 minutes), it was only a 5-10 minute vaporetto ride to San Marc's square and the rest of Venice. It was very quiet, and Lido is a cute little town - has a beach, and some more affordable shopping and restaurants. The room was very spacious, as was the bathroom. Fairly modern and felt very clean. At first I was alarmed as the heavy drapes did not pull across the windows... I'm a light sleeper and wake with the earliest light - but then we realized staff had come in and shut the wooden shutters, which made the room very dark. :-) Quite a relief. Over all the Hotel Panorama was a perfect find for our brief stay in Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend had booked our first trip to Venice as a surprise for my birthday, I was pleasantly surprised by his choice of location and everything else he had arranged. Hotel Panorama (HP) is in an excellent location, the waterbus stop is right across the road and the main street with shops, restaurants etc is around the corner up the next street. The staff are all very welcoming and always there for advice and tips on what to do, where to go. The room was nice and spacious with a decent sized bathroom, we stayed in room 207 on the 2nd floor. The view was lovely from our room, we could see right across the lagoon. As other reviews state, it is nice to be across the water and away from the the mainland, with only a short ride on the waterbus. All in all the hotel is in a great location and I would highly recommend it to all, we had a fabulous stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My parents and I stayed for three nights at the Panorama and loved it. We had booked a triple with and inside view, but because our room wasn't ready when we arrived, the staff kindly upgraded us to a triple with a view of the beautiful Venetian lagoon. The marble bathroom was clean and beautiful, and the decoration was simple but with everything that we needed. A few downsides are that it takes an extra 10-15 minutes to take the boat from the center of town to Lido, but the waterbuses run all night, and we didn't find it to be a problem. Bottom line is, compared to the exorbitant prices of hotels in Venice, I highly recommend the Panorama. One tip is that there appears to be two websites run by the hotel; we found a cheaper rate on the Italian version of the site (there's an English translation link on the site that will convert everything to English for you)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiancee and I stayed at the Hotel Panorama - and it was brilliant! It was a very special day for us as I 'popped the question' on the way from the airport to the Hotel. The hotel manager Sabrina was amazingly helpful to organize EVERYTHING - from the private watertaxi, to the flowers and the prosecco. Sabrina and her colleagues made our stay perfect with their organizational skill and local knowledge (good restaurants, things to see etc). The hotel itself has everything you need - for a fraction of the price of similar hotels in Venice itself. And as others have said before, it's kind of nice to escape the craziness of Venice. We stayed in the Junior Suite which has really nice views of San Marco and the bay. It was clean, nice, not huge but well sized for Venice etc. In summary, a perfect stay - and thank you Sabrina and colleagues for making it so special for us!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Panorama for 6 nights from 17th July. Great location, easily accessible into Venice. The beach is gorgeous (15 euros per couple) for sun loungers and umbrella and during July really quiet. We stayed in Room 209 which was lovely with partial views to the lagoon and St Marks. The air conditioning worked but was not great. We ate most nights on the Lido and as previous reviewer said if you would like a really nice restaurant such as La Favorita, then book ahead. We ate at the Bounty Bar a few times which is on the other side of the Gran Viale, really simple but great food. DONT EAT at the restaurant next door to the hotel (to the left as you come out of the hotel front door). Food was below average, service terrible but they still added on 6 euros cover charge and 6 euros tip. Panorama staff are extremely helpful and I wouldn't hesitate on staying here again.</p></li>

She was so helpful and always made time to answer questions and give great tips. The rooms were very spacious for Europe. The location was awesome. Arriving from the airport was so easy. We got on the Lido taxi and as soon as we arrived at the Lido stop, we could see the hotel. Lido was a great area full of locals. We never felt unsafe in Venice and on Lido. The beach was very close and nice. The only con to this review would be a restaurant they suggested on three different occasions, the restaurants was overpriced and horrible. Itâ€™s on the main street, its white on the front with a large cover outdoor sitting area. The hotel hands out their business cards. Venice is beautiful, but be smart about where you eat and shop. Weâ€™ve been all over Europe and Venice is by far the most expensive place to shop and eat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I highly recommend Hotel Panorama. I stayed at Easter 2011 and just arranged for my parents to stay there at Easter 2012. The staff recognised the connection and allocated my parents a lovely large room with views across the Lagoon to Venice. The hotel is located opposite the Lido water taxi/Alilaguna station and close to the main Gran Viale street. The hotel is clean, comfortable and offers superb value for money. The staff are very friendly and helpful, they will provide you with maps and tips and also arrange for a private water taxi to take you to Murano to visit the glass factory if you wish (free boat ride and no obligation to buy anything). We stayed 2 nights in the heart of Venice and then stayed 2 nights here on the Lido to escape the hustle and bustle of Venice. The beach is lovely and it is fun to hire a tandem bike to explore the whole island. I will return to Hotel Panorama for sure.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Panorama - great hotel with fantastic views”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Panorama thoroughly deserves the good reviews it gets on this site. The hotel was literally a walk-in straight off the Alilgiuna water bus. It was spotless and all the staff very friendly and helpful. We asked for double superior and our room was at the front of the hotel with a fantastic view over the lagoon and St Marks. There is also a really nice terrace area with the same views. Some reviews have commented on the noise due to the hotels waterfront location. This is fair comment, but the noise is not excessive and can be avoided by keeping the doors closed and using the AC. Ther lido is generally fairly sedate and has really nice beaches. It is cheaper than central Venice and only a few minutes by the vaparetto bus, so a really good location. Our only criticism of the hotel was that fresh coffee should be served at breakfast rather than through a machine. Overall, great hotel and good value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our first trip to Venice and the Panorama stands out for TripAdvisor ratings and value. Whilst not on the main Venetian island, the hotel is next to the main water bus stop on the Lido island and is therefore well serviced by both vaporetto (for local hopping around the city) and Alilaguna (e.g. Airport transfer and inter island travel). All the staff were pleasant, helpful and courteous despite my mangling of their language; all the front desk staff had excellent English and I heard fluent sounding German and French too. Our standard room (301) was very clean, quiet, of a decent size and had the usual facilities; a marble tiled bathroom was a surprise though the jacuzzi bath was starting to look a bit past it's best. Breakfast is of the buffet type we expected and modest in quality. Overall the Panorama well deserves the praise of the other reviewers and I consider it to be great value and well worth considering.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I stayed at the Panorama Hotel and it was excellent. We stayed there for 2 nights and since the first day we got to the hotel we realised all staff were very friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and well experienced.Our room was facing the Lagoon and it had a fantastic view of Venice. Morning breakfast was very nice with lots of options. The Panorama has an excellent location in the lovely Lido Island which is only about 10 minutes by vaporetto from Venice, the transportation for the different islands runs every 10-15 minutes.Only two minutes from the hotel you will find a lovely boulevard with shops, nice restaurants in a very relaxed atmosphere. I currently work as a Travel Consultant in the U.K. and I strongly recommend to stay at the Panorama. We had a lovely time in Lido. Thanks a lot to Eugenio who provided us with an excellent customer service and made our stay very pleasant, we hope we can go back to Panorama.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose the Panorama after comparing the Trip Advisor ratings for Venice hotels. What a perfect choice. We fully support all the positive comments by previous visitors and were glad we paid the little extra for a superior room overlooking the lagoon (room 104). This room had fabulous views to the front and side as it was on the corner. Staff were friendly and very helpfull and I suppose I could just repeat what others have already said, however one further piece of advice:- Buy a 3 day vaparetto pass and use it to your advantage. Take the No. 1 all the way up the Grand Canal and back again. Then take the No.52 all the way around the island of Venice. Great way to see the sights. Make sure you use your vaparetto pass to jump on ond off at the best sights and it is extremely good value for money. Forget the extravagant water taxis, they don't know what to charge. Fabulous city, great restaurants, brilliant hotel Highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just came back from spending 3 night there. We had room 303 which is in the top floor. The room was big and clean, so was the bathroom. The only downside the this room is that there is no shower, only a tub. so, if you don't like baths, this is not the room for you. The staff was great always willing to help and answer questions. The location, is great best decision! it is quite and has easy access, way better that the noisy streets of the center of Venice. It was great to spend the day in Venice, and then take the vaporetto to the Hotel. Transportation is super easy and you cant miss the hotel from the vaporetto stop. this is great when you have your suite cases. it is also, easy to get to the airport and train station. Breakfast was great, plenty to choose from and the girl that works the breakfast room is super nice. Tip: buy the vaporetto ticket for the length of your stay, it will save you a lot of money from the individual ones.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I guess depending on where your room is located, you might have a different experience. Our windows faced the piazza. The noise from the people getting off the boat lasted way into the night. Then at 3 or 4 AM a boat started circling around. I kept praying it would leave, but it continued. Even my trusty earplugs didn't help. So if you're deaf, this hotel is PERFECT for you. In addition, when we first arrived (this was our honeymoon) we were given a tiny, dark room on the lobby level, 10 steps away from the front desk. Room number 11. Since we hadn't seen any of the other rooms, we thought this was standard, however, decided to inquire about other available rooms. Hesitantly, the guy gave us a room on the second floor. HUGE difference. It even had a bidet, whereas the first floor room hardly had a shower (hole on the floor). So that made me angry. But once we were in the upstairs room, we had no problems at all, with the exception of the noise.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked three rooms with lagoon view for one night. The first thing that I would say is that the staff are extremely friendly & helpful. I would also comment that the Hotel is one of the cleanest in which I have stayed, I would have no hesitation in staying again. The location is really good. Being based on Lido you get the fun of the vaporetto journey which is great. The view over to Venice is superb. The only criticism I would have is that as the Hotel is so close to the water taxi station, you do get constant noise of the boat engines & local buses throughout the night. I think it would be a good idea to get some kind of secondary glazing to cut this out as I did find it quite hard to sleep. As a tip to other guests - take some earplugs and I am serious about that. However, this minor point would not stop me from staying here again. We found the rooms & bathrooms to be fitted to a good standard & the accomodation to be good value for money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went to Venice for the first time for our 40th Wedding Anniversary. The hotel is ideally situated, directly opposite the Lido ferry terminal. Quiet, stylish and unpretentious, it proved an excellent base for our visit. The room was comfortable and elegant. A mini bar was provided. The room was quiet and the bed large and comfortable. A full continental breakfast was included, with a stunning view across the lagoon Huge liners glided past as you munched your cereal. All the staff were very helpful and efficient, in particular the receptionists, Eugenio and Franchesca. The Lido is on the edge of the Lagoon a ten minute boat ride from St Marco's. Ferry tickets of various duration can be purchased at the terminal and give you access to all parts of the lagoon. There are shops, restaurants, a beach and pleasant areas to walk within easy reach of the hotel. A haven away from the bustle of central Venice. A bonus is also that you arrive at St Marco's by boat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Panorama - although it's been over a year since we travelled there, I still have the fondest memories of Hotel Panorama.. staying on the Lido was definitely a good choice, as we were away from the hustle b ustle of Venice, yet had the vaporetto (water bus) system taht ran all night long, so we could go and do whatever, and whenever we pelased! The hotel is so easy to locate, as it's literally by the water bus stop. The room was spacious, comfy, and had a lovely view.. the hotel has a terrace, where you can have breakfast on a sunny morning. There are good transport links from the Lido, and staff are v v v helpful in all aspects, and helped us work our our journeys. On the Lido itself, there are a few restaurants that offer food for much cheaper prices than in San Marco. Commuting daily to San Marco was lovely, as the view is awesome every time! I think 4nights was adequate for a stay in Venice - we got to taste the loca culture, food and walk all over Venice in this time.. what fun!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">having spent 3 nights at hotel panorama we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We only stayed in a standard room but even this was very comfortable, with all the extras you expect, a very good heating system in the room and a great view from the window overlooking the waterbus station and the lagoon. The reception staff were very friendly and were eager to ensure you enjoyed your stay and offered plenty of useful advice on places to eat on lido, waterbuses and the main attractions in the main part of the city. Breakfast was served till 10 so it wasnt a case of having to get up early each day and the selection of food was fantastic (and the coffee was delicious!!) After getting to grips with the waterbus timetables and routes, the fact that we were staying on an island away from the touristy bit didnt prove to be a problem; we enjoyed a nice walk to the sandy side of the Lido where there is a beautiful beach, which was very pleasant even in mid december!! We would definately recommend staying at hotel panorama! :D</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently stayed 1 week with my two kids (aged 7 and 9). Lido Island was the perfect place to anchor and do day trips into Venice. There was the beach (10 min walk) from the hotel with umbrellas and chairs with beach towels (note: cost is 10 euros per adult, children free. Access fees to beaches for chairs and umbrellas is common in Italy. This cost is less at the hotel than if you buy it at the beach access entrance). The view from our room 106 was spectacular! well worth the cost. Wonderful continental breakfast and Eugenio, Davide and Sabrina were great hosts always willing to suggest ideas. Word of caution: Parking is very limited. Do tell them if you will be parking and tell them when you will be leaving. Parking is free. Will not repeat the positive points already mentioned other than to say that they are accurate. Prices are considerably lower for restaurants on the Lido....the beach resort of the Venetians! If you are travelling with kids, this is the place to be. And yes, there is air conditioning and it did not smell!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">All of the above, with a certain caveat. The hotel has a very limited number of lower priced rooms and you probably don't want them, ie, right off the lobby (noisy), handicapped shower, etc. We booked a standard room and it wasn't what we expected. The staff immediately offered to move us to a nearby hotel or change our room the next day. We changed the next day to the garden, quite lovely. The hotel has been remodeled with double paned windows and wooden shutters which close fully at night, making it quiet even though it is located at a busy spot, just across from the Vaparetto stop. The hotel was very clean, breakfast was fine and the view from the terrrace not to be missed at sunset, especially if you can toast one of the large cruise ships on her way out. We stay on the Lido when in Venice as it is not as madding as in town with the bazillion tourists. It's only a short vaparetto ride into 'town' for dinner, given that the Lido restaurants are more casual. Plus Lido hotels are about half the price of the ritzy in-town digs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Panorama is very conveniently situated just opposite the Vaparetto stops on the Lido. This means you can start the day with the most stunning vista in Venice as you approach make the crossing from Lido to the main island, whilst you are somewhat away from the tourist throngs. To get to/from Marco Polo airport you can take the #5 ACTV bus from the Piazzale Roma and then boat to the hotel - this is covered if you have the ACTV day ticket. Or you can go directly to/from the airport to Lido by boat, but this will cost you 16 euro with luggage. The hotel has a very nice rooftop terrace from which you can see across the lagoon to the the main island. The bedrooms are comfortable, have minibar, room safe, aircon and Sky TV. The bathrooms look like they've been recently refurbished and are very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a decent continetal spread, with croissants, bread, ham, cheese, yoghurts, cereals, and some cakes. Just ask for freshly made coffee of your choice. All in all a good overall package.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at this hotel at almost 2 a.m. the front counter staff (Stefano) accomodated us, he was so kind to help us with our luggage and walked up the stairs himself (a true gentleman). We had a very clean spacious, quiet, and lovely room. After a trip from Paris (which was gross) seeing the Italian hospitality and loveliness of their people was refreshing. During the day, we were helped by (Eugenio) also at the front counter who helped us with places to see in Venice. We recommend this hotel for anyone who likes to enjoy Venice by staying at a clean, comfortable and quiet hotel with excellent staff members, it is just 15 minutes away from the main part of Venice which is easity accessable by the water taxis that run till late hours of the night. A note of caution about Italy in general, don't ever take taxis from anyone who approaches you, they are a rip off and not actual taxi drivers. Taxi drivers are not allowed to do this, so they just wait at the stations for you to go to them, they always have a meter and are honest. ****LOVE ITALY****</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Myself and my girlfriend stayed in the Panorama Hotel on Lido Island for 3 nights. This hotel is an ideal place to stay for visiting Venice. The hotel is just about 100 meters away from the boat stop on Lido and ideal for catching the boat over to Venice (10 mins to Marks Square). The hotel room we stayed in had a beautiful view of the lagoon over to Venice. The room was standard size and very clean. The staff were very pleasant and helpful if needed. The breakfast was continental with a nice selection. I would definately recommend staying in this hotel and on Lido. It is only a few minutes boat ride from Venice Island and an escape from the Hustle and Bustle at peak season. There is also a beautiful beach on the island. Venice is a must see as it is such an extraordinary place. We really enjoyed the few days. There is loads of places to eat in Venice and on Lido (less expensive on Lido). Transportation is also very good and easy to use whether coming from the Airport or just visiting Islands around Venice. I highly recommend this Hotel and a stay on Lido.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose this hotel based on the fact that there was a safe and a hair dryer in the room and that breakfast was included. When I booked I didn't realize that the hotel was on the Island of Lido to the east of Venice proper. I was kind of nervous about this because I was thinking that we would want to be in the city center instead of on the outside. I was so wrong! Lido is just a 15 minute vaporetto ride to St. Mark's, and the vaporetto stop is right outside the hotel, so getting anywhere is very easy. The hotel is a short walk to the BEACH. Yes, the BEACH. We walked down on our first day and had rum drinks, with our feet in the sand. It was a nice way to end our ten days in Italy. The staff, particularly Nicolo, were wonderful, suggesting places for us to eat, and keeping us updated on the vaporetto schedule, as well as the Alilaguna boat to get to the airport very early in the morning. One highlight of this hotel...the terrace. We had cappuccino and pastries on it in the afternoon, with gorgeous views of Venice. This hotel is a gem, and I would go back anytime.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here in early October, soon after the beach and film festival seasons had ended. The hotel is a modestly sized building, like most in Venice, although the neighborhood has quite a different feel, being on the Lido. Absolutely no complaints about our stay--the room was clean, comfortable and as it was a (recommended) junior suite, spacious. The included breakfast was limited, but quite good. Venice is an expensive place to stay, and the Panorama is not inexpensive. Yet it is a good value compared to similar hotels in the central area. The trade-off is having to take the vaporetto every day, but aside from it being a boat, it's not much different than taking a bus in other cities. Moreover, the Panorama is located within a block of a major vaporetto terminal, which makes getting to the city and the airport--and moving luggage--exceptionally easy. Hotels of similar quality with that degree of accessibility in central Venice are much more expensive, so on balance the Panorama is a good value. I would definitely stay at the Panorama again, and I absolutely recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner recently booked a surprise holiday in Venice for my 40th birthday! As it was the height of summer and probably the busiest month to visit Venice, we booked the Hotel on the small island of Lido. What a choice!! The area was clean, quiet and beautiful with a gorgeous beach on one side of the island and the views of Venice on the other. It was just a small water bus or taxi ride away from the streets of Venice. The hotel itself could not have been situated better with perfect views across the Lagoon from both the bedroom and sun terrace. The breakfast was more than plenty with a huge choice of different foods available. The rooms were large and extremely clean. All the staff on Reception where so pleasant and all seems to go out of their way to help and advise with any queries/transport questions etc regarding Venice. As our flight was not until late in the evening and as we needed to be checked out by 12.00noon, the staff were so accomodating looking after our luggage and letting us change at the hotel. I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone looking to visit Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Panorama surpassed my expectations - it was so convenient - just across the road from the water bus stop. It was also a complete contrast to Venice itself, being quiet and peaceful. I booked a hotel on the Lido on recommendation as the hotels in Venice itself tend to be overpriced and the rooms very small. Our double standard room had a partial view of the lagoon and was clean and comfortable. The breakfasts were generous with plenty of ham, cheese and eggs, pastries, assorted cereals, fruit, juices, etc. Thankyou to Francesca and Eugenio on the desk for their patience - they were so helpful with their advice and directions and even booked a table for us in a restaurant in Venice. We walked across the Lido to the beach when we arrived, a mere 10 minute walk - and hardly anyone around. The trip into Venice every morning by waterbus was a refreshing treat, and the journey home at night a pleasure as we watched all the palaces lit up by chandeliers. Venice is a magical place and to see the city skyline from the Lido every morning was a real delight - in fog or sun, it is simply stunning.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked the Hotel Panorama through Expedia in the UK on a farily late deal. Firstly, the transfer from the airport to the Lido is about an hour and can be longer if you get an old Aliliaguna not the new ones. The Hotel is right in front of the boat stop so don't be worried about finding it. The staff were excellent at all times, friendly conversations willing to help and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are a little small but very clean if not a little cold with no obvious way of heating the room up. I think this is a rouse to get couples closer so they keep warm and with such excellent views across the Lagoon, who can blame them. There was a little work on the building going on while we there but it was very substantial and only woke us one morning. The breakfast was sparce in choice but get there early enough and there is plenty to fill up on. There were all the facilities you can need and it's location is a great selling point as you can see the hotel as you come across the lagoon in a water bus. Our tip is that a travelcard is must, and can be bought at the boat stop in front of the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved this hotel, mainly because of its location. It is on Lido Island and is a lovely distance from mainland Venice. Lido Island is a lovely place to escape to after looking around Venice all day. It has plenty of fine restaurants and shops. The boats run you across to venice or anywhere else in no time and it is a pleasureable experiecne, and all part of the fun I think! There is also a lovely terrace in the hotel that one can sit on and look over across the water at Venice. The staff in the hotel are so nice, they really try to make you feel welcome and are so helpful with information, directions etc. The room itself was a bit small but perfectly clean and comfortable. The air-con was difficult to get right though and that would be my only fault of the hotel. We stayed in april so this may have been worse if we had stayed in june. But perhaps it was a once off issue as they do have air-con and it did work a little just not enough for us. The breakfast was excellent, lovely fresh fruit and cakes appealed to me! It was the usual continental breakfast but did the job and we were full most of the day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just stayed for two weeks at this hotel while taking a photography class. The view of Venice every morning (from my balcony!) was wonderful, and the location right off the vaporetto was perfect. I didn't have to lug my bags very far, and found it quieter and more fun to be a step away. I know the Grand Canal sounds romantic, but I know I wouldn't have slept as well with the noise. That said, there was construction right outside the hotel, but it was quiet at night and fun to watch the Italian crew work during the day! Another guest had trouble opening and closing her shutters, so ask for help - they lock open and closed! There is a restaurant right next door that is delicious (try the seafood zuppa). Breakfast at the hotel is well stocked - Stella is very friendly and will make fresh cappuccino if you ask! Sabrina and Eugenio are a big help at the front desk during the day - a wealth of information, and I always felt safe with Francesco and Nicola at night. The Wifi was very cheap - 10 euro for 24 hours lasted me two weeks as long as I logged out! Roomy bathroom - standard size room. I want to go back!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When my husband learned that he had a conference in Lido, and that we would be spending 6 nights on the island, he immediately began an extensive search into hotels there. Happily for us he chose Hotel Panorama. The hotel is wonderful. Outstanding staff members Eugenio and Sabrina made us feel at home, were extremely helpful with all of our questions and requests, and made each one of our interactions feel like conversations with old friends. They are great people. Our room was very clean and well appointed, with complimentary internet access. We had great views of Venice across the lagoon from our corner room vantage point; the breakfast was very good as well. The temporary work being done directly across the street did not bother us. I am extremely sensitive to noise, and for me the hotel was quiet and peaceful, with a great location, within half a block from the â€œvaporettiâ€� boats to Venice, and also next to the center of town. Lido itself was a delightful surprise, and whenever we returned from the hustle and bustle of Venice, we felt like we were coming back to our oasis. We recommend Hotel Panorama most highly.</p></li>

<li>I am extremely sensitive to <span style="background-color:#A00000">noise</span>, and for me the hotel was quiet and peaceful, with a great location, within half a block from the â€œvaporettiâ€� boats to Venice, and also next to the center of town.</li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Have just returned from a long weekend in Venice where I took my husband for an anniversary treat. It is the most romantic place and as someone who doesn't always write reviews i felt I had to let others know how we found the hotel. I had checked TA before booking and kept coming back to this hotel. It is ideally situated, the staff are fantastic, especially Eugenio who you will see during the day. We did upgrade rooms when we got there as I could not have stayed without seeing the views of the lagoon. Breakfast is what it is a cold buffet, great chocolate croissants, tea and as much toast/cereal as you like and again the views from the dining room mesmerise. If you fancy having a bit of fun hire a double bike from the shop just behind the hotel, took a lovely gentle 2 hour ride round the island and saw the beach albeit closed. The vaporetto is just across the road and took 10 mins over to Venice, you can then walk ito the centre which is flat and takes about 10 minutes, otherwise stay on it and get off at St Marks.Would I go back to this hotel is always a question I ask myself and it is a definate yes for the Hotel Panorama.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Panorama - 18th - 20th March. We arrived early and our rooms were ready. The hotel is on the lagoon front right by the waterbus stop, which is a blessing after a long day sight seeing. The hotel is very clean and well maintained, staff were exceptional providing maps, excellent recommendations for local restuarants etc, breakfast had a wide range of fresh produce - fruit, cereal, breads, croissants, cheeses, meats etc. The rooms would be considered 'cosy' by USA standards, but they are clean and comfortable, you could see the whole of venice from the loo too! We found no inconvenience with staying on the lido, it made a nice change from being in the city, the number 1 bus provides a 10 minute service and they are on time. The hotel also orgainsed a trip to a glass factory in Murano for free, we then stayed on the island and shopped, They have some wonderful glass jewellery if you are on a budget. From here we then caught a ferry to Burano where the lace is made. Here we found some great deals on silk scarfs all very original. Burano is very pretty and colourful. From here we caught the ferry back to the lido. An excellent day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel purely on Trip Advisor reviews and we were not disappointedl. Many comments refer to a poor breakfast, but ignore them, there was lots to choose and all fresh each morning. Our room was very spacious and clean, with an amazing view over the lagoon. We spent some evenings on the terrace watching the sun go down! And travelled back into venice in the evenings to enjoy the orchestras in St Marks square. It was nice to stay on Lido and to leave the hustle and bustle of Venice behind when weary from sightseeing and the heat in July. The vaporetto takes only 15mins from san marco to lido and stops only a 100m or so from the hotel. The beach is good and only a short walk from the hotel about 20mins. The vaperetto is a great way to travel into venice and to do this each morning into san marco was great. i recommend to anyone, if you want to go on a gondola, do it late in the evening (me and my husband went on one at 11pm) it was the most amazing thing we have ever done, it was like having the city to ourselves expensive (100 Euros) but well worth it! Overall the hotel was excellent, the staff were helpful and Lido is a great base to enjoy venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 3 nights in August, booked very late with the hotel direct (cheaper than other websites) and they were still able to provide free parking and a lovely cot for our daughter. We had a double room, it was light and airy, huge bed, plenty of space even with the cot, small tv, clean shower room, everything you needed to sleep comfortably-we didn't spend time in it other than that! Breakfast was continental, nothing exciting but very good for a small European hotel. Terrace looked nice with view over the sea, but we didnt use it. Perfect location at the waterbus terminal for 10min journey to San Marco. (33E per person for 72hrs and toddlers and buggy free). Round corner from main street with restaurants etc and 5-10min walk to beach (worth paying 10E each at the hotel for parasol and loungers (toddlers free again). 2min drive to car ferry from mainland (74E for Audi A4 and 2 adults, toddlers free). Cheaper and more convenient than leaving car at mainland car park. Overall, really great place to stay in Venice, especially with the beach close, more summer holiday than city break. The staff were all very friendly. I'd stay there again if we return to Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and the Fiancee went to venice for 3 nights in January for a break, after doing extensive research, i decided on trying this little family run hotel on Lido, Well when we arrived we were delighted to have chosen this place, the hotel staff were so friendly and the breakfast was excellent choice. we had a lovely room up in attic with jacuzzi bath and views over the lagoon to Venice it was really nice to visit venice in January when it was quite quiet compared to the busy times, although i will add it was only about 3-4 degrees when we were there, so if you are visiting at that time of year take a jacket and gloves and scarf!! Venice itself was beautiful. wonderful shops and some lovely little cafes by the main canals and some good bars just to sit and watch the world go by. it was really nice to be back in Lido at the end of the day with all the locals and just try and blend in and have a few drinks in there bars away from the crowds. There is also some nice restaurtants in Lido, and it was much more reasonably priced than right in the centre of Vennice for food and drinks. Overall i cant fault anything about hotel Panorama and Lido and Venice, we will definetly be returning.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are going to Venice, stay on the Lido. It takes you away from the fabulous chaos of Venice and offers a relaxing retreat. It is wonderful to come back accross the lagoon and see the lights twinkling on the water in the evening. You are in the lobby of the hotel after 1 minute of getting off the "vaporetta" - perfect!! There are cafes and restaurants seconds away that offer everything from a delicious pastry with an espresso or vino to amazing restaurants. We had e-mailed back and forth with Sabrina on several occasions. She went out of her way to answer our questions and re-assure us that we would have a perfect holiday and we did! We felt like we were going to meet up with an old friend and it was fantastic to finally meet with her in person. I have stayed in many hotels around the world and never been provided with such a warm, welcoming and gracious service. I also have to hand it to Eugenio who we only met on a couple of occasions, but was also extremely helpful. We will go back to Venice and we will stay in this hotel every time without hesitation. I can't imagine anyone ever having anything negative to say about the hotel staff, amenities and service provided here, it is second to none.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a way to end our 3-week vacation in Italy. The Panorama Hotel is a little gem located on Lido Island where the tourist crowds are thin and food is wonderful. We arrived in Venice by train to an exciting storm of rain, lightening, and thunder. It was such a wonderful experience stepping out of the train station into what appeared to be a travel commercial...what a surprising and sudden change. Although it was an exciting first time in Venice, we were anxious to check into the Panorama Hotel. Upon reaching the hotel's front door and despite being drenched, we were warmly greated and helped with our baggage. The warm hospitality never ended. The staff are welcoming, friendly and exceptionally helpful. We could not have chosen a better hotel or location and the ever-friendly staff made the capping of our vacation all the more memorable. Our room overlooked the Venice Lagoon, which is a view worth the extra cost. The room was large, as well as the bathroom. There's Internet access and the breakfast was something to look forward to every morning, but the highlights are definitely the friendliness of the staff, comfort of the rooms and it's close proximity to the ferry stop. We definitely recommend this fantastic hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice hotel. Beside the waterbus station. Beware of the safe.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is on the island of Lido which is about 15mins from the main Venice square via waterbus. We were initially offered a ground-floor room beside the breakfast room and near reception which had no view at all. We were offered an upgrade to a first-floor room with a stunning view for â‚¬15 per night. The staff were friendly and spoke excellent English and the breakfast was a typical European breakfast (meats, juices, cereal, bread-rolls and coffee) ... tasty! But beware of the safe in the room. It locks with a standard (easily duplicated) key and the key-barrel slips right out into your hand when you fully turn the key. We asked a receptionist about this and he said that this is a safety-feature ... so that the safe is permanently locked until you replace the key-barrel ... Not true ... I easily lifted the safedoor-latch with a pen and the door swung open. Needless to say, we lost all confidence the safe and chose not to use it. Overall, it's a very nice hotel if you can get a room with a view. It is right-beside the waterbus-station which costs â‚¬6.50 for a 60min ticket and Venice square is only 15 mins away. Also, Lido is nothing like as touristy or expensive as the main Island which is a big, big thumbs up! And the beach is a 15min walk from the Hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in Hotel Panorama for 4 nights in December 2007.Even though i booked through a third party website, the hotel emailed their own confirmation of booking with detailed and helpful directions from the airport. When we arrived, we were greeted very warmly. Our bags were taken promptly to own room and we were shown round the room. Complimentary coffee was brought to the room, then 15 minutes later reception phoned the room to check that everything was OK. The staff were always the model of professionalism - friendly, helpful (free guide book, free maps offered without asking). Breakfast was a basic continental selection of breads, meats and pastries, but always fresh and tasty. Our double corner room had 2 walkout balconies with a great view across St Mark's Basin to Venice. It was warm, very comfortable and very cosy. Don't let the Lido location put you off. The waterbus is literally 30 seconds away from the hotel and takes you to Venice in less than 15 mins. Food is superb on Lido and cheaper than in Venice itself. Tip - Buy a travelpass for the number of days you intend to be there and you get unlimited waterbus rides around all the islands at a discounted rate. We plan to visit Venice next time in the summertime, and will definitely be staying at the Hotel Panorama.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Our own little Island of Lido, 15 minutes from Venice and Murano by waterferry”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Panorama was located in Lido, Italy about 15 minutes from all the main sites in Venice and Murano Island areas. However, it was pretty cool staying away from all the hustle and bustle. Lido is a town of its own and about 80% locals. Not very tourisy, and not much siteseeing. The waterbus stopped right in front of our hotel which was nice. A few steps away and you are on your way to hop on the local waterbus and exlpore all the sites on the map (Murano Island/Venice). The hotel was nice, not spectacular but unique. A little noisy since the waterbus stops right near the hotel. Breakfast was A+++! Nearby restaurants were ok. We went in mid September and it was chilly, definitely need some warm layers/coat. I just brought one fleece jacket....not the best way to pack. The only negative thing i would have to say is location. It was cool to stay where the locals are, but it seemed far on the waterbus touring around. Plus it was cold. Also, the worst part was getting to the airport to leave Venice, it took about close to an hour. Best part of our stay at Panorama was that they offer FREE taxi to the island of Murano. Free glassblowing demonstration. You can buy more affordable stuff after the demonstrations, there are tons of cool stores to buy nice glass at reasonable price.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have just returned from a 4-night stay with my husband and a friend in the Hotel Panorama. I strongly endorse all the positive comments about the hotel. Eugenio and all the other staff were helpful and pleasant - always with a ready smile and a friendly, good-humoured exchange of banter. They made excellent recommendations for restaurants within easy walking distance for dinner each evening (we particularly enjoyed La Favorita). The rooms were spotless and carefully serviced each day and it was a nice touch that someone came in and closed the shutters for us before our return each evening. The hotel was extremely quiet at nights and we slept very soundly - not surprising, given our boatrides, gallery visits, opera performance, etc!!! It was not a problem that the hotel was on Lido island rather than nearer St. Mark's. The vaporetta stop is so convenient and it is very advisable and economical to organise a 3-day travel ticket online with venice-connected in advance. Breakfast was plentiful, with fresh strawberries and other fruit, in addition to a range of breads, cheeses, ham, hardboiled eggs,youghurts and cereals. The breakfast room was overseen by a young waitress who anticipated what was needed and refreshed supplies quickly and efficiently. I recommend Hotel Panorama unreservedly.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 4 nights in October 2010. Location is excellent as it's 30 seconds from the waterbus stop at the Lido so cheaper than staying in the centre of Venice. Room was clean, we had a superior room overlooking the lagoon so the view was looking over at Venice from the room. They are working on the waterbus stop outside the hotel at present which was the only drawback as work started at around 7.30 to 8 each morning but this didn't detract from our stay as we were up around that time anyway. No bath, only a shower which wasn't huge (I'm 6' 2" so I like big showers!!). But it did the job and was quiet at night with the shutters closed. Breakfast was excellent, continental style with a choice of bread, yoghurts, pastries, fruit, criossants, tea, coffee etc. The staff are helpful and advised about which waterbus to catch etc and advised the best time to catch the Alilaguna back to the airport and you can leave your bags there if your flight isn't until later. No 1 waterbus is every 10mins across to the main part of Venice and you can get a waterbus back at any time to the Lido although obviously less frequent the later you are. Plenty of places to eat on the Lido too if you want to come back near the hotel for dinner. Would definitely recommend this hotel or stay here again if I was lucky enough to go back to Venice.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A few weeks ago, my wife and I wrapped up our Italian Honeymoon in Venice at this wonderful hotel. I wanted something special for her because this was our last stop in Italy. Eugenio at Hotel Panorama made this dream come true. From the moment we arrived they treated us like king and queen. Eugenio knew prior to our visit that it was our Honeymoon (via email), so he gave us the best room there (204 I believe) which overlooked Venice from the top floor. He also arranged a bottle of champagne in our room when we returned from the first night. He did all of this with a smile and he even refuse a tip, and I tried forcing it on him twice. Eugenio made our stay, he even told us where to get the best gondola ride and not to pay over a certain amount. He has all the inside scoops. As for the hotel, it was brilliant. Staying on Lido is a million times better than Venice. To get to Venice you just take a 5 minute water taxi. On Lido you can relax and avoid all the crowds. Their free breakfast was by far the best we had in the 3 hotels in Italy and the breakfast room has the best view of Venice in the morning. Be sure to dine at the restaurant a couple blocks away on the main street. Eugenio recommended it to us and it was the best Italian food we had on the trip. We ate there 3 times over two days. If you are going to Venice stay here and water taxi into Venice. It is beautiful and the best way to experince Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was in Venice from 7 to 10 of may 2011 and I choose hotel Panorama Venice. PLUSES: 1. Located on Lido island is providing a peaceful and quiet enviroment away from the tourists crowds in Venice. Still only 20 minutes away by vaporeto to San Marco square ( vaporeto are comming every 10-20 minutes) Number 1 vaporeto is stopping at every station but there are much faster ones like 52 which are stopping only at main stations 2. Hotel is very clean an recentlly renovated. 3.Is located just accros the vaporeto station so you won't have to drag your luggage trough long narrow streets like in Venice. 4.Price /quality ratio is ok 5.Staff is polite and helpfull. Minuses: 1. Breakfast is not very diversified ( no warm food at all -like scrambeld eggs or ham) 2. Rooms are rather small but this is normal in Venice. 3.Beds are ( as in most of the hotels today) not made for people over 1.80 meters , so if you are taller the 1.80 meters expect to sleep with your feets hanging from the bed. 4.After booking trough venere.com the accomodation in this hotel I find out that on the hotel site it was an offer for birthday holiday (it was the case for my wife) including special price and â€¢A bottle of Prosecco served in room â€¢Rose petals lying on the bed â€¢a special birthday cake I would expect them to make a nice gesture and to offer those facilities even if I wasn't aware of them when I made the booking on venere.com ( the special offers are not available on booking site)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed there for 4 nights with our two children. Since we were on a small road trip round northern Italy, Lido is the place, since you can bring your car along. The Hotel is spotlessly clean and the service and welcoming you receive when arriving leaves you elevated for several days. We got a room on the third floor with a double bed and two sofa beds, where you could overlook the lagoon all the way to St. Marks, when standing two steps. Fantastic view, we stood there every afternoon, enjoying a glass of wine, when we were back from Venice, having a siesta. The main Vaporetto terminal is just a one minute walk away, so we could easily get back and forth between Venice and Lido - which meant that we even could go to Venice in the evening for dinner - together with the kids - since we were never far away from a Vaporetto stop. The Main shopping street on Lido (Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta) is just close, here were restaurants, shops and cafÃ©s. There are an - extremely small - parking facility at the hotel - they asked kindly if they should park the car - I would recommend that you let them do it - there can be squeezed 3-4 cars in there, but then be sure that you have all your gear in your room, and don't need anything from the car, it will be impossible to get to. Breakfast was fine and you could get special coffees if you wanted to. Everything was very nice here - especially the service, which made us feel welcome from the very beginning and during the whole stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My parents and I stayed at Hotel Panorama at the Venetian Lido for four nights in July 2008. We have already booked to stay five nights in July 2009. It is our first choice hotel for Venice. My favourite view of Venice is that from the Lido across St Mark's Basin towards St Mark's Square. I am not aware of any hotel that can provide a better view of this than Hotel Panorama. The view from its 'superior' rooms and terrace is simply stunning, especially when there is a colourful sunset. In addition, it's interesting watching all the water-borne traffic on the Basin, ie waterbuses, watertaxis, private boats, ferries and cruise boats. The Lido is only ten minutes away from St Mark's Square by waterbus. And Hotel Panorama is right beside the waterbus stop. Venice is a city where the mode of transportation is by boat. Accordingly, I like getting into the spirit of things by using the water-borne transportation. To me, Venice is one of the most fascinating cities in the world. It is unique. Venice gives tourists the opportunity to enjoy history, culture, museums, historical buildings and churches, music and casinos. However, it can be very busy. After a day exploring Venice, it is nice to retreat to the Lido which is quieter to relax. Hotel Panorama also sells vouchers to a private beach. I think they were 10 euros. The hotel rooms and bathrooms were spotlessly clean and very nicely decorated. My parents and I were very comfortable. The hotel staff were excellent. Very professional but also very friendly and helpful. My parents and I are very much looking forward to returning to Hotel Panorama next July.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said already! Hotel Panorama is a fabulous hotel in a gorgeous location with helpful and friendly staff. This was my first trip to Venice and I decided to stay on the Lido; mainly because it is slightly cheaper than staying in central Venice and because it has a beach, which I thought my teenage son and I would appreciate after a hot days sightseeing! We stayed in Venice for three nights and we bought a 72 hour pass at the airport, which enabled us to use the buses and the vaporettos for our entire stay. Word of warning though; this does not include the 'water-taxi' from the airport (Marco Polo) to Venice. But that wasn't a problem. We boarded Bus 5 which took us to Piazzale Roma and from there we caught a vaporetto to the Lido. On our return home we did get the 'water-taxi' from the Lido to the airport, for which we paid 12 euros each. Venice is spectacular and certainly lived up to my expectations. We did a walking tour (around 2 hours) just to get our bearings. The tour also included entry to the Basilica and an optional boat trip to Murano afterwards. Make the most of Venice, don't rush from one 'site' to the next. Venice is heaving with tourists all year round; pushing through the crowds will only lessen your enjoyment of such a beautiful city and raise your blood pressure too! Slow down and enjoy it. Although I thoroughly loved Venice, I have to admit that one of my favourite experiences was hiring bikes on the Lido and spending a few hours exploring the island. The roads are safe and virtually car free. If ever I get the opportunity to return to Venice I would definitely stay on the Lido and at the Hotel Panorama again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel for my boyfriend's birthday. Our room was upgraded to a junior suite for an additional 25 euros a night, which seemed very reasonable considering the amazing views we had of the lagoon. The room was large and clean and the little balconies were lovely. The staff at the Hotel Panorama were incredibly helpful and accomodating. My only regret is that we didn't stay longer than the weekend, but in the future, I won't stay anywhere else in Venice. We especially enjoyed utilising the terrace for breakfast (I can't really understand why anyone would choose to remain in the breakfast room when there are such amazing views to take in). The waitress knew immediately what we wanted and provided us with a tray so we could take our food and coffee upstairs. We also enjoyed a bottle of wine one evening on the terrace - no one said anything about us bringing our own, although we did also buy some beers from the bar. The 3 day pass (25 euros) is great for exploring Venice. We took the number 1 all the way up the Grand Canal and the number 52 around Venice - a great way to take in the sights. The manager at the Panorama recommended the Trattoria Favorita on the Lido for dinner and made the booking for us and drew us a map to find it. We had a great meal there on the Saturday night, sat outside in their garden and the scampi ravioli was amazing. The actual food in Venice wasn't brilliant (we ate pizza for lunch both days) but that restaurant was special. It was wonderful to explore Venice and then be able to return to the Lido to chill out. The beach is definitely worth checking out as well. It's only a 15 minute walk and the main street is lined with shops and cafes. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Venice.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having never travelled to Venice, we wondered how easy this Hotel would be to find considering the main source of transportation is a "vaporetto" (water bus). We need not have worried, you come out of the airport and the signs to the waterbus are very clearly marked right to the stop. It's an hour ride to the Lido which is breathtaking to say the least and as we come into the lagoon the Hotel Panorama was lit up like a Christmas Tree - Beautiful!! It took two minutes to get off the waterbus and into the hotel lobby. The staff here speak excellent English and are very friendly and helpful. My partner went down to the lobby to request an extra pillow and the Concierge got back to the room with pillow in hand before my partner did!! Our room was light, airy, spacious and immaculate with panoramic views over the lagoon and the bathroom all Italian marble and well lit with shower and bidet. The breakfast buffet was a smorgesbord of hams, cheeses, pastries, pates, yoghurts, cereals, toast and fresh rolls to name just a few and free to guests. It was lovely to leave the wonderful chaos of Venice behind of an evening and head back across the lagoon to the Lido with all of it's shops and restaurants. Very, very romantic! They are building a new "vapoertto" stop outside the hotel which would mean that if you stayed in a room on a lower floor, you would lose the view across the lagoon while the construction is in progress, but we had upgraded to a room on the second floor and our views over the lagoon were panoramic and un-obstructed. I think anyone with anything negative to say about this Hotel must be mistaken and of stayed somewhere else!! This Hotel has it all and is excellent value for money. 10 out of 10 Hotel Panorama, We would not stay anywhere else!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is superb - a great choice when one considers service, location and the value it offers. I was a guest not a number, felt so esteemed by the hotel staff and management. On day 1 was given a ground floor room near the reception when the hotel was full. As soon as more hotel rooms got free Davide from management offered me a change of room. That was appreciated. An upgrade! Moreover, this hotel is recommended for its location. It is just opposite the berthing station of the Lido. There are boats going to Venice day and night. There are restaurants, bakery, supermarket, many shops and the bus station right around the corner. There is a market at the Lido too which offers local food products, fresh fruits and vegetables. Thanks to a suggestion tip from the receptionist Francesca had the opportunity to visit and enjoy. Moreover, the personal service that these people offer is wonderful. Just got suggestions to visit non-touristic sites too. Davide suggested Chioggia which has been an excellent suggestion despite the rain â€¦ must visit an off the track sites too. Davide even phoned a place which is not open to tourists. The availability of these people is marvelous. What can I say about breakfast! It was generous. There was a choice of hams, liver pastes, cheeses, sliced bread and rolls, crackers, jams, honey, chocolate spread, juices, teas, coffee, water, yoghurt, boiled eggs, fruits, croissants. Cannot but praise the choice of food that this hotel offers for breakfast. Much appreciated service and friendliness â€“ special thanks goes to Davide, Francesca and Giulio who are very helpful, polite and caring. Thanks goes also to the ladies doing the cleaning and serving breakfast. Till now the Panorama Hotel was the best hotel I have been to in Italy.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Fabulous Hotel and Location!!!!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Mom and I stayed at the Hotel Panorama for three nights - July 10-13, 2008 - while visiting Venice. I cannot fully express how wonderful our stay was!!! First off, we were originally concerned with whether not staying in actual Venice was a mistake, however, we quickly discovered that staying in Lido was definitely the way to go! Lido is a very short boat ride away from Venice (not to mention the water buses are right across the street from the hotel), and has a much more casual and less touristy feel. We found Venice to be sooooooooooo busy that it was great to get away from the crowds at the end of the day. Another nice thing about staying on Lido is that the food and especially the drinks (not just alcohol, but also soda) is considerably cheaper! In restaurants in Venice it is not uncommon for Cokes to cost 8 Euros! The hotel itself was very nice, and the breakfast (which was included) was wonderful! The staff at the hotel was exceptionally helpful. We were given a map, good directions, suggestions of places to eat, etc. Staying at the Hotel Panorama also allows access to the private beach in Lido. For 10 Euros, we were able to get access to the beach, our own umbrella and chairs reserved for the day, and beach towels. We really enjoyed the beach! Another plus of the hotel is the roof top terrace from which you can get views of Venice. Even though the hotel does not have a restaurant, there is one right next door that has good food for reasonable prices. The only complaint at all is that the room was not the biggest one we have ever stayed in, however, the furnishings were nice and the bed was comfortable. Also, the bathroom was spacious and nice. Overall a wonderful stay! If going to Venice again I would definitely stay in Lido, and at the Hotel Panorama!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved, it Loved it, Loved it..... Having spoken to a friend who had been to Venice a few months prior to me planning our trip, she advised me of the expense on the Island of Venice itself for poor quality and service. She advised to look on Lido or one of the surrounding Islands...I compared this hotel to others and it seemed to be offering a good rate for a good quality. In particular the breakfast surveys for most hotels are shocking..I have to tell you that my mother and I were not disapointed. On the contrary, Breakfast was lovely. A choice of cereals and juices, yoghurts, granola and fresh fruit are on offer...Bread for toasting and an array of bread roles and crackers....fresh croissants from plain, chocolate or almond and a cold meat selection including cheeses and fresh boiled eggs...all eaten overlooking the lagoon and out onto the tower of St Marks Square. Before we arrived I had lots of correspondence with the hotel and the team there where friendly and very helpful from start to finish. There is a lift which is great when you've been travelling all day with a heavy case and the hotel is directly opposite the vaporetto stop so no lugging your suitcase for miles once you're off. It was great to get the water bus back to the hotel after a long day of sight seeing (Which takes about 10-15 minutes tops) and look back at the picturesque view of venice, and then relax in a quiet, slower paced and less noisy surroundings. About 45 mins to an hour from the airport by waterbus... A really great stay - only one thing that could have improved our stay, the beds were a little hard...this is easily rectified with one of the blankets out of the wardrobe! The team also advised of great restaurants on Lido and help us with lots of bookings for concerts, boat tours and other activities...clean, bright, great service....ideal. Would recommended highly... ****************</p></li>
