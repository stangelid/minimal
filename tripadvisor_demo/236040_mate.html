Also the botel is a bit outside of city centre which was ok for us but you should take it into consideration before booking. Although we were not really dissatisfied with anything in particular the botel does not offer great value for money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I would describe it as cheap and cheerful. If you want to spend a couple of nights in Amsterdam for low cost it ok. I think some of the reviews are totaly out of order for the price you pay they are expecting a 5 star hotel for 2 star prices. The rooms are more like cabins as you may expect on a boat. It an easy walk to all parts of the city and it is quiet. There is a bar on board and basic breakfast. It a bit like a floating Ibis.</p></li>

The room was basic but good value for money and very clean. We found the breakfast very fresh and a good choice. I have no complaints about the hotel, the rooms are tired but who cares when you are in Amsterdam, we only went back to sleep !! The staff were excellent and very friendly.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here with friends August 2003 and found it to be ideal for the budget-minded. Location is good - you can see it from the entrance to Central Station, no need for taxi. 5 minute walk to centre of Amsterdam. Lets face it, we didnt come to Amsterdam to spend more time in our room, so if what youre looking for is a cheap, convenient roof over your head, then I think the Botel is great, if youre after the Hilton then go spend lots more money elsewhere. Would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Found the Botel very convenient for all the main sites and "attractions". Rooms were basic but clean. Had no problems whatsoever with the staff, in fact hardly saw any staff. In house movies were easily accessed ( Channel 35 in our room) and certainly set you up for the attractions. Breakfast was more than adequate ( eat and drink as much as you like)- we didn`t pay supplements for anything. All in all a basic , clean base if you are staying a hazy couple of days in Amsterdam.</p></li>

The Botel is simple, spotless and right on the door step of everything. I went in October of this year and all 8 of us had a fantastic time, and we are all in our 40,s and 50,s. We paid Â£62.00 per night but that was sharing, so we each paid Â£31.00 per night, which I think is pretty reasonable. If 8 women between the ages of 40 and 50 can enjoy it, then everyone will.

Also we stayed water side so I don't know how much noise would be heard if you stayed roadside with all the roadworks, but we didn't hear it at all...

The bathroom is small, but ok. The bed, is advertised as queen size, but they fail to tell you that its two beds together, with a hard wooden area betweem each half. The staff were fine amd pleasent. The location of the hotel is excellent to the city centre. The breakfast is good with a choice of hot and cold. Overall, We would rate it 7 frm 10. Its good value overall.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Amstel Botel, what can I say? Cheap no frills hotel in a central location a few minutes boat ride from Amsterdam Central Station. We have been there twice now and knew what we were getting into as far as the hotel goes. Cheap, no frills and located well. Dissapointing though was one member of staff, an Asian lady who was very ignorant with ourselves and 2 other sets of customers that were there waiting to get sorted. Think she was having a bad day or sometihing, we all do but still no excuse for the behaviour.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This floating hotel has decent rooms with very narrow bathroom; my room was not very clean, in particular the bath. During the night you can hear people shouting in the hallway and of course a very deep smell of cannabis. I didn't really like that one day, early in the morning, a staff's member suddenly broke into my room without knocking... The new position is not very close to the central station, so you have to take a ferry (20 mins.) to get there. If you are looking for a peaceful place to sleep, try another one!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The only thing negative i can say about this hotel is it was a bit of a nightmare to check in, lots of people and rooms not ready. Its in a perfect location if you dont mind a short ferry ride back and to from the hotel to central station. The free shuttle ferries do stop just after midnight after then you have to get the shuttle bus. The rooms were clean and comfortable and even had channel 5 on the TV!! Breakfast was basic but very nice. Yes the boat does rock slightly but you do get used to it. I will most definitely be returning this year.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have already written a review of the Botel based on a previous stay. I decided to go back in March. Unfortunately, I lost my credit cards en route - probably at the airport. The receptionist could not have been more helpful in getting them cancelled, to the point of helping me with my Dutch over the phone while I spoke to Customer Services at Schiphol Airport. What could have been a very stressful situation was ameliorated by his friendliness and professionalism. When I got home a week later, new cards were waiting for me at my local sorting office. That's all!</p></li>

The hotel staff were efficient and professional, not much chance to build a rapport but helpful and professional. The hotel location was great very central to all main attractions with great transport links. The hotel was basic but clean and comfortable. It was a great hotel to choose for a short city break as location and value was excellent. If you looking for something with a bit of atmosphere and satff interaction then i would avoid this hotel.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not a bad place, but not great either. Amstel Botel had a decent location. The complimentary breakfast was slightly above average. The beds were fairly comfortable. The staff was friendly and helpful, exceeding my expectations to some degree. However, the price (considering how worn out our room was, and how tiny the bathroom was), make it difficult to perceive the value at this property. Also of note, the nearby construction can make sleeping past 8am difficult. There are better places to stay in Amsterdam, for less money. While I don't regret having stayed at the Botel, I would have difficulty recommending it to a friend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a 3 star floating hotel next to centraal station. So the carpet is a little worn and the decor is a little dated, but its clean and functional and the staff are fantastic. So, you can't sleep with the window open as you're right next to the station. But get this right - you are RIGHT next to the station. You'll never loose your hotel, all the taxi drivers know where it is and you're right in the centre of town. The staff went out of their way to be friendly, chatty and helpful. The breakfast (although expensive at E10 - it wasn't as expensive as some!) was great. For a budget stay I would highly recommend this Botel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hi I stayed at the Amstel Botel for 2 nights in September. The rooms are basic but very clean and great value for money. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The location is perfect only 5 min walk from Central Station and 10 min walk from city centre. So very close to everything yet the botel is on a nice quiet canal if you are somone looking for a nights sleep. The only thing about the hotel is the food they do have a breakfast area but besides that you will have to walk over to the city centre for even the small things like tea or coffee. If they hotel had a small menu it would be very handy. Other then that great little hotel. Kathy Ireland.....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked stay between 15th to 17th October. Location good, close to Central Station (5 min) and City Centre/Dam Sq, (10-15 min). Rooms, (or cabins) clean and tidy, housekeeping very good, staff friendly, especially in bar. However, accommodation is basic and cramped, with little room between beds and dressing table! Toilet/shower room very tight for space. Location very noisy with continual trains passing and extensive construction sites nearby. Be aware when booking, most hotel search siites offered inclusive breakfast but booking through Botel's own 'availaibility & reservations' site does not provide this! It is mentioned in their 'rates' page at 10 euros. Be warned</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed once again on the botel from dec 29th to 2nd january for new year. Had a great time again. OK the rooms are small but who the hell stays in your all day when in amsterdam. Great bar, staff great apart from one guy who is a bit miserable. It's only a 5 minute walk from central station & a 5 minute walk to the bars etc if you know the short cuts!! Never had the breakfast as i prefer a long lie and head out to a bar to get a decent breakie. A bit of a disapointment for me is the botel is moving on the 7th january to another spot over the water to north amsterdam which is a fair bit away so i'm a bit upset as this will be my last time here. All in all a great place to stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel in Amsterdam,this is for you. The location is excellent,2 minute walk from Central Station,10 mins from Dam Square. There is some building work going on behind the botel,however only during the day,quiet at night.Rooms are basic but clean and have a small en-suite with shower.Having talked to a few of the locals, many of the hotels in amsterdam have no private facilities!! This alone gives the botel an advantage.The breakfast is also pretty basic but caters for all tastes. Across the road from the botel is a brilliant mexican restaurant called the "Guadalupe", this is well worth a visit and is very handy if you are staying in the botel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was happy with the desk people and satisfied with the room. Coming back late at night can be a bit indimidating due to the long, relatively isolated walk to the "pier thingy". My only complaint was with the microscopic restroom, in which one has to virtually squat sideways under the sink in order to use the toilet. The shower was quite rusted, and the tiny bathroom quickly turns to a sauna when showering. But after all, this IS an old converted cruise ship of some sort. I was a bit surprised to turn on the TV and find XXX porn playing 24 hours a day, but I suppose that could be a bonus. Might not want to leave the kids unattended, though, if you're the sort that brings children to Amsterdam.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I went to Amsterdam twice and stayed at the Botel once. I am thinking of going back again and I will choose to stay at the Botel again. The other hotel I stayed at - I had to carry my luggage (a lot) up the stairs into the hotel (it was a 3 or 4 star hotel) myself. No one helped. At least at the Botel there was a ramp to take your luggage up. It is a busy place but very friendly and you cannot beat the location. Right by the train station and across the street from a "coffee shop". Everyone was friendly and I fed seagulls french fries from my window. It has atmosphere!! Can't wait to go back again. The price was right. Although the rooms are small - they are clean and "do-able". I am not a kid - 57 - but I like this place!</p></li>

The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially the bar man. Breakfast catered for all tastes, with plenty to choose from. Although the botel is located a little distance away from the central station (city area) we had no problem travelling to and fro as the ferries were running frequently and only took 10 minutes The shower is a little on the small side (not recommended for anyone over 5'8" or 12st), but again, very clean and well stocked with towels, etc. I would recommend a trip to Ikea as our pillows were a little on the lumpy side. I can recommend this hotel, and will certainly stay there again in the near future</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Botel for almost a week during IBC conference last week. First impression : the room was small, a floating tobacco smell, apparently clean. After one night, some of my colleagues reported water overflows in the tiny bathroom (shower problem) but even worth, after two nights, one of my colleague started itching and couldn't sleep for the remaining nights as he endured an intense itch. We are just back from Amsterdam and his doctor just told him he got "scabies", probably due to inefficient bed cleaning. Then, there's the very noisy environment of the Central Station. On the plus side? Breakfast included and OK. Friendly staff. So it's probably worth spending a few extra bucks and skip this "less then OK" Hotel</p></li>

The room was fine, Clean and tidy The bed was large (or maybe the room was small so it just felt large) and not uncomfortable The shower had good preasure and was clean and tidy Breakfast was great with a selection of cold meats plus all the normal stuff, bacon eggs,toast etc Overall, uniquely worth it</p></li>

<li>The room was fine, Clean and tidy The bed was large (or maybe the room was small so it just felt large) and not uncomfortable The shower had good preasure and was clean and tidy Breakfast was great with a selection of cold meats plus all the normal stuff, bacon eggs,toast etc Overall, uniquely worth it</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Amstel Botel, Amsterdam Date. Returned 26 March 2007 Just had a wonderful weekend in Amsterdam, Amstel Botel very comfortable, ideal as so close to central station and city centre, no need to taxi or long walk to the canals, bars, etc. Accommodation very clean, bedroom adequate, shower a little small but hell its only for a few days. Staff very polite, breakfast was very good, bar a bit smokey but the Dutch tend to smoke anything so get used to it. Sited next to Sea Palace chinese restaurant which is a must for an evening meal, best chinese we have ever had. If you are thinging about using the Botel do it, excellent value for money, remember this is a capital city hotel, we paid about Â£ 78 per night inc. continential breakfast.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We definetely enjoyed looking out our window onto the water and seeing a Russian Sub from our room. The rooms are tiny but you have to remember, you're staying on a boat! We would have done it again for the novelty but if we visit again we will stay somewhere that doesn't require taking a ferry everytime you want to get over to the mainland area. The ferry's run about every 30 minutes but after midnight you have to take a ferry to a different spot and the hotel shuttle comes to pick you up from there (you just call them when you get there). It wasn't a big deal just a bit of a time inconvenience. The breakfast bar here was good and always full. The front desk even made a point to bring us coffee the morning we left and were waiting for the shuttle!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hey, I'm not sure what all the fuss is about, we picked this hotel on price and we got what we paid for. Dont get me wrong its not a palace but it was clean, tidy and warm and to be honest if you where expecting something grander then check how little you paid and think again. The rooms are basic but livable. The location is not that bad, the free public ferry leaves from behind central station and leaves you off about 150 metres from the Botel, cant see what all the crying was about. Lazy arses me thinks. The use of the mini bus for collection when returning home a little worse for wear in the early hours of the evening was hassle free. There is a very nice restaurant / bar situated at the end of the quay where the Botel is docked. Dont think anybody has mentioned that as yet.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We visited Amsterdam in February 2012. We stayed at the Amstel Botel and it was better than I expected it to be. The botel itself is not far from the central train station; there is a free ferry boat that takes you directly to the botel. The ferry boats run until midnight daily and there is a free shuttle bus that drops you off outside the botel after midnight so the service is excellent. The only downside in my opinion was that we had twin beds instead of a double bed. The bed wasn't the most comfortable bed ever but I've slept in worse!The room itself wasn't very big but it was clean with its own shower and toilet which was my main concern. Breakfast was included in our stay which was lovely! Highly reccomended. We can't wait to go back, we'll definately be going again this year.</p></li>

The Botel itself is o.k. for the price , the rooms are small as you would expect the bar was quite and the breakfast was no very good the t/v had many channels to choose from, our bathroom quite often had a very severe smell from the drains and poor drainage in the shower , the staff are very pleasant overhauls I would not stay again mainly due to its location 1.5 hours a day wasted travelling to and from , but it quite good value for your money</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed here twice with my partner and found it to be ok for what we paid, especially as breakfast was included in the price and there is a lot of choice including hot food. I didn't pay a lot either time and wasn't expecting too much so I wasn't dissappointed. There is certainly nothing special about this place but I have stayed in worse for the same sort of money so I would say as long as you look around to get a good price and you just want somewhere to put your head down it's fine. The shower/toilet room was very cramped and could definately do with some re-decoration as there's was mildew in the corners. The whole place would benefit from a refurbishment but no doubt the price would go up if that happens. The staff weren't over helpful or even really that friend either time but they do their job.</p></li>

The beds are really uncomfortable, the matress isn't nice, nor are the pillows and the bed linen looks really cheap and old and has a stale smell. overall Cleanliness is acceptable but not impecable. My biggest problem was having no thermostat. Room would be either cold or you turn the heater on and it becomes boiling hot overnight, the in-house entertainment such as the tv, and the bar is all rubbish. Also the bathroom was tiny and the shower would flood causing the whole bathroom floor to become a puddle. Sound proofing between rooms and the corridor didnt exist. However the staff were freindly and helpful (but all the locals in amsterdam were). The view is also not very nice. on one side theres a rusty old submarine in the river and on the other side there's an industrial estate.</p></li>

To our surprise they had no water supply so we had to wait till the evening to take a shower. We were put in a 3rd floor room which was ok but we had the view at the back of the boat, this consisted of overflowing drainage & construction work. The breakfast was really basic & nothing special. Luckily for us, we asked for a room change & got it. A strange thing happened while we were changing rooms. My partner left a bag in the room & i left a cleanser. When we realised, we enquired at the reception & she told that nothing was left in the room. Bet the cleansers really enjoyed my $60 cleanser! The rooms are really small & compact, not to mention the showers!! I wouldnt recommended to anyone. Its not worth the money, staying in a hostel would be less costly and you'll get the same thing!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Do not stay here! Our family was booked to stay 2 nights and ended up staying 1. I think that since the Botel has moved to its new location it has gone downhill and is rundown and tired. It was like cheap student/backpacker accommodation The ferry service is good between the train station and the Botel, but the location is horrible. Industrial docklands â€“ bleak and stark with nothing around it . We knew we were staying on a boat but the rooms were very small and ordinary- cheap, vinyl/plastic â€“ extremely dated. A bathroom so small you could barely get in there!!! And it all just felt grotty! The bar area and dining room were very ordinary too â€“ cheap plastic furniture etc. It was probably alright to stay at when it was close to the train station because of its location. But now it has no redeeming features! For the price we were paying the quality should have been a lot higher.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Have just returned from Amsterdam - stayed at the Amstel Botel - had a lovely room on the top floor, overlooking the canal. Room was very clean with a nice view - bathroom a bit of nightmare, especially if you suffer with claustraphobia - staff OK - some need to exercise their face muscles and try smiling - Breakfast not up to much - food lukewarm, possibly cooked and then stored in a hotplate for quite awhile before it was served. Overall, good value for the price paid - it isn't a five star, but you are not paying five star prices! Ideal location, especially as our flight arrived in Amsterdam at 21.00 - The Botel is within walking distance of the Centraal station and easy to find - about 5 to 10 minutes walk. Would definitely stay there again, but don't think this would be the ideal place in summer when both the city and the Botel are busier as I don't think it would be as peaceful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Amstel Botel is nothing special. But I was happy I stayed there because it was right next to Central Station in Amsterdam. After a long flight, we were fighting jet lag. It was also our first time in Europe, so we really needed a place like this that was so easy to find. Believe me, after a long flight, the last thing you need is the stress of trying to find your way around the streets or figure out the public transportation system. Take a nap first! Not only was the Botel right outside the station, if we were ever lost trying to find our way home, we could just ask people for directions to the station. If you've been to Amsterdam before or you think you'll have no problem finding your way around, there are plenty of other cheaper, more comfortable places to stay. But if you're a first-timer like me, I highly recommend the Botel for the first couple of days until you get your bearings.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading some of the reviews on here I was nervous about our booking for July 07. I needn't have been. It was great. I still can't understand how our experience could have been so different from some of the other reviewers', except to assume that they thought they'd be staying in a higher-end place??? It's clean, it's simple, it's functional and it's comfortable (some of the best pillows I've found on our trip). We chose the bay side for both our room and our teen children's and it was probably a wise choice because it gives one something interesting to look at during down times (and is perhaps less noisy given the construction on the other side). We had little interaction with the front desk people and only had a brief visit to the bar (working men's club). No, it's not luxurious, but it had everything one needs for a comfortable (and clean) stay. We'd definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I found the hotel to be very average with some problems that need to be considered before you book the hotel. 1 You have to pay up front even before you see your room then try to get anything changed or attended to, you will find it hard. 2 Hope you get good neighbours who will have consideration for other people when they return to the hotel in the early hours of the morning. The walls are so thin and flexable they do not kill any noise. Again when you complain you get negative feedback and very little help. 3 The bathrooms are all in need of very big facelift. They are moldy and smell unpleasant. I don,t think I would stay at the Botel if I returned to Amsterdam and I would say you should consider very carefully if it is the sort of hotel you want. All I would say it would suit a stag or hen party then they could make all the noise they want and everyone would be in the same boat (pardon the pun)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked in February asking for a non smoking room, if possible on the canal side. When we arrived, we were given a regular room, on the other side (the station side). We stayed there for 2 nights and it was hell. At the reception nobody wanted to know anything pretending the hotel was full. We didn't sleep at all, the noise of from the trains arriving in the station and from a construction site located just in front of the hotel was huge. The rooms are tiny as well as the bathrooms and the ventilation is bad. The breakfast was ok. Do not go to the breakfast room before 8 am or you will find the old bread and croissants from the day before. We payed the full price without knowing that a huge construction was in progress just a few meters from the hotel. We weren't informed by the reception and this is inacceptable. Our advice: try and find another hotel in Amsterdam, this one doesn't deserve a stay.</p></li>

There is no air conditioning in the rooms, when we were staying it was about 30 degree but we were able to keep cool with the window open.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was ideal location and excellent value. Come out of the rear of the central station, walk to the far right of the pier and the ferry to the botel is approx 8 mins. The boat itself is stuck out in a bit of an industrial type area but it's clean, comfy and ideal enough to lay your head close enough to central Amsterdam. The rooms were cleaned all the days we stayed. The showers and bathrooms were small, ship cabin like but you get what you pay for. The room was warm and the bed comfy. All I want when staying in a good value place! The breakfast was plentiful... Cereal, toast, fruit, yoghurt, croissants.... Again, excellent value. After reading some reviews, I was expecting a bit of noise but it was very quiet at night. We did ask for a double room rather than a twin which is allocated as standard when booked online but the staff changed our room on request... Cheerfully! Lovely pleasant staff. Would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we found the botel suited to what we needed for our trip to amsterdam, a place to rest. as there is so much to do, we did not find the need to spend a lot of time, but when we were there, there was a nice level of comfort, but if you do like a plump pillow, take your own. the breakfast was ok, luckily we did not have to pay, if we did we would have gone out earlier. it could be better organised, but for a small staff team, they do their best. there is nothing to do around the botel, but a free ferry service, 15 min peak 30 min off peak, will take you to amsterdam, you get off just behind centraal station (it is the furthest to your left to get back to the botel). on a last note, be aware of bikes, mopeds and small cars, they use the ferry too, and take no prisoners if you are in their way. for a budget hotel, you cannot complain, because at the end of the day you get what you pay for. although the use of the bathroom is an experience in itself. :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Amstel Botel is cheap and cheerful. It's a very simple little hotel in the form of a boat. If you suffer from severe motion sickness then it might not be ideal. The hotel itself doesn't move but you can occasionally feel the water beneath the floor boards, which gives a feeling of movement. The hotel was clean and comfortable, although the shower wasn't particularly great - it was incredibly small. The bar/restaurant wasn't very good, but that didn't really bother us since we were eating out everyday, I was happy with the hotel overall and would certainly recommend it to those on a budget. Nonetheless, I probably won't stay there again myself as I'd quite like to try somewhere different and possibly stay a bit closer to the town centre (it wasn't far but it was a boat ride away). Having said that, this was my first time in Amsterdam so for all I know this is the best place there is for that price - other hotels might be awful in comparison. Who knows.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The beds were a bit too hard, the room a bit too drafty, not enough hot water for everyone, and not enough pillows were placed in the room to begin with. When I first entered the bathroom, there was [-] in the bottom of the toilet outlet, barely visible but obviously there. Other than that the toilet was clean. But I liked it! It was clean, provided plenty of soap for both the sink and the shower, and had a wonderful breakfast with bacon, sausages, slices of cheese, cold cuts, eggs, French toast, syrup, orange juice, apple juice, coffee, I think tea, and I think there was other stuff; I might have forgotten something. The breakfast was included in the price. There were so many of us in my school group that some people got the canal view for no extra cost. There was enough room in the rooms to move around in. It's near a lot of hot spots. I recommend it; I give it a passing mark! The whole "boat" thing makes it somewhat unique. Nice lobby, nice restaurant/bar.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I agree with a lot of what have been written here about the Botel. It's a good, not great location. The rooms really need some urgent renovation. Besides the decoration being ugly, there are lots of stains at the walls and ceiling, speacially in the tiny bathroom. Not pleasant, but bearable. The breakfast was good and the staff very friendly. The lobby offers a nice cooffe bar with jukebox, pool table, darts, internet and is an interesting place to hang around while resting between rides through the town. The best feature for me and my wife, although, was that our room was almost at the level of the canal water. A complete duck family (male, female and 3 little ducks) seem to live around and got close to us looking for food. We just needed to open the window and make some duck-like noise, and there they came. If you love animals, that may be something to miss about afterwards. If they completely renovate their rooms and bathrooms, we will be glad to stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had read some mixed reviews for the Amstel but it fitted in our budget so we went for it. Cracking Botel! Yes it could do with modernising but its clean, rooms were a reasonable size (considering you are on a boat) and the location was good. The ferry to get here is free and runs frequently from the central station. Staff were all very friendly, especially helpful after I had fallen and badly hurt my foot whilst out in the town. The breakfast was great, just what you need to start the day, good selection of breads (& croissants if you were there early), cereals, juice tea & coffee and all the meat and cheese you could stomach first thing. Plus a cooked section with boiled eggs, bacon & sausages. Some folk had complained about its location but I thought it was great, I wasn't visiting Amsterdam for the crazy nightlife so quite enjoyed being able to get away from that when I wanted to. If I go back to Amsterdam I would certainly stay here again and recommend it anyone heading there.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There are many reasons why this hotel was not the best. 1. Lack of directions to get there. Out of the central station, there are about 4 ferries, one of which takes you to the Botel. None were marked with the name of the hotel to help us tourists and we weren't told when we booked. We had to call to ask, while on the pier. 2. It's quite far from the centre. Takes half an hour on the ferry. 3. You would really need to love the swaying. I didn't think I'd mind since I don't get seasick, but it got on the nerves (since travelling also includes a ferry ride...) and we were only there for 3 nights. 4. The food! The one time we were forced to eat there was when we first arrived and were starved to death. The burgers we had from the bar were dry and obviously microwaved or something. However the free breakfast was nice and had a wide selection. 5. Bathroom was pokey. 6. We weren't told when our room would be ready before we turned up. When we got there we were told we'd have to wait 2 hours.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">OK, its a decent hotel for its location and proximity to the train station. That said it is not a 3* hotel. It seems that prices in Amsterdam continue to rocket and that is true of hotels more than anything. We paid â‚¬100 a night for twin rooms. In many other european cities â‚¬100 a night will get you moderate luxury but in AMsterdam it seems it will not get you much. On this basis you have to review the hotel for what it is, expensive but in a place where in proportion to other hotels it's in the lower band of hotels. Bathrooms are very small yet clean as are the rooms. We stayed at the end of May and it was 30 degrees for the 3 days we were there - the rooms have no air con and it was very hot. Breakfast was satisfactory and enough bread etc to soak up the previous night's intake of local alcoholic offerings. All in all it's an ok hotel, would I stay here again? only if absolutely necessary - ie stag where it was already booked / decided on. Certainly not one for the couple away for the weekend.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For what you pay the Botel is just fine. The rooms are decent and clean apart from the bathrooms which are tiny but adequate for an average sized person. The price was good for Amsterdam (70GBP/room/night). The location was very good being walkable to most of the major tourist attractions and only 5 minutes walk from Centraal Station making the transfer from Schiphol very straightforward (and cost effective). Our guidebook placed it in the top 10 budget hotels and if you go expecting a budget hotel you won't be disappointed. The only complaint we had was that the agency we booked it through (GTAHotels.com) advertised it as Bed & Breakfast (and emailed confirmation as such) but when we checked in we were told it was room only. GTA Hotels said it was a mistake and that we should be room only. As this was a problem with the agency the hotel staff, although friendly, were unwilling to help out and wouldn't ring the agency to enquire about it. Like I said, expect a budget hotel and you won't be disappointed.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Amstel Botel - Excellent Value For Money & Service.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from a 3 night stay. Amstel Botel offers you a cheap and very plesant way of staying in Amsterdam. Directions from Central Station - Go to the rear of station to ferry terminals, walk to the far terminal, you'll see a illuminated sign saying NDSM Veer. The ferry is free, just walk on and wait until you dock at the next stop (approx. 20 minutes). You'll see the Amstel Botel directly next to landing stage. The Amstel Botel is very clean, quiet and the staff are very helpful. Joesph the night reception manager could not help you enough - Thanks! I owe You One. After midnight, The boat offers a free shuttle bus service. You catch the midnight ferry which runs every 15 minutes. The minibus is located directly in front of landing stage. If it's not there, then wait. You wont have long. Food on the Botel is basic, but tasty. Staff ensure it's topped up and hot. Rooms are cleaned daily with new towels etc - What more do you want! It's only a base to sleep at whilt you enjoy the sights of Amsterdam. Enjoy!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfried and I just returned from a weekend away at the Botel (3 nights) and we loved it! It is a fantastic location, you can walk everywhere. We were in Amsterdam in March 05 and we stayed miles away in an expensive hotel and it cost a fortune for taxis. The room was really clean, warm and the bed was comfortable. The staff clean the rooms everyday and bring fresh towels etc. If the porn channel isn't your thing there are loads of other channels (at least twenty). The Bathroom is small but not tiny it does the job. We didn't hear any noisy and the staff were pleasant and helpful. I can't comment on food because we didn't eat there but the Bar was nice and inexpensive. It is also very safe and secure at night. After reading some of the reviews on this site I was worried but need not have been. This is a great place to stay, really different for your normal hotel. Oh and the view from our front room was beautiful and there is the most amazing chinese restaurant next to the hotel. We would definitely stay there again...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have been traveling all my life and this by far, was the worst hotel experience of my entire 47 year life. A complete rip off......on the edge of Amsterdam at some ship yard in disrepair. Too the ferry over to the NDSM Pier, right next to some abadnoned Russian relic submarine. Walked 5 mins to the floating hotel, and waited while they checked us in. Very rude front desk help. When we got to the rooms, I almost checked out.....it was that bad, but I was too tired to go find another place to stay. Could not fit on the toilet without moving sideways. If you fell down in the shower, you would land in the toilet or sink. Literally, the bathroom is smaller than a closet. No A/C, just a small window to slide open for fresh air. No inside ventilation to speak of. Prisoners at Guantanamo have better conditions. The bar was a joke and the on site restaurant had terrible food. The cafe at the end of the pier was extremely expensive. This should be called the Prison Barge Hotel. Spend your money elewhere......this place is a dump.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in this hotel in July 2011, I pulled up and actually thought we may have been lost, as it looked like we were in some kind of industrial area, unfortunately this was just the location of the boat! The rooms themselves were tiny and bare, with a bathroom equally as tiny and bare. I felt like I was in the D class of a cruise boat. I could have lived with all of this, as I prefer not to spend to much time in my hotel when on holidays. The location, I was not bearable for me. We had to wait for the ferry (which only came every half an hour) to get anywhere close to civilisation. My friends and I ended up having to run through Amsterdam in the rain, so that we didn't miss the last ferry at 12am. If you miss this, you have to catch two buses that take you completely out of the way, before actually getting back to where you need to go. I don't even want to know how much longer this journey would take. If you are young and want to stay out and explore Amsterdam at night, and not be forced to come home at 12 am, this is not for you</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From Jim, Dundee, Scotland. Visited Amsterdam again from 13-16 April 2005, and stayed at the Botel which is approximately 3-4 minutes walk from Centraal Railway Station. This is a good and very clean floating tourist hotel and with its central location you can access all the major attractions by tram or by foot . The Botel does not take children. The free channels on the Satelite TV will probably explain why, but then again individuals have the option to watch or turn off. Anyway Amsterdam is so vibrant most people only want to use their rooms for crashing out in after the excesses of the day and night and only the extremely sad would want to stay in and watch TV. The cafe bars are something else and the general atmosphere in the city is one of being totally chilled out. Restaurants are freely available to suit any price range. My personal favourite is the Ankara, a good quality Turkish Restaurant with excellent food at very reasonable prices. My wife and I have visited Amsterdam 6 times in the past 5 years and will doubtless return next year.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I wholeheartedly implore people to look elsewhere in Amsterdam for a hotel - as there are much nicer places to stay!! The last moment website we booked this through gives it an incredibly unrealistic 3 stars... We booked this on the recommendation of a friend who I can only imagine did not spend much time on the botel! I had paid Â£81 per night for 3 nights here, we ended up staying one and finding somewhere else at the first opportunity. The hotel is in a terrible location, way out of the city in an industrial estate, with ferries only crossing every half hour it could take you an hour to get into the city centre... the room we had was freezing, damp, the thin windows meant the gale that was blowing outside was also blowing inside, the "bathroom" reminded me of a toilet on a train (not one of those nice new trains either) When we then attempted to cancel our room the following morning, the reception staff were unhelpful and impolite, as we had booked through a website they would have nothing to do with us, we simply could not wait to get out of there</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I have stayed at the Amstel Botel for the past 3 years in a row. Our latest visit was last early March,during the blizzard. Apart from having to haul our luggage(4 heavy bags)through the snow from the train station to the botel,we had a ball.We found the rooms although tiny, clean and the bed was very comfortable. We have always stayed on the 2nd or 3rd floor overlooking the canal. The view of the city,particularly at night was wonderful. Yes the walls are thin and the aroma of pot is always present(this is after all Amsterdam). These minor irritations have never preventing us from enjoying the atmosphere. Buffet breakfast(all you can eat) was fine, and we found front desk staff and the mgr. owner himself to be very friendly and polite as was the night desk man.We could stay in a 4 star hotel if we wanted to,but we find the Amstel Botel to be a great introduction to this fabulous city. The bar is also quite adequate but on the expensive side. Should we return to Amsterdam and we probably will,we will no doubt stay at the Amstel Botel again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in the Botel as part of a study abroad trip for a few days in 2006. It was a unique and fun experience. The only downside was that the bathrooms are TINY! No room to get ready. Take one step in there is the toilet and sink and one step to the left and there is the shower. The room I stayed in had what would be the equivalent to American twin beds, however, they were more narrow than American beds. Friends that had rooms that were double or more had larger beds and larger room to move about in the room. There was no TV in our room, was a working phone. They have breakfast every morning and a bar in the hotel. It is in a great location. Every room looks out onto the water. Our room looked out onto the canal and we were able to see boats passing by of all kinds, which was really great. We had an excellent view of the city and the hotel is in a great location. Walking distance to many of things, and if not to where you want to go it is close to a metro station. Service in the hotel was great. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about the Botel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Easy to get to via free ferry in 10 mins. First impressions were very good as the check in staff were very efficient and helpful. The rooms are on the small side however we do not go on trips to sit in our room so this was not really an issue but I do not know how a very large person would cope with the bathroom! The bed was the comfiest I have ever slept in however its getting to sleep thats the problem! You can hear everything going on and I mean everything!!!!!!!!!!! You can feel the boat rocking at times which made me feel a bit nauseous however no one else in our party was bothered by this! The bar onboard was very reasonable where we had drinks on our return at night . The cooked breakfast items left a lot to be desired however the continental options were fine. There is a large dining room with breakfast served until 10.30 for those who don't like to rush in the morning. Some snacks are also served during the day e.g burgers however we did not eat try this so cannot comment. Would I stay here again? Maybe but only if there was no other bargain accommodation and I pack the earplugs!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a serious budget hotel. I has the novelty of being a floating hotel, but thats where it ends. The boat is moored on the northern sector of Amsterdam which to get to you need to take a ferry, albeit free... You therefore need to keep an eye on the clock to make sure you don't miss the last one. If you do miss it you can get another ferry but you need to ring the hotel to send the shuttle bus to pick you up. On arrival my friend and I were 'greeted' at the reception by a woman who appeared to be reluctant to stop what she was doing and deal with our reservation. This same woman was behind the hotel bar one evening when we came back and kept us waiting for five minutes while she busied herself round the back before informing us 'Bar's closed!' without even making eye contact..... The rooms stank of cigarette smoke especially when the heating was on or the sun was shining in, the duvet cover had cigarette burn holes, the toilet appeared to back up and the shower bracket was broken. Breakfast was reasonable although sometimes you had to wait for tables to be cleared and clean cutlery to be provided. like I said serious budget quality.....</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was curious about the botel after seeing some unpleasant views on here but luckily we found them to be unfounded. Please remember this was a river cruiser and therefore the rooms are small for hotels although bigger than i was led to believe from the reviews. The Bathrooms were small tho but we were expecting that. The room was very clean and the bed was queen / king size so plenty of room. We had a canal side room on the 1st floor. The view was spoiled by the walkway and meant that people could see into the room if the light was on but we just closed the curtains when privacy was required. Its location close to the central station and within minutes of the city centre is difficult to beat. Being on the water meant that street noise was minimal. It is true that the walls of the cabins are thin but this wasnt too much of a problem. We didnt sample the bar or facilities there so cant comment on them but there is definately a dope-smokey type smell across most of the ship (and indeed amsterdam itself). We hope the photos will give some idea of the botel as we enjoyed the stay especially as it seems at a budget price and would stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The novelty of staying on a boat hotel appealled to myself and my partner as a last minute deal for the end of august. to amsterdam. The ferry you have to catch is just left as you come out of the back of central station (airport is about 30mins away on a train straight from airport 4.80euros for a single) and a short distance to the botel once you cross ove which is a free ferry service, just becarefull of the scooters and bikes!!!!!. every time we made our way over to the crossing we didnt have more than a 15min wait for one, which helped when it rained!!!! The staff had basic understanding of english and very informative with info on shuttle bus and ferry times, and gave us maps etc at the hotel. The rooms were basic but cleaned every day and you dont really feel the hotel move until you are in the shower!!! It was very quiet dispite sail 2010 event on all weekend which only happens every 5 yrs. breakfast was a selection of what we consider brekkie and salad!!!! but it was nothing special, would like to have seen fruit and pastries though!!!! a basic but comfortable stay and would recommend to friend and family, and consider staying there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this Botel as it was cheap through lastminute.com, after paying for it I read the reviews on here, as was totally put off, so much so that I tried to cancel but couldn't. However, It was not too bad at all. I speak as someone who stays in lots of hotels around the world, 3* and above. Ok, the room was basic but comfortable, the bathroom tiny, can only fit in one person, but the shower was fab, lots of towels (you dont need to bring your own) like someone said. Good TV reception with 2 or 3 english speaking channels. Clean room, very safe, cleaners ecah day if you wish. I would rate this a good 2*, and afterall we wern't in the room for long, out all day & night, so it suited the purpose. Do ask for another pillow each though. The boat is on concrete as isn't actually floating, we requested a canal view, as you can see from the pics, there is a building in the process of being built on the other side, so we avoided that. The staff were very friendly we found and helpful. The breakfast is ok, lots to choose from. It is a 5 minute walk from the station and a 5 minute walk to everywhere ekse, can't fault the location. So please don't be put off as I was, it is worth the stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I always thought reviews were for moaners but please read this as I dont know how the Botel are getting away with their advertisement, the pictures you see are not where the boat is situated! Our weekend away was a christmas present from my Mum. She stayed in Amsterdam (although not on the botel) and said it was very central, however a couple of months before we were due to go we got an email and the boat had moved and apparently to a new trendy location! Please please check my pictures as to where the boat is situated, it is like an industrial site! There is a free boat to central Amsterdam but if you get a taxis then it will cost about 20-30euros depending where you are. The room we stayed in wasn't at all luxury like it states, its about a 1* but it is clean which is a plus. When we stayed there were large groups of lads which was fine but the corridors smell of weed! Amsterdam is lovely but I would reccommend a central hotel where things are walking distance as once we got up in the moring it would be a 2hr turnaround to catch the ferry back to the hotel and then get ready, chill and go back out for the evening, so once you leave you aren't going back till the end of the night!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading the reviews, I was a bit worried. I stayed here for 5 nights with my 2 kids age 5 and 8. It was suppose to rain all 5 days and it was the 1st time my daughter was without the stroller. I needed a hotel close to public transportation. This fit the bill. Central station was a stone throw away and we could get busses, trams, and trains very easily. The kids LOVED it. We had a triple and I thought there was plenty of space. Remember - this is a boat. I expected everything to be smaller, but it wasn't. The shower was tight but I've been in much smaller ones. Only one night did we hear anything and it wasn't that loud. We had a room on the 3rd floor - I would recommend 3rd or 4th. I was worried about the porn on the TV but they turned it off without me asking them. We also had 2 or 3 English kids stations to keep the little ones entertained while getting ready in the morning. I would recommend the Botel for families and groups. If you're there with a spouse there are plenty of other small hotels. Amsterdam is great with kids especially Nemo and Tun Fun. The Van Gogh musuem has a wonderful free pamphlet for kids - searching for art, puzzles, etc. 5 days was not enough for us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Dont stay at this place if at all possible. The staff are about as much use as a chocolate teapot! Not friendly and very un helpfull. Our room was on floor #2 had a lovely view of the building site and the screeching of trains outside our window every 15 mins throughout the night- not to mention the water pipes gushing out into the canal, and being delighted to see a digger going past my window (a few feet away) as I awoke form my 15 mins of sleep. We complained about the room and had and upgrade canal view! what a shame that we were situated on the bottom floor underneath the walk way and had to put up with the noisy footsteps of anyone walking past. The rooms are very small with a bathroom the size of a phone box. Although the rooms were clean, the breakfast isnt worth 3 euros let alone 10! Biggest downfall for me though was, that they will NOT allow cannabis to be smoked anywhere near the premises. Which is a 1st for me in visiting Amsterdam for 17 yrs. So anyone who wishes to stay here and like a smoke in the evening.... you have been warned, dont go to this place! A 1st and last for me to stay in this god awful place, Ive also spread the word to my friends and family that this place should be avoided at all costs! Blue cheese fan</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in Amsterdam for 2 nights on our way home from the UK. I had read the reviews on here, good and bad and being on a budget decided we would risk it. It is in a handy location near Centraal Station, 10 minutes walk and handy to all the tours and shops. We got an indifferent greeting from the receptionist and went to our room on the construction site side. Yes it was as noisy as anticipated but bearable with earplugs. We turned down our beds (2 singles) and both found several dark hairs on our pillowcases. Gross!! They were clean just hairy. The bathroom was small but adequate and we chose to have our breakfasts in the city. We had a drink in the bar and the barman was barely civil so we left after our drink. We asked for a wake up call on our last morning in time for us to catch our plane but we didn't get it. Luckily we woke up in time and when questioned as we were checking out they admited they forgot but offered no apology. We left thinking how indifferent all the staff had seemed, perhaps that is the European way as we found it throughout Amsterdam. Maybe we just were unlucky. Would I recommend the Botel? Only to those on a limited budget. Would I stay there again? No, but then I wouldn't go to Amsterdam again as I found it a dirty hole.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked a mini break (cheap) for my husbands Christmas pressy so whilst not expecting the best hotel this was not what I expected. For the majority of travellers I am sure that for just putting your head down it would be adequate but the 3 star rating is pushing it, for us it was more like a 2. In essence this hotel is basically a decommissioned ferry converted into a hotel on a budget. Our room was very small (that was expected) but the 'bathroom' was joke, you couldn't move in the shower and the shower curtain didn't fit, you couldn't sit properly on the toilet due to it proximity to the sink and the shower - it was a wet room with no space. The dÃ©cor was very shabby and dated and the TV was a portable - hey small to match the rest of it. The bar area consisted of four tables with plastic chairs and a juke box (that wasn't working when we where there) and a pool table in bad need of re felting. the breakfast was a buffet affair which catered for most tastes but it did put us in mind of being in youth hostel. On the up side the staff were lovely, polite and very helpful. the ferry ride from Centraal Station to the Botel was free and added the fun to the trip. Would I go back there never but I feel that it would make as fun place for the younger generation!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Yes the rooms are TINY, the bathrooms are MINISCULE and the rooms do smell a bit smokey! But I found the Botel to be generally clean, friendly and in a great location! If you are expecting a huge, airy hotel room you will be disappointed but if you just want somewhere to shower and sleep, right in the heart of Amsterdam, then this is ideal! I don't understand the reviewers who said it was too far out of the centre! Perhaps they would rather stay right in the Liedsplein with all the noise and tacky pubs?? I have been to Amsterdam several times and I consider the city centre perimeters to stretch at least as far as the Botel! You can walk anywhere in the city from here. The nearest pubs and restaurants are perhaps 2 minutes away, with the red light district a bit further. If you are flying to Amsterdam, get on the train from the airport, get off at Centraal Station and after 5 minutes walk you are at the Botel! One thing though - we paid extra for a canal view but our window was right above the metal walkway which leads to reception. This was pretty noisy when anyone with heels clattered past so I would stay on the other side if I went back again! You can pay extra for the breakfast, and although it's a good spread, you can eat better for less if you go to one of the cafes on the way into town.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed in this hotel twice. Once in 2007 and once in 2010. 2007 experience: The botel was located in amsterdam centraal. Just outside the centraal station. This made is easy to access the city center and the scene was also beautiful. Rooms are cheap and have all the basic necessities that one requires for the price offered. The main advantage was the location and the fact that you will actually be living on a boat with is thrilling. 2010: The boat moved farther away from amsterdam centraal station towards amsterdam Noord. Takes 10 min on ferry from centraal station to Noord. Then a 5 min walk from the stop to Botel. Nearby there are not many places as it seems to be an industrial area. There is a ship restaurant near by which offers food and we had dinner there which was actually very nice for a good price. The rooms themselves looked tired. Carpets were stained and the room was a little stuffy. The comforters had dust in them which made it difficult to sleep at night. Allergic persons should beware. rest all is ok for the price. Breakfast was normal cold breakfast with not a lot of variety. just jam, toasts stuff like that. Overall experience was good. Would only live there again if am on a budgeted trip. As one is out all day on excursions to coming at night to sleep is not bad here for the price. Thanks</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Amstel Boatel website uses the word Luxurious to describe the accommodation. Luxurious IT IS NOT! This is a Budget Hotel in every sense of the word. Firstly the Bad News. The rooms are compact and the bathrooms are small to the point of tiny. The furnishings are minimal and the carpet is thin. The glasses are thin plastic ones and there is no tea/coffee making in the room. Our particular room had a shower with a broken fitting meaning that we had to hold the shower head with one hand while showering with the other! There was no plug in the sink and no bathroom fan so the place got very steamy at times. Now for the Good bits. The hotel is clean and the staff are friendly. The rooms are warm and the TV picture is good and has BBC2 and BBC world service programmes available. The breakfasts are adequate and the breakfast area is pleasant. The location is unusual and industrial but we found it interesting and not offputting. It was only a 5 minute walk from the free ferry that took you to the rear of the central station, which in turn was only a 10 minute ride. The ferry ran every 30 mins and was more frequent during the morning and evening rush hours. All in all as a lower price budget Hotel it is fit for the job, but please do not set your expectations by reading the brochure or web site, or you may be disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked a room around 2 months in advance. Paying the extra for a canal view. Upon arrival the canal view room was facing the canal for certain. Though this was all. They gave us the basement room that looks out to the water of the canal, the underside of the walkway complete with water pipes and the advantage of people being able to look into the room. This is what I was charged a premium for. In addition to this the room stank of cannabis, so this is Amsterdam, but I am sure the room could have been freshened. It was so bad I changed side of the boat (no other canal view rooms available), no view but higher. Well I say no view, there was the view of the railway line (plus the noise) and a construction site (plus the noise). During the process of this room change (around 20 mins) I saw 3 other guests also complaining about the same thing. To charge for a canal view is at best a damn right cheek, at worst a complete deception. The room itself is no way near the standard of a 3 star hotel that it claims to be. 1 star would be complementary. The bar is like walking into a cloud of smoke, no ventilation or air conditioning. Breakfast is not included and costs more than any of the nearby cafes which are far superior. The staff are not at all helpful. No managers were available. Unless you have low expectations I would not recommend this place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at Botel twice before, but that was in it's 'old' location! It was slightly confusing looking for the ferry terminal - its the last one on the left and there is an LCD display board and wow they are never late. I personally loved getting the ferry, it felt authentic and a rare chance to experience the real Amsterdam. I personally didn't mind it being so far away as it was quiet and there was always something to see out of you window [or should that be porthole?] Once checked in, you are given a ferry timetable and off you pop. The hotel itself isn't concreted down any more so if you don't have you sea legs take some travel/motion sickness pills, we did and it really didn't bother us despite being worst for wear more than once....! The Botel itself is incredibly basic, but it's clean and the staff are nice - what more could you want for that price?!? We asked for more pillows, got them and there were two spare blankets in the wardrobe as it was freezing when we were there. We didn't stay for breakfast as for ten euros it didn't seem that great, the pub/cafe by boat stop do and their coffees are lovely, and their food looked nice too. The bar has a pool table, Indiana Jones pinball machine, internet access and a juke box. Pretty decent. Beer wasn't overpriced either. There are also vending machines on the floor directly above reception for those mid evening munchies!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Was great for what we needed, which was cheap and basic accommodation, that was close to the city centre or easily accessible. LOVED getting the ferry back and forth each time from Amsterdam central to the Botel (last stance on the left on oct 10'). It's very regular, you only have to wait 25 minutes at the most, and it takes you to within a minutes walk of the botel. Later at night there is only one ferry available but a nightbus takes you from the dock to the Botel (typically efficient dutch transportation). One of the downsides about staying on this side of the river however is that it's very industrial with basically no restaurants/shops, making traveling across the only option if you get the late night munchies. There is a restaurant beside the botel which is cool and modern but because we were on a shoestring budget we only had a few coffees there which were about 1.50 euros each. Being a boat it doesn't rock at night quite as much as you would expect although I did occasionally get jelly legs. The staff at the front desk are quite helpful, loads of free maps available. The rooms are VERY basic so don't expect any type of luxury and there was a massive stain on the quilt in our room. The toilets can smell quite strong at time as well but it's what you'd expect for the price. It's also probably worth mentioning for the red-blooded humans reading this that each room has free 24 hour porn which obviously my boyfriend was totally ecstatic about. He'd probably go back to Amsterdam and stay at the Botel for that fact alone!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ambience: What can I say? It is indeed a boat! The location is very good. It's close to the Central Station - via a free ferry service that operates between the station and the hotel area. The size of the boat is very deceiving - it looks much bigger on the website. The rooms and general interior of the boat are very worn - desperately in need of refurbishment. The whole ambience is like a hostel more than a hotel. Stars: ** Room: We stayed for two nights in a double room. The room was tiny, extremely worn out - marks of damp walls. The bathroom is hardly a room at all. Quite literally just enough to fit a toilet, and a standing shower compartment. The room was not cleaned properly during room service. Bedsheets were never changed. Stars: * Service: Very good service. The staff at reception was friendly, pleasant and helpful. But apart from this, the hotel seemed to have no services at all. It's very basic, but okay. Stars: ** Breakfast Room: The botel has no restaurant, only a small bar and a breakfast room. Consistent with the rest of the interior of the boat, the room was very worn out. The breakfast buffet was much too small for the amount of people it served. The food was not very fresh - it seemed to have been out there for quite a while. Not a very wide choice of food available. The coffee was honestly the worst coffee I've ever drunk in my life. Stars: * Overall: The price is probably okay for Amsterdam standards. Usually, hotels so close to the city centre are excruciatingly expensive, so at least the price was borderline reasonable. Overall: **</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I actually signed up on this page today because I feel the latter reviews are unfair - or at least not representative for our stay (which was 3 nights over new year's). No, this is not luxury - however it's solid and the staff was very friendly to us. The location worried me a little but if you do your homework eg. watch the video on the hotel website) beforehand, it's very simple. We actually came to appreciate the short boat trip to the central station when going into town. Only slightly annoying thing is if you just miss a boat (they go every 30th minute most of the day). I think a telling thing about the service of this place is that when we checked out we were asked whether we planned to take the boat, because it was not sailing (We never found out why). But in 5 minutes we had a free shuttle taxi to another boat (much closer to the central station - it's the one you are supposed to also take at nights). All this was explained carefully to us at check in. It's dead simple - and the boat is right next to the botel. Oh, and if you stay at the botel do drop in at the eating place next to it http://www.ijkantine.nl/index.php. We had dinner there the last night. It was great. At night it's like a restaurant with a splendid view. At day, however, it seemed there was a lot of noise and a lot of children... There really is little else than the botel and the kantine in the area, but I am not sure you need more. We did not. Amsterdam Central is just 10 minutes away. Having said that it seems that the NSDM-area is an uncoming one - as far as I understand there is also a metro line coming.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are expecting 5 star accomodation, you WILL be dissapointed. The star rating of the Botel reflects the price, and I think it is very reasonable and we got a very cheap deal. You have to remember your staying on a boat...so yes the rooms, particulary the bathrooms are very small and basic. Our room was cleaned every day, we had no issues at all and found it quite comfortable. The guy on reception was lovely and changed our room so we had a nicer view :) The breakfast is pretty standard and replenished all morning..meats, bread rolls etc but they also have hot food...bacon eggs and sausage - bonus!! The bar is small but they have a dart board, pool table, juke box and tv in the bar/lounge area. We found all the staff to be very friendly and helpful!! watch out for channel 35 btw...its porn 24 hrs a day!! We LOVED taking the ferry to the centre everyday, the novelty didnt ware off for us! It was a bit daunting at first but you get used to it. If you leave Central Station via the back Noord Exit...cross the road and turn left. There is a little ferry port. The ferry you need to get on is the last one on the left and is signed NDSM. It only takes about 10mins to get across and the Botel is right there. The ferry..(which is free by the way) runs every half hour and every 15mins in rush hr. The Botel will give you a timetable when you check-in. It can be a nuisance if you just miss it and have to wait for the next one, but if you keep an eye on the time its really not a problem! All in all, we had a fantastic stay here and would definatley go again and recommend it to anyone on a budget! If you have any questions dont hesitate to contact me! :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First and foremost...For the high season the rates are great! Okay the positives. Very clean. asked for a non smoking and it really was a non smoking, smelled great.You have your own bathroom with a kick-ass shower. Location is awesome. Free porn! Bar in house with restaurant. Now for the negatives. Staff is not all that friendly, they were never rude it was just that they were not there to make your stay just a little more enjoyable with say even a smile or a good morning that would have been nice. The first floor should not have rooms on it due to the fact that above oh say...room 128 the bar is there and the floors are very thin and you feel and hear everyone bound for the bar or the restaurant or their 2nd floor room walking. very loud. Also we faced towards the city which is located next to the the boardwalk to the hotel and the chinese place and a 1000 other shortcuts and it is very LOUD. whats that you say? Close your window, well cannot since no airconditioning so all I am saying is that it is loud. Also on the first floor people walking by get a straight shot into the room this of course made it hard to enjoy the porn. Curtains were the type that were just about 4 inches to small so always some spot open. and the hotel is nice enough to put a bench for people to sit on right outside the door which puts it outside our window and we were lucky to get every young Brit in town drunk and loud and telling of all his conquests in the red light district which sort of made up for the porn intrusion. BOTTOM line good hotel, great price. My wife and I would stay again just ask for a room up high and on the back side where the construction is taking place.</p></li>

The botel can be scene on the left as you dock and there is a ex russian naval sub also moored there. When we checked in the receptionist was really helpful as we had arrived a day early , but she allocated our rooms and told us to see the booking dep in the morning and they would sort everything out , which we did , and they did with no charge . the rooms are a good we had a double and they have all been pretty much the same , warm comfortable and clean with a small en suite shower and toilet.

We enjoy the botel as we always find the ferry ride fun , and as we have been frequenting Amsterdam for the last 25 years we appreciate a break from the hustle and bustle of the city centre and the quiet at night , don't let the position of this hotel put you off it is always reasonably priced and a much better standard than you get with some of the city centre hotels , we should know we have stayed in about 20 of them . so all in all we love the botel and will be returning in the very near future..</p></li>
