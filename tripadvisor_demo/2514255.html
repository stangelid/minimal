<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I can't argue with the previous reviews but at £29 per room in central London this is a pretty good deal. I've stayed in smaller, noisier rooms in London for a lot more money. The service lift is now available for guests use. Staff were very pleasant. The room was large and clean and as it was at the back wasn't too noisy at all. Expect no frills and you won't be disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Went down to london for one night to see a theatre show. At first glance doesnt look great but for the price you paid (for me i think it was around £40-50 for one night) you cant moan. Its clean, tidy and has all the basic stuff like TV, Kettle etc. Bathroom was clean, and we could still get in after 10 even though people are moaning that they couldnt. Staff were friendly and i had nothing to moan about. Basic bog standered hotel for a bog standered price.</p></li>

All the members of the staff were kind and helpfull. English breakfast was ok. The rooms were clean-also the bathrooms. Only the corridorfloor and the mirrors of the toilets in the basement were not 100 % . The busstop in front of the hotel made it easy for us to visit the centre of London. I will certainly book again in Travelodge Farringdon.</p></li>

The room was noisy at night due to traffic, but its states this in the information. Wouldn't recommend buying evening meals in advance as many of these were cheaper anyway.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is desperately in need of full renovation. The quality and comfort of the rooms was on a par with a private room in a youth hostel, although admittedly you do get an en suite.

The other clientele in the hotel reflected the sort of people you would expect to be hanging around in a cheap, run down and anonymous hotel round the corner from Kings Cross.

It is right on Kings Cross Road and the noise insulation is poor so the noise from the road kept me awake late and awoke me early. Also, despite booking 3 months in advance the best rate I could find was £60 ("it's London") , when I arrived they plastered the place with Travelodge's rooms for £19 adverts - that's just rubbing it in!</p></li>

Bed WAS a bit uncomfortable because of some springs sticking up, but nothing we couldn't deal with for a couple of nights.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel at this price outside london would be a bad deal, for london its OK. I have stayed in some real dumps in London, and even some of the very expensive hotels come under the above description. The room is clean, but in need of minor maintenance, before it gets worse. Various small faults. The food in the resturant was not good, but this hotel is only 2 minuites walk from an area with a good variety of places to eat. This hotel is not upto the normal travelodge standards, but its london - so you expect that. I'd probably come back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had a midweek one night stay due to a works Christmas party. The location was great for travelling to work next day, but the main road directly outside is busy all night, so though the beds were comfortable my sleep was disturbed. With three girls sharing it was a bargain at £23 each. The room was decent sized, the decor slightly worn but clean. The bathroom was slightly cramped, but adequately stocked, and the shower worked well. I've been in better decorated Travelodge's in quieter areas, but this was just the ticket with regards to location and budget.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My second visit to this Travelodge simply due to it's relatively low cost for London and its location - close to Kings Cross and a nice walk in to town. Although it would not appeal to those who require luxury, the rooms have seen better days, and only 1 lift works it is clean and comfortable for a short stay. At some point Travelodge will refurbish it and you will end up paying a lot more to stay there! Look out for the Travelodge sales/best offers from their website and book well in advance. For me I would rather spend the money I save at one of the great local restaraunts than twice as much on a hotel room.</p></li>

This is a very basic and old style hotel. the reception and bar look appealing and are quite newly fitted but the room I was in was in need of a revamp. the walls are quite thin so if you need a quiet night (like I did) then this is probably not a good place to go. It was also very small but at least the shower was warm in the morning. I also had very itchy sheets... I'm not sure if it was just psychological but it also contributed to a restless night.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I had separate Christmas parties in London so chose to stay in the City rather than have the hassle of travelling home. At £19.50 for the double room, this was a absolute steal. Even the guy at reception was shocked at the price (booked during one of the Travelodge promotional deals) as he said the walk-in price would be close to £200, which is frankly a joke (in my view). The room was clean, relatively spacious and had the benefit of small TV. For the price, there was nothing to fault. If you pay up-to ca.£60-80 then this is a good option. Any more and you will start to feel that there were better options you could have chosen.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We checked in on a Thursday night as my other half had a business meeting on Friday and I was working from our London office. Checked in fairly late - note you book in electronically (I did ask if I could check in and the grumpy assistant simply pointed me to a terminal). Food stops at 10pm although this wasn't the case as we were told "No Food" at 9:30ish. The rooms have new carpets and some decor, but it's not very modern. If you've come from continental europe then think "Formule 1" in the 1990s when they were dismal places to stay. It was clean, I suppose and the beds were fairly OK. Not good enough, though. Not somewhere I would ever choose to stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had a long weekend in London and Faringdon Travelodge was close to KX station and reasonably priced. Wasn't expecting The Ritz and can put up with tired decor and a bit of traffic noise, but do expect basic room security. On check-in was given a key card to an already occupied room. I didn't steal anything and receptionist apologised. At midnight on Saturday night was woken by sound of someone trying the door handle and then an intruder walking in. He was lucky that he exited when I screamed at him and that i didn't have a weapon to hand or have a heart attack. Turned out to be a member of staff checking the room which they thought had already been vacated. What total incompetence.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've never stayed in London before as was naïve to think that the hotel prices would be reasonable. This was the cheapest hotel available where I did not have to share a bathroom or bedroom. It's very basic and dated, but you get a bed and a bathroom - what more do you need? The service was fantastic and the staff were always more than happy to help. I requested a room change during my stay due to the noise from people outside the bar downstairs at 2am, and this was organised for me with no hassle. Overall the quality of this hotel is not he best but if it's the cheapest around then you can't expect much more. You get what you need along with helpful service but I wouldn't voluntarily stay again.</p></li>

We were given a warm welcome when we checked in and the room we were given was as on the second floor facing the road, which was noisy ( they state this on their web site) at times but as we were always out and about it did not bother us. The bed was comfy and had clean crisp white bed linen. Soap, two towels, tea, coffee, electric fan, tv. The carpet was clean and the artex was clean!!! (it would take forever to referb that). I would not like to pay the top price for this type of room but for the price we were happy with a clean room and a place to rest our heads at the end of the day.</p></li>

They couldn't afford to put a loo paper roll holder in the bathroom, could not afford to put hangers in the closet and could not afford to put a functioning remote control for the tele....oh and they must be worried about guests stealing batteries as the battery cover on the remote control was screwed permanently in place. I got no sleep due to the slamming of doors during the night and all of this for 110GBP a night!</p></li>

The hotel is in desperate need of refurbishment and the rooms could do with an occassional dust and vaccum. More worryingly is the vermin that run around the public bar area, we witnessed several vermin running in and out of chairs (each chair has a hole in the bottom). Staff didnt seem particularly bothered with this and begrudingly gave us a refund for breakfast as we didnt intend eating in this establishment anymore. The reports of vermin on here go back as far as last year so it isnt the first time this has been spotted. We would certainly pay a little bit extra and sleep with Lenny Henry and his team down the road!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading previous reviews i had serious doubts about whether to bother going to the accommodation. I'm sure glad we did though. My husband rang ahead and asked for a quieter room which they accommodated....well a room at the back where you could hear the trains rather than front noise on busy road. Room was adequate, tea and coffee making facility. Fan was provided f necessary, flat screen tv. Check in was brisk and straight forward, breakfast was good value and plenty of choice. About 15 min walk to tube, but it's not a difficult walk. We paid £90 for 2 nights, which included 1 breakfast and 2 early check in payments as we couldn't book 2 nights together at time of booking!!!! Anyhow for BH weekend that was great price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for one night only, as it was convenient for the venue of the conference I was attending, as well as Kings Cross station. The staff were helpful but the hotel itself is drab, extremely basic and rather grubby. A box-like single room with no kettle, a fan which could not be used due to health and safefty reasons, no phone, no toiletries except soap, a thin duvet and an extremely unconfortable, lumpy mattress were among the poor features. Lack of double glazing means that the noise of the traffic disturbs sleep and I was able to hear, not only the television, but voices from the room next door. The entire place requires TLC, but sadly, its situation probably ensures a plentiful clientele. This experience has changed my opinion of Travel Lodges.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed with colleagues for one night. I got a reasonable night's sleep, although most of my colleagues didn't, the beds seemed to be two single bed nailed together, and for one colleagues, two single mattresses of different levels of comfortableness. It was clean. The location's not brilliant as (compared to other hotels) it's not near any tube or rail stations. The rooms were adequate (although the shower in my room was very lame). We were all on the top (5th) floor so that kept noise away as much as possible. I can't comment on the service as we didn't interact with a member of staff. Due to the queue in reception we checked in using the computer terminals. And don't use the book-a-taxi phone in reception, it cost twice the price of flagging down a cab.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were really dissapointed with this Travelodge - our room was definitely not up to their 'basic' standards. Each of the wall lights in the room had severe singing damage from using too bright bulbs. This had caused the walls to have burn marks all up them... it was not very reassuring going to sleep wondering if there were other electrical faults in the building... The breakfast was particularly frantic - with people wondering in having not paid and not being stopped by staff. The only coffee being served was from a machine using instant granules and UHT milk. Lots of items in the breakfast were running low/had run out, and no staff were on hand to replenish them. This wasn't good value for money as a couple of pounds extra would have got a much nicer hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I read some reviews before our trip and took most of the negative ones with a pinch of salt. Get real folks, this is bargain basement priced accommodation in the the middle of Europe's busiest capital city. The place was clean, room just what you would expect and the staff were pleasant and cheerie. Plenty cafes/ restaurants within 5 mins walk and 2 pubs vurtually next door both with good food. Only ten minutes to walk into Bloomsbury/Russell Sq/Southampton Row where you can use all your internet restaurant discount vouchers and lots of pubs to call at on the way back. No 19 bus just down the road and you can have a scenic tour right through the West End and onto Knightsbridge. I think people really expect too much for the fairly piffling sum this place costs!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading previous reviews expected the worse - was pleasantly surprised. We had a two triple rooms looking out onto Kings Cross Rd. The room was lovely and warm - heated with radiators rather than air con unit. Three real beds as opposed to the usual roll-away bed. Enjoyed watching the world go by though by night there was traffic noise - but you'd expect that on such a main road - slept well. Some black mould on ceiling in bathroom - but all fitments, floors etc spotlessly clean. Breakfast - bacon and sauasage good quality, but no eggs due to prob with supplier and beans and tomatoes cold - fruit salad not appetising - so not a good breakfast for vegetarians. Overall very pleased with the hotel - have paid £85 for a room no better than this in Shrewsbury!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Yes it is what is says on the tin, basic accommodation, 10 minutes from Kings Cross station, central for all of London! Beds uncomfortable, 3 pillows on the bed??? You would either have 2 or 4, when we asked for an extra pillow, we were treated with a look of disgust, you would think we had just asked for a new bed!! Breakfast poor, and not enough staff to cater for a busy breakfast room. We certainly would not go back. Reception staff are Rude, if looks could kill, i certainly would be 6 ft under, all because they had not swiped our key cards for the full stay, and had to keep going to reception to get them done again, obviously to much of an effort to do it right in the first place!!! My advice, go to Holiday Inn or Premier Inn which were both a few mins away!!!</p></li>

Yes you have to check in by machine but so what ? It took one minute, and a very helpful lady on reception oversaw it, and immediately changed my room to a quiet one at the back of the hotel. She was very pleasant and asked if i needed any further help or assistance. Excellent service. The room was clean, tidy, and indeed quiet with an excellent tv and decent bathroom. The bed was comfy and spotless. For £19.00 i simply could not find fault in any way. The location is not the best, and its easy to go to the Travelodge Royal Scot by mistake, but if you are departing from Kings Cross as i was its just fine. I simply do not know why this hotel gets such negative reviews.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for a cheap weekend as we were down watching some filming at the BBC. The rooms and the hotel are absolutely adequate - it was clean and the beds comfortable. Yes - it is worn out and needs a make over but for the price we paid - I have stayed in way worse B&B's for 2 or 3 times the price! The shower was great - very powerful! and the staff were fine - friendly and helpful enough. The hotel is situated on a busy road - we were on th roadside which is noisy but we slept no problem - probably worth asking for a room away from the road if you are a light sleeper. It is about a 10 minute walk to Kings Cross and £4 in a taxi. If you want luxury - then don't book here. But if you just want a place to crash and enjoy the city then it's fine and I would recommend it!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed in three Travelodge hotels in the King's Cross area of London on three different trips to London. All three offered great value for the money: Basic, secure accomodation, with decent beds in clean rooms. There aren't many frills included, but I've noticed that the rooms have been consistently comfortable. Our most recent trip put us in to the Farringdon location, which is the furthest of the three locations from King's Cross station, but it was still only about a 15 to 20 minute walk away. The hotels offers at an extra charge a very hearty buffet breakfast. If you're a budget traveller like I am, fill up with the buffet at breakfast, eat a light picnic or cafe meal at lunch, and splurge a little for dinner. The Travelodge hotels are perfect for budget travellers like us.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I must admit I didn't do much research on this Hotel in advance as I've used Travelodges on many occasions and "you know what you get" - and they're well priced. Well thats what I thought but this was a real disappointment!. I was working near Farringdon and thought it would be close, in fact its nearer to Kings Cross than Farringdon. However the issue was the decoration and very drab appearance once you get past the "front of house" and bar etc. On the 2nd floor walking down the corridor at night was almost "scarey" as it was dimly let and was more like walking through a prison! The room although large was for 1970's guests with holes in lampshades (looked like burn marks) missing shelves in the bathroom and general tiredness. The room was big, noise levels good and breakfast OK but I'll definitely choose another Travelodge in future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 nights as part of a cheap few days in London. I agree the rooms were very hot but we coped. We had a family room (double and single) which could be changed into a triple. The breakfast was fine and there was a great selection to choose from. They were a bit slow to replenish the breakfast that had been taken but it eventually came. We travelled into Euston and took the long way to the hotel. But if you get the tube to King's Cross and then the #63 bus - this stops straight outside the hotel. Didn't really go out in the area of the hotel but it looked OK. We had a meal one night in the hotel which was good value. One thing I would ask for is a room away from the main road as it can be noisey. The bathroom was small but it done what we needed it to do. The shower was very powerful which was a great wake-up in the morning.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First the good point. It's in a good spot near some good eateries and not touristy. Unfortunately I have not got any good points. Staff never on the reception desk, always in the back office. The triple room was tiny and very noisy (we had asked for a quiet room), the bathroom was probably the same size as in a tourer caravan and really need a good clean and updating. The tiles around the bath were grubby and the grouting was black in some areas. The pillows were next to useless. Half the draws were broken and one plug was dangerous. We had 2 towels between three of us. I could go on! What I would say is considering we are hosting the Olympics this year and will have visitors from around the world, I would have thought that Travelodge would have invested money on an upgrade. Sadly they have not and I do hope that people DO NOT BOOK THIS HOTEL!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">"what you pay if what you get". We booked Travelodge Farringdon because it's near St. Pancras(Eurostar to Paris), and we couldn't afford a hotel like Renassiance (the hotel above St. Pancras) so we booked 2 nights at Travelodge Farringdon, and the other night at Travelodge King cross (cause it's full house on the 3rd night) If you take the bus to kingcross, you will get off right in front of the hotel, so this is the only good thing I could think of. The water was not strong enough to wash off the shampoo, other than that, everything is what I expected (low cost hotel). I think Travelodge King cross (few blocks away from Travelodge farringdon) is a little better, and it's closer to St. Pancras/King cross station. Easy self check-in and easy self check-out. Basically dropped the key card in the box when you check-out. By the way, we only took 15-20 mins walk to Angel (bars area)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Compact and bijou, the best way to describe our room, asked for a quiet room and got one round the back on the top floor (509). it was clean and the bed reasonably comfortable. Breakfast was very good by Travelodge Standards. Was late when we got back to hotel and went to bar to order some food, but no sign of any staff anywhere, gave up after about 20 minutes of waiting and got some snacks from the vending machines, annoyingly the bar man came out of his hiding place then! Note to Travelodge Management, you missed out on a lot of bars sales Friday night! The rooms have seen better days and are in need of some re-furbishment. I was with my teenage daughter and felt reasonably safe, but like one of the other reviewers, I would steer clear if I were a single lady traveller as the night staff did seem a bit odd. Would stay again if there was nothing better on offer for the price paid.</p></li>

The room was extremley dated with artex on the walls !! which had not been decorated in many years. The lightshades had holes and burn marks on them.Unfortunately we did not notice that was a massive stain on the mattress until on the day we were due to leave, The window had mold around it and on the wall. The bathroom had rusty plug holes and a dirty bath. The shower which was above the bath had a dirty shower head,shelves were missing and cracked tiles, The list is endless.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had the misfortune to have an overnight stay here recently.Firstly I may say there are 3 Travel Lodges around Kings Cross and this one is furthest from the station.It is about a 15 min walk away.The street that it is in is not very nice at all.You would not want to walk out here late at night. The room was of a low standard which I must say is not of the usual for Travel Lodges which I find to be fine for their money.The lamp shades were burnt of the heat from the bulbs.The room smelt a bit.The bathrooom was dingy and the shower was all black with fungus.I did not sleep in the bed in fear of catching something unwanted .When it was time to catch the first train North from Kings Cross I beat my retreat.Had a quick shave and was off. On leaving I noticed a kind of doss house down the road as there seemed to be a lot of hoodie types congregating outside it.This hotel also was not much better than a doss house.Be warned stay clear.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was in London for an internship this summer and needed somewhere cheap and close to my offices. I was there for almost a month, and although the hotel is more often used by people for one or two nights only, the staff went out of their way to make my stay pleasant. The room was absolutely fine, with everything you could need, and was cleaned to a very high standard each morning. The location is great, and unlike others I experienced no problems with outdoor noise. My room was comfortable and clean, and I was there for longer than most other visitors! The rooms are an absolute bargain, and considering the location, I can honestly say I was delighted with my stay. People should consider the price they are paying for a room in central london! Staff provided an extra fan for me in the hot weather, as well as extra bedding when a friend missed her train. Would defintely reccomend this a budget hotel for a stopover in central London.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was booked for me as I was attending a conference at the Barbican. I'd requested to stay at the City Rd Travelodge, where I'd stayed before, but this worked out a little cheaper. I arrived at 9 pm on Sunday to find the electric door shut and no-one at reception to let me in, a fellow guest eventually letting me in. They have those electronic check-in machines which seemed fine and I was assigned room 205. The lifts are currently broken so stairs it was. The room was basic and very dated, the double bed two singles with metal sprung mattresses pushed together. Despite this I slept well. Awoke to find the shower useless, the thermostatic control was broken so nothing but very hot water. On my return to the hotel that evening I requested a room change and was given a very similar room but on the 5th floor - but at least the bed was more comfortable and the shower sort of worked. In conclusion avoid this place, it's noisy dirty and in serious need of some tlc!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Got the £26.00 room rate from [--] .First night stayed in room 513,easily the smallest double room we've stayed in and the shower flow was very weak.Requested another room the following day [informed staff about shower]and was given a much bigger and better family room,room 502, Taken all things into consideration i.e. the rooms are dated double bed is actually 2 singles together and you are staying at a 2* chain hotel,it was clean,the staff were very friendly ,hotel was very quiet and the price of drink at the bar [£2.98 a pint] ok for central London lol. Positioned approx 10/15 mins walk from Kings Cross tube or a very short bus ride [the no. 63] to KX and 200m away from the restaurants/bars of Exmouth Market ,which i would definately recommend, If i were to get the £26.00/room option again i wouldn't hesitate to go back [i would try to book a family room though] but i wouldn't pay the normal £70.00 rate.I would rather go to some of the newer t/lodges.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Okay, so it wasn't the Hilton, but I don't think you can really grumble for a hotel that is a 20 minute walk from St Paul's Cathedral for £26 per night. The bathroom was very small and pretty grotty and you may get woken up by the traffic on King's Cross Road at the front of the hotel or the vibrations from the underground trains at the back, but ask yourself what you are looking for out of your stay? If you need a base that is pretty central and incredibly cheap then I don't think you can go far wrong here. The Farringdon underground station is a 10 minute walk away, there are plentiful bars and places to eat very close by and, if you are arriving by train at Kings Cross, it is only a 15 minute walk to the hotel, meaning you don't have the hassle of taking your luggage on the underground. If you are after comfort and a romantic break then stay elsewhere. If you want a relatively central place to sleep after a day of sightseeing and a few drinks, then this place is ideal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We too have just stayed in this Travelodge and yes the rooms were hot (though we had a plug in fan!). The hotel is good and conveniently located about 10 minutes walk from King' Cross. Good restaurant (recommend the steak and ale pie!). On the walk to it you pass the King's Cross Travelodge which was always busy with coachloads of foreign tourists. We could see huge queues for breakfast in the morning. Don't buy breakfast in the hotel. Instead on the walk to King's Cross station you pass cafes with boards outside doing full English. We had one for £3.80. It included a pile of toast, hot drink and even chips! We were lucky, we got the £9 per night per room Travelodge deal off the internet site which comes up every so often. So our 3 nights cost £27!!!!!!!! By the way, we also travelled from Preston to London on the Megabus for £2 return each. So, all in all a bargain holiday. We also got 2 for 1 into Hampton Court Palace and gardens with a day Travelcard. I have details if interested.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was so nervous about staying here after reading all the bad reviews,,, but we'd booked it months ago and already paid so we gave it a go! Its not as bad as everyone says!! Their is a car park at the back which charges £15 for 24 hours which is cheap compared to the NCP carparks!! The staff were friendly and our room was basic (apart from the flatscreen tv!!) but it was clean.. what more do you want when youre staying in central London for £40 a night?!?! We only had one problem, and that was we were staying next to some very noisy girls who were running up the halls from 2am-6am (not good when we were running half marathons the next day!) but the staff were nice enough and said on our next stay to ask to stay in the 'alcove' as this was a quiet part of the hotel. Its only 15 mins walk from St Pauls cathedral, and we spent the rest of our stay sightseeing,and enjoying madame tussauds,,,, overall,,, give this hotel a go! its not as bad as everyone says and its a bargain for staying in central London!!! :-)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Have just stopped for one night with my partner (the poor thing is down there all week for business!). Travelodges are usually good basic accomodation, this one is really letting their reputation down. It needs a complete refurb - wiring from old electrical equipment from 70s is just cut off, hooks fallen off bathroom doors, electricial sockets intermittant! I'm not fussy, when it's cheap I can happily live with a scruffy room, but the worst thing is the noise from the Kings Cross road (it doesn't stop all night) and the crappy little desk fan they give you for air con - it was a case of staying awake from the heat or the traffic noise - We chose the heat. Desk staff no better, asked for more hangers, took 20mins & then turned up with towels - said she'd go get some hangers - we gave up waiting! Taxi they booked my boyfriend for a very early train was a complete rip off - £12 for a 5 min journey! Only stop here if a) it's winter b) it's on one of their £19 a night deals and c) you take industrial ear plugs!!</p></li>

<li>I'm not fussy, when it's cheap I can happily live with a scruffy room, but the worst thing is the noise from the Kings Cross road (it doesn't stop all night) and the crappy little desk fan they give you for air con - it was a case of staying awake from the heat or the traffic noise - We chose the heat.</br></br></li>
<li>Desk staff no better, asked for more hangers, took 20mins & then turned up with towels - said she'd go get some hangers - we gave up waiting!</br></br></li>
<li>Taxi they booked my boyfriend for a very early train was a complete rip off - £12 for a 5 min journey!</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">stayed here over the august bank holiday, having previously stayed at other travelodges i expected basic rooms but in all the others the room has been clean and fit for purpose. The farringdon is the exception the room looked like it needed a total overhaul and the carpet was disgusting. The bathroom needed a deep clean and the furniture looked like it was from 1940. I can accept older furniture but can't accept a room that needs a good clean. The reception and restaurant staff were hopeless and their command of the English language was not the best the least i can expect is to be understood in an English hotel when i am speaking English. The upside however was you could just walk in for breakfast without paying and without anyone asking for your ticket to prove you had paid. Just with i had realised this before i prepaid. oh and to top it off if you are on the lower floors you get to hear the tube trains passing every 5 mins I will never return to this hotel i will instead pay a bit more and stay somewhere else</p></li>

What also annoyed me was a bare faced lie i was told by recpetion when i rang to book some months ago.I askled if the Farringdon was the closest travel lodge to the tube station or was the Royal Scott closer,to which i was told that the Farringdon could be viewed from the station and was a 2min walk and the closest one.Lie! Royal scott is the first travel lodge along that road and even that is after a ten min walk.Farringdon is another 5-10 mins from that hotel. Top tip, dont bother coming here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We love this hotel ! Coming from rural Yorkshire we actually enjoy the city night-sounds which occasionally intrude into the room. The bus-stops on both sides of the road are immediately outside the hotel on the Number 63 route from King's Cross making for an easy arrival and departure with heavy suitcases ( Lynne's fault ) and quick access to the tube network from there. Had breakfasts here twice this visit . The ample space in the food/drinks area and the staff's attention to keeping the tables cleared and the hot-meal sections topped-up made these the best 'Travelodge' breakfasts we've ever had, and, believe me, we've had quite a few. O.K. - The room was a little 'tired' - but 'Travelodge' does state this hotel was a not built to their specifications - though perhaps when sheets and duvet covers have holes in them it's time for replacement. The staff were always superb - especially 'Solomon' on reception. Booked during a 'sale' , so costing about £100 for a three-night stay, with breakfast on two mornings this was terrific value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was obvious at both the check in and the bar area that English was not the first language of the staff. My diction is good but repeating oneself time and time again becomes a drag after a while. The room (£116 per night breakfast not incl.) was very scruffy, light fittings hanging at odd angles, door frames chipped and scuffed and skirting boards in very poor condition likewise the carpets. The bedding (sheets and duvet covers) were very thin, probably due to age and the number of times it had been laundered. The bathroom was the highlight (read low light); mould around the edge of the bath, mould on the bathroom ceiling and on the bottom of the shower curtain. An interesting collection of broken wall tiles too. The enamel was chipped in the bath. The towel whilst a good size stank of bleach - possibly from the products used in the commercial laundry. The toilet seat was also broken when I arrived but this was fixed by 18:00 the following day. The highlights; the TV worked as did the kettle in the room. Shameful given this hotel is in our capital city.</p></li>

After reading previous reviews I was a little anxious as to what I should expect, many poor review, other asking for rooms at rear so they were quiet etc etc. I stayed 2 nights. The hotel is a 5 min walk away from Kings Cross station past 2 other Travelodge hotels. On check in I asked ro a quiet roomm at the rear. I was given room 222 and when I located it I found it to be on the main road. The room was clean enough and whilst it is not 5 star I certainly did not pay 5 star prices. It had plenty of hot water, the TV was fine with Tea/Coffee facilities in the room. My small grip was that my "double" bed was 2 singles pushed together but no real problem. The staff were fine and attentive to my needs, Breakfast was Ok, nothing out of the ordinary but quite acceptable and guess what - the room was even quiet. I would stay here again if I had the same room rates so look logically and if you feel the price is right and you are not expecting 5 star than stay there, really its fine.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and my friend stayed here on the 6th June, i had booked it a few months in advance so paid £49 for the room. I had looked on tripadvisor before we arrived so was not expecting a lot from this hotel. When we arrived the hotel from the outside looked pretty grim. We checked in ok and when we got to our room, the room was dirty and the shower didn't work, so we trekked back down to reception and told them. They did not seem surprised at all and quickly gave us a different room . In the 2nd room the window didn't open and the heat in the room was stifling, also the shower worked this time but there was no hot water. So back down to reception again, the 3rd room we had was marginally better but at least the window opened a bit and the shower was warm. The room was so old and the bathroom was pretty disgusting - we were only staying for one night though and we were hardly in the room only to sleep so we didn't just to put up with it. I don't know if it was my imagination but i was itching all night and still am today - 2 days afterwards. I would seriously not recommend this hotel to anyone, spend 20 quid extra and actually get a cleaner nicer room. Yuk.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is easy to find and within walking distance of Kings X - probably about 10-15 minutes brisk walk. We tried a couple of routes and thought the best was - take Gray's Inn Road opposite KX, walk down to Acton Street (past another Lodge). Turn left down Acton Street and right at the end onto King's X Rd. The Lodge is a couple of minutes walk just around the bend on the left. Our room was a reasonable size for London, made smaller by the horrid woodchip effect wallpaper which made the walls feel like they were closing in. We had a double plus (double + single)which meant that if you are a party of 3 you all have a proper bed. The room was clean and well appointed for budget with small bath and shower. The basin taps didn't work properly. This was clearly a room in dire need of an update, but as we were on a saver rate we may have been allocated it. Hopefully, the flexible rate rooms are more recently re-furbished. The road was noisy - no escaping that if it bothers you. I was a bit worried that all the fire doors seemed to be propped open. Overall, great value on the cheap rate if you just want somewhere to sleep. I wouldn't be happy if I'd paid more than £50.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 2 nights in this hotel whilst in London on a leisure visit, our room was at the front of the hotel and i have to say was the nosiest room i have ever stayed in, i expected some noise but it really was relentless, It was mid week and the traffic never gave in day and night!!, We could not open the window as it was bad enough with the window shut,which ment it was incredibly hot!!, we were however provided with a small room fan which made it just about bearable. The nearest tube station is Kings Cross, do not make the mistake of getting off at Farringdon as its decievingly far away!. The room itself was old and tired, although was spotlessley clean,Except for the bathroom which was a bit grubby, the shower curtain and shower head needed a good bleaching and there was a very worrying burnt lamp shade which has to of been a fire hazard?? If you have to stay here ask to be put at the back of the hotel,where i imagine the noise will be a bit less. Also the card machine was broke, and although we never ate or drank here we saw some very hungry and thirsty travellers who didnt have any cash, which to say the least they werent happy about. There is budget and then there is Travelodge Farringdon!!, Avoid!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A group of us travelled to London for a concert and needed to stay somewhere cheep for the one night, It worked out about £25.00 per person for the night so we booked it. Its not the best example of a travelodge, I have stayed in some decent ones but it was only for the one night & we wouldent be staying in all night. The room is awful, really small & bland. The bathroom was old and tired, it had been cleaned but everything was so old it was past the point of cleaning to spruce it up. The beds were really uncomfortable and the room was boiling hot. This was not just my room all in our party (6 rooms) were the same, it needs some investment. I had noticed that the hotel was charging £81.00 for the night on a room only basis, this is more then we paid but if I had to pay that we wouldent have stayed. We got a good internet deal and to be fair can not grumble about £25.00 per night, but cant get over they were getting £81.00 for thier rooms in the condition they were in. Some of us decided to stay an extra night in London, and for an extra £25.00 we stayed in the City Inn which was fantastic & stylish & included breakfast - i dont think any of us would have stayed an extra night at the travelodge. Its a bed factory of the worst kind</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here Sat & Sun in a family room and was quite dissappointed. It was quite a distance from KingsX tube and a bus ride from Farringdon. As I was with 2 disabled teenagers, competing in a national gymnastics competition, the walk became an issue for us (it is also a pain if you are pulling luggage!). The room was extremely small and poor quality. Travelodge have cut back on "frills" so there were no toiletries, hairdryer etc, only one towel and two pillows. You can get extra linen from reception but as there is no telephone line to reception and that means getting the kids ready and ALL heading down! The tv service was rotten (not even 5 channels) and the bathroom well past its best. To their credit the staff were great considering they seemed to be continually under pressure from dissatisfied customers! We got one night at the £26 (online prepaid) rate and the other at the usual £79. The reduced rate night is the only reason I didn't complain but I have stayed at far superior family hotels in London for £70 -£80 per night. Rather than choose this hotel I would advise checking out online sites for good family bargains at much better locations and with better facilities. Great for those who can get the £26 rate but don't pay more!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for a cheap weekend break, and for the £19 we paid for one night’s stay, it was a great bargain! This Travelodge was slightly different to many others we have stayed in outside town centres – it was larger (about 5 floors), and had an excellent cafe/bar area serving drinks, snacks, breakfasts, lunches and dinners. Our room was on the top floor at the front of the hotel. As it was located along a busy road there was some traffic noise, but this wasn’t a big problem for us (there is also a notice about this when booking on the hotel website). The room was similar to other Travelodges – basic, clean and comfortable, but one difference was the flat screen television which was a nice surprise! The bathroom was small but perfectly adequate for a short stay. The hotel is about 15 minutes’ walk from Kings Cross station. We noticed another similar-looking Travelodge only a few minutes away walk from this one (Kings Cross Royal Scot), which confused us slightly! Russell Square, the British Museum and the various restaurants in Southampton Row are about a 20-25 minute walk away. It is possible to walk to Oxford Street and the sights of central London, although this is a longer walk. For a Friday night stay in a central London hotel, we thought this Travelodge was great value for money.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">To be honest I was really worried when I read the reviews on here after I booked to stay two nights at the London Farringdon, however I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was quick even though it was really busy and the staff were polite and accommodating, I had a single room that I requested at the back of the hotel, it was very clean, cosy and comfortable, if a little dated, but that wasnt a problem to me as it was well maintained. There were plenty tea and coffee supplies in the room which were topped up daily and a nice flat screen TV, plenty of seating and wardrobe space for a single room. The bathroom was also very clean with constant hot water and a nice powerful shower. I slept soundly both nights in a very comfortable bed. Breakfast was very nice with plenty of choice, served in a clean dining room. I honestly cant fault this hotel, I agree the decor is a little dated but its not dirty as some reviews state, it is very comfortable, clean and cheap! Its also very close to central London which in itself is a huge bonus. I have used Travelodge a lot and I would definately return to the London Farringdon and recommend it to others. My advice would be dont believe everything you read, ask for a room at the back away from the lifts and as long as you arent expecting a Marriott type hotel you will be very comfortable here</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at The Travelodge Farringdon for 1 night on Sunday 7th January 2007, got a online saver rate of £15 a night. Location - Hotel is on Kings Cross Road about 10 - 15 minutes walk from Kings Cross / St Pancras Train Station & about 30 mins walk to the West End. Only thing you could grumble about is that this hotel isnt located close to a Underground Station, i think the nearest one is back and Kings Cross / St Pancras. Rooms - I was allocated a double room plus, which had a double bed + a single bed, room size was very good & it was clean and tidy upon arrival. Room had a built in wardrobe area plus a desk and bedside table. Colour TV with BBC 1 & 2, ITV & C4 + some radio channels, decore was a little bland and looked a bit dated. Bathroom - Its was a bit on the small side but was fine for what you need it for and just like the room it was clean & tidy upon arrival. I did have a little trouble with the shower pressure at times, one minute it was fine then the next all the pressure would go & then all of a sudden it would come back again. Overall this is a fine hotel if all you want is something basic and your not intrested in anything too fancy. I would recommened this hotel and im giving it 5/5 but only if you can book a saver rate of either £26 or £15 per night, i would not stay here if i had to pay the standard rate of £70.</p></li>

<li>I would recommened this hotel and im giving it 5/5 but only if you can book a saver rate of either £26 or £15 per night, i would not stay here if i had to pay the standard rate of £70.</br></br></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel on 15th January 2010, Checked in on the self service machine which allocated us rm 422. Headed up to it, it was opposite the lift meaning it was going to be extra noisey. The room was tiny, it was small and pokey it smelt of damp the sealant round the sink and bath was all mouldy and black, not to mention the pubic hairs in the sink!! The toilet clearly had never been descaled or cleaned throughly. I went back to reception and was told that we would be moved to a 'superior' room I found this quite funny as travel lodges hardly have superior rooms. We were moved to room 440 whcih was only marginally better as there was a lot more space. But the lights did not work properly they were flickering on and off as though there was a sprit trying to talk to us. In the end the only light we could use was the bathroom one. The bathroom filthy again toilet in need of a good clean, generally a very dirty, grimy hotel in need of a major refurb or even better knocking down and starting again. The bed was worse than sleeping on a concrete floor the base was broken, and the matress sagged and our feet were higher than our head as it was so uneven!! I haved stayed in many travelodges and this is the worst one i would not recommend it even if you pay a saver rate and get it for a good price. Traveloge you should be ashamed of yourselves!!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed our stay at this hotel, our room was clean and the bed comfortable although the pillows that were provided with rather thin and there were only two of them (with one spare). Our room was at the back of the hotel overlooking the car park, there was a little noise at night from the surrounding properties and a train line somewhere in the distance but certainly nothing to complain about. The hotel is only a brisk ten minute walk from King's Cross, which is a big bonus and we felt that £75 per night bed & breakfast was really good value for money in central London. The quality of the food provided was good but the service pretty poor unfortunately, which was its only real downfall. We stayed for 3 nights and on the 3 occasions we attended the restaurant for breakfast, there was a distinct lack of cutlery. A few plastic knives and forks were left for the guests to use, the supply of which eventually ran out as well leaving the full English breakfast a non-option (unless you were willing to tackle a plate of bacon, eggs and sausages with a spoon). The explanation given by the staff was that the cutlery was hard to clean, which in my opinion was an unacceptable excuse. The hotel did seem to be rather understaffed, which may have been a more reasonable explanation had it been offered. All in all we enjoyed our stay and I would definitely use this hotel again if on a budget.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is singularly the most disgusting property! Despite the warning on their website stating "The hotel is an acquisition property and the rooms differ from the illustration and from standard Travelodge hotel rooms" I had the misfortune to stay here. The staff are sultry and less than friendly in that ex Eastern Block way. The rooms are small, very small and need total refurbishment. No radiator controls meant the room is boiling hot or cooler and very noisy with the window open. The bed linens and towels are threadbare and almost see-through. The two pillows on the bed are so pancake thin I had to use both folded in two to make one decent pillow. One electrical socket had a sticker saying it had been disconnected for safety. The second socket should have been disconnected too as it is hanging off the abrasive artex stippled walls. As for the bathroom: filthy and beyond delapidated. Please see pictures attached which are not for the feint hearted. Old pathetic shower with mildew all around the bath tub and a leoginella encrusted plug. Brackets but no glass shelves. The breakfast offered scrambled egg from egg powder and was nowhere up to the standard at other travelodge properties I have stayed in previously. Travelodge offers consistent value accommodation, but at £80+/night this is appalling value. Do not stay here until it's refurbished. FYI I have no connection with this or other hotel chains.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Worth £12. No more.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I paid £12 for a double room in the Travelodge sale and if I had paid full price I would be gutted. At the time of booking I thought I had managed to bag an amazing bargain, but now I think the price I paid was about right. The room was adequate but unwelcoming and shabby. On the plus side the bedding was clean and there was plentiful hot water. The bathroom was dated but generally clean, although the toilet bowl was cracked and the hooks on the back of the door were broken. The room was very small with the double bed pushed right up against the wall on two sides. The mattress was very soft and there was a fag-burn on the duvet. The pillows were wafer thin and when we asked for more we were told there weren't any. The lighting was peculiar; it was all-or-nothing so any hopes of reading in bed evaporated. The remote control for the TV didn't work. The traffic noise, even with double glazing, was very loud. The location of the hotel was absolutely fine for the price. Kings Cross is only a short walk away, or about £6 in a taxi if you have a lot of bags, and the walk felt safe. There aren't many restaurants in the immediate vicinity but, as you're in central London, you would have to be severely lacking in imagination not to be able to find somewhere. Overall, it is clear that this hotel is a relatively recent acquisition and is certainly not up to the usual Travelodge standard. I was quite surprised that Travelodge seem happy to put their name to this hotel as it has certainly undermined my confidence in the brand.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a 2 night stay at the London Farringdon. We were a group of 5 girls, staying in a double and a triple room. Arrived at the hotel more than an hour before checkin time - hotel staff were very accomadating and as 1 of the rooms was ready we were able to checkin immediately. Rooms were clean and comfortable - exactly what we were looking for as a base to stay to explore the city. Staff were very friendly and approachable - we had requested that the double bed be changed into single beds. Upon arrival this hadn't been done but after asking at reception it was completed by the time we returned to the hotel in the evening. The hotel is easily accessible from Kings Cross Station - you can jump on the number 63 bus right outside the station and it stops outside the hotel - or it is only a maximum of a 10 minute walk down Kings Cross Road. We had 1 room at the rear of the hotel and the other at the front. Kings Cross Road is busy throughout the night so if possible when booking it is advisable to request a room at the rear where the noise isn't as noticeable. We didnt eat at the hotel but they do a buffet breakfast for £7.50 - and if you have children they eat for free. The bar in the hotel stayed open till 1am although there are a few pubs on Kings Cross Road which also stay open till 12 - 12.30am - where the staff were all friendly. They are also plenty of little cafes on Kings Cross Road which serve breakfasts. Would definately stay at this hotel again - was definately a bargain at £45 per room per night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The reviews of the Travelodge London Farringdon were pretty dismal but I booked three nights anyway: it was cheap, close to King's Cross Station, could accommodate three adults in the one room with its own facilities, and - basically - it was cheap. Three nights for GBP210 was by far the best deal, and we arrived without pre-conceptions. The room was bright, warm, the bathroom was clean and - best of all - the shower was hot and strong, and the towels were crisply clean, white and huge! The downside: the heater couldn't be adjusted and the room got very warm even with the window open; there were cracked (and repaired) tiles and the toilet bowl was cracked (but clean); the decor was textured-paint walls; pub-carpet; and 80s-style timber panelling. No remote, we had to stand on a chair to change channels or switch it off (the wall control panel didn't work despite Omar insisting it did - we aren't THAT dumb, guys); and our room overlooked the entry where cabbies stood and smoked and argued (not what I wanted to hear at 6.30am). The doors are thin - we were woken at 2am by a neighbouring couple having a loud argument: not the fault of staff (who did apologise anyway). Keiran was especially helpful, seeming to be an all-rounder counter staff, bar man, waiter, and all-round nice helpful guy. It was clean, convenient, and cheap: you get what you pay for so go in with your eyes open. If you want four-star decor you will pay for it. This hotel will be made-over soon, probably become a Premier Inn, and you'll be paying a heap more. Be prepared.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading some blatently awful reviews about this Travelodge I began to worry about what I had paid for! When we arrived it looked a bit dingy from the outside but what do you expect for a budget rate hotel just outside of central London? When we went inside I was pleasently suprised it was nice and clean and the staff on the desk seemed helpful. I had read in a review that rooms at the front of the hotel were noisy, so we asked if it was possible to have a room at the back of the hotel, the receptionist checked and informed us that one was available. On the way to our room we went up the staircase instead of the lift, the stairway was a bit dated and in need of a lick of paint but in the corridors it was nicely decorated and brightly lit. When we got to our room it was lovely and clean and there were no cracks or broken wires as mentioned in other reviews. Although the room lacked air conditioning, the window let in a nice breeze and we weren't disturbed by any exterior noise. The bathroom was ideal, with a full length bath, shower, sink and toilet and although it was clean a few of the tiles seemed in need of a scrub. The shower did cause a slight problem as it was too hot and lowering the temperature caused difficulties, but after a while we figured it out. The location of the hotel was ideal, about a 10 minute walk from both Kings Cross and Farringdon tube stations. With plenty of places to eat and drink in nearby. We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and if I could get another saver rate room I would definately stay in it again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I would have given this hotel a 2 star if only for the 26gbp price for one night I got online six months in advance. However, after arriving from an overnight flight from San Francisco, an hour on the tube, and a 20+ minute walk from Kings Cross/St. Pancras it was disheartening to be told the lift wasn't working and our room was on the 4th floor. (Of course, the guy at the desk said the lift would be fixed "tomorrow" - clearly the lift has been broken for weeks - unbelievable.) The room was big enough and clean enough and even had big, fluffy towels and a tea/coffee pot, though the bed was old and lumpy. And I might have still given two stars if it weren't for being woken up by a fire alarm at 2:30am and then herded outside in the freezing cold for 45 min for what was obviously a false alarm (a card had been jammed in and broken off in the outer door, and the desk clerk and firemen had obviously seen this "prank" before). I was looking for an inexpensive place to rest in London before an early morning train trip to York the next morning out of Kings Cross. Inexpensive - yes. Restful - no. And the Travelodge Royal Scot was closer and without the walk by the s&m shop. As I told my teenage son when he voiced concerns about the area, "One sex shop equals colorful; you have to see two or more to equal seedy." A much better choice is the rather nice Novotel near Kings Cross which I got for 80 bucks on Priceline for our last night. Only 5 mins. walk from the tube and not much more expensive than a crappy, distant, Travelodge that doesn't even bother to fix its lifts for weeks on end.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed in many Travelodges in London city centre and I believe this is the most hit and miss hotel. When I visited in April 2011, I stayed in a large beautiful room which impressed both me and my friend. However, after booking a stay in February, I became a little unsure of the hotel. We were greeted at the desk by a very helpful gentleman named Vitor (who became our saviour throughout the trip) and given our keycard. As we entered our double room, we realised that perhaps part of the hotel had been renovated, and this was one of the older rooms. In my friend's opinion, it resembled "a cave". With old brickwork, a tiny bathroom and overall, a small room, we decided to ask if we were able to change room. Unfortunately, the hotel was fully booked and we were told if we wanted to change for our second night, we would be able to. Although we felt like we were creating a hassle by asking this, Vitor seemed to know where we were coming from and instantly made a note for the next member of staff on shift that we were wanting to change rooms. The next day, we returned to the desk to ask if we were able to change rooms and were presented with another key card for a room which was much nicer than the previous. The hotel is in a rather good area if you are travelling to and from Kings Cross or are needing to be in that specific area. If you are wanting to be in the city centre, where you'd like the ability to walk everywhere, perhaps Covent Garden Travelodge is more suited for you. There are buses and tubes run from near the hotel though, so if you're okay with travelling then this hotel is okay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for one night as i had a concert nearby to go to. I booked this particular hotel due to the location and the fact that it was the cheapest hotel left on the travelodge website for that night. The hotel is approx 10 mins walk from Kings Cross station (which the website advises you is closer than Farringdon), on the walk there you actually (or at least i did) go past two other Travelodges. The Farringdon Travelodge is opposite a Holiday Inn. I checked in without too much bother. Receptionist was fairly friendly and let me check in a hour early. Neither of the lifts worked, which meant using a narrow old school staircase to get to my room. My double room was as you would expect fairly basic. A Small size, and was quite stuffy. When i opened the window, this went away but then another problem of noise came in to play, a job the window was actually doing a good job of keeping out. London drivers like to beep alot, i learnt! General cleanliness of the room was again basic, but sheets, towels (all 2 of them) were clean, the room just needed a better hoover in more discreet areas. The bed was of a okay size and i got a good nights sleep. The bathroom was also compact, the shower didnt work, so i used the bath which wasn't the most comfortable experience of my life. The television quality was terrible though, all 5 channels fuzzy and my remote control didn't work. Pay Tv also looked basic as the "latest" film was War of the Worlds. So Overall, if you manage to get a room for 15 or 26 pounds, then you are getting value, but if full price then i suggest you go for a Premier Travel Inn to get more for your money.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I feel compelled to write a review of this hotel to counter some of the negative reviews that have come before. This is a Travelodge. In Central London. It cost me £59 on a flexible (cancellable) rate. You are not going to find a 4 star hotel at this price in this location. Ever. This hotel was perfect for what we needed: a place to crash after a Christmas party. We checked in on a Friday afternoon about half an hour before the official check-in time and at no extra cost. The staff were friendly and helpful. We were given Room 122 (first floor at the front of the building direclty opposite the lifts) which was clean. The bathroom was minuscule but I wasn't planning a night in with a relaxing bath so this wasn't a problem. We spent most of our time out so the room itself wasn't important. More important to me is the location; because of where the hotel is situated we were able to walk to and from everywhere we needed to get to including Clerkenwell, Russell Square, St Pancras and Euston. We were very late back so I don't know what night time noise was like but from about 8am I started to hear the lift noise and people talking outside the room but that's to be expected with a room directly opposite the lift. The traffic noise didn't bother me too much, neither did the slight rumbling from the tube. It's central London - what do you expect? I'm still utterly perplexed about why they only provide three pillows in a double room but you can ask for more if you need them! I was dreading staying in this hotel after reading the reviews. I needn't have worried. It was clean, cheap, central and the staff were friendly. I wouldn't recommend it for more than a night or two and certainly not for a romantic trip away but if it's a bed for the night you need, you could do a lot worse.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A disgrace to Travelodge”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having stayed at numerous Travelodges throughout the country I had no hesitation in booking rooms at Travelodge Farringdon. I was with a party of 8 and we had 4 twin rooms booked. We were advised over the telephone that although we would not be able to check in to our rooms until 2.00pm, we would be able to leave our bags until check-in. On arrival at reception we were told (very rudely by having a pre-printed notice placed in front of us) that bags could not be left under any circumstances. This was contrary to the advice we were given over the telephone and one of the conditions we required for our stay. Luckily a more helpful member of staff overheard our predicament and asked the receptionist to check if any room were available to check in. There was one available so we were able to leave our luggage in this room. The room was tiny, but this didn’t matter. However what did matter was that the room was a smoking room and stunk of stale smoke and more importantly the single beds were the narrowest single beds I have ever come across. If you lay on your back your arms would dangle out of the edge of each side of the bed. Residents should be informed of this fact beforehand. After spending the day in London we returned to the hotel to check-in the remaining rooms. All went smoothly until one of our party being desperate for the toilet realised that something was amiss when he noticed someone’s wash bag in the bathroom! On checking the room this was indeed someone else’s bedroom which they had given us! BEWARE. The hotel, the staff, the cleanliness, and the decor are all of a poor standard and one which Travelodge should seriously thing about keeping on their books. It certainly does not live up to the previous experiences I have had in Travelodges throughout the country.</p></li>
