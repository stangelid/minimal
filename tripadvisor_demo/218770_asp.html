Dining was 5 star, great for client meetings. And, a great wine cellar. Good service and room rates are moderate so you won't break the bank. Golfers like the locale--but I am not one.</p></li>

Whether you're curling up with a book by the fireplace, taking a swim in one of the heated pools, or relaxing in one of the many whirlpools around the property, it's easy to find serenity anywhere on the property. The golf was great, as was the spa. I also enjoyed the breakfast buffet. The only downside is location; it's a bit of a drive to downtown San Diego.</p></li>

The staff was outstanding, you can tell they all have been with the resort for many years and they do not plan on leaving...everyone loves their job! Love the view and all the remodeling!

The staff goes out of it's way to be friendly, the rooms are spacious (some a little dated) and the food is generally creative and well prepared. What I found lacking on this trip was the fitness center- only 4 treadmills, one not working and TV's not working (or missing) on one bike and one eliptical. All of the exercise units are dated and only a few have working pulse monitors. Needs a refresh!</p></li>

Immediately we were comfortable in our room and had a great night's sleep in the big fluffy king bed. We chose the All play no pay spa day and it was fantastic.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Rancho Bernardo Inn is truly an oasis. I had a an amazing spa treatment in one of their spa casitas with tropical ingredients and we dined at the signature restaurant El Bizcocho. The chef made us a one-of-a-kind tasting that consisted of the most interesting and delicious ingredients, it was an amazing experience. I am not a golfer, but the course looked beautiful and we spent the majority of the day by the pool enjoying the sun and the peace. All in all, it was a perfect staycation for us!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">No complaints with the room or the fancy dining room. The Veranda is another story. We had a dinner for 10 and one patron got more than he bargained for in his salad--a rather large piece of driftwood! Now everyone knows there is no driftwood in Rancho Bernardo so the waittress as much as accused him of planting it there himself. Even worse, when he wrote a letter of complaint, he never received the courtesy of a reply. Have also been there for breakfast. The service was fine--the food cold and nearly inedible.</p></li>

They also have a great spa pool and the spa staff are so friendly and courteous. We then went to dinner at the high end Italian restaurant on site, the service and food was impeccable. After a great dinner we went to our room with our own private garden and relaxed. The next morning we were back at the spa enjoying the amenities again. I highly recomend this place if you are ever visiting the San Diego area.</p></li>

After the festivities, we enjoyed a leisurely dinner buffet on the Veranda. The weather was perfect, as was our room and all of the amenities. We'll definitely come back for more local mini vacations. Joy took our reservation and also assisted with a change of plans before we arrived. She was polite, gracious and provided the best customer service I've received in a long time. Thanks RB Inn!</p></li>

The cook/bartender was great with the kids and cooked hamburgers/hot dogs that were a huge hit. The fire pit in the Veranda restaurant was a great way to relax at night. The resort is close to the wild animal park so we were able to have a fun day excursion. The staff was very friendly and very attentive. The rooms were well appointed and the hotel provided a tent in the room for the kids to "camp out". Well done!</p></li>

The wine selection is by far the most extensive that my wife and I have ever seen and the attention to detail by the staff is unmatched. The golf course is both picturesque and very challenging, especially the 18th hole. You will not be disappointed. We have been staying at the Inn for over 10 years when in town.</p></li>

Also, we never encountered better customer service at ANY establishment...ever (restaurants, stores, etc.). The staff ALWAYS went above/beyond the call of duty. There was never a 'bad vibe' received from anyone associated with the hotel, no matter the request. The attitudes of all staff members was always upbeat and never once did we feel like we were being an imposition. We will be informing all friends and family of what a wonderful stay we experienced at the Rancho Bernardo Inn. Thanx!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our golf group has taken a golf trip for 30 years, same 8 guys! We go in March every year. We chose RBI because we hadn't been to Ca and their was golf on the property. What a great spot, rooms were great and very comfortable, food and drink were excellent we had at least 4 meals there. The staff were great. I loved the Starbucks. The golf course was very well maintained and in excellent condition. You can't beat SD weather! We have been to HHI, Destin, Naples, Orlando, Scottsdale and Myrtle Beach. The vote for next year's destination was unanimous we are going back to the Rancho Bernardo Inn.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 2 nights in RM 307--There was a nice fountain in front of the rear sliding door with a bistro table set. The room was clean, and okay --and the room was very quiet. I couldnt hear the people next door, which was a good sign. Had some Thai food from the restaurant onsite and it was pretty good. Booked room from hotels dot com, at $490.00 for two nights inclusive of taxes, which I thought was a bit high and did NOT include breakfast. This is a Preferred Hotels and Resorts property, so make sure you check with your credit card issuer for additional discounts, as I did not have time to do that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were looking for a great place to get away and spark some romance. The Rancho Bernardo Inn was the perfect answer. It's only 20 minutes from downtown San Diego but the grounds suggested somewhere far from the crowds. We loved strolling the grounds and there were so many quiet places for us to just sit and talk, laugh and watch the abundant bird life that we couldn't try them all. The staff was excellent and the food was fabulous. Our room with a private patio was just what we were looking for. Wait! If I give them a good review everyone will want to come to our quiet little hide-away... It was awful! (Wink)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am an event planner and several of my clients have hosted their weddings and events at the Rancho Bernardo Inn. I love when brides and grooms pick RBI as their venue. RBI catering and staff are very easy to work with and their events are "spot on" compared to other venues I've held events at. Their grounds also offer several perfect backdrops for ceremonies, and wedding photographers love the picturesque qualities RBI has too. RBI also offers a comfortable stay for guests with great restaurants, a spa, golf, and pools. Its warm, hacienda/early California feel is very inviting and relaxing for any special event or getaway.</p></li>

From the moment of arrival (where we were greeted by a lovely Receptionist named Hannah) until departure, every aspect of our stay was very relaxing yet rejuvenating. We leisurely roamed the property and everywhere we turned we met smiling employees' faces. The grounds were immaculate and the overall atmosphere was energetic yet peaceful. I would highly recommend this beautiful property to anyone (and as a District Travel Manager for AAA I've stayed at quite-a-few very nice resorts over the years).</p></li>

We spoke with several of the friendly staff who were catering to our need. This lovely inn is set amoung beautiful trees, lush landscape and a championship golf course. We got a terrific deal on the room rates through Skyauction.com. We were lucky as we found out that the hotel was totally sold out.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Without reservation I highly recommend the Rancho Bernado Inn. The setting is beautiful, the inn lovely and comfortable, and the staff definitely goes the extra mile. For example, in the midst of a widespread power outage in southern CA, the staff quickly pulled together an outdoor grill night so guests would not go hungry. In addition, when a restaurant, where we were going to have a dinner for 60 guests cancelled at the last minute due to water safety concerns, the RBI was able to accommodate our dinner guests with a fabulous buffet, all with only 3 hours notice. I was amazed by their skill, eagerness to please, and general hospitality. We definitely plan to return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the RBI with our two small children and had a wonderful experience. The family pool was great fun with other guests and their children. The rooms were outstanding. The 42" plasma was a hit for our 3 year old to watch cartoons. Rooms were tastefully decorated and recently renovated. The service was outstanding from the moment we arrived. Room service was great and they called about an hour after our meal arrived to ensure everything was to our liking. I also called to request something from housekeeping. They brought it almost instantly and then the front desk called about 30 minutes later to make sure everything had arrived. All in all it was a wonderful experience!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a plesant surprise for my Boyfriend and I! We stayed here for a wedding we were attending in San Diego. We thought it was a little far, but WELL WORTH the extra miles. So relaxing, beautiful decor, lovely staff and clientele. The rooms were HUGE! The best part? Seperate adult pool and kids pool! Never felt like I was going to get splashed when I just wanted to relax. It was a big old school for younger folk, but I happen to enjoy that, so it worked out for us. The only con was the restaurant (not El Bizcocho) had terrible wait svc. But we were so relaxed, it hardly mattered. Ohh and we got an amazing deal on a travel website for the room! Try off peak - and you'll be surprised what you pay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family just returned from a quick weekend trip to RB Inn and we all had one of the best experiences... there's so much to do there for the whole family. Lots of activities for both young kids AND teens (Kids Rule, Parents Drool promotion) where kids get wrist bands for unlimited food and activities. We even got a little adult time to ourselves since the kids always had something to do. Rooms were spacious and very clean. We spend most of the time at the Santiago pool and the staff (Joe and Alexanderia) took great care of all of us. Meals at Veranda Restaurant was very reasonable and the service was supreme. Check out the floors if you ever visit... very cool decor. We hope to visit again very soon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is the second year in a row that our family (as well as four other families) have gone to the RB Inn for Mothers Day Weekend. We love the property! It is like a hidden gem in San Diego! The golf course and tennis courts are amazing and the Mom's rave about the spa. The kids love the pool areas and the putting competitions. The Mothers Day Brunch is top notch and if you feel like splurging, El Bizcocho is a five star dining experience! Unbelievable! The rooms are extremely nice and my wife wants to find out how to buy one of the beds and all the bedding for our house. The staff was extremely professional, courteous and accomodating. We look forward to next mothers day as this is becomming a annual tradition for us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stay at this hotel every year for our anniversary since this is where we got married. The hotel has only gotten better! The new day spa area is absolutely amazing. I went and had a facial and the room was so relaxing (as opposed to many stand alone spas). The spa had a resting area, steam room, showers, lockers (you get robes and slippers), etc. I also used the workout room before and this was really nice (big windows and not busy). My husband golfs while I am at the spa nd loves it! This hotel also has many pools so if you are buy yourself and go to the spa's pool but if you have children, there is a pool just for families with even pool toys. The staff is very professional and the whole feel about the resort is high class.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have travelled extensively as a large family group complete with young children and teenage girls.

The gals all enjoyed the spa while I (Grammy) joined Granddaddy and the guys in some golf. Both have all wanting to return next year. There is not a lot for the younger children to do as they cannot (understandably) use the spa pools with their moms. One kind dad took them to the zoo. There is tons to do in the San Diego area but you are always anxious to get bak to the Inn. There is a warmth and peacefulness there that draws you in. Add fabulous food, flawless grounds and a pleasant staff and you have a total winner.</p></li>

The hotel is beautiful and there is a serene and peaceful feeling thru out the hotel. I must say the staff is exceptional in their customer service and their attention to detail for the most relaxing and enjoyable time. If you want to really have a relaxing time,please take time to enjoy the spa, its wonderful and the staff especially arlene is excellent. A great place for dining was the Veranda, Mr. James Cassady made sure our request and needs were met even though it was a hectic Saturday Night. The Sunday Brunch is also wonderful with excellent food. It definetly was a home away from home only difference is we felt very pampered with all the wonderful help and attention from the staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The entire experience was phenominal from reservation to check-out. The entire staff was knowledgeable, professional and very friendly. The room, overlooking the 10th tee, was spectacular. Spacious, light, bright and perfectly decorated. The grounds, perfectly maintained, invite you to stroll about, a very romantic setting. Several outside woodburning firepalces add to the magical feeling. The reception area and surrounding courtyard were beautifully decorated for Christmas enhancing the warm and inviting feeling of the property. Sunday brunch at El Bizcocho is a must, one of the best we have experienced. The pianist is the perfect touch to an elegant meal. We can also personally recommend The Rancho Bernardo Inn as the perfect location for a wedding, as we were married here in 1993.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got back from a wonderful stay at the Rancho Bernardo Inn. The grounds are immaculate and peaceful. The sweet smell of honeysuckle greeted us everytime we opened our front door. The staff works hard to insure that every guest is happy with their stay - excellent customer service. We really liked the fact that this resort is in the the center of a residential neighborhood; we believe this is what makes the resort so peaceful - no hustle and bustle. We went to the Wild Animal Park and San Diego Zoo during our stay. The Wild Animal Park is only 15 minutes away, and the SD Zoo is about 30 minutes away. I would highly recommend this resort if you want to get away from it all and enjoy the sound of silence; there is no night life at this resort - strictly relaxtion, spa and golfing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I will start off by saying this resort used to be among my favorites. And the many things it has going for it are beautiful grounds, a lovely spa, and a nice golf course. Unfortunately, their customer service has some major problems, which I will not go into since I have addressed them with the property directly. But the main problem, I think, is that this "Inn" has decided they now want to be a large event venue and in doing so, have lost all their focus on their quality of guest service. It has the potential to be a really special, romantic place for a getaway, but our last visit was a bit of a nightmare. Sad, because as I said, if they really aspired to it, they could do so much better. I hope the resort management will get back to basics and remember that excellent guest service is what will make or break this property.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the RBI when I was on a 3-day conference, and I enjoyed the ambiance of the place. The Spanish colonial decor is very in keeping with the area. The grounds are beautiful, with Mediterranean courtyards and fountains. There are four computers for guest use, two in the lobby and two in the cafe, and a big flat screen TV in the room. The food served at the receptions was good, but not great--too many fried things. I did not have a chance to try the spa or the El Bizcocho Restaurant, but the food served at the bar was decent and very reasonably priced. The Veranda Restaurant was closed for remodeling. The property is rather remote, well off the freeway in the middle of a residential neighborhood, so it is not a place to stay if you are in the area for sightseeing or nightlife, but for a relaxing escape, this is the place!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just stayed at Rancho Bernardo Inn for a 4 days week-end for our 2 years anniversary, and we had a wonderful time. Everyone was very nice and the service was good. The room was very nicely renovated and spacious, with a nice terrace. We also used the Spa and we received great service and it was very relaxing Spa. I would highly recommend having dinner and brunch on Sunday at El Bizcocho, the food was absolutely delicious, some of the best food I have had and great service. The only 2 issues we had were that we were on the 3 floor and there is no elevator and I am 6 months pregnant so after a long day it was a little hard, and the service and food at La Veranda (at least for breakfast) was very poor and slow and the food was not very good. But, otherwise I would definetly recommend the hotel for a nice and quiet stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent three nights at the Rancho Bernard Inn with colleagues and clients at a corporate event, and found it relaxing and charming. I was given a large room with a small, hedged in seating area outside a picture window. The bed was comfortable and I slept very well. The bathroom was large and everything worked, and it had two sinks so one guest could shower as the other got themselves ready. The conference facilities were great and are surrounding by lovely well tended grounds. We were able to spend time enjoying the grounds and getting some sun because the conference center was surrounded by lovely landscaping and accessible walking paths. The only problem I had was finding electric outlets to charge my phones and computer. They were there, but hidden, and I eventually used the outlets in the bathroom rather than unplug the lights.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">overall the property was adaquate but overpriced, really need to step up on the ground maintenance. service was poor at the veranda restaurant. had reservations at their higher end restaurant, but they later booked it for a private party. lots of other guests were also left in the lurch and unfortunately the management didn't think ahead to completely staff their second restaurant which was only half full. i was told that they didn't have enough servers to seat anymore parties. this left only the lounge area to get any food and they were swamped. luckily, the one server working this area was wonderful (vanessa you are great!) also, the adult pool only had 10 lounge chairs. asked a staff person to see if they could bring some up from the family pool, he made a phone call but nothing ever happened. overall, disappointed and would not return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The golf resort is quite large and spread out and the resort grounds are very pretty, although the resort is incongruously located in the middle of a residential neighborhood. I was here for a conference (it seems to be a popular venue for business meetings), so did not get to enjoy the hotel facilities much unfortunately. A pity as the spa looked very inviting. There is a decent gym which overlooks the scenic golf course. The business conference facilities were superb, with a very nice outdoor garden area perfect for cocktails in the evening. The resort rooms were quaint, comfortable, although I had problems sleeping as the pillows just did not agree with me. Housekeeping was a little sloppy as well. This is probably a great place for middle-aged couples and families who want a weekend away. The resort is located about 30 mins from San Diego central.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was in San Diego at the harbor area with my husband on business and we had a few extra days to spend time before heading back East... I searched for a resort and spa and found Rancho Bernardo Inn and boy am I glad!!!. This was a wonderful relaxing vacation. I went and had a couple of spa treatments and spent the rest of the day at the spa pool and ammenities. The next day my husband and I played golf and it was again a great experience. The entire staff was pleasant and helpful, wether it was at the pro shop, the spa, the front desk or the restaurants!! We had the opportunity the next morning to play golf again (early) and the Inn provided us with a late checkout time. I had no problem with the internet or anything. We had three lovely meals and drinks and I am hoping to talk my friends into going with us next time !!! Thanks Rancho Bernardo Inn...it was GREAT!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Rancho Bernardo Inn is beautiful like an old time country club with a good veranda restaurant, GREAT COFFEE. The staff appear to be young and sharp, however the telephone receivers in one of our rooms did not work and the refrigerator was overheating and leaking water on the floor. Both of these were reported three times and never fixed. One of the staff would come out right away and say they would fix all...but never did. All staff were polite. Valet parking a good value at $12 a day plus Required service fee $20 a day. The property had a very safe feel and appearance. Lots of activities going on all the time, i.e. weddings, meetings reunions. Fun to watch If you like beer, you would love it. 6 a day in the fridge. However if you ask for juice or ONE small wine as a substitue, the written request taped to the fridge was not acknowedged. Some that stayed with us would put the rating at a 4 star.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Upon our arrival at the Inn, we were greeted by the valet parking attendants, with big welcoming smiles who were handsomely attired in vintage golfing duds. Our good mood had already been set by the friendly thoughtful assistance with our reservations by Lyndi. Upon check in, Mandy helped in her sweet, informative manner to guide us to the most beautiful and comfortable room (#629) on the ranch. The gorgeous grounds have quiet serene golf course views, spashing fountains, chirping birds and meandering paths that somehow give the illusion of solitude. We felt the ranch and staff were there simply to cater to us! While there are several jacuzzi hot tubs and 2 pools on the property for guests use, there is a $30 charge for the use of The Spa pool, which also has other amentities for an additional charge. I felt this $30 charge and parking fees to be excessive. All in all the time at the Rancho Bernardo Inn was perfectly delightful!!!</p></li>

Premium room was good - the hotel needs newer plush toels - the pool towels were better than the room towels. I wasn't treated by the hotel staff as well as I would have like for the $269 a night - before taxes and all. Veranda restaurant is good - good view - almost all waiters were good except for one. BEWARE - The pool on Rancho Bernardo Inn's website is the SPA pool with cabana's - no kids allowed - the family pool is nothing special at all....plus there was next to nobody staying at the hotel - I think I was being lied to over the reservation phone when I was haggling over room prices - wasn't a WOW experience.</p></li>

It is evident that there is excellent management and training in the area of carrying out excellent customer service. We appreciate how staff engaged in conversation, asked questions and quickly responded to any requests. I wish we had this service everywhere we visited. It truly made all the difference for us. We love the attention to detail. We were celebrating our Anniversary and upon arriving, we had a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries along with a personal note from the Manager. Nice personal touch! Also our server at the El Bizcocho wished us a Happy Anniversary (without any questions or prompting) and we were served a complimentary glass of champagne in honor of our celebration. The service was above and beyond and the resort was beautiful. Thank you to the management and staff for all the effort to make our stay truly enjoyable!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at this hotel on a Friday afternoon, and although we had to fight a lot of traffic to get there from the airport we were pleasantly surprised when we finally arrived. The staff was very friendly and attentive, and we were checked in very quickly. We were escorted to our room, and upon arriving the young man carrying our bags even offered to retieve ice for us. We ate dinner at the Restaurant there and it was very good and fairly reasonable. The location was not the greatest for what we wanted to do, but would be great for those looking for an intimate and exclusive hotel with a great golf facility on site. We would have to drive about 30-45 minutes to the gas lamp district and about 20 minutes to pacific beach. I was there on business and was impressed by the facilities overall. The resort is vast, and the conferance facilities are top notch and very comfortable. Overall we were very happy with our stay, and I would recommand this hotel to friends and family.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My girlfriend and I booked this hotel through a Living Social package to enjoy a quick getaway from Los Angeles to celebrate our anniversary. It was our first visit to this hotel, and also our first time using such a discounted package. Quite frankly, we were ready for the other shoe to drop at any moment - assuming the deal sounded too good to be true. Boy, were we wrong. Without any hesitation, the hotel staff honored everything we were granted in our package - and more. A special thanks for the complimentary delivery of champagne and strawberries by the hotel manager - proof positive the folks at the Rancho Bernardo Inn know how to pay attention to the small details. And the food? Top notch. We dined at both restaurants, and I can honestly say the meal at El Bizcocho was one of the best meals I've ever had - the chef/waiter even allowed substitutions to accommodate our requests. I highly recommend this wonderful hotel - first class food, service, rooms, and attention to detail.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved this place! The best are the best I have ever slept in. The rooms were spacious and the amenities were great. It is beautifully updated and didn't leave us wanting for anything. In addition the property is beautiful! Our only regret is that we couldn't have stayed longer. I think this is a great place for a romantic get away, business convention or family vacation. The only draw back to this place is that parking can be a problem. They do have valet service but I would come late and leave early and didn't want to wait for my car so I parked myself. The spaces are small and limited in number. They should have golf carts to drive from the distant parking places to the hotel because although I don't mind the exercise, it isn't much fun to haul heavy bags that distance. We saw 2 weddings when we were here and they were both amazingly beautiful! Another great thing is a nice mall is just a short drive away. It was a pain to get to Seaworld from this hotel but so worth the drive! :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Let me start by saying I am the type of person who values free meals, good lodging and practical things like wi-fi above looks. Having said that, this is a pretty nice place. We stayed a night for our anniversary and it has the looks of a classic Inn-type establishment. Their pool and jacuzzi's are open until 11 which is great and the room was pretty nice as well. They charge a fee for wi-fi, local calls, any and all food (no vending machines at all) and just about anything else you can think of. Beware that they try to include this "resort fee" on your bill automatically, I asked for it to be taken off. HDTV in the room, but no point since they only have limited channels and I don't think any of it actually was HD. They of course have a golf course and spa on site (kind of the point for most people) and I am sure the ladies love this type of place. Bottom line: for a romantic getaway where you can enjoy a few rounds while the wife gets a rubdown this place is for you. For any other travelers, go with a more practical choice.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at the Rancho Bernardo Inn as part of our honeymoon. Right from the off, we were well impressed. We were allocated a large comfortable room overlooking the golf course. Room furnishings were excellent and everything seemed to work fine - including the 42" plasma screen TV. Rooms were well sound proofed, so we got a great nights sleep every night. Staff were always helpful and friendly, especially Karen the Concierge, who gave us lots of advice and tips on things to do locally. There are a number of swimming pools on the property, including one exclusively for adults, which helps if you are trying to just chill out. Food was excellent, although dinner for 2 in the restaurant costs about $160+tip, with breakfast for 2 approx. $60+tip, so the tab can build up during your stay. The only negatve for us was a couple of sneaky charges added to our bill at checkout, particularly one for $15/day for replenishing coffee making supplies in your room (we didn't even use these!). All in all, a grat place to go for a relaxing stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were attending a wedding reception at the Orfila Winery in Escondido and wanted to spend the night at a hotel close to the winery. We ended up at the Rancho Bernardo Inn by chance through an amazing Hotwire deal. The resort is located in the middle of a residential neighborhood about 10 miles northeast of San Diego. If you are looking for a relaxing golf/spa/wine tasting weekend away Rancho Bernardo Inn is an awesome choice. If you want to spend lots of time in downtown San Diego, this is not the place for you because of the location of the resort. When you walk through the front doors of the resort, you feel as if you've entered a warm, private hacienda. Although an older property, the rooms have been beautifully refurbished and the grounds meticulously maintained. Unfortunately we were only there overnight and did not get to take advantage of the resort amenities, however made sure to treat ourselves to breakfast because we were told by a friend that the food there was amazing. We ended up having brunch at Veranda and it did not disappoint! We enjoyed our short stay and would definitely return!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed over the Thanksgiving Holiday. Room was nice but was next to where the maids go in and out for supplies. Door slammed from 6a.m. to 10a.m. And I do mean slammed. We went to breakfast which was included in the $199 + tax + resort fee + parking charge. Service slow in the Veranda. The room itself seems too small for the property when they cannot use the patio to serve. We went there on our second day and was told it was a half hour wait. We did not wait. The next day we went at 10a.m. for breakfast and were told we had just missed the crowds that had a wait time of an hour. I don't know about you but wasting 2 hours on breakfast when you have places to go and people to see just doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I'd eat in the room next time. Food was ok. My main complaint would have to be that they allow smoking on balconies. If you want to leave your sliding door open for fresh air and there is a smoker next door - it goes right into your room. They should really make designated smoking and non smoking buildings. That way they could really segregate and control this second hand smoke better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Rancho Bernardo Inn is one of those resorts at which you need to stay for several days to unwind and enjoy the amenities. Unfortunately I was there for only one night, and that on business. From my brief stay, though, I saw that it is a warm, inviting resort consisting of a cluster of smallish buildings connected by winding garden paths. There are numerous small fountains and tranquil gardens scattered throughout. The lobby is an upscale rustic Southwestern decor, with an open fireplace. Very inviting and comfortable. The property is reached by driving to the far end of a residential area, meaning that there is no street traffic or noise. The rooms are extremely comfortable and are well equipped for business travelers. The inn automatically charges an all inclusive fee, so you don't have to pay extra for wireless internet access in the room or throughout the property. The hotel's business center was not all that well equipped, but the Rancho Bernardo town center (with a Kinkos) is nearby. It was a great location for our small business meeting, and I can see where a few days here could be very relaxing.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I read other reviews where this hotel double charged or wrongly charged their guests, and the guests had a terrible time getting the incorrect charges reversed. I ignored them due to the seeming abundance of good reviews. Wow, am I ever sorry. This place is a nightmare. Suddenly nobody knows anything (I don't have access to that, my supervisor is gone today, blah blah blah) and can't even confirm exactly what they billed to my credit card, let alone why. I show them my credit card statement and even then, they say they don't see where they billed for the charges that are clearly listed on the statement. Its like falling down the rabbit hole; zero accountability. They are incapable of doing ANYTHING but charging credit cards and then pretending like they didn't do it. Frankly, its unbelievable. Which is why I ignored the previous reviewers who had the same problem. Well, believe it. I travel at least 40% of the year and have *never* been subjected to the degrading run-around these con artists have going. There are tons of places to stay in San Diego, choose somewhere else if you value your sanity and/or expect an ethical hotel management system.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here from September 11,2006 to September 15,2006. At first we we're very pleased and excited. The employees were very nice and the grounds were well kept. At check-in we received a letter stating that we were on the "Stay and Play" package which allowed us options. It was one option per person per day. So my husband and I chose spa options. Since I was surprised that we were given options I asked the spa pesonnnel, the front desk (twice) if this was correct. All answers were ,"Yes, go ahead. You will not be charged." So my husabnd and I used to the options. At checkout the spa charges were removed because we were on a package. Our final bill was $455.98. Well, today I look at my credit card statement and there is an additional charge for $645.00. I call the hotel and the manger says, "Sorry, you weren't on that package so we billed you for the options you used." Of course I was not told that anytime during the stay or even when we checked out. The charge is still being disputed. Would I have stayed here again if this would not have happened? Yes. But since this has happened I won't go anywhere near this place again. All I have to say is buyer BEWARE!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family (all 13 of us) stayed a weekend at Rancho Bernardo for our folks 50th wedding anniversary. We had heard that they recently remodelled and were looking very forward to our stay. Upon arrival we realized the folks forgot their clothes, that was a hoot, but we remedied it by shopping at the nearby mall, which was an added plus to the location of this resort. The staff seemed friendly at all times, even when requesting feather pillows and extra shampoo's for our rooms. The most impressive aspect of the weekend was the fabulous Dining on the premises. The 2 Restaurants were equally wonderful. The staff at the Restaurants were exceptional. Service was flawless.The food was fresh, delicious and plentiful. The package deals are really the way to go, as they offer 2 meals a day at either Restaurant for 2. You save quite a bit by purchasing your room this way. The rooms are nice, complete with 2 sink bathrooms, a small refrigerator, a safe, a large flat screen TV with cable, and plenty of extra space to lounge. You can request a lake view as well, but all views are lovely from the balconies. Overall, a great place to spend some quality time with loved ones at an affordable price.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just back from a business getaway to the Rancho Bernardo Inn. This is a great spot to hold a business meeting and retreat. The place was renovated 2 years ago, yet some of the room details could have been paid closer attention to. The caulking around the shower for instance, was sloppy and some of the tile work crooked. Holes patched were obvious as well. The rooms are quite comfortable and well appointed. Although the walls are very thin and you may easily hear the snorer next door. Aside from those minor annoyances, the hotel shines. The lobby has comfortable seating areas and gives a hacienda feel. The staff is warm, helpful, and friendly. The food, while adequate in the restaurant, was quite tasty during our meetings as well as at the nightly parties. The bar is cozy, albeit a bit dated. The spa is highly rated and was praised by all. Golf was also well enjoyed by my collegues. Meeting space is great for a group of our size (300) and is in a seperate building, away from the main rooms. This made me feel as though, once the meeting was over, I was really able to get away from it all. All-in-all, I'd recommend Rancho Bernardo for it's comfortable surroundings as a business/golfing/spa retreat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My most recent stay at the RB Inn was the 20th -24th of July. I have stayed there many times since 2003. This place embodies classic Southern California decor with exquisitely designed grounds and a remarkably consistent high level of service. I look forward to my trips to this area in large part due to the quality of this property. There are two pools on the property, one for adults and one for family, but I highly recommend the pool at the spa for an exquisite experience. If you get a chance to get a massage by Corey or a facial by Heidi I strongly suggest you take that opportunity. Both of these people offer world-class treatments with an easy-going, yet professional manner. There are a number of separate buildings of guest rooms within the complex, each with different qualities, but the rooms are generally all well-appointed with super comfortable beds. The one downside I have noticed is the breakfast on the Terrace overlooking the golf course has gotten less imaginative and more streamlined. I have not eaten in the other restaurants in a few years. The combination of a great, well-maintained property staffed with people who are sincerely interested helping the guests makes for an unforgettable and sublime experience.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “The $19/night Survivor Package was a really great deal - but bring lightbulbs & park outside resort on street.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got one of the $19/night Survivor Package rooms and stayed Fri. & Sat. nights. (It was actually $34/night because they tack on a $15 "resort fee".) With the Survivor Package, you camp out in the room - no lights, towels, soap, shampoo, or even a bed. But there's electricity and we brought 5 lightbulbs so we had plenty of light and also free high-speed internet, plus we had our sleeping bags, towels, soap, etc. There's a working refrigerator, safe, and big-screen TV. There's also 2 nice big easy chairs in the room and 2 smaller chairs on the porch. The room was very nice, right near one of the pools. Great pools and jacuzzis. Beautiful grounds. Fabulous lobby building, excellent (expensive!) restaurants(we brought some of our own food), cafe, and sports bar. Wonderful service from nice friendly staff. Huge golf course if you play golf, tennis courts, fitness center, spa, meeting and wedding reception areas, etc. We went on both Sat. and Sun. to nearby wine-tasting rooms in beautiful wineries (Bernardo and Orfila) then spent the rest of the day at RB Inn. The RB Inn charges $10/night for parking though (in a lot a long way from your room), so we unloaded our stuff and then parked outside on the street (about 30 feet further than the resort lot) and saved $20.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I write this letter to tripadvisor users to save you from staying somewhere where your dollar isnt worth the stay. My family and i have stayed here three times and during theses times nothing seems to change. The grounds are kept clean you can find cans, water bottles etc in plant areas which isnt a great to see. The rooms look fine when you check in, but you have problems with plumbing and air conditioning. On one of our visits the room had the loudest air condition i've ever heard in my hotel stay and it would come on and off. On our last visit which was thanksgiving weekend we were extremely disappointed and have decided we are not going to have visit again. First of all we checked in to two rooms ; one for us and one for my mil (mother in law). When we arrived her room had water by the sliding door and our bathroom was experiencing some plumbing issues because the sinks were making sounds etc. The next day mil room was imense in water (bathroom and hall area); we were told they had some sort water issue upstairs, but didnt mention that on the first day! they were blaming the water sprinklers. Our dinner was also horrible the turkey was dry, the dessert was probably out of a box. Do yourself a favor stay somewhere else like the lowes might be out of the way, but we havent had a problem there.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here over the Memorial day holiday and it was my first time visting. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and from the minute you walk in, the service is excellent. You get the feeling that the staff is willing to go the extra mile to satisfy you and on a few occassions, and they did. As far as the rooms, they are very clean and our room had a balcony which overlooked a courtyard and you could hear the noise of multiple fountains. Unfortunately, there are some things that the hotel needs to work on. First and foremost, the place definitely needs a remodel. The hallways, rooms, and the bathrooms need a facelift. The bathrooms especially are very dark and depressing. The adult pool definitely needs to be redone as most of the pool tiles had cracked and stuff was starting to grow out of them. Furthermore, the hotel is located about 30 minutes from downtown San Diego. I say this because we spent most of our time in Downtown since we are in our early 30's and the hotel was just too boring to hang out. As an example, we wanted to get some starbucks from the coffee shop at around 7 PM and it was already closed. You get the feeling that everything shuts down at 6 PM...LOL Overall, if you are 40+ or traveling with kids, this place is perfect, younger crowds, I recommend looking somewhere in Downtown San Diego where you are closer to the daytime activities, .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I attended a NSM in Jan, where we had over 100+ employees staying for four days, all meals included, with snack and beverage service. The food was nothing extraordinary, and the service was fair. My second day at the conference my BMW was stolen out of the parking lot sometime before 7:30 p.m. Valet and Security were less than helpful as was the Front Desk Manager. All they did was call the non-emergency police so I could make a report. They never offered to take me home (I'm a local resident) and when asked if I could use their car service (they have two Lincoln Town cars) they informed me they only drive within a 5 mile radius of the hotel and could not make an exception to take me to Carlsbad, when asked if they could pick up the tab for the taxi, they declined, and offered me a drink ticket for the bar. The front desk manager apologize and also informed me a few months back they had a flat screen TV stolen out of their room and a security guard assaulted. Word got out quickly that my vehicle was stolen and needless to say, the local employees were on edge and checking on their cars throughout the day, not a good way to spend your time at a National Sales Meeting. For the amount of money they charge, their customer service is terrible and their security isn't any better. All in all a very poor experience and my company will not be going back, nor will the employees.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here in Sept, just before the horrible fires experienced in that area. The hotel is advertised as being completely upgraded, but that isn't completely accurate. It's evident that the rooms were superficially redone, but there were many remainders of what used to be a dated hotel. Still, our room was comfortable and clean and featured a large flatscreen (made for a happy sweetheart). The restaurant was the star of this property. The service was EXCELLENT, food was fabulous, wine was out of this world. Sure, it was pricey, but I've had the good fortune to experience some of the nicer restaurants both in the States and overseas and this one could compare with the best. One hitch: we were told that the restaurant had a no-denim policy. As I'd only brought 'dressy' jeans, we had to run out and purchase some slacks. I was not happy to see several women seated close to us wearing either faded denim jackets or even VERY casual washed out jeans (and an oversized sweatshirt!). However, once we brought our concern to the restaurant manager, he completely agreed with our observation and frustration, explained that it was the hostess' first night on the job and she didn't know how to correctly handle the other guests' wardrobe gaffes. Without us asking, he comped us our wine (an over $200 'gift'!) and brought us an on-the-house dessert that was beyond fantastic. The golf course was nice - nothing special, not great not horrible. Overall, our weekend was lovely.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Every aspect of our weekend at this resort was exceptional. The hotel itself is gorgeous - a word I overheard many times from other guests also! Although there were 4 rehearsal dinners and 3 weddings that weekend, they were barely noticeable - the grounds are laid out so there is no excessive noise, no crowding... The staff - the whole staff - were the most helpful and accommodating I've encountered. Dinner and breakfast at the Veranda were delicious and reasonable; brunch at El Bizcocho was over-the-top (although, one or two seafood dishes did not benefit from sitting around awhile.) The q/q room was comfortable and very roomy; plenty of space for 2 ladies to spread out without tripping over each other. The double-vanity in the bathroom is a nice touch, as is the small balcony with chairs. The only small problem was our room near the stairs, where it got a bit noisy during late-evening returns and early-morning check-outs. The spa atmosphere was relaxing and the treatments were as good as we expected them to be. Prices are high, but par for the course at a resort like this. Adult-only pool with cabanas was incredibly tranquil; spa lunch poolside was healthy and delicious. I booked thru Southwest Airlines Vacations, and expected a "value" experience, but on check-in, the manager threw in an invitation to the Manager's Reception and free breakfast at the Veranda, plus free items in the mini-fridge, like beer, wine, and snacks. Extra touches like this, and the free shuttle to other restaurants or shopping, made us feel like we were totally pampered all weekend. Love this place!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For full disclosure purposes, I use to work at the front desk there so I can still get employee rates from people I still know there. I have stayed at the RBI several times over the years, the most recent being at the end of December. There are many things that are good about RBI and a couple that are not. Good: - The grounds at the Inn are beautiful from the moment you drive onto the property until you get to your room and then from your room to the restaurant or the 1st tee or the spa or the bar (you get the idea). - The rooms are very very nice, depending on where your room is located. The best rooms at the hotel are 600 Building (upstairs), 700 building (upstairs), 500 building (upstairs facing the golf course), then 600 downstairs and 700 downstairs. If you cannot get into one of those room assignments the quality of the rooms drop off considerably in terms of size and location. - I love the room service at the Inn. Very quick and very very good. Breakfast is the best and I recommend the eggs benedict. - Personally, I think the staff goes out of its way to be friendly and accomodating to guests. I know this because I remember how much that they would get on you if you were not. It's highly encouraged to be friendly to guests. Not As Good: - Any of the rooms that were not mentioned above. For the standard price of the room it is not worth it. - The cost of the drinks in the bar. For the cost of the drinks you would think that you were downtown at the W or the Solamar. The bar is a great setting with lots of seats and TV's and a pool table but the cost of the cocktails is high.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently, I did a midweek trip to Rancho Bernardo Inn and Spa in North San Diego County. The special rate offered included a round of golf with a room midweek. Upon check in I was also offered a $3 upgrade to the valet parking (same price as regular parking). The upgrade included two drink tickets and free internet access for my stay which normally is an $11 value. I elected a room in the main building close to the restaurants and an easy walk to early golf in the morning. It was also easy access to the pool by the main building. My dinner at the Veranda Restaurant was excellent, the service was terrific, as the place was very full. After dinner drinks on the patio were around a fire which was nice as the evening was cool. The Inn has recently been renovated and the rooms though older, are now very contemporary and updated in pleasing cream and taupe hues with wood ceilings and plantation shutters. Mine was very enjoyable with a stone surfaced bath area, and granite on some surfaces. The golf staff was tip top, our carts were clean and on time, and the course marshall kept an eye on things so that they moved along quite nicely. The course itself is well maintained and the room with golf package is an outstanding mid week value. When I finished, my clubs were cleaned and sent up to the bell station to be put in my car. The staff arranged for me to shower in the spa as I checked out early to play golf. The spa is something I definitely would like to book into when I have more time. The mid week specials are an outstanding value, and I would recommend taking advantage if at all possible.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had the pleasure of staying at the Rancho Bernardo Inn this past Sunday night for my husbands birthday. My brother in law had booked us a couples massage at the spa and I decided, why not stay the night. I booked it last minute and fortunately they had a room available. I booked an regular room but upon arrival was upgraded to a room overlooking the golf course. We were on the top floor of the 700 building which not only afforded us a beautiful view of the golf course but were able to enjoy the vaulted ceilings in our room. It was so rustic but with modern amenities, such as a large flat panel TV and a beautiful king size bed that was lite from the bottom to give it a very warm glow. The bathroom was stunning with a huge soaking tub and separate shower enclosure. I also loved the Aveda hair and skin products! That's definitely a nice touch! We checked in our room with only a few minutes to spare before we had to be at the spa for our massage and when we returned the staff had left a plate of cheese and a bottle of wine for my husbands birthday! Compliments of the hotel! Now that is a first class resort!! The spa is amazing! I have been there before for a massage and really enjoy sitting by the pool after my massage if it's a nice day. My husband did not golf this time but has golfed at the RBI in the past and he says it's one of his favorite courses! This is an amazing resort with the best customer service I have ever had! We are so lucky to only live about 20 minutes from this wonderful place! We will definitely be back! Thank you RBI for making my husband's birthday one to remember!! You guys are the best!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here October 4 -6 and was disappointed. I heard alot about the Inn and amenities. The room was average at best and in need of updating (Room 815)......the bathroom was tiny.....one person barely fit. Nicest thing about the room was the flat screen, HDTV. All this for $205/night. We stayed at a Residence Inn in La Jolla on the 7th and spent half as much and the room was twice as nice. The restaurant Bizcocho was the same as the room - overpriced and average at best. Wine list was weak and the by the glass offerings horrible. $16 for a glass of Beaulieu Vineyards Cab - are you kidding me? I was a member of their wine club - the bottle only cost $18. Appetizers were not much better, wings were OK and the sesame tuna roll was pretty good. We attended a group dinner on two separate nights......these were the best meals we had. One night they did a buffet with a Mexican theme - all in all the food was good - but resembled more of what a Marriott would offer not a high end Inn like Rancho Bernardo. The second night we had a plated dinner - apps, dinner and dessert. Finally something good. The filet mignon was excellent - cooked perfectly and a good piece of meat. My wife visited their spa and gave it slightly above average ratings. She got a good massage and told me the overall spa was nice. Again, she thought it was a bit overpriced for what she received. Do not fall victim to the hype of their website......stay in Del Mar or La Jolla - try L'Auberge in Del Mar......you will find nicer hotels, some on the water - for the same rate. We stayed at La Costa a few years back and it was heads above Rancho Bernardo.......I do not plan on visiting it again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was really looking forward to this one night getaway from LA we were going to have and I just got back tonight. I have to say from the moment we arrived my experience began to go downhill. When we pulled up at 8PM on a saturday night there was no valet or bellman to greet us. I simply opened my car door and my girlfriends and opened up the trunk and got my luggage out and waited for a few minutes and finally saw someone and I said, "Excuse me we are checking in." No one opened the door for us or anything. We finally got to our room and I have tosay the room besides the very nice TV looked like the room PRIOR to the multi-million dollar rennovations. The outside and inside decor of the whole hotel resembled a motel. HONESTLY!! The pools were outdated and had no real ambiance at all. The sheets and pillows were the worst I have slept on in so many years. The massage today was pretty good but I can tell you one thing, the spa that is supposed to be #1 in America is definetly not #1 in America! The food was actually pretty good and this morning we sat outside and had breakfast in the Veranda and the nest thing we all knew, a golf ball came flying at our heads. No warning or nothing so be careful. I am a golfer but did not golf this trip and the greens were nothing of a private country club that it is said to be. Very inconsistent with color and a mix of brown and dried grass every few feet. Overall, I have been to some pretty amazing hotels and this was suposed to be a great one, however I have truly no desire to go back here again and would be truthful to say I wouldn't feel comfortable reccomending it to people who wanted an incredible experience. Decent at best.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at RBI over July 4th weekend for a wedding that was held there. It's a nice resort and the grounds are beautiful, but to me, nothing was overwhelmingly impressive. The AC unit in our room was awful â€“ it blew out damp, humid air and even turning it down to the low 60s didnâ€™t seem to cool things. We heard the same from several other guests, too, one of whom had to switch rooms altogether in order to have properly-functioning AC. The room itself was fine - generally comfortable but as far as decor, it was slightly dated. The bed in our room was positioned at an angle which made the room feel smaller than it probably was. Our room had a patio, but unfortunately we never used it because there was a heavily-trafficked path in front of it so there wasn't much privacy. Free wi-fi is available--a big plus in my book. And I loved the Aveda toiletries in the bathroom, which was kept well-stocked! Room service was tasty and reasonably priced, as were poolside drinks. Don't attempt to bring your own drinks into the pool area, though. We saw someone try to but they're big sticklers about that (understandably so). The staff was very friendly, and did an excellent job in terms of the wedding, cocktail hour and reception. It was really well-orchestrated and the meal was great. One other thing to note - the resort isn't in San Diego proper. It's about 30 min. or so north. The hotel doesn't offer a shuttle to/from the airport, but they did recommend Cloud 9 Super Shuttle. Had I known it would take me 1.5 hours to get to the resort via the shuttle, I would've just sucked it up and paid the $75 for a cab. I wouldn't be opposed to staying here again, but it also wouldn't be my first choice.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “What a great experience”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at RB a year ago, but our experience was limited by remodeling. We noted our issues on TA, and the resort contacted us to return for a subsidized visit. We were impressed! The people were tremendous, not just helping us, but filling in for each other. The teamwork we saw is a great reflection on the management. We felt welcomed by the valets. The check-in was thorough, striving to arrange every benefit for out stay. We had a terrific room, 625, with beautiful views of the valley and golf course, and was centered over the spaâ€™s pool. Our room was just the right size, well organized, and luxurious while maintaining the rustic feel of RB. Wireless access was fast and easy. The room came with a large LCD TV (analog) and DVD with normal hotel pay per view. We really liked the IHome alarm that allowed us to wake to our IPOD and recharged it too. Electrical outlets were sufficient, an unexpected plus. With the busy holiday season, we did not sample the El Biz Cocho restaurant. The Veranda was casual, family friendly, and served a well rounded menu of great food. We enjoyed one of the many hot tubs close to our room. The many outside fire places around the property were a perfect enhancement to the crisp winter Southern California air. We're novices to the spa experience, so we tried a couples massage. Nearly two hours of pampering together was one of the best things we've done together. The Spa staff was energetic, approachable (a plus for novices like us). and extremely knowledgeable. We didn't take the time to sample the salt water pool, but the steam bath, hot tubs, and relaxation areas were wonderful. We now would highly recommend this resort, and will be back to stay on our own $.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very nice experience for Spa and Golf package resort”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I came for a short three-day stay. After reading prior reviews, I had three concerns: noise, extra charges added to the bill. I spent extra time with the Reservations Agent talking about room options. We selected a suite that opened onto the golf course. It was everything the website claimed; great view, excellent decor and very comfortable. It was also quiet. When you buy a package (Spa, Golf or meal included), the charge gets posted to your bill and the desk staff take it back off. At checkout, both Golf and Spa were still on my bill but the Desk agent caught it before she handed me the bill. Everything else was correct. We thought the food was mearly ok but pretty expensive so not a good value. Steer clear of the breakfast buffet if you want your eggs fresh. Compared to the chain hotels I stay at, the buffet was pretty limited. On the flip side though, the restaraunt staff is extremely attentive and professional. My wife completely enjoyed the Spa experience. The staff were friendly, professional and skilled. The facility was clean and inviting. She came away relaxed and invigorated. The golf course is fun and has some good challenging holes. It rained hard one of the days of our stay but the next morning the course was in great shape. Hat's off to the grounds staff. The shop staff, cart setup, starters and marshals all worked to make for a good round. They keep play at a good pace so a round should finish in 4 1/2 hous. Ours did. I can't figure out the parking fee - $10/night. There's plenty said about it so no surprises for me - and it is still irksome. We enjoyed this hotel, the grounds, the staff and the golf/spa. We'll eat away from the hotel and there are plenty of choices close by. We'll come again.</p></li>
