<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Being close to the Termini was a big positive. But I should never have asked for a French bed. The room was small as to be claustrophobic. It was clean but I did see one cockroach. We did not spend much time in the room. Compared to our hotel in Florence, the Yes was disappointing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I highly recommend this hotel. If you want to be close to the train station. I stayed here for a couple of days and since I wanted to be close to the train I thought this was the most reasonable place. The price is right and you get the right amount of attention. The breakfast was really nice too. Just make sure you are not in the west side of the station since it gets very sketchy at night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, right by the Rome Train Station, but tucked away in a quiet street. Very helpful staff, very modern, tidy room, newly renovated with a lovely bathroom. Breakfast was good too - one of the best I've had at a 3* hotel. Only complaint (albeit very minor), was that the coffee at breakfast was awful, but everything else was great. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.</p></li>

The only negative would be that the rooms are quite small and have no tea or coffee making facilities which would have been nice after a long day on your feet!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here back in May for 5 nights. While the rooms were small, we really did not spend much time in the room since we were out exploring Rome. Breakfast buffet was good and plentiful...hospitality was great. The location was perfect for us...we could walk to the train/bus station or to some of the sites in Rome (if you enjoy slightly longer walks). I went running every morning and they pointed me in the direction of the park. Felt safe. Awesome value!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you don't want to drive in Rome (who would?) a hotel near the train station is ideal. The Yes hotel is just around the block from the Rome Termini. We were able to connect to the subway, to the train for a day trip out of Rome, and to the Leonardo Express for transit to Fiumicino and our departing flight. The staff was beyond helpful, even shared a pizza delivery on a rainy evening! We spent more for this hotel but for the sake of convenience, it was worth it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We ended our Italy trip with three nights at this hotel and couldn't have been happier with how it worked out. In the intense heat of Italy's summer, this hotel actually believed in real air conditioning. The room for our family of four was great.--two separate bedrooms with very comfortable bedding and a small refrigerator in each room. The location close to the Termini train station ( two blocks) made getting around Rome very easy with plenty of restaurants (and gelato) withing walking distance.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room was very nice. It was a bit small, but it was for only one person. The staff are very friendly and helpful. I asked them for a wake up call since there are no alarm clocks in the rooms. The breakfast was good, and the hotel overall was clean. The location is great, right by Termini station and within walking distance to lots of sights. There are two good internet cafes nearby on Via Panisperna. I also saw a Mac in the lobby, so you might be able to surf the net on that, but I didn't get around to checking it out.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel feels newly renovated and it spotlessly clean. Rooms are comfortable, bathroom is fairly spacious. Wifi was reasonably priced. About 100m from Termini Station. We only stayed one night before going to Sorrento. Stayed in another hotel when we returned to Rome for another 3 nights. The other hotel was near the historic centre, cost more but was horrible and barely 2 star. We should have just stayed in Yes Hotel again. Termini is not the nicest area, but this is a great value hotel for less than 100 euros per night.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a great little place with lots of character and modern amenities. The hotel was literally a 2 minute walk from the northern part of Termini Station. We were in walking distance to everything including the metro. The rooms are a bit small, but there are some things that you must sacrifice for a clean and convenient property. The bathroom was very modern and immaculate. The only thing may be a problem are the narrow showers. If you are a larger person, you may have a hard time showering. Other than that, everything was great!</p></li>

They are cheerful and friendly, the breakfast was fine, a small improvement could be some fresh fruit and tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms. The location is good, we were a little concerned after reading some reviews about the area around Termini but we did not feel threatened or uncomfortable at any time, in fact even though it was an unattractive area it had a nice atmosphere. Would definitely use Yes hotel again.</p></li>

Jonadab and Giuseppe were very helpful and attentive all the time giving us directions and answering all our requests (it was the first time in the Eternal city!). Rooms were spotless and modern styled. Location was terrific: just 5 minutes from the main station. I would suggest definetely to purchase Roma Pass: 3 day-pass for means of transport plus 2 free museum entrances. I would stay definetely again in this hotel next time.</p></li>

Two parents and two older teenagers were comfortable in a quad room containing two twin beds and one double/queen bed. Basic room with TV. No clock or tissues (which worked fine for us, but I mention for other travelers). Bathroom with shampoo, soap and a hairdryer.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">While the room was small, it had everything we needed. Everything was extremely clean and spotless. The front desk was friendly and very helpful, specially Marcelo who provided us with good suggestions and tips. The location is great just a short walk from Termini, convenient to the airport train, the subway (both subway lines meet there), and numerous buses. The area is always busy and we felt very comfortable walking to the hotel even later at night. Excellent choice if you are looking for a reasonable priced accommodation in a convenient location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not a 5-star place, but an amazing value. Hotel Yes is modern and clean with a wonderful staff - very helpful and friendly. Best of all it's so near Termini Station making it easy to drop your bags and go see Rome...or any other city accessible by rail. Many good restaurants in the area, too. The rooms we've had were both pretty small, and the shower was snug, but we didn't spend very much time there anyway so it didn't matter. Free wifi in lobby, 2 Euro per day in the room. This hotel is one of the best values in Rome - will stay here again next year.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">All three of the front-desk receptionists that we encountered displayed exceptionally warm service, which is a highlight of the stay at this hotel. The quadruple room that we booked was comfortable and elegantly furnished with all the basic amenities that one would expect of a hotel. The space was a bit tight for four people, but space generally comes at a premium in most hotels located in such a central area. The location of the hotel was a huge plus, which is a block from the Roma Termini (central train station with connections to the metro). The breakfast had a good variety of items.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is not bad - and good for the price. They also make discounts if you pay cash (but be ready to pay in advance - at acheck in). The room is small but clean and good equipped - even with a fridge. The location of the hotel is good - not far from the Station, but on the neighbouring is quite safe. Still during my stay there were some problems. It was very noisy in the room - there was no isolation from the corridor. I had to use the reserve lift and steps due to renovation - it was inconvenient. You have to go out into the street - and then enter the hotel to have your breakfast.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We always intended to see Rome with friends but where could we stay? The Yes Hotel is a good choice for location. From the airport there is good public transport to the Termini it takes 20 mins. and costs 7 Euros return. The Yes is only a 2 minute walk away from the Termini. The hotel is clean and modern, the staff are very helpfull and polite. Breakfast is bread, ham, cheese, cereal etc. The bar is basic so eat and drink out. Can recomend this hotel if you need a base to stay and is very close to Metro links and bus routs. Get a transport ticket for 3 days you can go on any bus or Metro for 12 Euros.</p></li>

Room was small but the furnishings were simple but tasteful. Breakfast included cereals, toast, other bread, plus a platter of hams and cheeses.

There are no big name tag, but for us as very easy to find it. Reception staff are very friendly and knowledgeable English. The room is very, very nice, with comfortable beds. All very very clean.Flat screen TV with national and international programs. The breakfast menu is a surprise with lot, lot of things to eat!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at that hotel during our round trip in Italy. Rome was our last destination. the hotel is small but new and very modern. It's close to the main terminal (apr. 7-8 min walk) but it's not near city center so you always have to take the train. And at nicht the area is empty so you should not return to the hotel very late. The rooms are clean, well decorated. The breakfast was satisfying, the mini restaurant was clean. It was easy to access internet for our flight check-in. and the front desk is very friendly and helpful. So you can can choose in this expensive city this small hotel cause the value is very good.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This great hotel is on a quiet street just 3 blocks from Termini Station; centrally located for quick access to the train, buses, and metro. The rooms are modern and extremely clean. We enjoyed breakfast everyday before beginning our sightseeing. Our entire family was given rooms next door to each other. An iron is available for use, and internet use is 5 Euros. A gold statue stands on the building nearby making it easy to locate the YES hotel from anywhere closeby. The hotel is a sparkling gem, with a welcoming staff. Even though four days is not enough time to totally see the sights of Rome, YES made our visit easier.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is in a location within walking distance to the train station which is nice. The rooms were nice and the staff was great. The main locations we were looking to visit, colosseum, vatican, spanish steps were all a bit of a hike, and I'm not convinced the hotel was in the best location for the price. But it was a great stay. I probably would have skipped the breakfast as it was the same mediocre food we've had at 2 other hotels in Italy. Make sure to ask for a dining recommendation for the afternoon/evening manager at the front desk. He sent us around the corner to the best local food we had on our trip. We ate there 2 nights in a row.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A small, friendly hotel which is a very short and easy walk from the terminii. The room was clean and bright. The whole hoetl apeared to have been refitted 2-3 years ago and everything was in new condition. It was nice to have a sarkling bathroom which didn't smell bad, Air-com that worked properly and and a good range of international plugs. The room was serviced daily and also opened out onto a clean tidy small courtyard. Breakfast was included and had a good selaction of hot and cold. Wifi was 2 euro/day or 5euro per stay. An excellent experience that is in stark contrast to 3 previous stays at different hotels. Will use again when back in Rome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros: The hotel was clean, it was a short walk to the train station, and the breakfast staff was very nice. If you prefer a more authentic area, you will probably like it. There are very few tourist walking in the area and at the two or three surrounding restaurants. Cons: The area from the train station to this hotel is not a good and I would hesitate being in there at night without my husband. If you went a few more miles away from the train station, the area is much nicer and about the same price. Restaurant options were limited. The front desk was below average on their willingness to assist us. This was also the smallest hotel room I had ever seen!</p></li>

The breakfast which was really good.The value of the American dollar makes it expensive to eat in Rome . its high to do anything. The train and bus station is only a 3 block walk from this hotel. We got a hop on type of tour over in that area and it was real easy. They speak great English at the Yes Hotel and since I had never been out of California this was a great fit before my cruise.I paid $1,300 for 2 rooms for 3 nights total on Hotels.com. They have a bar if you need a beer or wine just ask and they will open the bar for you. Very cool.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very convenient to the central train station without the noice. Walkable distance to coluseum and a few restaturants. The rooms are pretty spacious, very modern and clean. The staff member who met and greeted us on arrival explemplified what good service and set the benchmark for all those in the hotel industry. He was very polite, cheerful, helpful and could speak english which was handy with my limited Italian vocab. At night I did not feel the area was too bad as usually areas near the station can be seedy which was contrary to this and felt safe to walk around at night. I would higly recommend this place with the overall price, location and facilities provided.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved this hotel! Great location in a nice quiet street about 5 minutes from Rome Termini station. The staff are fantastic, very friendly, welcoming and helpful and of course, fluent in English. The hotel is lovely, really stylish and well designed, and the rooms are a decent size for Rome. Our room had a good shower, and a bath, which I'd requested, so that was a nice bonus. Breakfast was really nice, coffee and juice from a machine, but decent quality, and there was a good selection of fresh pastries as well as scrambled eggs and bacon. Wifi has fast and a good price, we paid €5 for our 2 day stay. We'd highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in Yes Hotel when we visited Rome for 3 days. The hotel is 3/4 mins walk from the central station and the room was clean & nicely decorated. Though the hotel is small but the full hotel was well decorated and clean. The items of daily buffet breakfast were not much but it was enough for a decent breakfast. Reception staffs were also very helpful. I would recommend the hotel for those who will be out most of the time yet if required can stay indoors and relax for sometime.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Less than a five minute walk from Termini station but within walking distance of many attractions, you could not ask for a better location from which to explore Rome. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. Our rooms were modern, quiet, clean and relatively spacious. There is no view from the hotel but otherwise, it really feels like you could have paid 30 euros a night more. The breakfast is nothing special but more than adequate and very convenient. Wireless internet is available but they provide free internet time in the lobby. This hotel is not luxury but very comfortable and far from roughing it; if you are travelling on a budget and want somewhere central to stay, you cannot go wrong here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is in a great location, we had a heavy bag and took a taxi - DON't, it is a two minute walk from Termini and we were ripped off by a 20 euro cab driver (and as I questioned him he claimed not to speak English!) Any, the hotel. Excellent Staff! The breakfast is OK... don't be later than 10 though! The rooms are very clean and modern. There is no ENglish television, but you're in ROME so explore! My only real complaint was that there was no iron in the room and you have to go to reception and iron in the luggae room, and the beds are not comfortable, very hard and onlyo ne pillow each provided. We were in room 601 on the ground floor which did suffer from Road noise. But in terms of Rome it was a good hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Yes Hotel for a few nights at the beginning of June and were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is literally 2 blocks- 5 minutes walking from the main station which made it extremely convenient. It is hard to find - make sure you don't walk by the tiny sign! The room wasn't huge- typical size for Italy but very high tech. The breakfast had a selection of juices, coffee, cold cereal, pastries, and even a station with cooked eggs and bacon. We were very satisfied every morning. The staff was great though- they put up with our endless questions of the area and spoke moderatley well English. We purchased Wifi by the day- I think it ended up being 2 Euros a day? Overall it was a good hotel at a fantastic location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You could not get a better located hotel for the price you pay! 30 Minute train ride from the airport to Termini station and then a 5 minute walk from there! The Termini Station is the main train, bus and metro station in Rome so ideally situated to get around the city. Is also walking distance to most places but wouldnt suggest walking everywhere in 1 day as we did! 3 day travel pass is only 11 euros and well worth it! Our room was modern, clean and spacious and well equiped for a city hotel room - couldnt have asked for more. Breakfast was included and was a buffet of cold meats, bacon, cheese, breads, pastries, yoghurt and fruit with all hot drinks and juices - Well appreciated before setting off for a day of sight seeing!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at this hotel to start off our honeymoon in europe. The hotel put us in relatively close proximity to the sites we wanted to visit. The staff was kind and helpful. The rooms were small, but that is to be expected in Rome. Although small, the rooms were very comfortable and modern. Everything was clean and comfortable. We recommended the hotel to some friends of ours and they enjoyed their stay as well. The breakfast was great. My husband and I travel quite a bit and were impressed with the Yes Hotel. While not the best hotel we have stayed in, the Yes Hotel was a great value for its contemporary feel, helpful staff, breakfast, and proximity to sites. Yes Hotel was a great start to our wonderful vacation!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is conveniently located close to the central railway station, the central bus station and a metro station. The interior seems pretty new and it is kept spotlessly clean and shiny. Our room was very quiet, of adequate size and nicely decorated. The breakfasts are fine with a choice of hot and cold food. The staff are very helpful. The hotel offers a discount for cash payment on arrival. I offered English pounds on arrival on Friday evening [because the rate was given in English pounds as well as euros when booking over the internet]. I was told that they only accept euros, but they kindly agreed to wait until Monday so that I could change money at the bank and get my discount. Clearly they didn't have to do this. Yes!!!</p></li>

I must say that the hotel is somewhat hard to find, but if you print a map from the hotel's website you should be fine. Coming from a hospitality background I am rather picky about the hotels I stay in; however, I must say this hotel in particular, definitely exceeded my expectations. The only issues that I had was the sound the front door made every time it was opened and closed and the variety of cold cuts for breakfast was not the greatest ( I mean there were none and no one bothered to re-fill the tray). Other than that, it's a great cheap chic hotel that provides great service for your money. Definitely will book again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in Yes Hotel for 1 night in May. The overall experience was average: We were given what must surely be, even by italian standards, The Small Room (no.603). The "double" bed was more like a king-single, even for us folk of average size. The room was on the ground floor and indeed felt very close to the street. Yet it was certainly no cheaper! In contrast, the bathroom was huge - almost the size of the bedroom itself, and very clean. Staff were professional and helpful with excellent english. Breakfast was fine. The location was good too - about 5 mins walk from the train station. The main problem I had was the noise. Bikes seemed to roar past our streetfront window until midnight. An offstreet room might've made me feel less negative about the whole experience.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Marcello was such a lovely and accommodating person during the first 2.5 days of our honeymoon. He really made the first couple days feel special and treated us very nicely. He was always very proactive in asking us what he could help with, and was very helpful with directions and restaurant recommendations. The rooms were really nice, clean and modern. I would recommend getting the larger sized rooms that were located in the corners. The breakfast was GREAT! They actually had nice eggs, sausage, and some nice add ons.... fruit, yogurt, cereal, espresso, coffee, juice, other deli meats and fruit! Internet for one hour was free, but there was a charge any longer than that. This was really one of the best places we stayed in out of the 4-5 towns we visited, and it was also a really great value!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very Nice Hotel by Train Station”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 4 nights at the Yes hotel and enjoyed our stay there. The beds were comfortable although the room was a bit small for 1 double and 2 twins. The room and bath was very clean and the bath had a shower door - nice when many hotels in Italy do not. We also had plenty of towels. Our 3rd floor room was vey quiet. The staff was also very helpful as we needed to print some important documents and they let us use the reception printer. The only negative was their internet service was spotty. I would recommend this hotel - it's about a 10 min walk from the train station and in a neighborhood with many restuarants. Note: if you use the laundry service nearby note that this is not self service laundry, but one where you leave your dirty laundry and you return later to pick up your clean clothes.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 5 nights in May and were very happy with the hotel. Staff are friendly and efficient, especially Raul and Rhodora. Our room 605 with street-facing window in annexe (triple room) was very clean and comfortable, if a little small for 3 adults, but we managed. Our fridge wasn't working at first but was fixed the next day. The breakfast was very good with plenty to choose from. The hotel was very close to the station and we walked just about everywhere or caught Metro for day at the Vatican. The only problems we had were a leaky (very small) shower and an air conditioner which turned itself on randomly through the night to the lowest setting so I woke up freezing - couldn't seem to get that sorted out for the 5 nights. Would highly recommend Yes Hotel to anyone wanting to be close to the station.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here with a friend in May 2008, and was pleasantly surprised seeing as this is only a three star hotel. The room was nicely decorated (art deco-ish theme) and very clean. We had twin beds which were very comfortable, and the bathroom was roomy and also spotless. The breakfast was a standard cereal/fruit/pastry offering, but this was not a big deal as we were just happy to grab something to eat before heading out for the day. The front desk staff were extremely nice and very helpful and were good at recommending places to eat. There are lots of lovely restaurants in the area and although people have said that the area is dodgy, we certainly felt safe enough walking about (we are two young women). I would definitely come back to this hotel as I know I will get a clean, safe, comfortable room in a really convenient location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here at the last night for our trip in Rome, since we have to catch our early flight, and this hotel is near the couch station, so we chose it. Check-in was a bit slow, but the reception was quite nice, he gave us also a city map and some tips about an art exhibition & activities in town. Room size is quite small, but clean with flat screen TV and a small closet. Amenities was so-so, but I brought some from Cavalieri, so it's okay. The bed was comfortable enough, location quite good, it's near the main train station. I found this area okay, just take care when you walk at night alone, it's an universal rule anyway. Though the price was with breakfast, but we have to leave at near 5 in the morning, so I don't know the quality. Overall it suited our purpose, it took us only a minute to catch our airport couch, and price was 80EUR.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at Yes Hotel after spending one night in a horrible establishment outside of the city. I found the rates very fair and my room was absolutely adorable. Being an American, I am accustomed to larger rooms, but I was not at all disappointed with the space of my room. Everything was well prepared, clean room, clean bath, etc. I found the staff very helpful especially with directions and suggestions for daily excursions. The breakfast was OK, but considering there are many other places to eat nearby it wasn't a deal breaker for me. I will definitely stay at this hotel again on my next trip to Rome! PS. I was solo traveler and I felt that I was treat just as well if not better than those travelling in groups! And although the Internet service was not free, it was offered at a really low considerable rate than most hotels were offering in the area.</p></li>

They loaded us with maps and information that really helped us tackle the city and we found their suggestions and restaurant recommendations to be useful and spot on! I absolutely loved the decor, it felt so trendy and new (just what we were looking for).

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On our first visit to Italy, we only had two days in Rome. The hotel location is very convenient for those traveling by train, as well as for exploring Rome either by bus or subway. The people at the reception desk were VERY nice to us -- gave us quick access to our room and then later took time to tell us about our location and how to get around the city. The neighborhood is fine -- we felt safe at all times of the day. The room for 3 was tiny but well appointed and spotless; we were situated at the back overlooking the courtyard which was very quiet. (The AC works quite well as long as the key card is in its slot and the window is closed.) Breakfast was typical fare -- we augmented it with fresh fruit from the market at the train station. This was the least expensive hotel we stayed in over the course of two weeks and perhaps our favorite in terms of service and value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in this hotel with my family. The hotel is on the excellent location near the Termini Station, in my opinion the best location for sightseeing. Althought I was said that the area around the Termini Station is not safe, I didn't get that impression. Termini is 2 min. by foot, Piazza della Republica is 5 min. away. From Termini and Piazza della Republica, there are metro and bus lines to all major sights. The better way is hiking- all the most important sights are less than 30 min. by foot (except for Vatican). Rooms are comfortable and clean, the hotel is new, tastefuly furnished. The stuff is very friendly, right upon check-in they gave us city map, recommendations for restaurants etc. The breakfast is good, except for bread, which is old. That would in fact be the only complaint I have. The hotel is very good for the price, I would recommend it and would go again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I did a boat load of research on hotels for our trip and this is the one I picked. DIDN'T REGRET IT! It is in a great location. The hop, skip and jump it took to get the Termini everyday was IDEAL. The staff was wonderful and very helpful, telling us about little hole in the wall diners with excellant food and a tour guide office not 2/3 blocks from the hotel. The rooms are a bit on the tiny side, but that didn't bother us...WE WERE NEVER IN THEM! We had a problem with the A/C on the first day we were there, but the Manager called somebody in to fix it ASAP! There was 6 of us all together...we had one single room, one double room (queen bed) and a room with 3 singles, all the rooms were of great quality. we stayed there 8 days without any problems except the AC on the first day! All in all...it was a wonderful stay and I would recommend it to EVERYONE. Including myself when I visit ROME again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My daughter and I stayed at the Yes Hotel in Rome Italy. We chose this hotel primarily due to its proximity to the train station and secondly because it looked upgraded. We were not disappointed at all. Although on the small side (rooms in Europe are generally small), the room is very comfortable, well appointed, and modern. The bathroom as well has been updated. Breakfast was also included and they had a very good spread. Cold meats, cheeses, scrambled eggs, hot dogs, bread, cereal, danish, coffee, tea.... I'm sure I missed some. We were about a 3-5 minute walk to the train station which was very convenient as we had some early morning museum appointments . The front desk staff are always very helpful and friendly. The area is quite safe (we arrived at 10:30 p.m. and walked to the hotel) and have so many dining options available. I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again next time I visit!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My friends and I stayed at Yes Hotel for three nights at the end of a 7 day tour of Florence and Rome. We originally booked Hotel Felice and became increasingly nervous about the hotel. We decided to cancel our reservation and booked Yes based upon the reviews on this site. We were so thankful that we did! The staff was very helpful and the complimentary breakfast was a nice touch. Nothing more than the usual fare, but enjoyable. The rooms were fairly small, but we didn't spend much time in the room....there was too much to see and do! The hotel was also in a great location (2 blocks from Termini) for us given that we commuted via the metro or buses during the day. We visited Pompeii from Rome and the proximity to the train station was yet again helpful. We also found a nice little place nearby, Taverna Pretoriana, and went there for a late dinner. The food was very good and the waiters were so much fun!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Yes hotel is just a fantastic hotel. It's near by the Termini station, so on a very good location. The hotel was very clean; we've never had such a clean hotel before! We almost thought my grandmother was the cleaner... Our room was excellent; clean, average size, and a grand bathroom. The beds were quite hard, but after one night you won't feel it anymore. We had a airco either and worked very well. There was also a minibar so we always had fresh water. The staff were very friendly and very helpfull. They spook English very well and even called to the attractions in Rome for getting us more information (about opening times, etc...). They even ordered our postcards! The breakfast was small, but decent. Some sandwiches, sweet bread, meat, cheese, cornflakes, yoghurt, fruit... Conclusion: a very nice, little hotel, good location and very clean! And very friendly staff. So say Yes to Yes: you won't be disappointed. We will definitely come back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">after reading through several tripadvisor reviews, we decided that Yes Hotel fulfilled the requirements that we required for our hotel in Rome. These requirements are: 1. Near the train station to facilitate for easy travel to our subsequent cities 2. Reasonable pricing Unfortunately, the hotel took awhile to find, probably due to a lack of preparation and research in directions on our part. Upon arriving though, we were thoroughly impressed by how clean and modern the hotel looked. We had no issues with the cleanliness, nor the size of the rooms. We were further impressed by the free buffet breakfast offered the subsequent morning, given the prices that we had paid for our stay. We stayed for a total of 4 nights, and were also duly informed during one of the mornings of a transport strike that was occurring during the day. The advice offered by the receptionists were also reliable, which made touring Rome alot easier for us. All in all, a good stay :)</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is located about a 5 minutes walk from the Roma Central Termini train station on one of the small side streets. Although not a short walk to any of the major sights (about a 20-25 minute walk to the Colosseum), tourist attractions are very accessible via the train station. I would recommend this hotel for those willing to stay away from the large crowds while still being able to safely and easily navigate the crazy streets of Rome. The entire hotel seemed to have a high-tech upgrade to it, especially considering the building looked pretty old, with the light switches and electrical outlets all operated by a touch panel near the room's entrance. Bathroom was pretty small but clean and spacious enough to at least move around a bit. Front-desk staff was very courteous and breakfast was included every morning. One point of note - there also seems to be a separate building that's associated with this hotel which is used as a hostel - be sure you know which one you're reserving.</p></li>

Its booked as the Yes Hotel, but the sign above it said New York Hotel above the glass door, ( the only way I knew I was at the right place was because of another reviewers comments) I thought overall it was a nice hotel, good location just a few blocks, or 7 minute walk from the Termini(which is great because this is the place the bus drops you off at from the airport) I always felt safe walking back to the hotel at night (it was just me and my 2 bff gfs)... aside from catching the trainsthe Termini itself was like one big galleria mall, with shops, restaurants, and yes McDonalds(they CHARGE u extra 4 ketchup!!! LOL)........... the hotel itself............................................ in walking distance to many internet cafes, restaurants, grocery store, staff was friendly(especially Marcell) we had a triple room which was nice, and clean.. good size bathroom, flat screen tv..breakfast, I would definately stay here again....</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent a few days in Rome recently. I had decided to stay near the Termini railway station as I had an early flight and the coach to the Airport departed from the station. There are many medium priced hotels in the area and my eventual choice for this hotel was influenced by Trip Advisor reviews. Hotel Yes is only 5 minutes walk from the station. I received a friendly and informative welcome at Reception and was shown to my room in a very modern and well-decorated annexe. I had a single room with a door to the rear courtyard. The modern room was small but well furnished. The en-suite shower room was spacious. Both were spotless. Breakfast was included in the price and consisted of various cereals, yoghurt, cold meats, cheese, rolls, bread and cakes, two fruit juices, an excellent choice of teas and good Italian coffee. The staff was very efficient and friendly. My visit to Rome was enhanced by my stay at Hotel Yes, especially by Marcello at Reception. I shall return to Rome and definitely to this hotel. I recommend it strongly!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed two nights at the Yes hotel and while it wasn't the worst experience, it wasn't pleasant either. Here are few things to keep in mind when considering this hotel: - The hotel is very close to the train station, which is convenient for the day you need to head to the airport, but means there are terrible food options and nothing to do in the neighborhood. Finding breakfast was not easy. - You have to pay for the internet (why is it not free at this point?) - The a/c was very weak and shut off through out the night. We called the front desk and they were no help, so we ended up opening the windows, only to hear people rolling their suitcases down the sidewalk to the train station all night. Click, click, click.... - The room was clean, but quite small and there was an extra single bed in our room. - The front desk service was not great. They took 20 minutes to check us in and there was no one else in line. They also didn't know how to give us access to the (not free) internet, and directed us to a local internet cafe instead.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from a 4 day visit to Rome. If you are looking to stay near the Termini I would recommend this great littl hotel. The bst thing about it is the location. It is only 2 blocks from the Termini on a quiet side street. We saved big on transportation costs by taking the Express train from Fiumicno Airport to Termini then walking to the hotel. The Metro and all the buses were also right there so we saved big on taxis. Also there is a great grocery store called Conrad right by the entrance to Termini off via Marsala. The hotel rooms are very small and basic but it is only 2 years old so the furnishings are new and modern. There is a small fridge and safe in the room. The hotel is very clean and the maids do a great job. The continental breakfast that is included is okay and will keep you going until lunch. The staff was very helpful with directions and recommendations. I got a discounted rate of 265 Euros for 3 nights which works out to around $100/night which is pretty decent. It's a great place to stay for the location and the price.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Yes Hotel for one night only, the last night of our two week Italian vacation. We returned to Rome by train and needed a room for one night before flying home. The hotel is a very short walk from Termini Station. We followed the directions provided and found it without problem, and didn't think the area was dangerous or scary, as some have mentioned. The desk personnel were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were large by European standards, very clean and nicely furnished. TV had several English channels.The bath was large and well lit. The breakfast was adequate and included in the room price. Although the area surrounding the hotel is not the most desirable location in Rome, it is very convenient to bus, train and metro, so you can get anywhere quickly and easily. We took the bus to the Piazza Navona area at night without problem. Overall, this hotel is a great value for someone not wanting to blow all their money on a hotel room that they will likely be in very little, but still wanting a nice room. You're in Rome! Who wants to stay in the room??</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After hours of searching for a hotel located centrally, I became dismayed after reading review after review of poor Rome hotels. Then I came across the Yes Hotel... it looked clean and comfortable in the pictures and so I booked it. Wasn't disappointed at all... in fact was very pleased with my choice. Location: It is VERY close to the Termini which is great for getting around Rome, took us about 3 mins to walk from the hotel to the station. Being on a side street it was quiet in our room in a night. Room: We had a standard double room which was spacious compared to the hotels we've stayed in New York, Tokyo, hong Kong and London. It was very clean; sheets and towels were crisp white. Bed was very comfy and pillows were plump. Good amount of storage space. Staff: Very helpful and courteous. No complaints at all. Downsides? In all I don't have any complaints with the hotel at all, the only issue was our aircon didn't seem to turn on, but then it didn't really bother us since it wasn't that hot and there were two very big windows we could open. Might have been an issue though if we had visited in July or August.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Yes Hotel in Rome offers modern, sleek accomodation in contrast to the usual antiquities that dominate the city (and much of Italy). Our double room was comfortable, though not spacious, with quality fittings, a safe, aircon, flat screen TV (not used by us but available if needed) and plenty of storage for clothes. The bathroom was also clean and modern with a large shower allowing room to move. Breakfast was very good - cereal, fruit, meat and cheese as well as the usual croissant/bread with coffee. it was served in the area called the "bar" but in the four nights we were there, we were the only people ever in the bar late in the day. It is very small and quite dark so you couldn't sit and read the paper or a magazine while having an afternoon aperitif - but if you want a drink, it is supposedly open 24 hours/day. There is 24hour reception, with locked glass doors at the entry to the hotel providing additional security. Finally, the location of the hotel just a couple of short blocks away from Termini Station makes it very convenient for people arriving in Rome that way (ie express train from the airport). And there are many restaurants in the neighborhood. All round - a Yes vote for the Yes Hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The service at this hotel was impeccable! The gentlemen at the front desk were extremely helpful with directions and advice on restaurants. Since we arrived on an early flight from the U.S., we were able to store our luggage in a locked room and go sightseeing until our room was ready. They also let us use the main floor restroom facilities to change clothes. There were four of us, and our room was quite spacious (especially for Europe). The bathroom was very large, as well. The room was clean, and the rest of the hotel was clean. Overall, the hotel is more similar to ones in the U.S. than the usual ones in Europe. Breakfast was continental, but it was sufficient and tasted good. The location of the hotel is ideal because it's located in a quiet neighborhood that isn't crowded with tourists. The Termini Station is only two blocks from the hotel, so it's easy to jump on the subway or the train to anywhere you want to go. Our favorite part about the hotel was the friendly staff and clean facilities. We couldn't really find anything wrong with it! The only bad part, for us, was that this was the first place in Italy we stayed, so we compared our other hotel stays to this. Needless to say, none of them matched up!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 4 nights and were very pleased with the service and rooms, especially considering the bargain price we paid (about $200AUD per night). This hotel is literally a 3 minute walk from Termini station, but on the northern (less dodgy) side. Rome is pretty to easy to walk around but it is great being near the station if you prefer to catch the train. The location is more about convenience than charm though, so if you're looking for a hotel nestled in amongst great restaurants and bats, this is not for you. It has a 24 desk with helpful staff who speak English well. Our room was lovely, clean and modern. Good tv with plenty of English channels (quite rare in Italy). Free air-conditioning, but you need to ensure ALL windows are closed for it work... we learnt this the hard way. The windows have amazing seals on them to block out sound from the outside. Wi Fi is available in the room for about $6 per day, and there is a PC in the reception area if you don't have a lap-top. The breakfast room is lovely and the buffet breakfast was good. They offer lovely pastries, toast, cereals & fruit. Overall a very pleasant experience and a really nice room for the price-range. You would be hard-pushed to get better value for money in Rome.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel and was very impressed. My partner had booked it for our anniversary and it was a great choice. We were upgraded to a triple room and there was a bottle of wine waiting for us, with the compliments of the hotel. The location was excellent for the Termini train station, just a short walk, but was situated on a quiet street and was quiet and peaceful. The room we had 209 was not large, but was very comfortable and tastefully decorated. The Bathroom was compact too but again very stylish and modern. Good shower, nice toiletries. There was a fridge in the room which was useful. The bed was quite firm, but we both slept well after long days of sightseeing. The breakfast was a little disappointing. It was a continental, with a few cooked items, but wasn't great. The juice was very artificial and I don't like coffee out of a machine, especially in italy. The staff however, were great. The hotel was very clean and we found Marcello, who I think may be the duty manager very helpful. He gave us a map and marked on it a good route to see the best of Rome in what was a fairly short weekend. He also gave us some very good tips for places to eat. All in all a very good hotel and I would recommend it and would stay here again.</p></li>

They ask the prepayment of the entire stay at check in, and then they don't care about nothing else. If you go to Rome, choose another hotel and stay away from Yes hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights in August. Great value for money and excellent because it was so close to the train station. Booked a double room but were given a triple for the same price. The safe in the room was great and there was a fridge but we never bothered to use this. Breakfast was great although sometimes it was slow in being refilled. Not really the hotels fault, just a little annoying. Air conditioning in the rooms was great although it did not go below 19C but we found this cold enough. There was a HD ready flat screen in the room, although you don't go to rome to watch tv it was a nice plus. Be aware when u go into the room that the lights are turned on using the keycard. You insert this in the wall. They hadnt told us this and I was completely confused but i dont travel alot. On the last day of our trip we asked the hotel to arrange our taxi to the airport which was very useful as some taxi drivers will charge extra. They also held our luggage in a locked room from 10am to 7pm. My only real negative is the bar in the hotel is not really a 24hr bar as stated but there are restaurants and bars close by. Overall this was a fantastic hotel with very helpful staff for a reasonable price. If we go back to rome we would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 nights and enjoyed the location and room! Angelo at the front desk was very friendly and always eager help out anyway he could! We stayed in a quad room (#300) and it was tight with 4 single beds in there but it worked out fine for the 2 nights we stayed. The room decor was modern and clean, the bathroom was large and had a GREAT shower with hot water and high pressure! This bathroom was the best out of 5 different hotels we stayed at on this trip! The beds were comfortable, pillows were average and in room air condition worked good! We also liked the multi electrical outlet near the desk (euro plugs, 240v, us plug 110v ect). The flat screen TV was large. The breakfast was standard euro fare with a good selection (meats, sweets, pastries, yogurt, juices and coffee) and it was suitable to get your day going! They have a self serve coffee machine that makes an average cappuccino but don't expect anything great. The wifi was free for the first hour and then you had to pay if you wanted any additional time... speeds were pretty slow but good enough to check email. (600k down and 200k up) One of the best features of this hotel is the location to Termini rail station, you are a short 2-3 block walk away!! I would stay at the YES hotel again on my next visit!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in the Yes Hotel just last week & we had such an enjoyable stay we just had to write about it!! The hotel is located near the Termini Station which provides easy access to the airport. A lot of tour buses start at the Termini so you can easily commence your tour of Rome from here too! The hotel itself is just two mins walk from the Termini, so no taxi needed! The decor is fresh, modern & exceptionally clean and the staff would do absolutely anything for you. We were travelling with our 15month old son & they were incredibly helpful with anything extra that we needed for our room. Our only little snag was that the room did not have tea & coffee facilities which would have been handy for warming bottles but as I mentioned the staff were incredibly helpful to us so not a problem really! You can also get tea & coffee from the bar if need be! On arrival, the staff provided us with a really useful little map showing the nearest restaurants, ATMs, pharmacy etc - everything you need really which I thought was a lovely little touch! They will also arrange a taxi service from the hotel to the airport on your way home, for just €40. (The train is €14 per person so I'd def say take the taxi, it takes the hassle out of it!) Our favourite activity when we were in Rome was the wine tasting at Vino Roma, an excellent introduction to Italian wines. You can find info about it at: http://www.vinoroma.com/</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in the Yes Hotel for four nights in our first trip to Rome. We picked this hotel due to its consistently high rating on Tripadvisor and in general we were not disappointed. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from Termini station and very easy to find (I had located it using Google Streeview in advance). The reception staff were very friendly and helpful and spoke good English. The room was small, but adequate. Bed was large and comfortable. There was a new flat screen TV including some English language news channels (BBC News 24 and CNN). There was a fridge, which was useful for cooling bottles of water (the temperature was 32 degrees celcius outside). The room included a modern quiet air conditiion unit that was so efficient that I got quite cold on the first night and had to swtich it off! Breakfast was adequate. Consisting of croissants (iced!), bread/toast, cold meats, cheeses, cerials, fresh fruit and yogurt. The coffee was undrinkable, but tea was OK. Being close to Termini station, access to all the main sites was easy. We purchased a three day "Roma pass", which includes unrestricted travel on the metro and buses and free admission to two state-run museums or other attraction (such as the Collesium). As the hotel has no resturant it is necessary to eat out, but there are numerous good resturants. I would recommend the La Famiglia on the Via Gaeta, which is only a few minutes walk (we went here twice).</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very chic and modern in perfect location”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My girlfriend and I were in Rome only 6 months ago, but we loved it so much that we decided to return in spring-time. We had planned on staying at the same hotel as we did last, but instead found this hotel around the corner from the other one through the same website. The location was perfect, but we obviously knew it would be. It is a nice and convenient area with virtually everything within walking distance. The hotel itself was amazing. The rooms and the common spaces (lobby, corridors etc.) look brand new and are extremely stylish. Although the rooms aren't the largest, you can hardly expect that in a popular city like Rome, especially not at these rates. Not that it's a particularly cheap hotel. On the contrary, you pay a premium for the boutique atmosphere, but not nearly as much as most other hotels in this category. We don't usually stay in this type of fancy hotels, but at this cost, we could afford it and it was well worth it. Just the feeling of pampering yourself was exactly what you needed for a few days' holiday off work. The staff were great as well. Even though we had been to Rome before, we had only been for a short stay and still appreciated the staff's help. I don't know if it is that the staff were so enthusiastic about the hotel themselves that did it, but they were all extremely warm and helpful throughout our three-night stay. Breakfast was also good. I see some other reviews note the lack of hot breakfast options, but that is not part of our usual breakfast routine, so it was not missed by us. If anything, we were just grateful we didn't get the sweet and unfilling Italian style breakfast we have been served elsewhere in Italy.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Yes hotel from 30 June for four nights, then after interrailing around Italy, came back to the same place for our final night before flying home. The hotel was much better than expected. All newly refurbished, the room and bathroom were spacious and clean (we stayed in a classic room after booking through Expedia). Location-wise, it was only 5 mins (if that) from the railway and bus station (perfect for us), and not particularly far from anything. The area is fine - a couple of homeless people on the street of the hotel, and more around the train/bus station, but never felt unsafe. The air con in the room wasn't too much of an issue - we simply asked Reception to turn it on in our room, then controlled it in the room by opening the windows (which shuts the a/c off). Not ideal but didn't cause any problems. Only slight issue we had was the noise in the corridors - our room was on the second floor right by the lifts. As there is no carpet in the hotels, we could hear people constantly running up and down the corridors, and the walls were quite thin. Breakfast was ok - nothing spectacular but it was enough. We found the reception staff friendly and helpful - for example, they helped us find better restaurants/bars (which are generally located in Campo del Fiore). Worth mentioning that when we stayed at the hotel again before returning home, we stayed in a smaller double room. It was in a separate building further down from the hotel. Size was fine. Cleanliness was ok, but found a few bugs around the room. It did feel strange staying in a separate building, but all in all it was fine. We would definitely return to this hotel - preferably for a classic room, rather than the standard double.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are looking for a hotel in a convenient location, that is clean, provides good service, nice rooms and value for money, then look no further that YES hotel. I had looked for a good hotel for hours on the internet including Trip advisor, but almost all, had some bad reviews. All the YES hotel reviews were good, which was why I booked this hotel. There were three of us in our party and we asked for 3 single beds in a quiet room, which was lovely. The room was an adequate size, which was very modern and the bathroom was very clean with a great shower! The location was ideal for travelling all around the historic sites of rome via the Metro and a good bus service if required. As soon as we arrived we were checked in, the desk clerk was very helpful and gave us a map and outlined all the sites and how to get to them. I'd read on Trip adviser and other sites that Stazione Termini is an unsafe place, but we didn't feel this was the case! We never felt in danger at anytime and I would recommend this location highly. Don't get me wrong it's not the best area, and there is a lot of graffitti, but most people in the area were welcoming and friendly, especially the owners and staff at a lovely Italian restaurant on the same road as the hotel, called Donati which was recommended by the hotel. We liked it so much we went twice and we were only in Rome for a three day trip! The food was lovely and the waiters were very friendly and helpful. Complimentary Limoncello for us on our second evening with them...yummy! We booked our airport transfer with Terravision which for 8 euros each return, was excellent value! I would definitely return to this hotel without hesitation and recommend it to anyone! Rome is a wonderful city and we can't wait to return in the future as there is so much to see, which is impossible to do in so little time! Ciao!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having booked a cruise from Civitavecchia we decided to have a few days sightseeing in Rome. We found the hotel based on comments from this site and were not disappointed. The hotel is located an easy walking distance from the railway station even with a couple of cases. However, a word of warning - if you arrive by rail from Civitavecchia or Fiumicino Airport you will most likely exit the station on to Via Giovanni Giolitti. Here you will find very helpful taxi drivers telling you your hotel is 3 km away. They will charge anything from 25 euros to over 100 Euros depending on your nationality for a drive around the station to the hotel. As the platforms for these destinations are located about 10 mins walk away from the main station, I strongly suggest you stay in the station and head for platforms 1-24. Then head right and cut through the main station - unmistakeable with shops, bars restaurants etc. Cross the main road ahead of you - Via Masarla - as you exit. Head down Via Marghera and take the first left on to Via Magenta towards the hotel. This is no more than a 15 minute walk and will avoid the extortionate cost of a taxi. We were welcomed by Angelo on reception who is a real star. His advice on restaurants bars and ice cream was spot-on and we can't thank him enough for his help. Our hotel room was spotlessly clean, quiet, well maintained with a modern and similarly clean bathroom. The bed was a little firm but as we were totally wiped out from the heat and walking it didn't really matter. The cleaners also did a great job every day. A continental style breakfast with bread, cheese, cold meats, cereals, juices and coffee was provided in the breakfast room each morning. Adjacent is a small bar with very reasonable prices for wines and beer. I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel and will definitely stay here when we return.</p></li>
