<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here to see a concert at the 02. It was a short walk across the footbridge from East India Station. Staff were helpful. Room was great for what we needed 3 friends sharing. Felt secure at night. Could order pizza up to 1 am (I think). To get to the 02 from east India it is a couple of tube stops away.</p></li>

Pretty noisy with a busy street outside, earplugs is a good advice. Communications to/from the city quick and easy with the DLR. Overall a good choise if youÂ´re not too picky about standards.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If working at any of the surrounding datacentres this hotel is highly recommended, a two minute walk to the closest ones. The proximity to the DLR allows easy access to central London once you're finished. The rooms are always clean, parking isn't normally a problem, the food can be a bit hit and miss, but overall a very good experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Positives: Cheap. Very close to the O2. Good sized room. Breakfast was lovely with a great selection. Good check out time. Negatives: Airplanes go over head ALL times of day. Beds uncomfortable. Not enough pillows. Too far out for anything other than the O2. Meal selection was poor and overpriced as well as drinks. Far too hot in rooms - heating was on in July. Staff weren't very helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked a family room. We stayed two nights and paid 60 pounds per night. This hotel delivers what you expect. The room was fine, and the bar and food acceptable. It is ideal for the budget traveller, perfectly located for jumping on to the Docklands Light Railway and on in to the city centre. Wifi is available, at a cost. A bonus is the relatively secure car park where it only costs a fiver a day to park.</p></li>

The room was tidy, on the small side but was easily adequate for an overnight stay. 10 minute drive to the O2, but in rush hour give yourself half hour at least. Adequate parking, nice bar in the evenings. Only gripe would be the poor breakfast. Poor selection and not of the highest quality.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 nights as it was close to the o2. It was basic which is the norm with a travelodge but i found the sheets had not been cleaned properly and the carpet cant have been hoovered as there was a broken finger nail on the floor. Parking was paid per day at the reception. Staff were ok. Bar served drinks till late and there were a few vending machines for snacks. Reception very busy and took a while to get checked in even though it was 10pm.</p></li>

The hotel was an easy 5 minute walk to the nearest DLR station (East India) & then 20 minutes on the DLR to connect with the Tube at Tower Hill. Our room was standard Travelodge, though the bar/restaurant were very pleasant. Staff were friendly & helpful at all times.</p></li>

Rooms were clean and quite large, and the bar was open late with outside seating. Very plesant stay and we would definitely return. Be aware though, that there are no bars, restaurants or shops near this Travelodge, it's in a large office area that is pretty much dead during the evenings and weekends, The nearest shop is a supermarket the other side of the tube station.</p></li>

Plenty of coffee & chocolate machines in reception, large car park. Shower only, no bath. BAD Hotel a bit tatty & rundown, a coat of paint is needed throughout. All staff non-English speakers but perfectly helpful. It was on a noisy road which might keep you awake (take earplugs). All in all, OK for one night. Â£55 a night was a bit steep for the standard, but OK for London prices.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were apprehensive after reading some of the reviews on here, but had a pleasant surprise. The room was adequately clean, the shower was hot and powerful enough and the bed was very comfortable but could have done with more/bigger pillows. It was very convenient for the DLR. Breakfast was busy but still very organised compared to other hotels we have stayed in. We also had an evening meal which was delicious and very reasonably priced. Would highly recommend as an affordable hotel for visiting London.</p></li>

Last year i stayed in the Holiday Inn but this hotel was a much better location, right in the financial times area of the docklands so quite secure if a group of girls or on own. East India DLR is right behind the hotel. Take this to to next tube station and change to get to O2 arena Â£5.60 day pas for zone 1 & 2. Hotel not the ritz but you get what you pay for. Parking is Â£5 for 24hrs. Best hotel for O2 though</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed up Thursday 27th to visit the 02 for a concert. The location was fine with easy transport from East India DLR to O2. Room was large enough for the three of us and quiet. The following morning we had a good breakfast and transferrd to another Travelodge at Southwark. The reception arranged early check in for us at Southwark for Â£10 which meant we went straight to the hotel at 10am, got our room and out for the day. Bar is on ground floor with access to ouside tables if weather good enough. Good stay as far as we were concerned.</p></li>

May sound like im moaning but a simple thing like a teaspoon cant be found at breakfast and they offer tea n coffee!!! Staff were very friendly and helpfull. overall we had a great time and if your not as fussy as me then its go fot it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in this Travelodge for two nights with my three children, in a family room. We faced the car park, so the noise was not too bad, which was good as it was very hot and we had the window open all night. The room was clean, but a bit shabby, torn carpet, bath panel badly fitted etc, could do with an update. But it was perfectly funtional, and suited us just fine. The staff were friendly and helpful. For the money, (Â£80 for two nights including breakfast for all 4 of us) I thought it was excellent value, and I would definately stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I guess Travelodge are not interested in quality only quanity judging by the very poor standards they now have. The walls in the rooms were dirty, the sheets barely fitted the beds. The beds themselves are marginally more comfortable than the floor, the pillows were hard. Then there the breakfast, don't bother go anywhere else! If you want a good nights sleep you won't get it here unless you take your own earplugs because the noise from the main road and airplanes is a 24hr drone, with windows closed!! I wouldn't recommend this hotel to any one.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Basic, booked to stay for the 02. Unfortunately the day of our stay the dockland railway was mostly not available so we had to get a bus to another station in an outer zone to come back in for the 02 (cost more). The reception wernt very helpful in where we catch the bus.The buses back were a bit hit & miss too. So really what should have been a 1 stop to the 02 was a pain in the backside. We got stuck in the lift too, reception didnt seem very bothered by it. The lift help button didnt know when an engineer would get to us & asked for our location!</p></li>

The cot was broken, so we just couldn't use it and baby had to sleep with us. Room was stifling hot and noisy. Run down and dirty elevator and hallways.

I also wasn't able to wash my hair as hairdryers are only available at the front desk for 2 hours and both times I tried, there were none available. I was also charged 10 pounds extra for an "early check-in" despite just checking in 50 minutes early. The only positive thing I could say about the hotel was the breakfast was decent. I wasn't expecting anything fancy but this hotel was downright grubby and definitely not worth the 120 pound/night price tag.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Think we got what we paid for here. The staff were nice and very helpful. The corriders smelt stale and there were holes in the walls. Our room itself was ok, the bathroom could have been cleaner, and our towels disappeared the following day. The shower was powerful though the water was a lot cooler the following day. On the plus side we didn't experience any noise from outside the bed was very comfortable and clean, the car park was cheap and safe. East India DLR was a short walk away. For me the pros outweighed the cons. I would stay here again as it was easy to drive to and was on the whole OK.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We checked in for one night to see a show at the O2. Reception staff rude upon arrival. One hour after we checked in, without any knock or warning, a housekeeper walked straight into our room. When asked by my partner to leave, they seemed to not understand English and carried on checking the bathroom regardless. After that, I felt so unsafe there. We took all out valuables to the show with us and I barely slept a wink all night. No real explanation from the staff, although we got free breakfast, which was cold and rubbery. Only had one towl in the room, even though it was booked for two adults. Avoid this hotel!!</p></li>

The reception staff were friendly and helpful. The room was basic (what you would expect from a travelodge) but was clean and comfortable. The hotel was a short walk from the DLR, which was an extremely efficient way of getting in and out of the city. The hotel has a busy road to its rear but with the window closed this was not an issue. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone expecting a five star service but if you are looking for a base from which to explore London it is ideal.</p></li>

We had a very friendly welcome, the reception were very helpful when we asked the easiest and cheapest way to get to the O2 and the room was clean. We had a room facing the road and could hardly hear the traffic at all. The breakfast was very well laid out and the staff were friendly and helpful. We would stay here again and even though everyone is entitled to their opinion, i feel some of these bad reviews are very harsh. If they want luxury, like they so obviously do, then they should go and pay The Ritz or The Savoy prices.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this Travel Lodge for the Royal Wedding weekend, it cost just Â£45 a night which was an amazing price given the busy weekend in London. reception staff helpful and friendly, room was what we expected for a Trave Lodge. Bedding and towels clean and adequate,flat screen TV and tea making facilities. We pre booked the buffet breakfast which was very enjoyable. There is a bar, dinner service and plenty of vending machines for snacks. Just a couple minutes walk to the DLR which connects to the London Tube System - cost Â£4 for a 3 zone ticket into centre of London. 24 hour parking Â£5 a night!!! Would certainly stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just back from a weekend in London. Stayed in the Travelodge Docklands because it was close to the O2 arena. Hotel is fantastic for the price you pay. Rooms are basic but clean and a good size. Staff were always accomodating; our first key didn't open the door and that was sorted straight away and we were given extra towles when we requested. The bar is very good, food is basic but does the trick. We paid 7.50 each for breakfast which was okay but doin't know if I'd get it again if I went back. The hotel is also very close to the East India train stop to get into the centre of London which is quite far away. But for the O2 it's spot on!</p></li>

They have to find you somewhere else if its overbooked????? The room was standard travelodge but was about 10 metres from the A13! The soundproofing was non existant. The room was very hotel even though no heating was on but there was no way you could open the window!!!! Checked out very tired and disatisfied. I wouldnt mind but its not even cheap!!!!</p></li>

There were a couple of minor niggles upon arrival, such as not enough towels in the room, but these were dealt with quickly and politely by the staff.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As with most other reviews would concur that this hotel offers value for money providing you take advantage (as we did) of the Â£29 per night offer available on the Travelodge website. Â£6.75 for pre booked cooked breakfast was also good value - particularly in London. One word of warning though - if you are travelling by car late at night make sure you have clear and precise instructions regarding the location of the hotel. We spent 30 minutes going round in circles around Canary Wharf trying to find the location of the hotel. If you approach from the wrong direction there are very few road signs to help and the locals do not seem to know where the hotel is either!</p></li>

The curtains in our room were different lengths (a good 15cm different!) and the shower curtain in the shower seemed to operate as a form of transportation system to get water out of the shower and onto the floor (resulting in the bathroom looking like a pond and me having soaking wet clothes to drag in a suitcase through Europe until I could find somewhere to dry them), but it was about Â£39 for the night, so I can't complain too much.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a regular visitor to Canary Wharf for work, I have frequently stayed in this hotel. It has 2 really bad flaws that have stopped me staying there ever again. First, their admin of corporate bookings is HOPELESS - they never can find the booking/confirmations; and there is always a check-in delay. Secondly, the even-numbered rooms overlook a main road and can be very noisy (especially lower floors) - if you get an odd-numbered room, it's fine. The hotel itself is pretty tired and tatty, and it's in a grotty location - but I don't really mind that as it is cheap and it is convenient for Canary Wharf by DLR. It's the 2 show stoppers above that really make it a bit of a disaster.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location too isolated dark walk at night from train station. Lack of basic facilities, i.e. No iron/board except on 1 floor (not on each floor) this room was not clean, ironing board needed new cover and steam iron with no facility to fill up with water/needed cleaning. Nowhere to hang ironed clothes in ironing room if more than 1 item. Front lift out of action for full week on site (may have been longer), stained carpets throughout reception, bar, stairwell and bedrooms. Bathroom not clean, mouldy shower curtain, dirty bath and sinks. Very noisy as no air con and window opened onto dual carriageway. As expensive as Hilton Docklands with less amenities/service/cleanliness. Preferred to drive daily (200 miles each way) than stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked in here for 2 nights by the company we were doing some work for. Not our choice but we thought it would be okay. Until we arrived. The receptionist was rude and unhelpful, hotel dirty and smelly. Needs total refurbishment. Silly things like no TV remote were annoying. Bathroom grubby and shower curtain disgusting. Breakfast was a farce - so awful you had to laugh. They hand you a cold plate as you enter the restaurant so that you can plate up your own sawdust sausages, cold scrambed (we think) egg and goodness what else it was all supposed to be. The bread for your toast was still in its packet and had to be put through the toaster three times to get it a light toasting! Generally awful and we will definitely not stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel with my husband and two children. We got a good deal, just under Â£100 for the two nights inc breakfast for us all. I found the room clean , yes its fairly basic but I thought great value. I was not expecting much from the breakfast which we booked online at the time of the booking room but it was great , lots to choose from inc hot cooked breakfast. I would point out that we got there just after 8 am , after 8.30 there was a big queue. Just a few mins walk to the DLR so was great location. We drove to the hotel and was only Â£5 to park for 24 hrs. Only negatives were the room was very hot and was there alot of noise from traffic and planes - take some ear plugs and you will be fine. I am sure there isnt a quiet hotel in London ! I would stay again.</p></li>

She went to reception and was told that all the bed linen was in the cupboard behind the door and we was to make it up ourselves. the room was very noisy with traffic noise and as the window didnt close properly was also very draughty for our daughter who was sleeping directly underneath. The bath hadnt been cleaned very well and still had hair in from the previous occupant. On the plus side that breakfast was very good quality and plentiful.</p></li>

There was 4 of us but thought we would really do it on the cheap and fit all of us in the 1 room, which the staff didn't seem to question. The room was really clean, spacious (plenty of room to sleep at least 4 people!), The shower was powerful, the water was hot and the staff gave us plenty of towels, duvets and a hairdryer on request. The staff were super friendly and helped us order takeaways to our room. The breakfast was also very good value for money for all the stuff they had to offer, it really set us up for the day. The location was also good, about 40 minutes to get to Camden and 30 to Oxford Street. We were so pleased with our Â£35pn find and will be coming back again.</p></li>

OK, it was a basic room but it was clean and comfortable with a TV and tea and coffee facities. Hot water and powerful shower. No air con and it hit high temperatures but we coped. Our price included breakfast and the staff were working hard as the place was VERY busy. Good choice of food and drinks. We slept fine but we did take our own pillows!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed one night only at this hotel during a business trip. Even if I understand that you should expect only basics from this kind of hotel, I did not expect the room to be that filthy. The carpet had not been hoovered for ages obviously, and it looked like the cleaning ladies also rushed to do the bathroom. My room was facing a road with constant traffic (mainly trucks) which added to my discomfort due to the noise. There was a kettle with cups and coffee/tea in the room, on the moment I thought that this was quite nice at least... until I opened the kettle and saw how dirty it was inside. In addition the spoons in the cups looked like that they had been used over the years but never washed. As you understood, I would not book a room again in this hotel and would certainly not advise anyone to stay there!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">following some of the reviews we were apprehensive about our discounted stay here for 2 nights, but have no complaints about our stay at all. The staff were pleasant & helpful - when we reported a missing light bulb the manager came up immediately with a new one. Breakfast was one of the better Travelodge offerings. The room was clean, tidy, cleaned each day, quiet despite being next to the A13 & the location is excellent - DLR, Jubilee line & buses all a short walk away. The real bonus though is the parking - @ Â£5/day it is unmatched anywhere else in London, we next stayed in Norwich where parking cost us Â£14 for overnight only. It is also just outside the congestion zone - another plus. I would not hesitate in returning to this Travelodge on our next visit to London - a bargain in terms of location & price.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just come back from four days at Travelodge, Docklands. Needed somewhere easy to drive to, avoid Congestion Charge and easy to access central London. This is it. Shall definitely return. Walk to East India DLR a couple of hundred yards. Station in zone 2 so off-peak day passes are fine. Rooms typical Travelodge - clean, sufficient and friendly staff. The bar and cafe also typical Travelodge unfortunately, so save on money and time by walking towards the DLR then turning right by board advertising Cafe. There are three down here on the same private estate as the Travelodge and all good value. Breakfasts especially good at present. Car parking at Travelodge Â£5 a day through ticket machine - but also needs 'resident permit' from Travelodge reception. Arrive early though as park doubles as commuter park for london.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is OK if you are staying no more than one night for the O2 arena!! Although the taxi is not cheap. The staff were cheerful and helpful. However this is a very tired travel lodge. Our room was cheap but it stank of cigarette smoke even thought the whole building is non smoking. The net curtains were very dirty and I imagine the problem is that the soft furnishings have not been cleaned since the smoking ban came in to force. There was loads of very hot water but this really is " no frills"- you need to bring almost everything with you apart from towels and bedding. Breakfast is just about OK - as long as you do not want a cooked breakfast - my husband said it was disgusting - I only had toast. But there really is nowhere nearby to have breakfast. Use it for what it is - some where to get you head down for a night!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here in November 2009 to attend an event in London - the hotel is located across the road from Docklands Airport with excellent views of the River Thames and Canary Wharf. There is a little noise from the airport , but this is to be expected. My stay here was two nights, the staff were accommodating and helpful with my requirements and nothing was too much for them. The room was quite hot and didn't appear to have air conditioning. The beds were also quite low on the floor. I had slight problems with my television in the room not working but this was soon sorted out by the helpful staff Breakfast was nice and plenty of hot food was available. I will definately we staying here again. The only drawback was a fire evacuation drill at 12.30am in the morning on one of the coldest nights in November and we were left outside for 30 minutes!!</p></li>

Can Park for Â£5 a night which is good value for London Outside of Congestion Zones Bad Points - Rooms smell badly of toilets. You get used to it after a while but when you first return to your room is always smells like somebody has just been to the toilet! Horrible showers because the mouldy shower curtains stick to you whilst you are having a shower. The water goes freezing cold then boiling hot! Other peoples hairs hanging off wall tiles to bathrooms! Carpets are rather disgusting, especially in the main coridoors the coridoors SMELL AWFUL! Noisey outside due to planes overhead and some kind of generator going all day and night For Â£19 a room cant complain but I wouldnt pay anymore. Apparently the hotel has just been 'done up'...but it doesnt look or smell like it!</p></li>

I "speak as I find" so this review is at it happened to us. We had no problem finding the place as we had printed out a map before we left home. Check-in was by a charming young lady. Our room was on the ground floor this time, much better, as we did not have to rely on a lift. One small gripe was that I had to return to reception to get enough towels for two of us. Why when you book a room for two are there only towels for one? I can answer that for myself of course!! The bed was comfortable, it was very quiet and we had a good breakfast the next morning with helpful staff on duty. At £63.25, including breakfast, it was not a bargain compared to what I see others have paid, but for London we were quite satisfied. If we need to be in the area again we will be back.</p></li>

The hotel parking is very reasonable Â£5 for 24 hours and there was plenty of spaces available. The hotel staff were very friendly and answered various questions we had ... they consisted of where is the nearest tube - 5 min walk, nearest shop - 10 min walk etc The lifts were out of use when we visited and had been for some time apparently. The room was very basic but like i said you expect that for the price but they were clean. The shower didn't have a suitable curtain and this lead to the floor being flooded everytime we showered. To be honest the only major issue I had was the noise ... the room faced onto the busy dual carriage way behind the hotel and this distrupted my sleep. A tip from me would be to request a room facing the car park.</p></li>

The room was basic but clean, but we did not expect it to be so noisy. We had to shut the window so boiled all night and we still could not escape from the incessant traffic noise that permeated the room all night. Would never stay here again. We were very disappointed also with immediate area. We had hoped to go out for dinner but after driving past the hotel several times (sat nav postcode given by Travelodge is incorrect!) we soon realised that there appeared to be no bars or restaurants in immediate walking distance (unless we missed them). We had to eat in and the food was not good. Didn't stay for breakfast - just wanted to get out of the place as quickly as possible!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Travelodge Docklands because the price was right, and it was a great way to see London on a shoestring. The hotel offers the basics, such as a clean room and comfortable bed. There is a restaurant downstairs which was good for dinner, but the breakfast was a bit pricey. Instead, we took the DLR and had breakfast at the Wetherspoons right near the Tower Hill/Tower Gateway underground stop. It did not take long to get to the hotel, or back into town. Don't let the Docklands location put you off. The hotel is close to the East India stop, just 2 blocks north. I've stayed at Travelodges all across the UK, and they're all exactly the same on the inside. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. But they're good basic hotels and you know what to expect - a MUCH safer bet than similarly priced independent hotels. Don't expect the Ritz, but expect to be comfortable.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">So let's be clear, this is a budget hotel. No frills like toiletries, no phone in the room, cell block decor. However for Â£59 for a room to crash after an event at the O2 it was good value. It is located a short walk from East India DLR station, and if you have a room overlooking the carpark it's reasonably quiet. Don't expect much in the way of customer service, the check in desk is pretty busy and staff seemed under pressure. Although the hotel looks very tired and really needs a coat of paint, it is clean in the bedrooms and the bathroom. The overall comfort of the room is acceptable, but it doesn't feel like much consideration has been given to this aspect of your stay. I would use this hotel again because it is exceptionally good value and the location is perfect for the O2, but I really hope they listen to the feedback about the need for a refurbishment. It's over due!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for the night but arrived at 11am, left the car in the car park and got straight onto the DLR line, which is 5 minutes walk from the hotel. We were in central London within 30 minutes of parking!! Not a lot going on around the hotel in terms of bars, restaurants etc, but this is not something that bothered us. Good check in and staff well informed. Room clean, quiet, although it was smaller than others we've stayed in, but nevertheless no complaints there. We didn't eat at the hotel but did have a quick drink and service and prices were pretty good. Securtiy good - barrier to get into car park, and the room key also opened security doors in the communal corridors. Good vending machine in case your forget toothpaste/brush for instance or need a cold drink or snack. Parking cost Â£5 which we felt was very reasonable. All in all very happy stay, and will definately return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having read the other reviews of this hotel, I must say, what do people want. We found the hotel great value Â£119 for a family room for two nights, it was clean and tidy, with a nice bar and restaurant area. Great location for the docklands light railway (just approx. 500m away). One observation though it seems that the odd number rooms are on the quite side of the hotel away from the main road as stated in other reviews, so it might be worth bearing in mind when you book, but to be fair to Travelodge they do state that there might be some road noise. Now before anyone asks I am nothing to do with Travelodge just someone who has travelled extensively throughout the world and stayed in 5 star hotels down to shacks on the beach and in my experience you get what you pay for so if you are looking for 5 star don't book a Travelodge, but if you want good value for money then give them a try</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for one night with my mum. I booked it originally as I was due to watch a gig at the O2 that was cancelled and would never normally book a hotel in the Docklands if I was visiting Central London, but I was impressed with the ease of getting to and from the hotel on the DLR. The hotel is 2 minutes from the station. You simply head over the bridge and down the stairs from the station, head straight on take the second right and you are there. The station is within Zone 2. Our room was slightly better than the Travelodges I have stayed at previously although a little smaller. It had a comfortable bed, a nice strong shower and a flat screen TV. The room was also clean and in good condition. One of the lifts was broken during our stay, but there was another lift slightly further away from the reception. Overall for Â£32 I was very impressed and would definitely recommend if you are visiting London on a budget.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed four nights at Â£29 per night which I thought was a bargain, it takes about 20 mins from Central London by DLR which may be a bit far out for some but is not so bad as its quite a good service. The hotel is undergoing refurbisment and that may cause a bit of disturbance to some but most of the work is going on in the day so you probably wouldn't notice it. The breakfast was okay, nice breakfast room and attentive staff, although the scrambled eggs were akin to rubber. If you are arriving by tube/DLR to East India station, there is little signage and late at night it is very deserted so make sure you cross the footbridge (signpost Town Hall), go down the stairs past the buses that are parked and through what looks like a security gate, you will then see the travelodge on the right hand side. I would happily stay again given the cost, even at full price it never seems to go over Â£55 which for London is a bargain.</p></li>

<li>The <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">breakfast</span> was okay, nice breakfast room and attentive staff, although the scrambled eggs were akin to rubber.</li>

<li>If you are arriving by tube/DLR to East India station, there is little <span style="background-color:#557585" title="p=0.996">signage</span> and late at night it is very deserted so make sure you cross the footbridge (signpost Town Hall), go down the stairs past the buses that are parked and through what looks like a security gate, you will then see the travelodge on the right hand side.</br></br></li>
<li>I would happily stay again given the <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">cost</span>, even at full price it never seems to go over Â£55 which for London is a bargain.</br></br></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For anyone like us being not familiar with East London, it can be difficult to find. Thankfully we had a London A to Z book! Apart from that, this Travelodge is very good indeed! A rather up market theme to this one, compared to many others we have used. Rooms very nice, new flat screen tvs, coffee and tea in the room, breakfast buffet excellent value at Â£6.75 if you pre book it, and thats for one adult and two children, a breakfast feast! Staff very helpful, and secure car park at Â£5 per night for guests (take ticket on arrival, and pay reception on leaving). Very close to the Docklands Light Railway station, East India with excellent links at Canning Town for tube services to the 02 Arena, and Central London. Excellent value if you can get a Â£26 per night deal, but still worthy at the full price which Im told is Â£80 per night. This one is a good advert for Travelodge, and they can fly their flag high over this one!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">after reading the reviews on here we were dreading going, but thought hey its only one night !!! as soon as we arrived we were greeted by the car park attendant who was bot helpful and friendly,the check in was both quick and also very friendly giving good advice on how to best visit London attractions. The room was both spacious and clean we were very pleasantly surprised. we had food both in the evening and buffet breakfast which was of decent quality. breakfast got busy at times so we did have to wait for food,but it was busy so acceptable,we should have got up earlier lol.the breakfast cost us Â£7.?? online but the kids ate free !!!!! so was worth the money. the only negative that i could say was that one of the lifts was not working but they did tell you about the other one(we 2nd floor so no worries). And the sofa bed was a bit saggy if I'm being picky lol would come back again and would recommend. HOPE THIS HELPS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we arrived on the 30th march at 11am after a 4 hour journey from wales, we were greated with a very bubbly happy receptionist who although we were very early to get into our room she sorted it out and we were in our room within 10 minutes, the room was spotless and the location was perfect, about 5 minutes walk from the tube and 5 minutes cab journey to the o2 which was ideal as my daughter and friend were going to a concert that night, The bar at this travelodge was great , clean,spacious and friendly bar staff , my friend and i could relax as the girls got ready upstairs. After the concert we returned and we all slept like logs, my friend and i slept on the pull-out beds and it was really comfortable didnt wake all night, there was no noise from outside at all, overall i would rate this travelodge as one of the best i,ve stayed in in london, some people might disagree but it ticked all the boxes for my friend and i and 2 teenage girls.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just a two minute walk from East India DLR station it's perfect for a short break in London. The food in the restaurant/cafe is average but it's handy if you arrive late and don't want to travel far for a meal, as there are no other places to eat in the immediate area. The O2 is a great place to go for something to eat if you want to avoid the busy city centre, with plenty of choice from Thai, Italian, Chinese, Pizza etc, and there's a Japanese sushi bar opening soon. The rooms are spacious and comfortable and the lobby has vending machines with snacks and drinks if you've forgotten to get something at the shop, and also two computer terminals if you need to check anything online. There's an outside seating area for smokers and some shelter from the rain if the weather turns. The staff are pleasant, friendly and willing to help if you have any queries. When i'm planning my next trip to London this is the first place i'll be checking for availability.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very basic (but what you would expect from a Travelodge). Room was however very clean, as were the white bedding and towels. Staff were friendly and helpful. The room got very hot (would hate to stay here in high summer) and the noise from the road is horrific and relentless and kept me awake - although they do warn you about this on the website. We didn't have breakfast but did have an evening meal, the food was cheap and cheerful but perfectly adequate. The best thing about this hotel is its location, catch the DLR out from Central London. Its a scenic trip and only takes 10-15 mins. When you exit the DLR at East India (which falls just within Zone 2) make sure you exit over the bridge, Travelodge is then a 5 minute walk. Also this hotel is outside the congestion zone and parking is cheap. I would certainly recommend this hotel if you will using it just for a base and will be out most of the day. For the money paid, this hotel is excellent value for money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel earlier in the month, as we had a party to attend in Canary Wharf. The Location for this was pretty close, just a short cab ride which was ideal. We picked this hotel as it was a reasonable price. I know the Travelodge is a basic hotel, but does basic mean it can be filthy?? On arrival the reception looked ok, although no one was at the desk. Waited about 5 minutes before someone appeared. The staff were polite and helpful, offered to book us a taxi for a bit later. The Room - Well what can i say, other than Disgusting. There was several pieces chewing gum stuck on the celling. Who does that!!! The shower curtain was a nice shade of brown (think it was originally white). Stains on the duvet and sheets which was a delight i must say. Apparently there was nothing the staff could do, as no other rooms available!!! I would never stay here again, and definitely would not recommend this to anyone. Stay some where else unless you dont mind staying in filth.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here 3 nights in may of 2011. It is close to Canary warf and very convenient for the elevated railway which runs in the east end. from there you can connect to several subway lines so the whole city is accessible. The journey from the airport to the hotel by subway was arduous but i made it okay. i felt sorry for the people on the subway who had to put up with my luggage as it was rushhour on a thursday night. the room was alright for the price, i realize london is expensive. i think i paid about $80 canadian a night which isn't bad. the room was small and the t.v. only seemed to have one channel but i wasn;t in the room much. there was no phone or radio/alarm clock in the room which i found unusual but no worries. there is a restaurant in the hotel but i didn;t eat there. if i was on a tight budget again and travelling on my own dime i wouldn't hesitate to stay here again but i wouldn;t mind something more central in the city even if i had to pay more which i know is the reality.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Look come on guys this is a Travelodge which advertises the fact they keep prices down by no toiletries or hairdrier etc. Don't expect the world. We have just returned from three days here as my son was attending the David Beckham Academy (DBA)and I really have no complaints. I am used to staying in 5* hotels all over the world and I certainly didn't expect this standard at a Travelodge in the Docklands. You get what you pay for, for goodness sake!! The room was comfortable, clean and quiet (yes do stay on the car park side). A quick walk to the East India DLR and a change at Canning Town sees you at the O2,(North Greenwich) (three minute walk to the DBA) with loads of restaurants. SPUR was our favourite by far. On the first night we bought a bottle of wine from the bar at the hotel but soon got wise to the Budgens by the East India DLR station (If only they sold ice!!)) Fifteen minutes will see you in to the heart of London. Bargain price for the location. Breakfast a bit average but apart from that no complaints!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel via anpther company - arrived to be told they had not beed paid by this company -also told could not check in til 3pm. Problem with payment sorted out with an apology - their mistake. got keycard and directed to room - keycard did not work - traipsed back to reception for new card. (this happened 5 times in the 3 nights I was there.) Room was basic and not overly clean - there was a piece of guest soap on the shower taps - i chose to leave it there to see how ell the rooms were cleaned - it was still there the morning I left. Food - time your meal well. food was rarely warm let alone hot. my suggestion is to get yourself some cereals and a cup of tea (teaspoons had to be asked for each day) and wait for the food to be topped up then go for it. the toaster took 3 times round the grill to get bread that even looked like toast. The location of the hotel is fine and is very near to the DLR at west india docks - just a few stropos from canary wharf. final comment - good location - wrong hotel chain. 'nuff said'</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked a one night stay through Travel Republic at a great price. This hotel would have cost more than double if I'd booked direct with Travelodge. We (my partner, daughter and myself) stayed on 29th Dec for the Miley Cyrus concert (which was fab). The price included a hot buffet breakfast which was really nice, plenty of choice and quite busy, but easy to get seated. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. We parked the car in the hotel carpark for a Â£5 charge for 24 hours which I thought was great value. The rooms are basic, everything you could need (except toiletries) and clean. The hotel felt really secure as there was a security guard patrolling the car park area. You also needed to use your room key to access the door to the hallway to the rooms after exiting the lift. The hotel was situated a few minute drive to the arena, so would recommend to anyone going to a conert at the o2. In all, I would definatley stay there again, and would recommend the hotel to anyone wishing to book a bargain break near the city centre.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I really can't agree with the views expressed by my fellow Devonian "silvertonsiren" & others, who clearly have had a very different experience! I stayed at this hotel wth my daughters in February & again with my wife only two weeks ago & our experience was very much as before. I agree that the hotel food is pretty bland & unexciting, but Canary Wharf (a.k.a. Docklands!) is less than a 10 minute bus ride away (the bus stops in the next street to the hotel) & Canary Wharf has dozens of eating places, plus pubs, bars shops etc. Our room was also quieter than before as we were on the 4th floor at the side of the building. As someone else pointed out, all the staff could be assumed to be "foreign", but all spoke perfect English & were polite & helpul. As for having to pay Â£5 for parking;- I suggest staying in a London hotel with no car park at all! Again, as detailed in a previous review;- cheap, comfotable hotel, nice bar, friendly staff, 5 minutes walk to the DLR station & 25 minutes into central London...I'd certainly stay here again!</p></li>

My biggest beef was a repeat of the comment I made to the management at a previous visit in March 2011. The tables in the restaurant were permanently sticky. After each customer they were only given a cursory wipe with a damp cloth. There was no evidence of any cleaner being used making them generally rather unpleasant. There seemed to be a significant difference in the attitudes of various members of staff.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here late December as I had tickets to see Rihanna at the O2 arena. The hotel is at most a 5 minute walk from East India DLR station. We paid Â£10 to check in early so we could ditch our bags and head into central London. The room on our arrival was fairly clean, not the cleanest room i've ever stayed in but otherwise ok. There was only one big towel and one hand towel in the bathroom which wasn't ideal. There was also only one tiny bar of soap in the way of amenities in the room as well as tea making facilities. We did notice some noise from aircraft from London City airport but it didn't stop us from getting a fairly good nights sleep. One quite annoying flaw was the pillows, you get on each and they were literally as flat as a pancake. Breakfast was absolutely dire and I would not recommend paying for it. It was around Â£7 per person and you can get a much better breakfast elsewhere. The hotel was only 2 stops from the O2 so it is ideal location wise. I'd recommend this hotel if you are on a budget and visiting the O2 but don't expect the ritz, it is basic accommodation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A good basic hotel with good public transport links into Canary Wharf, the City etc via the DLR at East India Station just a few minutes walk away. I've stayed at this hotel a couple of times now and what can I say? Its a Travelodge! So you get a fairly basic hotel which is all you need if you're going to be staying for one or two nights. It's getting a little bit grubby in places and one of the lifts was out of order on my last stay which was a little inconvenient.......but it was a better stay than my last time here when some idiot left a trail of vomit along the corridor outside my room. Not the hotel's fault of course. As has been said in other reviews, if you want a quiet night's sleep make sure you get a room which faces on to the hotel car park rather than the busy road which runs along the back of the hotel. There is a hotel bar/restaurant with a somewhat limited menu and various vending machines in the reception area, however there is a late-night opening "Budgens" supermarket on the other side of East India DLR station a few minutes walk away which sells a wide range of foodstuffs and drinks.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for one night to go to concert at 02. hotel is great location for this purpose. Basic but ok for the what we needed it for. Bar/Cafe is located within the Hotel there are no bars or restaurants in the immediate area. I had booked and payed for 6 rooms for our friends 2 months before the event. On arriving we were told sorry we hadnt got any of the rooms as they had double booked!! They offered to find us rooms at Kings Cross and pay for taxis etc but we had to be at the o2 within an hour so we said that this was not an option as we would be late for the concert. They tried to tell us we had booked in late. We were booking in at 5.15pm and you can only start checking in from 3pm so that was ridiculous! What annoyed me was that how can you pay for the room and then they still book it again if it had been one room by mistake then fair enough but all 6! After alot of confusion and frustration miraculously half an hour later they found 6 family rooms!! Amazing! Saying all this if i needed a hotel for a concert at the 02 again and i could find no other hotel i would still stay for the convenience.</p></li>

Docklands light railway (East India Station ) is 300m away,There is a large clean new looking supermarket ( Budgen's)underneath this station ( outside) which sells travelcards they cost from Â£5.30 for one day which you will use even just to travel up to the city. Hotel breakfast was good,fresh and plentiful but a bit of a free for all like many hotels now,Be aware they close promptly at 10 am on weekdays and 11am on weekends.They start clearing the stuff away at lightening speed as the clock hits the hour!Car parking is safe and Â£5 for residents ignore the sign as you go in stating that its Â£24 this is for non-residents only,The receptionist told us people complain about this mis-leading sign all the time,Makes you wonder why don't they just move it then!All in all it's not luxury but for between Â£26-40 per night it's fine.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed in a few Travelodge's around the UK, including others in London, and this one is particularly poor for a number of reasons. Yes Travelodge is a budget chain and I'm fine with cheap and cheerful as long as it's clean and tidy but this Travelodge has definitely seen better days. Particular down points for me: 1. The lack of cleanliness both in the rooms and communal areas. I'm talking about dusty surfaces, carpets that are ancient and need replacing, mould in the showers, cobwebs in the restaurant. 2. Pretty dire buffet breakfast - the sausages are awful and the egg is powdered and looks more like mashed potato. Never had a breakfast as bad in any budget chain hotel I've stayed at in the UK. 3. only giving you one bath towel for two people. What's that all about? Plus points: 1. really close to East India station on the DLR, which is the last station in zone 2. 2. I slept well on all 3 nights. Yes the rooms are hot, just open the window, yes it's noisy, it's London - buy some earplugs. I don't think I'd stay again, there are better places for the same amount of money. It didn't ruin my time in London because we were literally only using it as somewhere to sleep</p></li>

All of our party and most of the guests we spoke to wanted extra pillows, but when i asked they were all out! After completing the marathon we decided to have a meal in the restaurant. We were all wearing our finishers T shirts (bear in mind you only get these if you complete the marathon..so they are special). The bar man was a miserable guy, and tried to give out lipstick stained glasses. The incompetent waiter decided to spill curry over my T shirt and jeans..permanently staining them. I reported it all, and when i got home emailed and wrote numerous letters seeking compensation. I was initially fobbed off, however persisted and had to threaten court action to receive the compensation. They have finally apologised however the damage is done...

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked and paid for a double room at this hotel 3 months prior to our stay. Upon arrival following an event at the O2, my partner and I were advised that there were no rooms available. We were further advised when complaining that usual practice would be for them to send us by taxi to another hotel but that there were no hotels in the whole of London with any rooms available. My partner paid to use the Internet at the hotel, London Docklands, and the Travelodge website clearly showed availability at Gants Hill. When we advised the receptionist and Duty Manager of this they went behind the back of the reception saying they had to make a call and did not comeback out the front for 30 mins by which time 3-4 more people had arrived in the same situation. Needless to say we ended-up sleeping in the car which we had parked on site following demanding a refund. Checks on the web the next day showed that Travelodge have been the subject of whistle blowing by former employees that the over-booking of their hotels is actually a marketing strategy and happens all the time. No one from Travelodge ever responded to our numerous complaints. Caveat emptor, buyer beware, you get what you pay for and in our case that was a night spent freezing in a car.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel for a very reasonable 22 a night. I was quite concerned after reading the reviews on trip advisor, but went any way. We arrived at 7pm, and booked in. The reception staff were very friendly and efficient. You pay 5 a night for the parking-which has a 24 hr security guard. As we were having trouble with the ticket machine the receptionist came out to help us. The room was spacious and clean-if I wanted to be picky, which I dont, there was a slight mark on the ceiling, and if you leave your windo open you can hear road noise, but all that goes with the windows shut!! Had food in cafe-reasonable and good service, you can also eat in your room and they do pizza's until 1am. We needed extra pillows and were given them straight away. In the morning we asked which zones we would need on the tube-again they were excellent, marking the info on a little map of the tube for us to take with us. I can honestly say it is a very good hotel in a very good location. The DLR railway is a 2 min walk from travelodge, and there is a little cafe that does a fab brekkie just around the corner. A full breakfast and coffee is 5.50. We will definatley go back and stay here. I know that people have had bad experiences of this travelodge, but we couldnt fault it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Arrived to be told that there wasn't a room available, I had booked and paid for this room a week a week prior to arrival.Needless to say i refused to leave,and insisted on my room, however they told me that all they had was a room that smelt heavily of smoke from the prior guests, and that another guest had just refused, was desperate so told them i would take it, i opened a window basically. room basic, although i didn't expect 5 star decor. didn't stay that nite as i had to queue all nite at the 02 arena with my daughter (x factor auditions). stayed the following day, was wrecked tired from no sleep, but managed to get to the bar for food, bar man was miserable, never smiled and very unprofessional, food wasn't great . Went up to room to sleep as we had not slept for 48hrs, woke up at 4am to shower as we had an early flight at stanstead, only to discover the part for turning the shower on at the taps was broken off, no shower! too late to run baths for all of us. Complained at reception, but the guy wasn't in the least bit interested, non professional all the way! all i can say is they were the worst staff ever. Advise people not to stay at this particular Travelodge, really bad experience, would have been better off staying in a tube station. Staff at the local McDonalds were more courteous and professional.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked a room for two, myself and my sister for 2 nights. I requested no smoking and quiet room. Room 111 however, was extremely noisy and we got it changed to 112. This room actually stank of smoke ( No smoking ? ) and had a smell of what can only be described as cat urine.The flooring was sticky underfoot. The overall standard was of a run down 60's motel and quite unacceptable.It was extremely distressing to find ourselves in such a position. We subsequently managed to book a hotel in the city and departed without using the room. This was a special celebratory weekend, potentially ruined by a totally unacceptable standard of accommodation, in fact, the worst we have ever experienced. Thank goodness we were able to find alternative accommodation closer to the city, as otherwise, we would have returned home. Yes, that is how bad it was. I might add that I spent most of the previous day trying to telephone this Travelodge and the phone, although always ringing, was never answered. What a sad reflection on Travelodge standards. I subsequently sent a complaint in to Travelodge asking for their comments and like a previous reviewer, never received a reply; yet another bad reflection on this group and how it is run. I don't know if these standards are down to the local management, but rest assured, we won't be using this group again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A Pleasant Surprise”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place had come in for some criticism from other reviewers so I was slightly apprehensive about staying there, but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it's basic and there are more comfortable places to stay in London, but I'd have to sell an internal organ or two in order to be able to afford such accomodation. It's a Travelodge: you have to expect it to be basic. As long as it's comfortable, clean and the staff are helpful - all such criteria were fulfilled - you can't go wrong. It's easy to find from the DLR station (East India). Just cross the footbridge signposted for the town hall and it's just behind the big office blocks. It's a 2-3 minute walk. On the other side of the station, you have a supermarket that's open til 10pm (8pm on Sundays) where you can pick up some basic provisions. It's only six stops on the DLR to get to central London and the O2 Arena is just across the river, where you can find a number of restaurants and entertainment venues. All very convenient! The hotel has a perfectly adequate restaurant if you don't want to travel any further to eat. Again, it's basic, but reasonably priced. The only criticism I have to make is concerning the toilets in the hotel's restaurant. The Gent's toilet was in a particularly unpleasant state - obviously, I can't comment on the Ladie's loos - and that could really put you off your food! Otherwise, I enjoyed my stay and I'll definitely stay there again in future.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I needed to stay overnight in London and booked at short notice. If I had paid Â£15 as offered in the Travelodge sale I would have thought it good value. However at Â£139.95, I felt badly cheated. For that money, I was initially given a basic room - no sheets, covers or pillows. I was then moved to a "newer" room along a corridor with dirty carpets. This room featured sheets and pillows, a single plastic chair and a very dusty curtain with was partly hanging down. The standard "work top" was of such cheap material that it had patches of chipboard showing through where the kettle or mugs had been resting. There were additional holes drilled where the television had been anchored. The panel radiator has attached to the wall at an odd angle giving a very sad appearance to the room. The bathroom was no better: the washbasin was blocked and the water splash had caused the joins to lift. Of course there was only a very small tablet of soap - no shampoo, showergel or shower cap. The shower worked well and fortunately I had my own shampoo as my hair would have been soaked under the spray. No hair dryer of course and the short shower curtain meant the bathroom was flooded. Obviously a common occurrence as the corners of the floor covering were showing water damage. I did not try the food. The good points about the hotel were the hot water and the cheerful reception staff. I was just sorry their equipment was equally unreliable and cheap.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 3 nights starting 5th - 8th January on a family theatre Break booked through Superbreak. First of all let me start with the plus points - the breakfast was tasty, the staff were friendly and the family room was a decent size. However.............................. The beds were the hardest, most basic, that for the first time ever I asked to change rooms, but due to a large damp patch on the ceiling and a musty smell, we decided to stay in our original one. On the first night the beds were not made. Despite there being, 2 adults and 2 children, only 2 sets of towels were given - although more were given on request. Due to a mix up with Superbreak, our rooms had been booked for the wrong date - luckily I had my paperwork and we were still allowed to stay, but our room key kept locking us out and we had to get it reactivated every evening at reception. But the biggest minus by far, was at breakfast on the second morning of our stay, now this being a Travelodge I didn't expect a dress code, but did expect a 'get dressed' code. A group of 4 girls came down to breakfast in their pyjamas - correction 3 were in their pyjamas and the 4th in underwear. I thought this was very unsuitable for a family hotel and was amazed to see this, however, the following morning when they were once more allowed in dressed the same way - I was absolutely astounded. I think that the management should have shown some respect to the other paying guests.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the outside it looks good, we thought! That is until you get inside your room. We booked a family room to share with our 13 and 14 year old kids. The main bed was terrible and "sank" in the middle. Myself and my husband spent the entire night clinging onto the end of the bed so we did not roll into the middle - no sleep at all. The kidâ€™s beds were absolutely disgusting. One bed was a sofa (not even a sofa bed!) the other was a "box" which had a mattress stuffed inside it. The mattresses on the sofa and in the box were so disgusting we contacted staff and insisted on a change - to be honest the replacements weren't much better but it was gone midnight by this time and we just wanted to try and sleep. The bathroom was filthy and there were large chunks of enamel missing from the bath and mould was growing up the wall and the panel on the bath. We had ONE bath towel for room occupancy of FOUR! We had 3 pillows between 4 of us and the kids had no duvets for their beds!! On checkout we complained to the receptionist who told us it was a "budget hotel". We are aware that Travelodge is not a star rated hotel and our Â£62 room price clearly reflected this however even a budget hotel should have basic hygiene standards surely? I have emailed customer services several times but they don't seem capable of responding. Like I said at the beginning - AVOID AT ALL COSTS if you want any sleep and if you value even the most basic hygiene standards!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good value for money, some minor hassles, but be careful of valuables.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overheard another guest complaining to reception that she left her passport and money in the hotel room on the table or something, and it went missing, which means it was clearly stolen by staff. The receptionist denied the staff were behind the theft, but who else has access to a locked room other than staff?! Just be careful and lock your luggage, keep all valuables with you especially when you're out. Nothing happened to me, fortunately. Rooms are simple, and clean enough. Do note that some toiletries such as shampoo and soap are not provided, so come prepared. 3 of us were staying in the room, but only 2 sets of towels and extra blankets are provided. We didn't expect too much due to the price though. The wooden panel lining the outside of the bath tub seemed rather worn, but everything else was okay. Location wise it seems a little out of the way though, if you are seeing the main sights in London (the museums, Tower of London, Buckingham Palace). That it is near a DLR instead of a Tube station makes it a little more troublesome. The surroundings are very quiet at night, you probably won't be able to get much food within a 5-10 min walk. For some reason we had to get our cards swiped (to rest it, apparently) everyday either after breakfast, or when we returned in the evening. And as mentioned previously, the even numbered rooms facing the main road can be noisy. The odd numbered rooms facing the carpark might be better. But being a city person this was tolerable for me.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Bargain Stay”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our 5th stay at this travelodge and again it did what it said on the tin, cheap clean accommodation with good transport links. We now avoid this lodge at the weekends or when there is something on at the O2. The noise is just horrendous at nights. We were again on the ground floor and worryingly as we walked up the corridor behind reception we again smelt dampness, this was also evident during our last stay in the same corridor. This time the carpets were dry. Our room was ready on our arrival just after 3pm, no waiting to check in. The room was clean but with scuff marks on the walls. The tv remote was missing and a bulb out in the shower room. We reported both on our way out, we received the remote but the bulb wasnt replaced, which was disappointing, it was only a light bulb afterall. The one thing that really annoys me about this lodge is that it has a good bar which is only opened limited hours. It's something like 5pm to 11pm Monday through Thursday and open till midnight I believe Friday and Saturday. When the place is busy and you have people waiting outside the reception wouldnt it make sense to open the bar, people can sit there and you may even make additional Â£Â£Â£!! If you go to a show in the west end, the earliest possible time you can get back to the lodge is 11.15pm, so when you get in you can't have an alcoholic drink. The lodge isnt really near any bars for a convenient drink, so we bring things back or have a drink before heading back to the lodge.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Really dirty and scruffy”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The only good thing about this hotel is its location. I booked the hotel with my friend for one night as we were going to a concert in the 02 and after searching through various hotels it seemed both very cheap and well located for our visit. And it was. Just a five minute walk to East India DLR station and then one stop on that before getting on the tube for one more stop to North Greenwich, it was ideally located and overnight parking was just Â£5. (Coming home from the O2, it was also handy as it seemed that most people were travelling towards the city centre and as we were going the opposite way, we were back at the Travelodge in about 20 minutes.) But that's where the good points stop for us. The main room itself was scruffy, bordering on dirty - with marks on the duvet, ominous white stains on the rather dilapidated sofa, dirty net curtains and poly-fillered holes in the wall. However, the bathroom was worst of all. Mould all over the roof, the area around the sink hadn't been cleaned before we arrived, the shower curtain was yellowy brown (and should have been white) and there was a loose wire and ugly holes where a notice told us a heated towel rail should be. We couldn't shut the door to the bathroom either as if you did you would get locked in as the door could only be opened from the outside. All this seemed very odd to me for somewhere that looked quite new and had a fancy flat screen television - personally I would have thought that a new shower curtain, lick of paint and some cleaning materials would have been more important. For one night it was bearable but any longer and we would have either asked to be moved or gone elsewhere.</p></li>
