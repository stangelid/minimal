<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for a convention. The hotel was very nice with good employees, but if I was on a non-business trip, I wouldn't stay here because of the distance from the city. There are quite a few nice restaurants nearby and you can walk easily to the Silver T line (which will take you to the airport for $2).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has great features, updated, close to decent dining although it's not close in to downtown. However, a short $10 taxi ride puts you right in the heart of the city and the historic landmarks. The nice thing about this hotel is its proximity to Logan International. I would definitey recommend it .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is upscale and most convenient to restaurants and particularly the convention center, where the conference was held. While everything is done to accommodate guests, the $16.95 fee for an Internet connection in the room is really exhorbitant. Also, skip the $42 valet parking and park around the corner for $30.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for one night in August, with a late arrival, on the eve of a cruise departing from the Black Falcon Terminal. The hotel is lovely, the desk personnel helpful, and the room extremely comfortable. We were able to walk over to the cruise ship terminal in the late morning. It was a warm day but even with luggage it was not difficult. We booked through Priceline and were extremely pleased at the value we obtained.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a great location - only a few minutes from the airport by Silverline, and a 15 minute walk to Boston's sights. Ask for a room on a high floor with harbour view - even if, like me, you booked with Priceline. I paid only $80 per night for a weekend stay - you can't get a cheap motel for that! The room was very comfortable - and Starbucks internet password worked on the 17th floor in my room too! I will definitely return!</p></li>

We were on the 21st floor and our room was bright, sunny and offered wonderful views of the harbor. It was a quick 5 minute walk to the convention center, which made it easy. While we didn't eat there, there is a Del Frisco's right there (one of my favorite steakhouses). The staff was friendly and helfpul. I would stay here over the Seaport if the rates were the same.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here just one night -we got a great rate to start with and hit a free upgrade to a city/harbor view -the room was super clean and basic. Very quiet. Breakfast was very good, typical city prices but a good value for the location-and very good service. This hotel is right in the middle of all the new restaurants at Seaport-literally-all the new(er) places are a very short walk-and then there's the ever-changing scene on Biston Harbor with so much boating action. I definitely recommend this hotel!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent 3 nights here in February 2012. The location is excellent. I-93 is just a short drive away and there is a T station a little less than a block away. There are a few great restaurants in the neighborhood. My biggest issues were the parking - which was too expensive (Valet & on-site self parking is an outrageous $42/day) and the paper-thin walls between rooms. I learned a lot about my neighbor and his business even though he wasn't trying to be loud. The concierge lounge was nice and the staff was friendly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A nice, very clean, newer hotel with everything you could expect for the price. The hotel's only downside is the neighborhood--it's pretty isolated from the rest of Boston and consists of only a few office buildings, two condo buildings, and some hotels. There are only a few restaurants, mostly in the ~$20/entree range, and nothing by the way of nightlife. The area is incredibly clean and safe, though. However, downtown is easily accessible by the Silver Line with stops nearby, so its easy to get to some more stimulation.</p></li>

Hotel is next to the Silver Line bus that was a very short ride to the airport & handled riders and luggage without a problem (and was only $ 2 each way per person). Hotel is close to one of the tour company pickup sites. Severel nice restaurants within walking distance with good food. I would definitely recommend this hotel.</p></li>

I didn't know what to expect but loved the beds, and got helpful information from the concierge. Boston was fun, wish there were more restaurants in the nearby area of the hotel. Had no trouble catching a cab, riding the T, riding a pedicab, or even the trolley tour. Will be back. And will stay here if the price is right. Only wish wi-fi was included....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am so glad I stayed at this hotel. Off the beaten track a little but with 2 housekeeping svs a day, great linens, comfortable rooms and club floor - that's all I needed. Once in a while you hear the planes but not really bothersome. There are a number of good restaurants within a short cab ride. Remember this is near water and does not have the same atmosphere and shopping as the other areas of Boston. You would use a cab or if you are so inclined the subway is just a short walk away. As a hotel this was first rate and I would definately stay again.</p></li>

The accomodations seemed fine but we did not receive room service one of the days. After 14 hours of site seeing we came home to dirty dishes outside the room and dirty towels on the floor. The front desk credited us $50 for our trouble but it does not seem adequate but we were too tired to put up a fight. The hotel was convienent for a wedding on the pier but that was about it. It was 1.5 mile walk to do any of the major sight seeing unless you were catching a boat somewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The waterfront hotel was a great option at a good price. It was right across the street from the Silverline Bus, which we grabbed from the airport and which also took us to the T for our explorations inside of Boston. The hotel room was clean, the Starbucks was cozy and had free wi-fi ( although it was only open until 7pm ). We asked for a room with a view of the Harbor and were not disapointed. I personally love that they have Aveda products available for you in the bathroom. The area is building up as well so by summer there should several more places to eat around the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel is in great location across from some great restauarants, including the one in the hotel. Lobby is beautiful and one of the nicest I have experienced. Gym is also one of the best I've seen in a hotel. The problem with this hotel, and it is a big one, is lack of sound proofing in rooms. Even at a normal voice tone, you can clearly hear everything that is being said in the room next to you. I have experienced this on all 3 occassions that I have stayed at this hotel. Service at front desk is excellent by the way. Bathrooms are great and rooms are spacious and sunny with great views.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here with my wife and son over Spring Break, and it turned out to be a very nice hotel. It is new and beautiful. The staff is very courteous and helpful. Our room was large and had a view of the city and water. The pool and gym were nice. The lobby with fireplace and free computer use is very nice. When I booked the hotel, I was worried about the location, but it turns out that the Waterfront is beautiful, full of first class hotels and restaurants, and the subway "T" silver line is across the street from the hotel, an easy trip to downtown Boston. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a monthly business traveler to Boston, I prefer this hotel over all others. It's not close to tourist stops, but as a quiet comfortable place surrounded by excellent service, it can't be beat. Rooms are spacious and have nice touches of luxury for an affordable price. All rooms have floor to ceiling windows for excellent harbor views. It is right across the street from the concert venue on the harbor; so an excellent location for attending those gigs or hearing the tunes while eating outdoors. The restaurant in the hotel has an excellent chef who was featured on Top Chef Masters as a contestant.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed a week there, due to conference. Rooms are spacious and clean but very expensive. Room design is not that exciting, quite simple and rather old fashioned. The big problem is you can hardly rest without ear plugs, the walls are so thin that you can hear nearly everything going on around, even when your neighbour showers or flush the toilette. Service is standard, not extraordinary, rather cool. Location is far from activities, going out for food is quite a walk away. If you take T, you need to change a few times. I would recommend this hotel only if you need to go to WTC daily, otherwise don't.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was priced reasonably for it's view and location. It is new and very clean. Not crazy about the decor, but there is a Starbucks in the lobby and good restaurant. Try the Jonnycakes for breakfast!!! We used valet parking and walked everywhere or took the T. We were able to walk to the Aquarium, restaurants, and Faneuil Market was not that much further (if you are not in a hurry). They have free internet on a couple of computers in the lobby area. We stayed there twice in less than a month. There is a nice bar if you want a cocktail before turning in for the night. Drinks are a bit pricey though.</p></li>

I walked to Fanuiel Hall and Chinatown with no problem. Get a wonderful dinner at Legal Seafoods or mix with an eclectic crowd at Tamezcal. The views on the third floor at Legal Seafood is wonderful. The best Lobster Roll is at the end of the foot bridge at James Hooks Seafood great price $15 for a large roll. Cheap beers at Hennesy's next door to the Union Oyster House. Take the SL1 bus to the airport for $2.00, the stop is directly across the street from the Hotels's Congress Street entrance.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a great location. It is close to the airport and some new restaurants on the water. The hotel itself is modern and clean and service is great. The lobby bar had lots of seating and good drinks, but bar entertainment was HORRIBLE, I would have been happier listening to elevator music than to a band still using their guitar training wheels. Parking was also a project, it's either valet or a garage a few blocks away. It would be nice if there was an elevator from the garage that went right to the hotel. The hotel is also freezing in many areas- the bar, lobby, meeting rooms- bring an extra sweater. I would stay here again.</p></li>

Hotel is close to Logan and adjacent to Silver Line stop which made transportation really easy. Room was clean, good daily service, Aveda products. Pool is small but was never crowded...I was there by myself every time. There is a small hot tub too. Lobby bar was busy in the evenings and bartenders were friendly. Food service stopped really early for a bar though.... We booked thru Priceline and got an excellent rate...if that were to happen again I would stay here. Otherwise, I would prefer to be closer to the action.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not right in downtown but only about a 10 min walk across from the downtown area. Very clean, new, upscale look and feel but can be very affordable. The rooms were spacios. We were in a room for 3 people and they offered 2 doubles versus 2 queens so a bit tight for those sharing a bed but I heard from others that the King size rooms are amazing! Great washroom, using Aveeda bath products, each room has a fridge and safe and there is a Starbucks in the lobby! They only offer valet parking which is $42 US a night but around the corner from the hotel is a parking lot for $30 per day (but you can't drive your car in and out throughout the day).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here on my first trip to Boston. I honestly was expecting something better. The price was pretty good for Boston on a weekend so overall I was not to dissapointed with my decision. The hotel was a standard Renaissance hotel nothing to special. We went primarily for sightseeing and either took a short inexpensive cab ride ($10) to the downtown area, or walked which took about 20 minutes. Bed was comfortable, staff was average. I would probably not go out of my way to stay here again as I think Boston has some better offerings, but if the price was right I might. Overall Boston is a great city to visit with lots of sights. Weather is perfect in early fall/late summer.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The lobby was very nice and spacious. Hotel staff were very good about giving directions, and one of them even gave me an umbrella to use while it rained. There was plenty of comfortable furniture on which to rest. The lobby restaurant had a great breakfast buffet ($20 for an array of tasty food). The rooms were well-equipped with many items a traveler may need, including iron, ironing board, hair dryer, etc. The beds were very comfortable. The bathrooms were squeaky clean and always stocked with towels, soap, and shampoo. We even had a third bed brought to us in the room for free because a colleague's flight was cancelled, and he need somewhere to sleep. Overall, a fantastic hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall, this is a fine hotel...I would be happy to go back if business required this. Hwever, I was disapointed with the business center because it was not adequately equipped or maintained. The business center only has 2 computors, and one working printer. The other printer was out of toner. I did not travel with my laptop this visit, and I had to get up early, 6 AM to make sure I had access to the computor. The other minor point is that the inroom coffee service, only came with enough coffee packets for one person to have coffee. On the other hand, there was an inroom refrigerator. Rooms spotless and up to date, but not soundproof. These are relatively minor compliants and i would go on business again</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here in Sept at the end of a 4 month trip touring over the US and indeed enjoyed my stay. The rooms were very clean and comfortable, all well laid out and indeed very well stocked with loads of pillows and cushions on the bed, mostly I chucked them on the floor to make space for a sleep. Very convenient setup and indeed the staff could not have been more helpful. The staff in the bar were also very good and efficient, however I did not sample the restaurant as i was out most of the time. Only down side is that it is a bit of a walk to the main downtown areas and indeed if you are there for leisure that can be a drawback, but at night with a clear sky the view over parts of the city are indeed worth the wee walk.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a newer, very beautiful hotel. The rooms very nicely decorated and a very modern feel to them. My room was ready for me for early check-in and I was able to get a room on the top floor that gave me great views from my room. The hotel can't change it's location but it is not too convenient to go to bars or much of the Boston nightlife. I was attending a conference at the convention center and I love Marriott properties so it was located well for me. However, the bar could have been opened later. With the hotel being sold-out I would imagine they would keep the hotel bar open later then 12:30am. We ended up walking to the Westin down the street which had their bar open until 2am. Other than that it was an excellent hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">To start off, we would not stay here if we were paying regular price. Like most upscale brands, many things are not included in your stay. The hotel was definitely NEW, very clean and chic. The staff were... snobby to say the least, but it is Boston, so that is to be expected. Parking is a pain, since the hotel does not have its own parking lot, one has to park next door, 30 dollars a day. If you want the valet, it is 41 dollars a day. A little high, wouldn't you say?! The concierge was useless, you could probably get more information from the internet online. The hotel is what it is, nothing too special about it that really stands out. The location was decent, you could walk to dt in 15 mins or so, and bus connection is literally outside the door.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location is good if you're going to the convention center or airport, but not for other activities. I travel a *lot* for business and pleasure and this was one of the worst hotels in this price range I have found. It should not be at the star level that it has been granted. The decor and rooms were old - the couch in my room was an allergen pit - I couldn't go near it. The carpet also could use a better vacuuming and/or shampooing. The concierge service was terrible - first we waited in line for 20 minutes behind a single other couple trying to book a trolley tour (not too hard in Boston) - then we were finally served and only needed a rental car - which she could not accomplish. I ended up booking it on my Blackberry as my colleague continued trying to work with her. Awful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed here with my new husband in April. We stayed for 2 nights, 1 prepaid for on hotels.com and one prepaid on expedia.com. I left a cc for incidentals. A month later I was charged for one of those nights even though it was prepaid. I called customer service and had to fight for a credit. Well, it happened again now in June for the other prepaid night. I was charged again and dealt with 2 very rude customer service agents. The most recent kept me on hold for over 20 minutes before I hung up. This was their ever and they didn't deal with it professional. As a travel agent, I would never recommend a Marriott hotel again after dealing with this. If you book online and pre-pay, make sure to check your statements because chances are you will get charged again by the hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here over Labor Day weekend. It 's just minutes from the airport and a short cab ride away from most attractions. The hotel was clean and efficient; what you would expect from the Marriott brand. The rooms had ample space and a bathroom with large, walk-in shower. The concierge here was incredibly friendly and helpful. He was able to get dinner reservations for us at the last minute at a great Italian restaurant. He also helped us navigate the city. The hotel is a block away from the waterfront and several nice restaurants, including Del Frisco's and Morton's. The local sightseeing tour also makes pick ups here in the mornings, which is ideal for sightseeing. Overall, the stay was convenient and met our expectations. I would stay here again on a trip to Boston.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The usual Boston Seaport hotel was booked out, so trying this hotel was a pleasant experience. Overall my stay at this hotel was very nice. It is clean, comfortable and reasonably quiet. The check-in process after a long transatlantic was incredibly slow, but i think the person in front of me was asking 1000 questions, so no real reflection. I had a room at the very end of the hall on the 14th floor and the only noise I ever heard was the occasional door closing in another room, emergency services vehicles at night, but this is all normal. The restaurant was OK. The food was exceptional, I had the scallops the first night. What lest this place down is the service. Its more about getting you in and out, but to get you in when no one is there, and then set up a separate table did not make sense. Id stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is OK. The rooms are nothing special and having to pay for internet in the rooms is annoying. We used the Starbucks free wifi in the lobby! We had a water view but had to look over buildings,etc to see it. As mentioned in another review, the walls are very thin so we heard a baby on one side and a couple who seemed to argue a lot on the other side. The Starbucks in the lobby is great. The room service food was decent. The staff seemed very nice and eager to please. The area is not great for sightseeing. If you are there for a convention, it is probably an OK hotel but if you want to see anything in Boston, it's not a good location. It IS a very short distance from the airport which is nice, but we ended up taking cabs everywhere else we wanted to go. It's not the location for enjoying the sights of Boston.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is very new. The lobby is stylish and inviting. The front desk staff was pleasant and helpful. The room was a nice size with new linens, decor and furniture. The room and bathroom were spotless. The hotel location is a good 20 minute walk to downtown which was nice in the summer but might not be ideal in winter. There is not too much to do in the immediate area around the hotel which is near the harbor. If in the area I would recommend eating at the Legal Seafood Test Kitchen which is next door to the hotel. Only a few minor points against... The internet acess was expensive and the room service menu was lacking. On one night a concert was at the nearby amphitheater and I was suprised how loud the music could be heard in the room. Overall I had a nice stay at the hotel and would stay here for business again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For the most part, the hotel is great. It is certainly an above average 4 star hotel. It is new, clean, and very comfortable. The rooms have extremely large flat screen TV's, and the bathrooms are very nice. If you don't like lots of bright colors, especially orange and blue, than the decor may be somewhat disappointing. The hotel is pretty close to the scenic (although somewhat fishy smelling) waterfront, with views of Logan Airport (not very loud though). This proximity brings with it an advantage - if you wish to skip over the outrageously priced, although chic hotel restaurant, Legal Seafood (which started in Boston) has it's "test restaurant" right next door. As far as proximity to downtown Boston, it is an easy .5 mile or so walk. The hotel is near a conference center, and the neighborhood is moderatly desireable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 3 nights Feb 2011 on a mini-vacation to boston to watch some NHL hockey. The hotel is wonderful-- very clean, staff helpful and friendly, quiet rooms. Not sure if we would have paid full price, we got a deal through "friends & family program" with marriott for $99 a nite. parking was steep at $42 a day, but that's boston. the bus stop was practically across the street from the hotel which easily transferred to the subway system. The hotel is a little far to walk to places, especially in the winter, but the subway is easy to take. We did not eat in the restaurant, but wished we would have had breakfast there as other places were a bit far to go for breakfast. All in all, a wonderful stay, we would definately stay again if we got a deal on the price. One thing though-- the swimming pool is only a lap pool @ 3.5 feet deep, not great for recreational swimming.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Although some may find it not so close to many downtown favorites like the Harbor, North End and the Aquarium as the Marriott Long Wharf, this Renaissance is a true gem with helpful staff and plenty of amenities like free WiFi in all rooms, luxury toiletries, a 24/7 gym and a good restaurant for both buffet and dinner. Other good dining facilities like Legal Test Kitchen and Barking Crab are very close to the hotel. We stayed there for three nights with our older son who would to start his studies in Boston the following week. Good connections from the Silverline Courthouse MBA station with other parts of the city which are not within walking distance. We all liked this hotel and were happy to unwind and relax in our room after a busy day of walking and sightseeing the town our son will call home for the next two years.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Waterfront Hotel is in an area hardly existed a couple of years go. The hotel is perfectly maintained; it is one short block from a new waterfront area with a number of very popular restaurants; it is near the new Convention Center. It is a 5-minute drive from the Airport through the new Ted Williams Tunnel. There is a bus that goes from Logan Airport about every 8 minutes, and that same route runs in a special bus tunnel to South Station where you can transfer to the rest of the Boston Transit system. The rooms were beautiful; the staff was friendly and helpful. The conference held there had no glitches at all that we could see. The location, as I have described is not exactly in downtown Boston, but it is a pleasant "electric bus", taxi, or drive from the very center of Boston, and in exchange you get a brand new hotel on a brand new street, near an amazing number of brand new restaurants.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you need a great hotel with a great location in Boston the Renaissance Boston Waterfront is the one. It's located 3 miles from the airport on the new Legacy Wharf and has beautiful spectacular views of the harbor. The hotel has the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in and I love the "Heavenly Bed from Westin" but these are more comfortable. LTK and Legal seafood are right next door and in walking distance, The banquet food is unbelievable, if you have a meeting there you MUST order the lobster MAC & Cheese. My group loved it so much I ordered it again for lunch on the last day and everyone was pleasantly surprised! This hotel has a really cool and funky decor, very hip and a great bar and Sal is the sweetest Bartender you will ever meet. Peggy at the Concierge Desk is so friendly, extremely helpful and knows all the best restaurants, lobster spots and places to visit. I can't wait to return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We picked this hotel from the information on the Boston's ferry service website. As we planned to take the ferry to Provincetown on Monday. We arrived on late on Saturday, the front desk clerk told us we had a city view, was fine with us. If we looked the other direction could see the water also. We asked about restuarants in the area. Said the hotel restuarant was very good. We did not at that time take her advice. We should have. Walked to the waterfront a couple of blocks. My friend wanted to eat facing the water. Ate at Legal Harborside ,I could not get a decent meal have many food allergies. She had a meal. Then we came back to the hotel after walking around the area. We than went into the hotel's restuarant where the Chef prepared me a Gluten Free meal. The meal was so good that we continued to eat here the rest of the weekend. Also when we returned a week later ate here before going to the airport.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location of this hotel might be a little out of the way, but it's a short, direct ride from Logan airport on the Silver Line buses. And if you want to go downtown, you can catch the Silver Line again to South Station and change trains there. The services will run till around midnight. Since this hotel is quite newly opened, everything is very clean and in good condition. Rooms are spacious and have a wave/waterfront theme. I was given a room facing downtown and the World Trade Centre on the waterfront. Nice views. Room cleaning service could do better though, as used towels and amenities were not replaced with a complete set and the bathroom mat was missing the next day after room was made. But overall room was still very clean. Liked this hotel very much but very pricey! Although to be fair, hotels of this caliber in Boston would all cost around the same prices albeit at more convenient locations too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here 20-22 AUG. Came up from FL to visit a friend deploying to Afghanistan. Wonderful time. Place is first class. Staff is very helpful. Take the bus from Airport ($2.00). Drops you off almost next to the hotel. Going back take a cab, it is just easier. Morton's Steakhouse is around the corner. A couple of great bars overlooking harbor also close (Irish place especially good). Checking in FRI, walked the Freedom Trail on SAT and caught a Red Sox game same night (MUST DO IT A "BEST PRO SPORTS EVENT"). Very good seafood place around the corner which serves until 1130 on weekends. There is not a downside to this hotel. I will stay here again. Fyi the Gym is also first rate. FYSA got to meet a lot of fun guests who were there for a wedding late on SAT night after the game. Cannot stress how gracious folks in Boston are, especially to military people. I have been assimilated into the RED SOX NATION. Army Officer</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location of the hotel was perfect for our needs. We were only in town for the weekend, so we were out and about in lots of parts of town. We took cabs mostly (which are pretty expensive in Boston) and it was nice that they all knew where the hotel was, and we never had to wait more than a few minutes for a cab. The lobby was a little bit on the smaller size, but it was nice and the staff was appropriately helpful and nice. The room itself was exactly what I expected. We had requested 2 beds and received them, the decor was typical hotel style so it looked clean and comfortable and functional. We had drinks at the hotel bar which was good, except that they closed at 12:30, but were kind enough to let us sit there for a while and finish our drinks and talk. My only complaint is the cost of internet; and it's often a complaint of mine at hotels. I don't understand how is could be justified to pay over $12 a day for internet.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel served well while we were there for a conference at the convention center that was 4 blocks away. The walk to most tourist attractions is 20 minutes. The neighborhood is very safe and you mostly see business people walking around that area. The â€œmetroâ€� system is one block over that takes you anywhere you want to go. That was nice having that so close. The staff was very friendly and did a fantastic job assisting us with directions to different areas of town and local things to do. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom. Comfortable king sized bed was nice, pillows could have been better. The fitness area had numerous treadmills, bikes and cross trainers. The lap pool was enough room for 2 people to swim side by side. The only trouble we had was we ran out of soap and shampoo and when we called down to get soap and shampoo brought up to us, it took almost 45 minutes. Besides that, everything was very good.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved this hotel!! We went to Boston (from NYC) for a weekend girls' trip to celebrate a birthday. We arrived very early on a Saturday (around 10:00am) so we could enjoy both weekend days to their fullest and expected to check our luggage with the concierge before checking in later that day. However, they had a room ready so we were allowed to check-in early!! And, while checking in, the front desk asked us what brought us to Boston (small talk I thought) and we said it was to celebrate a birthday. Not only were they so nice about it, but when we got back much later that night, we unknowingly had a bottle of champagne and 6 chocolate-covered strawberries waiting for us in the room with congratulations note for the birthday girl!! Truly amazing and thoughtful and very unexpected! Also, the location is perfect (along the waterfront) and very easy to get to and from downtown Boston and the airport via the Metro system! Loved it and would highly recommend to anyone!</p></li>

<li>We went to Boston (from NYC) for a weekend girls' trip to celebrate a birthday.</br>
<span style="background-color:#f032e6">OTHER</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>We arrived very early on a Saturday (around 10:00am) so we could enjoy both weekend days to their fullest and expected to check our luggage with the concierge before checking in later that day.</br>
<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>However, they had a room ready so we were allowed to check-in early!!</br>
<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>And, while checking in, the front desk asked us what brought us to Boston (small talk I thought) and we said it was to celebrate a birthday.</br>
<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 0.999&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Not only were they so nice about it, but when we got back much later that night, we unknowingly had a bottle of champagne and 6 chocolate-covered strawberries waiting for us in the room with congratulations note for the birthday girl!!</br>

<span style="background-color:#fabebe">SERVICE</span>: 0.995&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Also, the location is perfect (along the waterfront) and very easy to get to and from downtown Boston and the airport via the Metro system!</br>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Excellent hotel for a conference”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently returned from a conference held at the hotel. The hotel is brand new with nice rooms, comfortable beds and an awesome fitness center (including a lap pool, which I used twice). The conference facilities (rooms, wifi paid for by our conference and food) were quite good, contributing to a strong overall conference. I ate at the restaurant three times (2 breakfasts, 1 lunch) and had drinks at the bar a few times. In all instances, I had attentive and thoughtful servers who went the extra mile, which is not something I usually experience at Marriott properties. I stayed an extra two days to sightsee in Boston. With the conference rate, this was an excellent deal and better than any I could find for the weekend otherwise. The location is close to the water and a breeze on the Silver Line from the airport, although a bit of a walk to public transportation. We ended up cabbing it to MFA Boston but walked to the North End and back. All and all, I'd stay here again and recommend it to others as a conference location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I picked this hotel for the view of the Boston harbor for New Years Eve fireworks. It is in a district next to downtown called the Seaport district that has several nice restaurants in the area such as Legal Harborside. The hotel itself is new, has nice decor with service/amenities that you'd expect from this large chain. The location is close to downtown but a not necessarily a short walk from the downtown sites. From the Public Garden, we had to take the Red line to Silver line to get there or hire a cab for a ride. A plus to the non-downtown location is that parking near the hotel is a ton cheaper per day than any lot right downtown. We did have issues with noise. There was a party going on next door and I had to go down to the lobby twice (11pm and 2am) to get resolved. The walls seem a bit thin to deal with even the alarm radio playing next door much less a party, Yes it was New Years Eve and there's no way the hotel could stop all of the noise because I'm sure many others had the same idea as us to stay overlooking the water.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was booked for a conference at Harvard University. From the moment I booked, everything went smoothly. I secured a good rate by booking well in advance of my stay, and had a nice smart room on the 10th floor, with working desk space, and a couch, but my bathroom only had a shower, no bath. Internet best value if you pay for the length of your stay in your room. The staff were very friendly, and helpful. Restaurant was great for breakfast but rather limited for other meals, although good quality. Bit on the pricey side for casual dining. Close to many other eateries but no fast food thank goodness. Also close to the "T" so take the Silver Line across the road from the hotel to South Station (via tram) and then hop on the train, if you want to go to Harvard Square, or Boylston area (for the Apple Store). Only one ticket needed using the Charlie ticket system which is more economical, otherwise exact change required as you board. Great views over the water and super close to the airport. An excellent find and strongly recommend hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Renaissance Waterfront hotel is a new, modern incarnation of Marriott's Renaissance brand. I've stayed in other Renaissance hotels which are nice but may seem dated (think Marriott rooms and amenities but different color scheme). The one at LAX in Los Angeles comes to mind. But not this one. The Boston Waterfront location is modern and has a light, airy, fresh New England feel to the rooms with the white walls and blue carpet. Lobby is very modern and cool with a bar and restaurant as well as a Starbucks attached. My Platinum status was recognized on check in (I don't care that much, I'm humble) and that got me a room with a city and water view. Room actually had a mildew odor to it so I asked for a different room and got one- no problem, no questions asked. Also with the same view. Club Lounge on the 20th floor was nice for a complementary breakfast or after-work cocktail from the honor bar (mix yourself!) Warm cookies and canapes and a Nespresso machine to boot. At $178, this was a real deal compared to some of the hotels across the harbor going for twice that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for Valentine's day and were very impressed. Booked on priceline (name your own price) for $100, very good deal. The valet is $41 but the garage is right there so your better off parking and just pay $27 for the night. We arrived around 2pm and had no problem getting an early check-in. The staff was very accomodating. We had requested a king bed and harbor view, but they were not able to accomodate our entire request. The front desk explained it was busy due to the holiday but that they could still offer us a king bedroom without a view or we could have a double room with a view. We went with the double room and view and were not disappointed. When we arrived in the room we were so impressed with the beautiful decor and cleanliness. The 37 inch flat screen tv was great. The view was of part of south Boston and also of the harbor. It was a beautiful day and we could see all the sailboats. The double beds were not a problem, extremely comfortable. We grabbed a late-night bite at the hotel restaurant bar and the service and food was excellent! Over-all very impressed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed at the Renaissance Boston Waterfront hotel for a business conference at the convention center and had a great experience. While I've been to Boston many times I have never stayed at the waterfront and wasn't thrilled about the location compared to Back Bay and Copley, but my experience at the Renaissance made the location worth while. The hotel looks very new and modern, extremely clean lobby, restaurant and bar area. Check-in was quick and the staff took my Marriott rewards card immediately and were very helpful about places to go in the surrounding area. The room was spotless and a good size, the bed and pillows very comfortable...housekeeping was prompt and thorough. While the waterfront is a little further than I would normally stay the area seems very up and coming with beautiful restaurants, bars and markets right there - and a block away from the Renaissance. The hotel is not far from the silver line on the T, buses are close, South Station is about a 15 minute walk and Logan is right across the water. Consider the Renaissance Boston Waterfront hotel for your next visit -- you will not be disappointed!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I drove into Boston on a weekend without hotel reservations, and were very surprised that we found immediate availability at this Renaissance. This was our first visit to Boston, and the area certainly looked pretty and clean considering it was right downtown and on the waterfront. We later found out that it was a bit off the "beaten track" but we enjoyed the area and the walk to the shore with it's local businesses. The rooms were quite nice--bright and airy with a great view of the harbor; and the beds were fantastic! The rooms were expensive, but in this case we felt the immediate availability justified the price. As noted by other reviewers, hotel parking and available commercial lots also very high-priced, as was the cost for wireless. After viewing the breakfast choices and prices, we chose to eat all of our meals elsewhere. The front desk staff seemed a bit full of themselves, but we had no problem with service other than a misguided harbor tour on the Spirit of Boston booked by a slightly snooty and misinformed concierge. All in all, we enjoyed our stay, but may stay elsewhere the next time we return to the area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at the hotel late in the afternoon on a Saturday and straight away you could tell that these guys knew how to make their guests feel welcome. The valet service and bell stand were very efficient and professional and the check in staff were exactly the same. We were upgraded to an executive room without any prompting from us which was very nice. We had dinner in the restaurant that evening and both the food and service were first class. Breakfast was the same and the choice was very good. The location of the hotel is about half a mile from the downtown area but there is a bus stop over the road which links to the rest of the transportation system which we thought was very efficient. We spent the day wandering around Boston and did the historic walk which shows you most of the key sites in the guide books. We used room service that evening and again the food and service was excellent. The room itself was very modern with a large HD LCD TV and the bed was very comfortable. Overall we enjoyed our stay alot and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The hotel was very comfortable and the staff were fantastic which I guess makes it a winning combination.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got a great low rate on this hotel via an Internet site. The hotel is only two years old and still looks and feels very new. It is located in the completely renovated Seaport/Waterfront district of South Boston. It is only a few blocks from the new convention center, the federal courthouse, the Institute of Contemporary Art, and the design center. The silver line of the T is across the street. Unfortunately, the neighborhood is T or cab ride away from almost everything else in Boston. Look on a map before you decide to stay in South Boston. In a few years, it will probably be very trendy with more restaurants, bars, and apartments. As for the hotel itself, it has a real Starbucks in the lobby, a terrific concierge named Peggy, and an extremely friendly front desk staff. The beautiful shallow pool, whirlpool, and fitness center is in a secluded section of the fifth floor. Hallways and rooms have a modern, nautical design. rooms are extremely comfortable, airy, and clean. Our view was of the financial district as well as the water. Ask for a high floor with a view and you will not be disappointed. We self-parked in an underground garage in a new apartment building adjacent to the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my second stay at the Renaissance Waterfront. I had a regular King room that faced Congress Street. The staff was friendly and helpful. I was managing a small group of guests and the front desk staff was great at making the last-minute changes to the reservations. A Nor'easter had hit and delayed several flights, which meant I was down at the front desk late at night and early in the morning making sure that my team's rooms weren't canceled because of a 'no show'. I had a regular room and it was a decent size. Housekeeping was good at keeping it tidy during my 6 days. The 606 Restaurant is still pricey but the food and service were excellent. The business center was decent and had a functioning copier and fax machine. It's pay-per-service deal and on the expensive side. However, if you have small copy and fax jobs, the front desk may do it for you for free. The concierge lounge was closed Friday evenings, Saturday and Sunday. This is disappointing but pretty much standard in all Marriott properties. My biggest complaint is that they still charge for internet service. $12.95/day plus tax. All the upper-tier Marriotts do and, as a business traveler, it is one of the most frustrating charges.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was at this hotel from Sept. 2-5 with my 4 year old daughter. We arrived early and were able to check in around 1030am even though check in is stated as 4pm. This was a huge plus and started our day off well. We booked via priceline and got a decent rate. The Silver Line for public transit has a stop that is a short walk from the hotel. Very convenient and we rode the T our entire stay. Our room had 2 double comfortable double beds. We did not try the restaurant but it had a nice crowd. The hotel Navigator (concierge) gave us a map for the T and also had several written instructions for the popular tourist destinations. Hotel staff was helpful and nice. There are a few restaurants in walking distance of this hotel. It was very quiet until Saturday when more people arrived but there were still no issues. Housekeeping made our beds daily and I have no complaints in that area. The business center service to print your boarding pass was a nice touch. If you want, a nice clean hotel convenient to public transportation in a non busy area..this is a great hotel. If you want to be in the heart of the action right as you step out the front door of your hotel..this is not the hotel for you. It met our needs though.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here with my wife for a few days while visiting friends in the Boston area. We arrived via airplane and took the Silver Line from the airport to the hotel since we wouldn't be needing a car for the first two days we were there. The World Trade Center stop on the Silver Line is just one block from the hotel, so that was very convenient. (I believe the Silver Line Way stop is also one block away, in the other direction). Check in at the front desk was a breeze! They gave us a corner room, which was a little more spacious than the standard rooms. The room was very nice. It had a king bed, sofa, desk and tv. We didn't need to access the internet while we were there, but I believe it was around $13 per day. We did get rent a car the second day we were there (since we were visiting friends outside the realm of the MBTA transportation network). The only downside to that was the parking at the hotel was $42 per night (although the valet was very convenient). We did a trolley tour while we were there. The trolley stopped less than 100 yards from the hotel. The only reason I couldn't rate this hotel with 5 stars was that while we were there the hotel pool was temporarily closed for some reason so we weren't able to use it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Full disclosure: First Reniassance I have gone to in the US, after a couple very pleasant and rather luxurious experiences in China. I'm not sure how their branding is positioned here or what should I expect from them. This is a very nice, comfortable and clean hotel. Views of Boston are fantastic from the upper floors. Our room was spacious. Excellent location if you need to go to the Convention Center, and not terribly out of the way if you want to tour Boston. It's a matter of context, if you come from a big city, given the compact nature of Boston's downtown and historic neighborhoods everything will seem relatively handy. I had this incident one night, however. My wife and I had leftovers from lunch at a nearby restaurant and we hate to throw food away, and I had just bought some excellent fruit at Haymarket to round a little dinner in the room up. I called to have a couple forks brought to the room, and much to my surprise I was asked if I had ordered room service. I candidly explained what was going on with my "dinner arrangements", to which I was told that it would be a $4 fee. Are you kidding me? Had we needed knives it would have been $8? Totally unnecessary disappointment. I'm still scratching my head on this one.</p></li>

Go to the RIGHT END of walk at arrivals (each terminal) & wait for long double bus, the Silver Line. It's only 2 bucks and the 2nd stop is right at the Renaissance (Silver Line Way stop).

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Husband and I stayed at the Renasissance from Nov 11-14, 2010. We flew in from Buffalo. The hotel is in the Seaport District, which seems to be a new and upcoming area. We took the subway everywhere we wanted to go. Hotels are expensive in Boston, but we did get a discounted rate at this hotel. My only complaint is that this hotel is out of the way from downtown. You can get to it by taking the red line subway to (south station) then take the silverline and get off at the World Trade Centre stop and walk for about 5 min. The rooms in this hotel don't match your inital impression based on the front lobby. The front lobby is beautiful, all wood, with really contemporary decor. Then once you head up to the rooms, the hallways are orange and blue, and the rooms look like something out of a cottage brochure, with painted white wood walls....very odd. Our room had one king bed (amazingly soft with lots of pillows), a desk, a full couch, a fridge and a safe. The view overlooked the City and the Harbor, very nice. The bathroom was incredibly clean and impressive. Overall I would recommend this hotel only to travellers who have to visit the seaport or are in no hurry to get around the City. We basically only used this hotel to shower and sleep.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Average isn't bad - it's average so don't take my average rating as a slam. At check in, the front desk folks were neither rude nor friendly. They just did their job. I cracked a joke about it being so windy and even if it was a lame joke, a smile couldn't have hurt. The cleaning staff was always pleasant in the hall and said good day or something nice. The room was clean and perfectly functional. The AC/heat had a fan function with two speeds and the higher level produced enough white noise for good sleeping. Shower had plenty of pressure. The location is fine from a 'close to the airport' perspective, but it's not really close ot much so if you're coming to Boston to see the city, this isn't an ideal spot. I will say Yes to if I would recommend it to a friend, but only on the condition tha they have a reason to stay in this area of the city and the price is similar to the others in the area. Otherwise, I'd tell them to book a hotel downtown or in Cambridge. The fitness center was average for a hotel like this - a few each of cardo machines and some machines. Not a good selection of free weights. Wireless internet was pokey. Direct TV was sketchy - maybe it was the weather. Not important, but if watching TV was important to you, it would be frustrating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I thought this place was just great. Smoothest/fastest check-in ever, the rooms were beautiful and the beds very comfortable. Quiet, clean....great breakfast buffet. Julie at the front desk was extremely kind and helpful. The only drawback I can see is the location; its a bit of a hike to get downtown and we ended up taking cabs everywhere. The one thing they could improve upon is the concierge; they just did not seem all that knowledgeable or up-to-date with the events going on around the city. If I was a concierge, I think I would make it my business to know what is happening locally and be able to give recommendations based upon the type of group you have. For example, we heard that there was going to be a free Earth Day outdoor concert downtown and wanted to know where it was located. The concierge had no idea that there was one, and after looking on the internet, told us that Earth Day wasn't until May....after some back and forth she realized she was looking at last years schedule. There were a few similar incidents and generally speaking she just was not helpful or even that friendly. Also the pool is very narrow, which disappointed the kids. Other than that, I have nothing but compliments to the staff and I will definitely stay there the next time I go to Boston.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family (wife and 2 kids) stayed for 3 nights at this hotel. Upon check-in we were offered a junior suite instead of the 2 double bed room we had booked for. The room was a business room with a sofa that converted into a bed. They brought in 2 additional cots. The room was huge! The sofabed was not overly comfy but was adequate. We stayed because we loved the rest of the room. The hotel is located in the business waterfront area which had convenient access to the bus line / subway. We discovered later in our stay that there are many nice restaurants a short walk away. As we are tourists and wanted to see all the sights, most of the attractions involved taking a subway from this area. The pool is long and narrow so you can swim laps when it's not busy. There is a whirlpool as well beside it. Towels and a poolside shower are provided. The staff, from valet and bellman to conciierge and front desk, are all very pleasant. The concierge was especially helpful with directions as this was our first trip to Boston. Parking is a bit expensive ($40 self park and $50 valet) but there is a lot across the street where you can pay for parking for less but is less secure. Overall, this was a great place to stay. We loved the hotel and city and I would definitely consider a return visit to both.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Average hotel with 5star prices where every little thing costs extra!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here in Jan for several days the room was very average -- nothing special. A view staring into the windows of a condo complex across the street. Shades had to be drawn the entire time. No bath, just shower. Nice and large LCD tv. Water bottles were $4 each - usually you get 2 complimentary at other hotels. The business center -- 2 computers working (3 in all); very cramped and next to a noisy conference room, difficult to get any work done. Many people tried to walk in but all computers were taken. Wifi is available in the room BUT for an additional 16-20$ per day depending on if you want fast or slow WiFi. Found myself wondering if this should really cost extra with such a sub par business center. The breakfast - not cheap --- $22 per person for buffet, though it was very tasty. There is a continental version for $16 as an alternative or a Starbucks which is the cheapest option. Due to the location, not many breakfast alternatives. Fitness center: pretty good -- free weights and several machines as well as a lot of aerobic equipment. Good for a hotel. Service and staff was excellent. Very friendly. Overall I thought this hotel was a B/B-; I didn't like all the extra fees which don't exist in many other chains, made me feel like a piÃ±ata, not a guest. Location could be better as well.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice for business, not great for families”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here during a convention. IIts about 2 blocks from the hall and about a 10 minute walk. If I came with my family for pleasure, this is not really the place to be. Stay closer to Boston Common or Faneuil Hall. The hotel itself is nice and well kept. I had a handicap room so it was larger with a couch, etc. The gym is great, although they advertise a lap pool which was always full of kids playing. The pool is about 1 meter wide so not too flexible unless you can swim laps early in the AM. Food options are pretty limited in the area unless you jump in a cab or take the subway which is close by. There are a few options closer to the water, but not much. The lobby is small although you can certainly lounge in the cocktail bar area or the restaurant. My only real complaint was that the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night and was not handled very well be the staff. The elevators still worked, but no one on staff really knew how to handle or direct the guests. This wasnt very pleasant at 1 in the morning. All in all, I would go back for business in the area, but not pleasure. If you are there for a convention, the Westin is nice and is connected to the convention center so it is definately the closest hotel option with very similar ammenities. Just depends where your loyalties are for points/rewards, etc.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My friend and I took a weekend trip to Boston and stayed at this hotel for one night. We drove from New York overnight and arrived in Boston about 7:45 am. Upon arrival I went into the front desk to see if there would be anyway to check into our hotel room early. To our surprise they allowed us to check in eight hours early and gave us a room with was on a higher floor! The room and view was amazing. The room was clean and very nice with an extremely comfortable bed. We were able to shower and start our mini-vaca early which was awesome. I read many reviews after booking that stated the hotel was far away from most attractions. We took taxi's the first day but realized on our walk home that the hotel was only a 20 minute walk from Quincy market and the Warf. We had the calamari and some drinks at the bar and the food was great and so was the bar tender. He was really friendly and gave us some different tips and ideas of where to eat in the city. The parking was somewhat expensive, forty two dollars, but they allowed us to keep our car parked in the garage after check out until almost 6:30 pm for no additional charge. The only downfall, which really wasn't even a downfall, was that the pool was really small and only 3.5 feet deep. Overall we had an amazing experience and would definitely book and stay at this hotel again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “It is not waterfront!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First of all you have to remember that Renaissance Boston Waterfront is not waterfront. It is across the street from waterfront and therefore it offers a panoramic view of large buildings and parking lots on all four sides. This hotel is seriously mismanaged. You feel this immediately upon arrival. It has this small driveway. The driveway is always clogged with some dead parked vehicles. Consequently, in order to check in, I had to circle the block three times! They charge $42 for â€œvalet parkingâ€�, but it is a sheer nightmare if youâ€™ll try to use it. They promise to deliver your car within 15 â€“ 20 minutes but it seldom happens. For instance, I had to wait for over 30 minutes while there was zero demand for cars. Itâ€™s not that they were busy, not at all. I stayed there waiting for my car while nobody did anything. They just donâ€™t care. I asked to see a manager, but he was too busy to see me. This hotel does not own its own garage. Weâ€™ve made August reservations back in June. They demanded full prepayment (which we did). Yet, upon arrival they had no room with two Quinn beds available as agreed. Consequently, a mother with two little children was forced to spend a night on the couch. There are plenty of other hotels around with better rates, with its own garages and not as chaotic atmosphere. Avoid it if you can.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice Hotel but Watch Out for Breakfast”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel has a great location, and my room on the 21st floor had a great view of Boston harbor. My room was large and comfortable. However, this is another new hotel that, in spite of being well designed and built, fails when it comes to service. The hotel would have received five stars if the breakfast had not been so poor. I had a business breakfast the first morning so we ate in the main restaurant. I ordered what I believe is billed as Organic Maine Oats, along with a bagel. The oatmeal arrived as a thin gruel and the toasted bagel was slathered in butter or some such spread. I would have sent both back, but since I was with other people, I only asked that the bagel be replaced with one toasted but dry. The waitress complied with my request, but certainly not with a smile. The breakfast buffet may have been much better than the off-menu food, but I did not get to sample that. The second morning I had breakfast in the Concierge Lounge on the 20th floor. The food was good, but all the cereal bowls were hot, as they were just taken out of the dishwasher. The attendant apologized for the hot bowls, a plus for service, but I do wonder why the management thinks that they cannot afford an extra set of cereal bowls so that their loyal customers do not have to pour cold milk into steaming hot bowls. For dinner at least, you can walk to the nearby Legal Seafoods and get a good meal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Seaport is attempting to become the place to be in Boston, but not succeeding much. This is where this hotel is located. One of many in the immediate vicinity of the Boston Convention Center. The area is still plagued with empty lots and parking garages. You are a stone throw away from the water, but it is barely accessible.. The shipyard is there. Lots of new restaurants are close buy. Legal Harborside and a couple of others in the same building are the latest addition but not worth it! The excellent Sam's @ Louis Boston is less than a mile away. Forget about Anthony's Pier 4 and no name. Pretentious is VERY overpriced. So when it comes to location, if you have to be @ the Convention Center pick this place if not stick to downtown Boston or the Back Bay. The hotel itself is nice and modern. Nice staff, lobby is beautiful. The rooms are large and very clean with modern TV and nice linen. Aveda bath products are provided in cheap quantities. Not much of a view from the rooms. The WALLS are VERY THIN. I could hear all night the TV of the neighbor.. Torture!! The gym is decent with few machines and treadmills. There is a 2 lane lap pool (probably 12.5meters) and a nice Spa facility and Sauna. Parking is by valet. 30$!!! hard to park on your own and then it's a small walk. Overall, again if you are on a business trip or need to be close to the Convention, go there, if not there are a lot of better located places in Boston. The seaport district is not ready for prime time and probably would need another 10-15 years to become.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is great in that it has a great location-walking distance to restaurants and the stops for the sightseeing tours. The rooms were clean, the beds comfortable and the amenities were fine. My only complaint was the customer service. The doormen/bellmen who stand at the curb did not greet us once during our entire stay. No one offered to help us with our bags-from the bell men to the front desk. The front desk always had many desk clerks available but none seemed to excited to help us. Smiles were infrequent. On one day we asked to borrow an umbrella and the desk clerk told us there would be a $40 charge for the umbrella until we returned it. This wouldn't have been as irritating if the umbrella hadn't been a complete piece of garbage. She only offered us one umbrella even though there were too of us and then told us that we probably didn't need it because it was not currently raining. I am glad I didn't listen to her because there was a torrential downpour a few hours later and it drizzled the entire day. That being said-the umbrella still wasn't all that helpful. It was a piece of junk and kept turning inside out with the wind. We bought a second umbrella from the drug store. We stayed here for 3 days, 2 nights and with the exception of the concierge who was very friendly and knowledgeable-the staff at this hotel is not friendly or helpful. I would not stay here again for this reason. The hotel itself is fine though.Also-the brand of shampoo/lotion they use which is Aveda is horrible and smells like garbage and patchouli.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good hotel in a nice quiet location”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Checked in for 5 nights at this hotel and although not located in downtown Boston, was in a lovely up and coming waterfront location, with plenty of bars and restaurants within 5 minute walk. Check in was slightly rushed as the receptionist seemed more interested in sorting out the luggage of her previous client than looking after us. Had to ask about the Executive Lounge, even though a gold member and given no details of the hotel or services or even the location of the lift to our room!!. Oiginally allocated a room with connecting door, which as I'd requested a quiet room was slightly strange, but changed rooms the following day. Lower floor room but no noise from road or other rooms throughout the stay. Advised hotel in advance we were celebrating our wedding anniversary but no mention at check in, which was disappointing. Hotel is a 20 minute stroll from Long Wharf or the Silver Line can be taken into the centre just 5 minutes from the hotel. Good quality bars and restaurants very close by, but they do get busy so you may want to consider booking in advance. Hotel bar was very pleasant, although drinks more expensive than some bars, service was excellent and you expect to pay more than in a normal pub. Gym facilities are also excellent, with a good range of equipment in pleasant surroudings. Executive Lounge doesn't have the range of food available for breakfast that we've found in other locations and did run out of some items. It's not open over the weekend and no alternative free dining is offered. Pleasant stay and would certainly return,</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here over the 4th of July. We took advantage of a sale that was going on. It's a really nice hotel. Especially for what we ended up paying for it. The rooms were spacious and very clean. Except the brown hair all over my husband's pillow when we arrived. For a hotel with a 4 diamond rating to have someone elses clump of brown hair on their pillow for new guests is really the main reason why I did not rate them higher. Not quite what I was expecting. We did get the room on sale but Really??? The pool area was crowded and full of kids. Not a huge issue, we just didn't use it. The resturant in the hotel was very good but the breakfast buffett seemed a bit overpriced to me. My husband didn't eat because all he wanted was a hard boiled egg and some melon and he would have had to pay over 12 dollars for just those 2 things. The bar seemed reasonably priced and the bar staff was sooooo nice. We decided to avoid the masses for the firework show and the staff offered to let us watch the fireworks from a conference room. We didn't have to because the window in our room overlooked the city and we got a very good show from a distance. They have an interesting choice for carpet throughout the hotel. There is absolutely nothing "wrong" with it but for such a nice hotel it was weird seeing primary color almost child like rugs. Access to the T is very very close, this is also what appealed to us about this hotel. Doing the shuttle wasn't an issue at all. The waterfront area is nice. It's scale is kind of small and choices to eat are there but somewhat limitted. I would stay there again but probably only if it was on sale again. :o)</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked my trip through Priceline and at first i was a bit apprehensive because the parking was so horribly expensive. I went for a weekend and thought from the other reviews that the area was abandoned at night. It was not. Parking is ample at night but you must pay the meters $1.00 per hour at 8am, Although I like sleeping in, I got up and moved the car over 2 blocks to ample parking lots for $5.00 per day weekend if no events are going on. It was $5.00 although u must pay by credit card. It was great. The old town trolley stops near Anthony's pier which was easy walking distance to do the trolley ride. The Hotel is brand new and amazing. Very clean, nice tv's, excellent bar and restaurant and great staff. The trolley driver dropped us off in front of the hotel because Tropical Storm Hanna decided to pour down on us so for our benefit and some of the older passengers he made a special stop and avoided our need to walk 2 blks in the torrential rain. Hotel is near the waterfront, near the convention center and near the Fannueil Hall, (about a 15 min walk) You can easily take the silver line from the Airport to the Hotel and it is on the next block that the train is there. I would have preferred not to have a vehicle because parking where all the clubs and bars are is awful and hard to find. I think you can take the silver line to South Station and transfer to the rest of the T, which I would definitely do next time. Airport by car is on the other side of the New Tunnel and it is a 10 min drive. Very nice, quiet area. Starbucks is in the lobby for a morning coffee and danish. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay again, so close to everything.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I don't know if this is brand new hotel or not, but I think it may be since it's in a newly developed spot on the Boston Seaport, walking distance from a few new restaurants. My boyfriend and I came for 2 nights for a wedding weekend for one of his college friends. Although we arrived a couple of hours before official check-in, which is 3pm, the very nice and efficient desk attendant allowed us to go ahead and check into our room. They also had the wedding welcome bag ready to go. They even left a message for us on the first night to make sure we received the welcome bag for the wedding. The whole hotel is nicely decorated and modern, but not in an obnoxiuos trendy way. I didn't check to see if they had in room free wireless. Even if you're not in a room facing the water (we weren't), you still have decent view of the city, though we had to look around the building directly across the street. Still the view was plesant and vast. I also wish I bought my swimming suit because they have a serene and sleek-looking lap pool indoors on the 5th floor that was virtually unused when we checking it out in the middle of the afternoon. The room itself was spacious and had room enough for empty areas and a 3 seater sofa. The bathroom was a standard size, and the bath products were nice, too - Aveda. The bed was plush and comfortable. I would stay there again in a heartbeat if I went back to Boston. My only caution would be staying on the seaport in the cold months because then it may be too cold to walk around the seaport and go into the city. Mid-Septebmer, when we stayed, the weather was still fairly warm and spring-like, and at night I didn't need a jacket to walk around. A light sweater was good enough.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Typical Upscale Corporate Hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is typical of the newer large business hotels: Nice rooms with modern technology, and a small lobby with a single expensive restaurant, a bar, and the requisite Starbucks which is open during the daylight hours. I found the staff to be very friendly.The rooms are good sized, very clean, with comfy beds and bathroom amenities that will leave your hair smelling minty fresh, literally. Request a room on an an upper floor for an amazing view of Boston Harbor, with either the city skyline or Logan Airport as the backdrop. The hotel also has a small gym with new equipment, including free weights, and a narrow indoor lap pool. The gym is free, but there is a charge for WiFi. The self-service business center is also free to use. I arrived from the airport at 7:30am expecting to just drop off my bags before heading into town, and they checked right into a room. The hotel seems to be in a redevelopment area of Boston that ran out of steam when the economy turned sour. The area has a couple of hotels, a few sit down restaurants, the convention center, and a couple of office buildings, but not much else. Very few people live in the immediate vicinity, so the area is pretty dead at night and on weekends. It almost seems like a suburban "corporate office park" near the water. Nearly everyone visiting the area appears to be attending a conference of some sort. It's only about a 15 minute walk into downtown, but along most of the walk you'll be passing wide open parking lots surrounded by chain-link fences or fishing piers. On the plus side, the subway in Boston is very easy to use, and the Silver Line station is less than a short city block away. The hotel is also only a 5 minute ride from the airport. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I was travelling on business, but I think I would rather stay in Downtown Boston if I was travelling for leisure.</p></li>

<li>The area has a couple of hotels, a few sit down restaurants, the convention center, and a couple of office buildings, but not much else.</br>
<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 0.883&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp<span style="background-color:#e6194b">BUILDING</span>: 0.104&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Very few people live in the immediate vicinity, so the area is pretty dead at night and on weekends.</br>
<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 0.780&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp<span style="background-color:#f032e6">OTHER</span>: 0.150&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>It almost seems like a suburban "corporate office park" near the water.</br>
<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 0.997&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Nearly everyone visiting the area appears to be attending a conference of some sort.</br>
<span style="background-color:#f032e6">OTHER</span>: 0.995&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>It's only about a 15 minute walk into downtown, but along most of the walk you'll be passing wide open parking lots surrounded by chain-link fences or fishing piers.</br>
<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>On the plus side, the subway in Boston is very easy to use, and the Silver Line station is less than a short city block away.</br>
<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>The hotel is also only a 5 minute ride from the airport.</br>
<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I was travelling on business, but I think I would rather stay in Downtown Boston if I was travelling for leisure.</br>
