<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was fine at the discount price of $150 per night for the room with a nice view of the harbor. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The only real drawback was the slowness of service in the dining room. The free breakfast is above average. However, if you order the fritata, ASK THAT IT NOT BE OVERCOOKED TO DRYNESS. The next day, the eggs sunnyside up were done correctly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel was beautiful! Our room was perfect. The grounds were well maintained. Internet was quick. We ate breakfast and dinner there. The dining room was nice, the food was delicious though a little pricey. The service was kind of slow but isn't that the way things are on the island. We had no problems with anything. It was a fast and easy drive to Sea World from the hotel. We will certainly stay here again when we come back to San Diego.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and one of my friends got set up at the Kona Kai when our flight back to Detroit was cancelled. Trudi was working at the front desk and was so nice and accomodating. She gave us an awesome room with views of the water. The room was really cute and had a beach theme. We only got to stay for one night, but I would have loved to stay longer. If I'm ever back in San Diego I will definitely be booking a room there. Thanks again for being so awesome Trudi!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a very nice hotel. Nice staff, attractive rooms, very clean, beautiful location. Nice proximity to harbor, downtown, Balboa Park and zoo. All are within about 10 minutes by car. All the amenties in rooms (coffee maker, iron, hair dryer, mini fridge, great wifi). If people in adjacent rooms are loud talkers or door slammers, it could make it hard to sleep, but I find this to be the case in many hotels. Otherwise, I love this hotel, and will stay here again.</p></li>

The breakfasts in a lovely surrounding and the spa, while modest, is staffed by really great people. We love the location and its proximity to Umi's ...THE best Japanese restaurant.

The room was comfortable though the decor was a little dated (the bathroom needed a touch up too). The location is great if you have a car, but even if you don't the helpful staff will drive you to the nearest bus stop (public transport in San Diego is pretty good). The driver also picked us up and drop us off at the Amtrak Station. The pool and hot tub are a nice touch too!</p></li>

When a manager, like Dennis, goes out of his way to make us happy, it shows he appreciates us choosing his hotel. When I feel like a valued customer at any place, I will visit the establishment more than others.. Great view of the Harbor and the Bay. So peaceful at the end of the island, which made the trip so relaxing. Clean rooms, and comfy beds made the trip even better. We will be back soon!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for a wedding that was here. Was a nice hotel just felt dated for some reason. Breakfast was pricey and not bad but def not great. Shelter Island had some great views but was covered in a haze the 4 days I was there and a lil chilly. They call it the May grey and said it rolled in early this year. Overall a good experience but I think you pay for the location more then the actual hotel. I enjoyed my stay but prob would look elsewhere if I went back to San Diego. Paying for parking every night was a downer for sure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room carpet was not clean. When I walked , made the furniture that bad quality shaking and noise. The place for basin, with coffee maker and to charge your mobile phone was too small. But it has beautiful view. For the breakfast , they serve in some menu. You should pay for the juice and toast. But the food was nice. Don't miss the Belgium waffle. They will offer you what juice you want to and then give you the menu which show the price for juice. The swimming pool is attractive. The front desk staff forgot to smile. :( . I am dust allergy.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Kona Kai resort last June and had a great time. Rooms were clean, staff were friendly and the place was kept up quite well (dining was expensive however). I got my room through Priceline and lucky for me, I got a 2nd floor room that looked over the Marina for cheap! The only issue I had with them is that the magnetic stripe on their key cards is weak and prone to keep you out of the room at times... but that just maybe a problem I just had. Aside from that, it's a great resort and located in a quiet spot (end of Shelter Island). 4 out of 5 stars from me!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Picked Kona Kai after researching for weeks, because of the price, reviews, & pictures. I was looking for a quite, peaceful, good location with pretty surroundings and I got it. The room was nice, the location was great, the grounds were very nice. The bay is on one side, marina on the other. Our balcony faced the marina which we loved. Is it a 5 star resort, No. But it is a very nice, comfortable, relaxing resort, without the 5 star price tag. We stayed 5 nights, and after sightseeing each day, we were so glad we picked Kona Kai to come back "home" to on Shelter Island.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I took my fiance here for our 4 year aniversary and we absolutley loved the atmosphere. On a tiny island in between the Bay and a marina, the hotel felt like an expensive romantic honeymoon spot but at a fraction of the price. Dennis, the Front Desk Manager, found us a beautiful room overlooking the bay. The next face we met was a security gaurd who told us where our room was. Said his name was Peter Stuart. He let us know the times for the pool and the other services at the hotel. Surprisinly friendly for a hotel security guard. Overall, the stay couldn't have gone better.</p></li>

I would stay here again and would reccommed it anyone who wants a relaxing visit with a wonderful view of sail boats. I was able to run each morning while looking at boats and the variety of art and historical information along the path. Also, very affordable, during the week.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I visited San Diego for the first time this summer for my cousin's wedding. We chose this hotel because of the waterfront views shown on their web site. Right from the start, the staff was friendly and personable. Chrissie checked us in and also gave us precise directions on how to get to Seaworld. Later, we enjoyed the pool and later went for a walk where the view overlooked downtown San Diego. Very beautiful! With the wedding along with trying to visit as many tourist spots as possible, thank goodness the room was comfortable and adequate size for my wife and kids.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family of 3 spend one great relaxing Sunday night in early August. (We booked online a day early with no problem -in order to escape another hotel where we had an horrible experience!!) The Kona Kai Resort is a very quiet hotel because it is the last resort at the end of Shelter Island Drive in Shelter Island Park. Our room had the ocean side view on the entry to San Diego Harbor with The Coronado visible across the channel. Service was very fine. The only negative complain I have was that the hotel wifi internet access was spotty at best. I do recommend this hotel to everybody !!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I grew up in San Diego and in the 60's and 70's this hotel was the place to stay. Now the hotel is showing it's age and is in need of major rennovations, especially in the rooms. We still found the rooms clean and the staff pleasant and courteous and you cannot beat the location for beautiful views of San Diego and the harbor. Our room rate was so deeply discounted it proved to me they were desperate to get guests. There was also nobody in the restaurant the night we stayed at the property. Still, until some money is put back into this place- the ratings will continue to be just average.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Kona Kai is a beautiful hotel in a beautiful location. I was traveling with the AUVSI robotics competition, and the hotel staff was particularly welcoming. Our rooms were excessively messy with machine parts, and we even shifted the furniture. Furthermore, they allowed us to test our equipment off their docks and in their pool. The desk staff was informative, and helpful, especially Trudi. They were knowledgeable about the area, and helped us print our shipping labels and other documents at no charge. On top of all this, the hotel is in the middle of beautiful San Diego. I'd stay again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had a 2nd floor room, with a small balcony, facing the bay. It was great to watch all the ships passing. The room was nicely decorated; the tile on the bathroom sink area was striking. Breakfast in the restaurant was a little pricey, but the amount of food was enormous. The pool area was very nice. The interior and exterior public spaces were so beautiful. The Kona Kai is located on the far tip of Shelter Island, just a few miles from downtown San Diego. Close enough to get to town quickly, but far enough away to be so very quiet and relaxing. Great staff and concierge. I will definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">They had a discounted rate advertised on the website. It didn't matter, they make it up in so many ways. They charge an approx. 11% "Tax Recovery Charge and Service Fee". Parking is $15 a day. If you want to use the gym, that's $10 a day. Oh, and a side of toast in the restaurant is $2.75. My room was reserved to be a pool or garden view. I got the parking lot. Two trays of consumed room service food were in the isle down from my room for two days. The room was decent, the bathroom counter was extremely small, but Wi-Fi is ""free""!!! Expect to spend much, much more than what the room is advertised for. I guess in this economy that's all part of the game.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I read the reviews on this hotel saying it needed updating, etc., but to me the decor fit right in with the Hawaiian theme. Maybe a little dated but not as I pictured it. I chose this hotel because of the location to Hwy 8 and wanted a little of a "resort" feel. I got this here and the staff treated me as if I were royalty. King bed was not too comfortable but I think that is all I would change. Loved the views from our room and close access to the sparkling pool. Loved the little beach with sand volleyball. Our room was very clean. Room service was pricey so we did not use. No time for the spa but it looked beautiful. I was not charged for parking so didn't understand the parking comments but perhaps they forgot?</p></li>

I was here for three days for a conference, and I can only assume the conference organizers got a good deal, because this place was pretty awful from the moment I walked through the door - especially considering the rate (>$200 a night). Decor was dated from the lobby to the rooms and beyond - to the extent that I felt I was caught somewhere in the early 90s. Room didn't feel clean and the food was poor. Being situated so far from anything in San Diego, it was difficult to get away to eat anything decent.</p></li>

This SHOULD be a four star hotel, if the crew cared. Instead, it is bottom of the barrel -- a travesty for the beautiful area it surrounds.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I wanted to have a nice weekend getaway with my boyfriend for Valentine's Day but we were on a bit of a budget and it wasn't easy finding a place. I found the Kona Kai on a travel site and decided to give it a try. I spoke with Peter and he was so helpful! He understood our situation and found the perfect room for us. He was very knowledgeable about the sites of San Diego. Peter told us a list of hotspots for dining and dancing. The room had a great view and service was exceptional. Check out was very easy and the employees were really friendly. Every time a friend asked about a hotel I tell them to check out the Kona Kai and ask for Peter because his customer service is one of a kind. He'll really fine tune your trip to fit it to your needs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we stayed for five days. there was never ice on any floor. We didn't rent a car and the only transport service was a cab. or walk the lengh of the Island to get to food. The hotel shuttle went to the airport and wildlife park. The wild life park got us there by 11 and picked us up by 4. that wasn't enough time to see anything for the price of the enterance fee. ON our last day we learned that there was an island bus that stopped by am and pm. Lot of good that did us then. Room service took over an hour for a pot of coffee. In the end I could have stayed in town walked to starbucks. The room was fine but it was just like a quality inn room only add on was you got to look at the yachets. But I bet every room there had view since it was an island.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at Kona Kai 3 nights with two teenagers and pet. Location on Shelter island is quiet with great views of habor and city, 10 min. proximity to Ocean beach and downtown. Good AAA rate included free parking. This was the first time we travelled with pet, extra $70 for entire stay. We usually don't book rooms that allow pets due to allergies and our pickiness about cleanliness , but our room at Kona was clean. Internet was fast, had a fantastic 1st floor harbor view of the yachts. We stayed at the adjacent Best Western property last year, but the AAA rate at Kona was much better- glad we chose it. The Best Western is newly remodeled though, so given identical rates, I would pick the Best Western (and it has tennis courts). Fun trip, thanks Kona Kai !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Got this hotel using priceline for $69 a night. We received a room facing the bay at first, but request a room facing the he marina. Front Desk was very nice and sent a new room key to us for a marina facing room. Beautiful view of the marina and all the yachts. Beds are okay, not bad or great. The area is a little out of the way. Your about 5-10 minutes from Old Town and 15 minutes to Downtown. You receive a refrigerator in your room and an open balcony if your not on the first floor which faces a marina and a private little beach. I really liked this little resort and would love to stay here again for the right price. The only complaint is the parking fee of $15 a night. I mean, c'mon, for the prices they charge normally, they should include the parking.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Kona Kai Resort was a perfect setting for us. It had everything that we needed...our room was overlooking the pool and the bay and we had some relaxing moments hanging out on the balcony. We were given breakfast coupons and was very pleased with the quality and quantity of food. Although you only had 5 or 6 main menu selections to choose from, it included all the breakfast items you could want. The frittata with asparagus was the best! I would highly recommend the bike rental. We spent 2 hours one day on a bike rental and biked around San Diego along the water and got close to downtown. The location of the hotel is great! The grounds were kept up well and everything was clean. When we come back to San Diego, we will definitely check out Kona Kai again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I would skip. Too many other places to stay in San Diego with better prices and atomsphere. We were looking for a Hawaiian themed hotel...and this was not it. We did have a room right on the marina but the room smelled like a Motel 6 room. I would rate this hotel about a 2.5 - definitely not a "resort". The decor is definitely outdated and the breakfast with the AAA rate is not worth "the deal". The front lobby clerk processes checkin only...unconcerned with giving you the usual spiel about where to find the internet access code or that the AAA breakfast is ordered off a special menu and you must notify your server ahead of time. The rooms lead out to concrete hallways and the walls are paperthin...definitely not resort material - especially by San Diego standards!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a lovely view of the bay out front and a view of the marina while eating breakfast. We got the "Island Getaway Deal" so we paid $118.30/night and it included breakfast and parking, heck of a deal. The room was abit outdated but it was doable since we were only there to sleep, lots of closet space, it was quiet and we had a good sleep. The breakfast was delicious, we had the vegetable fritatta. The location was perfect to get to Sea World, The Zoo, drive along the harbour, ocean beach park, etc. We ate at Pizza Nova one night and loved it. Nice atmosphere, nice marina out front and delicious food, not just pizza. I also recommend going to La Jolla and checking out Torrey Pines scenic drive to the glideport where you can watch people hang gliding or flying other planes.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I would highly recommend my family and friends to stay at this resort. Tina sagisi and patrice battle made my weekend getaway a million times better. Tina was very helpful and informative when I booked my reservations. She was able to answer all of my questions about the resort and also made several suggestions on what to do in San Diego. I appreciated that she took the time to help me out. Also, when I asked if I could upgrade my traditional room to a room with a balcony and a view. Patrice battle was able to give me a 3rd floor marina view. She upgraded my room at no additional charge. I spent about $150 and I also got $5.00 back when I checked out. I just wanna say that I will he back again and hope that Tina and Patrice get recognized for their wonderful customer service. Thank you</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When we arrived Sergio at the front desk was very courteous and helpful. When I asked which side of the hotel we would be facing he told us we were facing the parking lot, but that we could upgrade to the marina side and that it was complimentary. He also gave us a rundown of all the great amenities at the property. He told us about the pool, the marina, restaurant, bar, and the spa services. I told him I was very impressed and he comped us a breakfast at the restaurant. We got to the room and were pleasantly surprised. The room was beautiful! What a view! Roomy, cozy, nicely decorated and very comfortable. Then, we got to know the area a little. We ate the hotel's restaurant, had a drink at the bar, took a stroll down the marina walkway and the length of Shelter Island and really enjoyed our stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I realize that some are looking for a less expensive hotel to stay at in a relatively expensive hotel market. But, for your own sake, keep on looking past the Kona Kai. The rooms were run down, the area is not very good (nothing to walk to), and the staff were less than enthusiastic about receiving us. Actually, we were ok staying there because they had a complementary shuttle service from the airport, which they said ran from 5am till 11pm. When I called them at 9:30pm for my shuttle, they told me that it was a slow night, so they sent their driver home... and that I'd need to take a taxi at my expense. I finally persuaded the manager to cover the cost of the taxi. Even though checkout was later, I got out of there at 8am... I couldn't wait to leave. I know their price is lower... just know that you'll be getting what you pay for.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just want to add couple more words to the previous review. Have some days ago returned from San Diego. The hotel is in very good place. All rooms really have or bay view or marina view. Decent show is spent on Fridays. A pure pool, but almost every day there were many children. The biggest lack was the room and shower, including restroom aria. The room looks like was not updated for the last 100 years. And this is true. Everything was in below average condition. NO screen on the balcony door, so you have to keep the door close and run AC (which was very noise like the most old window AC) or to buy a screen from the nearest Home Depot ant tape it every night. Parking is not free, but wireless internet was working fine. If you can fix all these issues I can easily give five stars to this hotel. That is why I do not recommend this hotel now.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Greeted by a sour faced head receptionist who couldn't dispose of us quickly enough. Concierge dumped our cases at the door of 2nd floor room (no lift) and vanished. Room had damp smell and insect screen was hanging off the frame. Marina view of the boats from room was superb so we decided to stay. Meanwhile car park at $15 gave us a pass but each time we went in or out we had to stamp in give name, room number etc - bit of a pain and not worth having the pass. Also you could park for free just across the road in public park. 'Free breakfast' was not free as 1 orange juice and 2 roundsof toast added almost $12 to our 'free' breakfast. Staff not very pleasant. Everything a problem and 'manager not available' to talk to so we checked out and stayed at the Best Western just up the road. Same view. Lovely staff. Less $$. Don't rush to stay at the Kona Kai. Shoot yourself in the foot - less painful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is in a great location, situated on Shelter Island. One side of the hotel faces San Diego Bay while the other side faces the Marina. The hotel is expansive and it is difficult to navigate from one end of the hotel to the other since it is made up of different buildings. My room had a private patio facing the Bay, and was comfortable although wireless internet was virtually non-existent in the building in which my room was located. I also requested, and was assured that I would receive, a morning wake up call, which I did not receive. Another person in my party also did not receive his wake up call. They do run a shuttle between the hotel and airport, but reserve space early as it is only a van that can only hold 5 people, including the driver, with luggage. The shuttle driver was much more friendly than the front desk staff and took the time to ask how our visit had been and what could be improved upon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Shelter Island is an excellent location but the rooms at the Kona Kai are very small and the bedding needs to be updated. The price should have meant something a little more elegant. The pool area was nice and kept clean but the chairs are very uncomfortable and you had to go to the front desk for towels. Very rare for a "Resort". The free breakfast was very good with good choices and the best coffee I have had for a long time. The bathroom area was very tiny. We couldn't lay out all our accessories and the toilet was very low. A problem for someone with bad knees. Can't fault the staff though we couldn't check in til after 3:00 p.m. Although we didn't attend the luau we could watch it from our room and it was very cheesy with about 15 mins of happy birthday and happy anniversary to people. Boring! I love San Diego and Shelter Island but the Kona Kai needs to step it up a little. I loved sitting on our lanai though.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Looked nice online great location. Checked in rooms were a little dated for the price but what the heck it's near the beach do be it. I am relaxing on the patio and hear my daughter and wife scream. I run in the room just in time to see no less than 15 huge roaches scurry offy pillow. We pack up and go to the front desk to cancell our room and the front desk person acted like it was no big deal no apology nothing. After 3 days of my funds not bring released I called to speak to the general manager and he almost accused ms of lying he said they couldnt find any roaches. I told him to ask the front desk girl about the 2 I brought down in a glass and that I would be happy to send him the pictures I took. Once again no apology nothing and it took 7 days for my funds to be released. These were probably 2 inches long it was very disgusting there was roach feces in my pillow and the way the management handled it was unacceptable</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “EXPERIENCE REAL LIFE IN SAN DIEGO BY STAYING AT KONA KAI RESORT”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My mother and sister were coming to San Diego in 2010. The travel agent had placed them way up in Sierra Mesa. I couldn't believe it. I told them to get the travel agent on a three way call and I would help guide the agent to a decent place. Kona Kai Spa & Resort is actually listed under Point Loma, Shelter Island. It is only 5 minutes from the airport and they have their own shuttle bus. When I inquired, in person, myself, I asked the manager, how I could make sure that my family got a room very close to the lobby, since my mother is 85 and has a hard time walking very far. I also asked if they could request an outside view room. They gave everything and more! My sister was up and out walking, while enjoying the San Diego Skyline, every morning. The hidden beach and the pool area, are to die for. The only draw back, at all, was the expensive restaurant. Needless to say, they thanked me for saving their vacation. KONA KAI YEAH!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What can I say, the stay was extremely disappointing from the minute we arrived, the worst hotel experience I have had in 30 years. First off they had us arriving in March, we reserved for February. Because of their mistake we were put in a bay view room with queen beds, we reserved a harbor view room with a king. The gentleman at the front desk offered to lower our rate for the trouble, yet he lowered it to the regular rate of the room we ended up in. Room service meal was awful, over priced drinks at the bar (AJ's). They charged the wrong credit card and finally - this is the loudest hotel I have ever stayed in in my life (I have traveled internationally for years). The walls are PAPER THIN and you can hear everything. We could hear people's full conversations in other rooms, heard hairdryers at 6 in the morning, could hear if some blew there nose for crying out loud. Save your money and take heed to this and the other negative reviews, as they are the TRUTH.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just returned from a stay at the Shelter Pointe--now under new management and known as the Kona Kai Resort. We had a wonderful stay. The room was clean with updated modern bedding and furnishings---sort of a subtle island resort theme. The beds were double sheeted--a nice touch, because who likes to touch hotel blankets?! We never heard any noise from adjacent rooms. The resort is situated in a beautiful location--Shelter Island. Both sides have views of yachting marinas. The pool area was beautiful---a good sized pool and hot tub, tons of nice cushy lounge chairs, etc...all with a view of the marina. I didn't have much interaction with the hotel staff, but the housekeeping was always thorough and timely. The location is also good...the island feels intimate, but you are very close to Point Loma and about a ten minute drive from downtown, the Gaslamp Quarter, Old Town, etc. Overall, I highly recommend this for couples and for families---a nice little playground on the premises and another just a short walk down the island.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Long ago, in a very different life, I spent 2 glorious years aboard the USS Will Rogers, the ultimate Polaris submarine. It was in service from late 1966 [my era] to the early 1980s [it is now razor blades]. Last October a number of its alumni gathered in San Diego. We convened at the Kona Kai. From the point of view of the reunion the KK has it all: plenty of rooms at a reasonable price, great location with a view of the Submarine Base, meeting rooms, restaurants, and is close to the airport. From the point of view of the individual guest, the KK has seen better days. Specifically, the carpet of the first room to which I was assigned was soaking wet, sopping wet. Upon notifying the front desk of the problem we were immediately moved to a similar room with a dry carpet. The rest of the room was just fine. Comfortable beds, good shower, plenty of space, nice balcony with view of the marina. But, the entire property shows its age. And the restaurant is mediocre and pricey. The Kona Kai was fine for our purpose, but I would not go out of my way to stay there again. Worse yet, parking is NOT free.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I read the reviews recently and decided to go ahead and give it a try. Our family went on a valentines day weekend with plans to visit the local attractions. We were only about 10-15 minutes from Seaworld and Old town, which was great. This hotel is nestled at what i would consider a prime location. It's safe, quite and has beautiful views. The hotel is near the end of the little peninsula on Shelter Dr. From one side you have the view of the street & ocean, then the backside of the hotel has the view of the marina and beachfront. Families with children, I recommend the Marina view with a first floor room so children can play in the sand as you sit and watch from your porch. The only complaint I have about this hotel was the condition of the room. The furniture had visible wear to the wood, and the carpet needed replacing, it actually looked a bit dirty.We had plenty of towels and necessities in the room, so no complaints there. Other than that, a decent place to stay. It's not a Hilton by far, but beats a budget hotel for a little more money....and well, the views for their price is what will bring us back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not only was the trip to San Diego a great idea, but staying at the Kona Kai made it even better. It's a beautiful resort and on a secluded island.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Kona Kai for two nights for a business conference that was held on-site. Overall, the hotel was clean and well-maintained. My room had been recently updated and contained new-appearing good quality furniture, nice bedding (good sheets, comfortable mattress, clean bedspread), and an adequate bathroom. The plumbing worked well. Carpet appeared new and was very clean. The room had a private balcony overlooking a beautiful pool area and a high-end yacht harbor. The air conditioner was a bit noisy, but maintained the room's temperature nicely. The restaurant was very nice with sweeping views of the harbor and hills through floor to ceiling windows. The staff was courteous and efficient, and the food was of good quality, although pricey. The pool area was exceptional for its views, comfort and cleanliness. The pool was quite large for a hotel, and the hot tub was very nice. The conference I attended was held in three meeting rooms, which were kept quite cold. I needed a jacket to stop my shivering. The rooms were well equipped and spacious. Overall, I was satisfied with this hotel and its very nice location. I will stay here again. I consider myself to be very picky.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">THE UPSIDE- The pool is huge and the hot tub is hot. The view is very pretty. The rooms are clean..a little dated, but still clean The beds are so soft and comfy. The towels are a lttle softer than typical hotels. They let us have a cot for free...saved us $20 A NIGHT The price was right. $89 USD per night The BUMMER- We asked to be moved within five minutes of getting there. The first set of rooms were....moist and dingy. We booked queen beds and got doubles. Later to find out that all of the beds are misleading. a king is a queen and a queen is a double. The restaraunt is way too expensive. Paying for parking is silly, I'm a guest at the hotel I shouldn't have to pay for parking. Theres a security guard who patrols the grounds/pool area at night. I know hes doing his job keeping the area safe., but the pool is gated and locked. Only guests of the hotel can enter that area. He interigated us every night about who we were and what we were doing. I really didn't appreciate being treated like a trespasser. Oh, and the wireless internet was pain fully slow. Either way you spin it the price was right. The beds were comfy and the pool was amazing! Minus, the pain in the rear securuty guard.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Kona Kai Resort and Spa was my choice of visit because it was cheaper then most hotels, and a friend told me he was there when it was known as Shelter point, and he enjoyed it. My experience with the hotel was o.k. It was slightly spoiled when I arrived to learn that the rate they reserved me for over the phone was not the rate they had me in the computer for. I argued politely with the lady behind the counter saying thats not the rate I reserved it for, Though it went nowhere So i just swallowed my pride not wanting to ruin the trip and accepted the 20 dollars more a day rate. As for the rest of the stay I was pleased with how clean the room was and the prompt room service, they did a good job. The Kids playground was a little small I was expecting something a little bit larger, So we took the kids to another playground not far away on the Shelter island. Sand volleyball nexy to the marina was nice, just dont hit the ball in the water. Heated pool and spa was a plus as it was chilly most the time. I didnt like paying for nightly parking, Or that They were unable to honor the reservation. If I decide to come back I will reserve online and get a printout of the hotel webpage with the confirmation #.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband I booked this resort last minute to drive out from Scottsdale to San Diego for Memorial Day weekend. We spent $129/night plus tax (pretty decent compared to many hotels in the area). The location is stellar! Close to everything... Shelter Island is gorgeous! When we arrived at 2am (eaaaaaaaarllly Saturday morning) Trudi was the front desk manager and assisted us in checking in. She was extremely sweet, bubbly and helpful. We were exhausted and cranky and she could tell, so she comped us some free breakfast coupons for the Kona Kai resturant. The room was nice, clean, a bit small. We had two queen beds. The view was gorgeous over looking the marina! We didn't use the pool, but the spa was nice. Very warm/hot and nice jets. We dined each morning at the resturant and enjoyed the food. We got the vegetable frittata, pancakes/waffles. It was all very yummy. Two bummers: was that parking was $15. We got $5/day discount though...which helped. And that the walls were like paper. We were awoken at about 2:30am Sunday morning when the people across the way were partying very loudly. We did call front desk and they took care of it in a timely matter. I would definitely stay at the Kona Kai again, great value!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Dennis, the manager, gave us a very nice room while we were there celebrating my 40th birthday.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place should be called the Kona Why? It was certainly not what I expected after looking at the website and spending hours reviewing various hotels in San Diego. This appeared to be a good hotel on booking and reasonably priced for a 2 night stay for my family of 4 plus inlaws. The only plus was that the rooms had a water view. This place is in desperate need of a facelift, from worn and dirty carpets, scraped wallpaper in walkways, dirty grout around windows in the rooms and to make it even worse mold in the bathroom above the light fixture, disgusting! The breakfast room has a nice marina view but was pretty deserted for Spring break, I should have guessed, extremely expensive! We spent $105 for 6 people which I think is expensive for eggs. Save your money and go to the Point Loma cafe, (within 2 miles) where we spent $60 for the same thing and it was very clean and good service too. Another point to make is that this hotel charges you $10 just to use the gym!! I have never stayed anywhere where this occurs, what a nice perk for guests that was! The drinks machine also seemed to be out of drinks conveniently, so you are forced to go to the bar. A good ploy by management. This place is average but has the potential to be nice if the management cared. Not a resort though!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was looking forward to my stay at the Kona Kai for a month, but now wish I had booked elsewhere. The hotel is in a wonderful location and I enjoyed waking up to see the ships each morning, but that is about all I was happy with. The room was very oudated. I was in the wheelchair accessable room (although we are both able bodied), so that may be the reason for some of the differences than what others describe. The bathroom was very outdated and there was no place to put personal items, although the spiders seemed to like it. Many tiles were cracked and there appeared to be small spots of mold on the wallpaper. Only one curtain opened to look out on the patio, which we never sat on. It overlooked the maintance shed and anyone in the parking lot had access to it. The refrigerator was warm and every button on the remote control only changed the channel down. Housekeeping entered the room three times, even though the do not disturb sign was hanging on the door. Finally, the gate to the parking lot usually took about 3 minutes to open. On Monday night we had to go in throught the exit because the gate to the entrance would not open after 10 minutes of trying. The Kona Kai was not worth the cost, even with the AAA discount. I would recommend looking elsewhere if you are planning a trip to San Diego.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had to take our daughter to college in San Diego & needed a hotel for the weekend. Because I was busy with college preparations I put my husband in charge of making the hotel reservations. He found the hotel on Google & booked it because it had a lap pool. I checked the reviews on this site & because there were so many negative reviews I really didn't want to stay there; but the price was right & we didn't have time to find something else. I was pleasantly surprised to find the hotel was really nice. I was expecting a dump with indifferent staff & found just the opposite. We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds overlooking the pool & facing the marina our first night. The second night because our daughter was moving into the dorm we requested a move to a room with a king size bed. They had no problem accomadating us. This room was on the first floor & faced the harbor & downtown. Both rooms were clean. Neither had any of the smells that were mentioned in other reviews. Both rooms were spacious & nicely furnished. My husband really enjoyed the lap pool, & I enjoyed walking along the water. I thought this hotel was great for the price. We paid $149 for Thursday night & $239 for Friday.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed at the Kona Kai twice, once in a water view room and once not. The room itself is dated, non-flat screen tv, dated decor, peeling paint etc, but the price is good compared to the other hotels on this street. I love this location as I come to San Diego for work and its nice to relax in a peaceful place right by the water. I probably will keep coming to stay, but might try the hotel just down the road next time for comparison. Overall pros and cons Balconies on the rooms The irons in the rooms seem to be very good (surprisingly) Bed is comfortable enough, pilllows could be a bit more varied Wi-Fi, although the first time I stayed it kept dropping out, the second time it was fine Restaurant on site if you want room service, I had the mango chicken and it was good. The water wasn't heating up hot at all on my most recent stay, which meant a cold shower, I tried it again 30 minutes later and it was working (a bit late) Walls are quite thin, I was woken up at midnight by my neighbors who had the most annoying laugh (especially at that time of night!) My colleague had a similiar issue the first time Parking is free if you have a AAA card Poor lighting - I have issues with dim lighting, and they really need a few more lamps I discovered a mini refrigerator too on my last visit behind what I thought was just a mirror, but there is a fridge and safe behind it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here with my boyfriend for our anniversary. One thing I can say is that they do have wonderful views, one side is full of interesting yacts, and the other side has a nice view of the open water. At first my bf was really irritated that there were a million college kids, but they didn't make much noise & he eventually forgot about them. Our room was okay. Nothing special, except that you could hear some type of seal or sea lion from our balcony (which some people might find annoying but we happened to enjoy). They had a nice gym & bike rental area, and it was very relaxing to just stroll around the hotel, since it's right on the sand. The best part of the hotel, in our opinion, was the restaurant. We are the quiet type, so we were delighted to have dinner mostly to ourselves at the beautiful restraunt with the ocean view. We also got a free breakfast that was included in our stay in the morning (there was only a few other people that time as well). The food was great and the venue was high class. It was pretty difficult to find our room at first, but the actual hotel, which is three stories, isn't that big. It seemed like there was some interesting places to eat down the street too. I would say, if you get a good deal on the room (no more than $100), and you live within an hour or two of SD, go for a night and enjoy yourself! More than one night is probably too much though.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">All I have to say about this resort are wonderful things!!! Right from the beginning of our stay, the clerk from the front desk was very polite. She asked us several questions and got us the right room we wanted. We had a room overlooking the marina and the view was marvelous! We spent more time on our patio than in the actual room!!! We also spoke with a hotel employee by the name of Chrissy. She walked by us while we were in the pool area, and asked us how our stay was going. She asked us if this was our first time in San Diego, and told us about a ton of things to do while we were down here. I couldn't believe all of the things we were going to miss out on! She talked to us about sea world, balboa park, and even gave us a city map of the area and pointed out where everything was! This was hands down, the best customer service we have ever gotten at any other hotel! (Trust me, we do travel alot!) After she talked about San Diego she told us if we had any problems to call the front desk, and she would make sure that it would be fixed..well we had some problems with the movie that we ordered (we tried several times) , so we called and she was able to comp our movie!! We couldn't believe the great service we got! We definitely will go here again, thanks to Chrissy and the wonderful staff here. We couldnt have asked for a more perfect vacation! Thanks Kona Kai!! We will be seeing you again soon!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Kona Kai 3 nights, the 25th - 27th the first night, Christmas night, we checked in at 1:30 am. We were very tired and just wanted a bed. We found the room, which was ok but we had no heat, the heat exchanger was not working. The room was about 60 degrees but we were to tired to change rooms so we piled the blankets from both beds on to one and had a cozy night. The next morning we awoke to a beautiful view in a chilly room. We let the manager know and they took care of the problem with the heater. The Hotel its self is a little rough around the edges and could use a face left. We ate in the dinning room for breakfast all three days and found the food to be very tasty, maybe a little pricey. The location of the hotel is to die for, very close to the airport, close to everything worth seeing and right on the water. There are great walks right outside the door, the views are fantastic and the price is a value. We paid $83.50 per night for a standard room with two queen beds, parking was extra and the price did not include breakfast, the internet services were free and fast. However, because of our problem the first night the manager comped the room for that night and also gave us free parking, no arguing, no hassle. If your looking for an upscale hotel with all the bells and whistles, this is not it. If your looking for a nice hotel at a great value, give the Kona Kai Resort a try.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Christie at the front desk is very welcoming.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stay at this hotel often because I travel alot for business. The location is nice and convenient since I work alot in the downtown area but hate staying in the downtown area. I also do some work over at the navy sub base which is very conveniently close. Anyhow, upon checking in, Christie at the front desk immediately acknowledged me and welcomed me by name. I was pleasantly surprised at such a welcome I had. I was impressed that she remembered my name and the exact location of the hotel I enjoy staying. I dont stay that often, but often enough to know which view and part of the hotel I like to stay. Christie seems to be a great asset to this hotel because all the times I walked past the front desk, she acknowledged myself and others passing. One day I did have an issue with the heater in my room. The first gal I spoke to, Jessica, said she would send up blankets and send the maintenance man to check it out, it was not done. Later, I spoke to Christie and she was able to immediately have a nice gentleman named Robert replace the unit with no further problems. I also want to commend Joseph in the restaurant who is friendly and checked on me during my meal. He recommended a few other places for dining that i never heard of since coming here which was very good. Excellent service! although, the rooms are a little old, I would come back because of great staff like Christie, Joseph, and Robert. Thank you all!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I wasn't looking for a luxury stay while in San Diego, just an affordable one. I travel with cats so when I first tried to book online via one of the 'discount hotel' websites, I realized I better call the actual place and find out if the cats would be ok. While inquiring, I spoke with Jessica at the Kona Kai who not only said 'sure, the cats are fine as long as we know ahead of time' but also informed me that she could get me a much better rate than the one I was about to purchase. Of course I booked the room! When I showed up, I was delighted to find it located across the bay from downtown and to find the views spectacular on either side of the place! For less than I would have paid for little more than a bed sized room downtown, I got this beautiful spacious room complete with a balcony overlooking the beautiful harbor at Shelter Island! The breakfast tickets were a plus as well! Real, sit down breakfast each day, with a decent selection to pick from and add on items available as well. I am an avid cyclist and was thrilled to find such great road biking on the island and to find it just a few short scenic miles to get to the downtown area or a few hilly, challenging miles to get to Ocean Beach! My legs are grateful for the location of this place! Jessica and everyone else I encountered at the resort were wonderful to work with, very helpful, and I never had a bad encounter with any of them. In fact, I ended up extending my stay because I loved it there so much!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I wrote a review on Travelocity that surprisingly did NOT show up. Hmmmm... We arrived around 12:30 pm on Sunday and was told to check back in 45 min for our rooms. No problem. Went to their dining room and had lunch, came back - still no room. The staff stated that we needed to come back in another hour as check in wasn't until 4 pm and we were "Early". ??? What? Unfortunatley, we did not have a vehicle, and unbeknownst to us buses and shuttles are not allowed on the island in order to control traffic. We were basically stuck to hang out in the lobby. We had my older mother and two children who were very tired and just wanted to get to our rooms. To make a long story short, they did not have our rooms until 4 pm. 4 hours later!! Other guests continued to come in and get their rooms. No apology other than they continued to say we checked in too early!! We were disgusted with the Reservation Mgr, as she never apologized and when we questioned why other guests that were coming in AFTER we were, she once again spouted "check in isn't until 4 pm". In addition I had called a month prior to our visit and requested that we were women traveling alone with our senior mother and asked that we be placed close together. We got there and of course this was not the case. They were unable to accomodate us with this small request as well. The rooms are dated and the accomodations are limited. If you do not have a vehicle I would not recommend this location. Let's be honest...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very nice hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was a little worried about this hotel after reading some of the very negative reviews, but our stay at Shelter Pointe exceeded my expectations. The location of the hotel is perfect, it is a 10 minute drive to anywhere in San Diego. The rooms were clean and nice, a little humid, but very nice. It is true that it isn't extremely quiet in the hotel, but we didn't hear any conversations or get woken up early in the morning. You can just hear kids outside by the pool and doors slamming in the other rooms, but it is not too bad. The hotel grounds are so beautiful, it is located in a great spot. Basically any room you have would be very nice. We reserved the cheaper room and were on the first floor with a patio out to the pool courtyard, and this was great. The pool and beach are very nice, it seems like a great place to take a family. It is annoying that parking is an extra $15 a day and they don't warn you about this, but it is really nice to park just outside the door of your building and not have to hastle with street parking or anything like that. We never ate at the hotel restaurant, but there is plenty of good dining nearby. Downtown is only 10 minutes away, and you can find anything you would want there. We ate at Miguel's Mexcian restaurant one night, it is on the corner of Scott St. & Shelter Island Drive, it was good and inexpensive. So if you have a reservation here, don't cancel it just because of those negative reviews. I was very impressed with the hotel and the grounds, and there is so much to do in San Diego that you'll never be in your room anyway.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Stayed here when it was Shelter Pointe Hotel ... it was "okay"”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After having stayed at just about all of the hotels on Shelter Island (and unless this one has been recently upgraded)... I would rate it dead last. It doesn't have the charm or character of the Best Western or Humphries. The parking lot is tedious. My room had outdated decor, ugly color scheme and the architecture is fairly hideous. The location is great on Shelter Island, but that is about the only good thing. It was just... "adequate" which for the price you expect a better experience. The bed was okay comfortable. The screen was broken on the sliding glass doors and the screen material was peeling into the room. Just felt a bit ripped off for the price. The lobby was full of people milling about for various weddings in the neighborhood -- kind of annoying atmosphere. The vibe wasn't really quaint or tropical or laid back like Best Western (which had free fresh chocolate cookies on their front desk) or Humphries (which had snotty desk people but a nice tropical feeling & flow to the property). Kona Kai is sort of lame and uptight. Can't describe it really. The "view" from the rooms is obstructed partially. Just an okay experience. Would rate it a C+. I prefer the Best Western down the street and even Humphries for about the same price range. It's better than staying in a motel-8, but for the money, you expect more. I haven't tried the one called the Bay Inn (I think?) but one lady in the parking lot told me that she liked it and that they had a free brunch, which none of the other Shelter Island hotels offer (to my knowledge). So I would try that or Best Western, then Humphries.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived a little after midnight (our local time 3am EST) to be told they don't have a room for me due to plumbing issues. Not a good start, but they had reserved a room at Hotel Sheraton in downtown and they comped our first night. I hated this part of it, but what do you do, at least they comped it...I wished they had at least let us know ahead of time via e-mail :( The next day we arrived at the hotel and they did not charge us for the parking for our entire 3 day stay. The view was marvellous, nothing better than being ale to see the water as I lay on the bed. It was fabulous to have morning coffee in the balcony with that view. We stayed on the second floor. The room is a little dated, but we've been to several all-inclusives in mexico, punta cana etc and I think the old look is inevitable with the ocean being so close by ??? anyhow, yes the bed mattress wasn't the best but we were fine. the only problem was the tiny airconditioner could barely keep our room cool. The complimentary breakfast was fine, yeah the orange juice is extra but we always have coffee anyways, and yeah! got to pay extra for the toast if you order eggs (this should be changed, but for a free breakfast they had a few good choices and the quality was good). I did see a foreign family with only the dad speaking some english ordering stuff with his free breakfast coupon and the staff didn't seem to expalin well that the juice etc. It says on the bottom of the english menu it's extra but the waiter just asks everybody whether you want orange juice or coffee, so that wasn't fair. I WILL STAY AGAIN, THE VIEW IS SO SOOOTHING AND THE PREMISES MORE THAN ADEQUATE.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is our 3rd trip to the Kona Kai and our last. We booked online with a third party and I admit I never did that before. I was assured by the third party if I upgraded my room I would get free breakfast everyday. When we arrived at the hotel I told them that and they said we were not getting breakfast and could not upgrade because it was booked third party. I don't know who was wrong but they didn't even try and work with us. When we were getting the room key I told them I wanted to stay in the free standing buildings not the older part of the hotel. She gave me the 2nd floor in the older part of the hotel. I said that wasn't what I wanted, she then gave me another key. When we went to the room we were on the first floor of the older part of the hotel...exactly what I did not want. The hallways to the rooms have scuffed walls, dim lighting and not nice smells. The room itself used to have beautiful bedcovers, pillow shams and decorator pillows...this time they made the bed with the bedcover turned down with no shams or nice pillows. The only pillows on each bed were about 2" thick, together they didn't make a decent pillow. The place just seems to get more run down each year we go. The beds were junk, neither of us got a good nights sleep in the cheap mattresses. The outside had a lot of discoloration, could have been mold or rust. Inside the room we had to move furniture to find a place to plug in our computer and cell chargers. Lastly we had to pay $15 a night to park in an unsecure parking lot, they were working on the gates and they were constantly open. All in all we're going to stay on Shelter Island but it will not be at the Kona Kai.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was in San Diego for what turned out to be an abbreviated trip for a conference for work. While the hotel was okay, I really disliked the location at least from the convention center, and the drive during rush hour took a bit longer than any of the hotels near by the convention center, although that's really not anyone's fault as my work booked the trip. Driving to the hotel and once on Shelter Island, we passed many other seemingly nicer hotels that I later found out cost the same or less. Once at the hotel, I was placed in the last building, and one of the last rooms, a handicapped room. Neither of the keys they gave me worked and I had to walk all the way back to the lobby, and wait in the line that had formed while I checked in. The reception staff was not particularly friendly or helpful. Once entering my room, it was immediately noticeable it was a handicapped room, low sink, grab bars all over the bathroom, etc. I usually don't request room changes unless something is really bothering me (like smoke from a neighboring room), so I stayed and it was fine, although I had wondered if I was given this room because I got a cheaper government rate. Who knows. Anyway, the room was nothing special and I could not tell whether or not the room had been renovated, somethings seemed to be newer than others (like doors) while the bed and bathroom seemed dated. The pool was nice and had a pretty nice view, and while sitting in the jacuzzi at night, I could see the fireworks from sea world. The hotel wasn't anything special, but it served its purpose. I don't think I'd stay there again though seeing as you can get a similar deal for a closer and newer hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had stayed here once before 2 years ago. We loved it. The weather was a little more cooperative last time, but that's not the problem. First up we really resented the new parking restrictions along the road which force you to pay for parking the hotel lot or be towed. $15 a day!!!! Outrageous. I bet when the signs went up the hotel smacked their chops and went 'cha ching'. Also, the dog fee. Gone Waaaaaay up. We don't mind paying a fee for the privilege but its outrageous now. I felt like we maybe could have booked her her own room... If you want to workout? You have to pay extra for that too. The room was not so great. They put us in a Handicapped room for some bizarre reason. Neither of us are. This meant the bathroom was large, but had NO COUNTER. The cleanliness of the room bothered me. The wall papered feature wall in the bathroom (alongside the toilet/basin...the one with no counter) reflected in the light a host of stains running up it. I don't think anyone has run a cloth over it in quite some time...yeeeck. Also the curtains covering the door to the balcony...aside from looking rather sad and old, were also stained with...something...not too sure what...blood? wine? ketchup? double yeeeck! We had the room service breakfast. Very nice. Put our tray in the hall for pickup when we left that morning...the tray remained in the hall through the whole next day - still there when we left. We really like this place. The views, the marina, the bay on the other side. You do feel like you're on a real vacation there. We like that its dog friendly. But its obviously going downhill. In these economic times, STOP NICKEL AND DIMING US! We probably wont come back.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “It made me remember why I love San Diego.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was absolutely perfect for my trip. First, I had a wedding to attend to in Mission Bay, so the location was perfect because it wasn't too far. The hotel was located in a quiet area along the bay in the Shelter Island Area. It was quiet, beautiful, and relaxing all in one. Dennis Vinegas, an employee there, set the reservation for the room for me. He set me up with the perfect room with an awesome view (Many thanks to Dennis!). The room was itself was cozy and comfortable, but it was the balcony that really did it for me. It was so relaxing just to sit on the balcony area and look out on the bay. Sleeping, we just left the balcony door open and let the bay breeze blow in to cool us down. Living in Vegas now, staying at the Kona Kai made me remember some of the things I truly miss the most about San Diego. The pool at the Kona Kai was a delight too. It was just as quiet and relaxing as our room. A pet peeve of mine is to be trying to relax at a pool while a bunch of young children splash you with water and scream the whole time. This was most definitely NOT the case here. Dining at the Kona Kai restaurant went just as well. My boyfriend and I couldn't resist and ordered 4 breakfast plates between the 2 of us. We opted to sit outside on the patio where the host told lead us to the table with what she dubbed as "the perfect view"....and she was right. We enjoyed our breakfast with a perfect view of both the bay and the hotel at a table with just the right amount of sunshine and a gentle breeze. If you're looking for a real hidden gem by the San Diego Bay, I completely recommend the Kona kai Resort. It's a relaxing spot with lovely rooms, beautiful views, and a very pleasant and helpful staff. Next time I am back in town, I would definitely want to stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">OK, well where to begin. I guess from the beginning. We checked in at about 11pm, on thursday Labor Day weekend. When I arrived there was a much older lady checking in, and was obviously, physically limited, the lady checking her in tried to put her in the old building which had no elevators on an upper floor, the lady checking her in seemed obviously annoyed that the lady said anything, asI checked in I confirmed I had a crib available, and she then tried to put me on an upper floor with no elevator, I explained, baby, stroller, and once again she seemed highly agitated someone made such a request. We got checked in, and went to our room. The rooms are very very aged. I did not have the mildew smell many complain of, but by no means pleasant smelling either. The linens on the beds and the bathrooms, all seem like they have been washed about 10,000 times. extremely thin, extremely worn, and overall very low quality. The housekeeping was ok, but not great. The furniture in the rooms is circa early 1980. very outdated, but not necessarily in bad condition. Just very old. The location is great, at the tip of Shelter Island, we had a great view of the harbor, but our patio furniture was so old and dirty looking you didn't want to sit on it for fear of it rubbing off on your clothes. Some have mentioned the luau, We did not go, but it did create a huge inconvenience as the hotel let all the performers park in our lot. So not only did we have to pay for parking but we had difficulty finding parking because of the luau. quite quite annoying. So here you go: Pros: location is amazing Very pretty property great views Cons: horrible linens cleanliness so so furniture- worn and out dated staff- well just so so parking, ok except for the one day property could use a good thorough cleaning.</p></li>
