Both the hotel and restaurant staff very very competent and helpful. Very good meal but expect to pay $40-50 for a dinner without drinks. The room was also very nice and deserving of the 4 star rating. I'll be returning in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hyatt Regency DFW was a great hotel - clean, good service, good food options. The room was great, spacious, and had everything I needed. The desk on rollers made it easy to turn into a dining table when a friend brought me takeout for dinner. The meeting rooms were also very nice. It's hard to get anywhere since it's by the airport, but considering the location it was quite nice.</p></li>

Room service was prompt, tasty, fresh and nicely presented. If I hadn't had a meeting (at the other Hyatt which looked nice but not worth the extra money) I would not have wanted to leave my room. It was such a comfy oasis coming off a plane. I would stay here again!</p></li>

Quick friendly shuttle service is available to all terminals, but you can walk to C if you don't have bags. One of the best airport hotels out there!</p></li>

Remember to ask the front desk or bell man to validate your airport toll ticket daily so you don't have to pay anything when you exit the airport toll gate. They will validate it for 16 hours. The room was very nice and modern in decor. Very clean. Not noisy. I didn't go into the restaurant, but it was hoppin' on Friday and Saturday nights and Sunday morning.</p></li>

I'd come in on the long flight from Sydney, Australia, so having a hotel so close to the airport was a big factor.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel is designed for layovers, with shuttle buses that leave every 20 min on the hour and departure schedule screens in the lobby. The hotel is very close to the airport, approx 5 min shuttle. The rooms are modern and staff is efficient. The bed has a duvet but is a little on the hard side and could be a bit more comfortable for my taste. For dinner I had room service and the sea bass was very good. I have stayed more than once and recommend staying on the side away from the airport.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here overnight on our way down to Mexico, and at the Grand Hyatt DFW on the way back. The Hyatt Regency hotel is on the airport grounds, about a five minute shuttle ride from the terminal. They picked us up promptly, and the shuttle leaves every 20 minutes from the hotel back to the terminals. The property is renovated/updated, and the rooms are large and fairly quiet for an airport hotel. Service was very good. Overall, a very good experience, particularly for an airport hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After missing a connection American put me up in this hotel. Not to be confused with the Grand Hyatt, this is the older Hyatt in terminal C. What a pleasant surprise this was. The property has undergone a total remodel and is way bettter than expected. The rooms have a "W" hotel feel, huge flat screen TVs, new comfy beds and the decor is first rate. The only drawback to the property is that it is quite a walk from the terminal, although they do have a shuttle. I would stay here again without hesitation.</p></li>

The front desk staff is always efficient, professional, and friendly. The rooms have always been immaculate and well equipped. The airport shuttle service is terrific. Because this hotel is right in the middle of the huge DFW airport property, you time between your room and your airline is amazingly short. This is a great place to get some much needed rest when travelling.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am accustomed to the Hyatt Regency brand applying to a moderately upscale hotel. This one, however, was a basic concrete block with the ambiance of a well-maintained Econo Lodge. Entirely surrounded by the Dallas-Fort Worth airport, it features breathtaking views of three parking structures. There is noplace to walk other than these structures. Clean and well-staffed, it is the perfect hotel to stay in before an early flight or after a late one. And it is ideal for anyone who is coming to Dallas and wants to avoid seeing Dallas.</p></li>

I used the kiosk for automated check-in and check-out and it was very quick. The shuttle took longer than expected to arrive to pick us up at the airport terminal. The shuttle from the hotel to the airport was also full and could not accommodate all the people that were waiting. The staff was friendly and welcoming. Had breakfast in the restaurant - it was quite average and the service was slow but I didn't have high expectations to begin with.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent airport hotel in terminal area (shuttle required). Couldn't be any more convenient without being in the actual terminal itself. Its a 1 minute ride from the hotel to the terminals. The best part is the price. It's half the price of most 'in terminal' hotels, and at least 80% as convenient. I've stayed there twice, and will be there again in March. I highly recommend this place for an overnighter or a couple of days. I've stayed there when attending the Cowboys Classic and earlier this year at the Cotton Bowl. Couldn't have been happier.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Although not a 5 star destination hotel, you'd be hard put to find a better place to stay before an early flight out of DFW. The staff is gracious and attentive, the rates are quite reasonable for a hotel of this quality, and the facilities are kept in exceptional shape. One of those places where you won't hesitate to walk around barefoot in your room - in fact the carpet was actually quite plush and felt nice on the toes. It was our first stay here, but we won't hesitate to stay again next time. The room was even quiet - didn't expect that staying AT the airport.</p></li>

If you put in Hyatt Hotel (GPS) it will take you to the hotel Down town which is also a beautiful hotel. Overall Excellent Stay</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here on an overnight on our way home from vacation. We had a great room rate that included breakfast. The hotel is off Consourse C at DFW Airport, very clean lobby area, spotless rooms and nice bathroom and room layout. The bed was very comfortable w/ ultra soft linens. The lobby bar had good service for a snack and a glass of wine. Breakfast the next morning was really good and a nice selection of fresh fruits, eggs, cereal, etc and excellent coffee. Front desk personnel were professional and friendly. There is a shuttle to and from the airport every 20 minutes or so. I would highly recommend this hotel if you have to stay overnight at the airport.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel two nights during a national junior high chess tournament. We did receive a special "chess" rate of $120 per night, so it was good value for the money. Positives: clean, comfortable rooms with flat screen TVs. It is fairly easy to get in and out of the hotel's parking garage. Be sure to have the hotel validate your parking card, and you'll save the $14 per day. Negatives: As one reviewer noted earlier, there isn't enough hot water in the morning when everyone is taking a shower around the same time. I also didn't enjoy paying $10.77 per day for Internet access. The two or three resaurants in the hotel are very pricey, so I didn't try them.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for one night to break our journey, having received a good rate on Hotwire, and were so pleased to arrive at the hotel after a much-delayed flight. Check in staff were exceptionally pleasant, and helpful with directions etc. Room was fine and very clean and comfortable, there was a great shower, and we slept well without any aeroplane noise to disturb us. Had a snack meal in the coffee shop type restaurant adjacent to the bar, food was very average and the server was rather over attentive, constantly interrupting our conversation to ask if we were enjoying our meal! That was the only negative thing about our stay and we would happily use this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel online not knowing it was right inside airport. So if you want leave airport area you have to pay toll fee. Therefore anyone picking me up or dropping me off from hotel would have to pay fee. If you need to stay near airport this is a good location but if you want to have restaurants or shops around you or just go for a walk you shouldn't stay here. I felt a confined to the hotel because of the location. Overall hotel was nice and comfortable. The only complaint I had was location and price of snacks and bottle water. Since there is nothing close by you have to pay really high prices for things like a gum or water. If you stay here make sure you stock up.</p></li>

From the rooms - amazing beds, gorgeous decor, excellent business features, plenty of mirrors - to the STAFF! I have to single out my ABOVE AND BEYOND shuttle drivers Alex and Gary who carted me around for three days during some pretty bad weather, always with a smile and great attitude. These types of employees aren't found everywhere, I hope the Hyatt recognizes that and takes good care of them. I work in hospitality, and if I could I would steal the both of them away.

The drinks were a little costly but everything was perfect. Immaculate. Photos attached to show you. I also don't think people calculate all the extras you get when you book at this hotel. Firstly you can choose a rate including full to order breakfast or buffet, whichever you desire included in the rate. The display was incredible. Everything looked and tasted wonderful. They even supplied us with toothpaste. Something I feel is a commonly forgotten item. I would strongly consider this hotel.

Pros: location, friendly staff, very comfy beds, nice amenities, good price. speedy check in and check out. nice decor. nice size room. You can print your boarding passes free at check in/out. Cons: This is a much older hotel....no shower door, so water runs everywhere. We used all our towels cleaning up the water. tiny tiny bathroom, parking garage was scary and dirty. not enough lighting so do no not walk alone. my room was dusty and need a really good cleaning.. the curtains were dirty as was the carpet and chair. Hotel needs a changing room near pool area. very slow internet connection (for a fee) The Grand Hyatt is MUCH nicer and a little more expensive, but its worth it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had to evacuate NYC prior to Hurricane Irene hitting and we were sent to Dallas Texas for our connecting flight to Brisbane. However due to traffic (2 hours in a cab to Newark) we missed our flight from NY to Dallas and had to stay overnight before flying out the next day. After that nightmare we arrived at Dallas Airport with no where to stay. Luckily there were free computers in the arrivals hall and we booked online to stay at the Hyatt Regency. What fabulous service, the best room we stayed in for our whole trip and very quiet. What started out as disaster turned out to be a blessing to have a night and day in Dallas. Your shuttle drivers are fantastic by the way. We took the shuttle bus to Grapevine and spent the day being tourists. Great coffee and nice drinks in the bar before flying home. Thank you.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wow, what a pain in the rear to get from dropping off the car, hauling bags up and down stairs in a parking garage, just to find the walkway over to this run-down hotel. It is badly in need of a face-lift. Everything is just worn and a bit grungy. Not the worst hotel ... but why not just stay at the GRAND Hyatt in the airport instead? At the Regency, to catch a flight in the morning, you have to take a shuttle, which only runs every 20 minutes becuase it's the most retardedly-designed airport on the planet and it takes forever to get to a terminal. This is NOT a hotel where you just walk straight into the airport and catch a plane. They have Mr. G's restaurant, which was fine but didn't knock my socks off. And it should have given their sky-high prices. The Grand Hyatt had better food too and was far less of a pain.</p></li>

<li>Wow, what a pain in the rear to get from dropping off the car, hauling bags up and down stairs in a parking garage, just to find the walkway over to this run-down hotel.</br></br></li>
<li>It is badly in need of a face-lift.</br></br></li>
<li>Everything is just worn and a bit grungy.</br></br></li>
<li>Not the worst <span style="background-color:#fabebe">hotel</span> ... but why not just stay at the GRAND Hyatt in the airport instead?</br></br></li>
<li>At the Regency, to catch a flight in the morning, you have to take a <span style="background-color:#fabebe">shuttle</span>, which only runs every 20 minutes becuase it's the most retardedly-designed airport on the planet and it takes forever to get to a terminal.</br></br></li>
<li>This is NOT a hotel where you just walk straight into the airport and catch a plane.</br></br></li>
<li>They have Mr.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here on an overnight passing through Dallas, arrived late - 9pm. Short queue at check-in, but encountered a trainee so took a little longer than normal - which was surprising, as the booking was made via the Hyatt Gold Passport frequent stayers program. After check-in we grabbed a couple of drinks at the bar and ordered some food. Unfortuanately the both meals were cold on arrival - faulty microwave? : ) Sent them back, same meals returned 10 minutes later 'nuked' - not stylish - advised that we were still not happy, and the manager took the meals and the two drinks off the bill, and offerered a free take away pizza. The hotel seemed to have reasonable faciilties, but as we were leaving early the following morning did not have time to try out the gym and pool etc. Would probably give here another chance if passing through.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The only reason to come here is if you are desperate to stay next to the airport. The rooms are adequate and they have decent meeting space for conferences. I will admit that the conference food (at least lunch) was better than average. The on-site restaurants are ridiculously expensive--literally $60 for a steak or chops. When we looked at the Mister G's steakhouse the maitre d' practically cornered us and was very pushy--insisting we would have a "memorable meal" and asking if we were on expense accounts which I thought was a bit crass. We opted for the less expensive option "Jacob's Spring Grille" which was still way over-priced and mediocre. They know you are trapped there and charge as much as they can for everything.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Got stuck at DFW during the big blizzard last month and got two nights at the Hyatt Regency for $260 a night the week of the Super Bowl. I felt lucky to get any room in town and the Hyatt Regency, while not cheap was certainly a nice hotel. Very much a "business traveller" type hotel, it was clean, spacious, and convenient to Terminal C at the airport. The one bellman seemed to be trying to rip me off saying that no rental cars were available at the airport at all because of the Super Bowl, but I should book a Town Car with a driver (who I think was a friend of his). I called the Hertz at the airport and they delivered a car for me with basically no notice. All in all, considering the circumstances, I could have done worse. The bell guy was irritating, and the hotel bar was pretty expensive. The buffet breakfast was also good, but not cheap.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel surprised me! The exterior looks old and dated, but once inside it's a very modern-style hotel! The check-in staff was great, and the beds were EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE! I only spent a few hours in my room, but I did get a good night's rest. The bar downstairs is really fun. It's a good way to meet people that are travelling as well. The food is okay, though. If you have friends that drive in to meet you, remember to have their parking ticket validated by the concierge to avoid paying the parking fee. If you have a quick overnight layover at DFW, this is a great place to stay. There are airport monitors by the elevators that can track your flight, and it's only a short walk to Concourse C where you can check in for any American Airlines flight, or take the free green shuttle bus called Terminal Link to get to any of the other four terminals.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was only in Dallas for less then 40 hours, but thought the Hyatt DFW was great. The meeting rooms were conveniently located and well appointed. All of the meals were well prepared and very tasty. The banquet meal was especially good and I appreciated being served by well dressed, polite and professional staff . These genterlmen were very attentive and went out of their way to provide a great dining experience. The hotel lobby and guest rooms were contemporary but comfortable and very well appointed. If I had to pick one item that the Hyatt excelled at, it would probably be the prompt , friendly and professional service that they provided from check in, to wait staff and bar service. I hate it when sloppy service ruins the experience, but I rreally appreciate it when the service puts the hotel or resturant over the top. Well done Hyatt DFW staff and management</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">While the Hyatt Regency was built in the late seventies once you step inside it appears brand new. The interior styling could almost be described as "boutique". Customer service and employee attention to detail were unmatched. Fitness center and pool are what you would expect at a five star hotel. Rooms are huge and soundproof. Never knew I was at the airport unless I opened the balcony door. Highway access is great if you are traveling throughout Dallas. But if you only have business in one part of the city the location may not be that convenient. My only complaint would be the the wireless connection. First, it was not complimentary (10.99 per day) nor easy to access with Firefox. I guess since parking is free it was a trade off. I would stay here again and recommend to others. Oh, and the pool is open year round and felt heated to 80 degrees. This is a great Hyatt!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My most recent stay at Hyatt Regency, DFW was the best stay I have had there. Like all other times, this stay was so I could catch an early flight the next morning. Being on the airport premises, it takes very few minutes for the hotel shuttle to arrive at the gate. When making reservations, I paid the rate for a normal "King", but when checking in, I was told that I had been upgraded to a King Deluxe; thus I was Suprised at the size of the room when entering it. the room has a 7 ft. couch and the bed had 5 or 6 pillows on it. Likewise, the bathroom was large. It does not have a tub, but a shower only. the shower stall is the length of a tub and has a stabble plexiglass wall half the length of a tub. This hotel has a restroom on the patio beside the pool which is very convenant for the guest. I have stayed there many times and will continue to do so in the future. GEW</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had to stay one night with my wife and two young daughters so we could catch a flight the next morning. As several reviewers have pointed out the rooms have been renovated and now sport a more modern interior. The rooms were clean, relatively spacious (not large but not cramped) and the new LCDs a nice touch. The beds were some of the best we've slept in while travelling. Sound insulation kept the plane noise outside down and the kids really enjoyed being able to watch the planes take off. Coupled with the super convienent location across from Terminal C and the fact that I was able to get it on hotwire made it a good stay. Only drawback was the hotel restaurant where we ordered the breakfast buffet, which was rather basic given and a tad overpriced at $14 per person (kids are half price or free). But then again when isn't eating at an airport a tad disappointing and overpriced?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I want to say up front that I haven't been to this hotel since June of 2007, but it's important that I let everyone know how hospitable the staff was. You see, I was heading back to Iraq from 2 (much needed) weeks back in the US. I'm glad I chose this hotel. I knew it would be just the place for me to relax and be pampered for a few more days before I headed back to the dust and dirt. Hyatt Regency, you didn't fail me. I expected a quiet stay and that's what I got. Your bar staff was more than happy to make sure what I ordered was to my liking. The room was exceptional, and the bed was one of the most comfortable I had been in. Maybe my opinion is a little biased; I have stayed in a few Hyatt Regencies before, so I knew what to expect, and you guys delivered. I just wanted you to know how much I enjoyed my stay. It made it that much easier to put my uniform and boots back on and head back to Iraq. KUDOS!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the moment I checked in (Tom did a great job helping me become familiar with the facilities and amenities) until I checked out the staff was thoughtful, informative and attentive. The service I received here from every employee I encountered was, without exception, outstanding. The room was well appointed and maintained. The room was also very clean. The wifi service worked well, television was modern and offered a lot of selections. I enjoyed the room service for breakfast twice and was pleased with the selection and of course the service. The only opportunity for improvement was the overall facility appears to be dated and in need of a slight refreshing but is very well maintained and clean. Just older. Overall great space to stay. The location was ideal as it seemed close to all my appointments and of course it was great when it came time for the early morning return flight. I highly recommend this hotel</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are just flying in and out and need a bed to stay or wanting to see Dallas this is a great place to stay, the staff are friendly and helpful and the food it fantastic well worth a visit. The total package starts when you are picked up by the free shuttle bus to take you to the hotel ( our driver was Bill) so helpful talking about the hotel and happy to help with any questions that we asked also remember our names when we came down stair later in the day a great asset to the hotel. As we were staying in a quiet time of the year we also were luck enough to be able to have ala carte breakfast at no added cost very nice. We had dinner at Aces lobby bar both night we stayed it was great we were served by Ron another good employee for the hotel. The food was fantastic. The hotel also has a Starbucks coffee available. So all round we had a great stay, why do you give it a go next time you visit you will no be disappointed.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel through Priceline and got it for $45 a night. I arrived late and it called the hotel from a courtesy phone. It took about ten minutes for the shuttle to arrive. The shuttle driver was friendly. At check in I requested a room facing away from the runway and was accomodated. The room was typical four star quality and had a comfy bed and flat screen HD TV. The only thing I did not like about the room was the shower that was not fully enclosed and let in too much cold air. The restaurant prices were outrageous. Pancakes were thirteen dollars and some dinners were fifty. Bring muffins with you like I did because there is no place else to eat in the area. Although I did not face the runway I did hear some distant runway noise and traffic from the roadway below. Luckily it was pretty quiet from midnight to about five. By the way, parking is free if you get your ticket validated at the front desk and you pay when you leave the airport grounds.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a WONDERFUL Hotel! Located right on the DFW property, it is easy to get to by car, or is right on Terminal C, and is an easy walk. The Staff are EXCELLENT! I did not run into a single staff member that was not professional in every way. They called me by name when I made a phone call to ANY department, and treated me GREAT! ! ! The room was Huge! And it was very comfortable as well. I LOVED the flat panel big screen TV complete with Digital channels. There was an iPod dock, coffee pot, hair dryer, iron and board, easy chair, incredibly comfortable bed, and rolling desk and desk chair. The food was great and I ordered several times from Room service. This service was always quick and very good. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone doing business in the DFW area. Free parking and free tolls in and out of DFW was a nice bonus. I LOVED THIS HOTEL and actually wish I was there right now. You owe it to yourself to give this excellent hotel a try.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed at the Hyatt Regency probably four or five times in the past seven years and once again, it is a winner. It is located at DFW airport which makes it a great location if you have an early flight or a layover at DFW. My son and I were on our way to San Francisco and had a layover at DFW. I called Hotels.com and was able to get a rate of $79/night for two queen beds. The hotel shuttle gets you to and from the airport quickly. The shuttle leaves the hotel for the terminals every 20 minutes, 24 hours a day, which makes it very convenient. Our room was very nice with comfortable beds. The bathroom is set up well with the sink area separate from the bathtub/toilet area, which enables two people to use it at a time. There are a couple of dining options at the hotel which we didn't use. There is also a gift shop area where you can buy sodas and candy as well as gift items. I will plan on staying at the Hyatt Regency DFW next time I need to stay near the airport.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hyatts are usually good bets for a four-star experience, but Hyatt Regency DFW under-performs relative to its peers. The other DFW Hyatt was priced much more highly, though, so this might be a case of getting what you pay for. Check-in was very rapid and efficient, and the entryway area was spacious and clean. Room soundproofing is not impressive, and when planes were taking off or landing the room seemed louder to me than inside the airline terminal. Rooms were good-sized, with a nice bathroom. Towels were lesser quality than expected (I had better towels at La Quinta, the night before). Only one cup each caffeinated & decaffeinated coffee for the in-room coffee unit. The Hyatt stay-fit exercise room is usually a great feature, but the DFW Hyatt Regency's exercise room had older machines, was not nearly as large as at other locations, and didn't have the amenities and ambiance of its peers. 24-hour lobby coffee shop. Walking to the terminal was easy, though signage was poor.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros- The rooms are wonderful, fast elevators, beautiful ball room and meeting space. Unbelievable staff... really fresh young and polite people running the place. This is a lovely hotel. Jacob's Grill is a terrific restaurant... I mean impeccable. Aces bar is a blast. Just know that this is a very unique arrangement. Google map it just to get an idea of where you are.. You are sequestered in an airport terminal. You cannot walk anywhere outdoors. You are in a concrete complex. Just know that. The CON and I seem to run into this in Dallas. Bad wireless connectivity in an airport hotel is a MAJOR CON. This hotel has horrible wireless access in your room. If you need wireless access... stay somewhere else. When I mentioned it to the desk they gave me an awkward device to hook up to my laptop, saying it would improve my connection. No such luck. But..... The ambience and amenities were so terrific... I would love to stay there again... i will just make sure I do not need wireless connectivity next time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband had a conference at the hotel, Tuesday- Sunday. Perfect for flying in for the conf. Each day I went antique shopping. This turned out to be the perfect hub for scouting out Texas Antiques. We also met up with several friends /relatives one evening for dinner at the nearby Gaylord Hotel~( Texas Rangers were on TV....and won). We live on the East coast and this location was just the best for us. I used their dry cleaning service-it was fine. I had a van that I self parked.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">How good can an "airport hotel" really be? Especially one that is acutally IN the airport? The answer in this case is "really good!" For logistics reasons, our team needed to meet in a central location, easy for all of us to get to without a lot of hassle, for a one-day meeting. All of us bemoaned having to go to an airport hotel, just knowing how beaten up many can be. Hyatt Regency DFW was a nice and inexpensive surprise. While it is now the "old maid" of the DFW Hyatt properties (the newer is the Grand Hyatt), the management and ownership has done a good job at keeping up appearances. Rooms were clean and well-appointed. Restaurants and bars all far above-average. The catering (remember, we had a team meeting) was unexpectedly well-done and the food well-prepared and tasty! Given it's location, it is not a "destination" hotel. But, if you need to layover or you have a group meeting like us, there is no need to go outside DFW itself if you want to avoid hassle, transporation costs, etc. Nice job, Hyatt Regency DFW!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here on a layover at DFW. It's a great hotel. The only problem I had was confusion about how to reach the hotel. It is adjacent to, but not in Terminal C. You can either take the hotel shuttle from Terminal C or walk through a series of garages to get to the hotel. I recommend the shuttle as there are several sets of stairs to negotiate if you walk. If you're on the DFW Skylink, you'll need to exit the train at Terminal C - - either stop and then EXIT through security and go to where the hotel shuttles pick you up. The hotel is newly renovated and is very attractive. My room was large, quiet - - soundproofed, and comfortable. The Hyatt Bed is fabulous. I think it's better than the Westin Heavenly Bed or the Marriott Revive Bed. Service was stellar - - everyone was polite, kind and professional. The breakfast buffet in the morning was definitely a step above the usual. Other than having problems finding this hotel at first, I can't think of any negatives. This is a first rate hotel and I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were marooned by our airline for the night, and stayed at the Hyatt Regency. The staff was wonderful! We had to wait in a bit of a check-in line with other airline passengers, and a concierge came around to chat with everyone and to see if we needed anything. He refilled the sippy cups of all of the kids in line (there were a lot of families on my flight), and tried to make everyone smile and laugh in spite of the situation. The front desk and bell staff were so nice, and our room was great. We had to request two pack-n-plays for our sons, and housekeeping brought them to the room and set them up immediately. We gave our kids a bath in the tub, ordered room service, and enjoyed a good night's sleep on high thread count sheets after a long day of travels. We were impressed with every aspect of our night there - these people really know how to pamper weary airline passengers. If you are ever stuck at DFW for the night, the Hyatt Regency is a great choice - practically in the terminal, and willing to roll out the red carpet for just about everyone!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When I read Hyatt Regency, I tend to think of a fairly nice hotel. Not this time. I hooked into this hotel dirt cheap by bidding on Priceline. It's primary focus are business meetings, because of the airport location. The service in the bar was horrendous. My wife and I went in for drinks. There were waiters and waitresses everywhere, emerging from the kitchen with and without food or drinks, wandering around among the tables, ignoring us totally. I tried to get the attention of a number of them. No luck. We were dressed nicely. We have no obvious malformities or diseases. We were sitting quietly and respectfully. Finally, we just went up to the bar, ordered our drinks directly and carried them up to our room. The value of this hotel is that it is right on the airport property. You can drop your rental car off at the rental car center the night before your flight, take the rental car bus to the C terminal, tell the driver you want to get off at the Hyatt, and get dropped of within a very short walk through a parking lot to the hotel. No taxi. No tips. No hassle.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Restful overnight layover”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">While traveling with my wife and young daughter, we had an overnight layover (flight arriving about 11pm and departing 7am). We had to wait maybe 10 minutes for the hotel shuttle, but the driver very graciously offered us small bottles of ice water. Of course we then tipped him, but the gesture was much appreciated after a long day. Our checkin was quick and efficient, and the lobby and public space was contemporary and appealing. We went straight to our room, and were impressed by the room. The beds, bedding, and selection of pillows were upscale and very comfortable. The room seemed recently updated. The bathroom was nice, and included a full set of toiletries, including a travel-sized toothpaste -- an uncommon addition. We were not aware of any airport noise. We slept well, enjoyed the in-room coffee maker, grabbed a free newspaper, and boarded the efficient shuttle back to the airport. All in all, a perfect choice for a good night's sleep on an overnight layover. I would not choose to spend more at the *other* airport hotel for such a brief stay, since the shuttle is so quick and efficient.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Let me be blunt: 1. I had to call the hotel twice to get a shuttle to pick me up from terminal E of the airport. While the operator apologized for â€œforgettingâ€� to tell the driver after the 1st call, waiting at night for 48 minutes to get a 5 minute ride to the hotel is just plain bad service. 2. The outside of building is ugly. Think 1960â€™s, concrete block building. 3. No one at the front door to help with bags or the door. Maybe the shuttle driver could have pitched in and helped out? 4. Watch out, if you have a late flight that lands after midnight, there is no room service and no open restaurant. You have to settle for a day-old muffins and a bottle of water in the 24-hr. coffee bar. 5. The 3 year old â€œrenovatedâ€� rooms tried look trendy but failed in my opinion. This failure is partly due to being small and dark. The trendy furniture seemed shabby or worn. Only 2 good things to report here: 1. The room was quite, I did not hear outside noise in the hallway or from other rooms. 2. Mr. Gâ€™s restaurant. The food is above average (but so is the price) and it has a good drink selection.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I knew that the Grand Hyatt at DFW was the nicer of the two airport Hyatts, so I was worried, but this place is fine. The conference facilities are a good, although I don't think the hotel is used to handling conferences as big as the one I attended - internet would bog down at peak hours, and the group meals were in a strange converted storage room in the bowels of the hotel. My room has spacious and comfortable, although dark - the half-window looked out on a wall of the hotel and the inner courtyard of a parking garage. The hotel bar is comfortable with a good menu, but gets noisy and is too small. You can call for a shuttle from the DFW terminals, but it's just as easy to walk from terminal C, if you're OK with finding your way across a parking garage and going up and down a few half staircases. So - ugly setting, but if you're at a conference, that doesn't matter. I would discourage vacationers from staying here, there's no public transportation to DFW and cab rides are far from anywhere. On the other hand, it would be convenient for overnight if you have an early departure or a late arrival.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Easy stay at the Hyatt Regency DFW”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked a two night stay (March 14-16, 2008) thru priceline for a total of $122 including taxes, in town for a wedding shower. I was concerned about being inside the airport with ease of getting to the hotel and the parking situation (we drove in). We were very pleasantly surprised. The signage within the airport directing you to the Hyatt is very good and they plainly differentiate between the Hyatt Regency (by terminal C-where we stayed) and the Grandy Hyatt at terminal D so there was no confusion there. The parking is also well marked and very convenient to the hotel itself. The hotel was quite busy for a weekend with a large high school convention going on, so I had some concern about noise, but we had no problems. When we checked in I requested a room with a view of the runways so we could watch the planes take off and land. They accomodated us with no problem (even though we'd paid so little thru priceline). There was no plane noise and our room was right by the elevator and we didn't hear anything either night. The room was quite nice and as others said the fitness center was great. We would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hyatt Regency at the Dallas Airport is a great place to spend the night if you need to be directly in the middle of the DFW area. Thoroughly remodeled, the rooms are nicely designed with contemporary furnishings, colors, and comforts. The bathroom is actually quite upscale, with the standard room missing a tub, but featuring a large glass walled shower. The room has a nice big flat screen television, too. I got a good nightâ€™s sleep in this hotel that is well insulated against noise from American Airlines mega hub. The only problems were a long check-in line, which Iâ€™ve found at other airport hotels because flights are cancelled and the passengers pile in, and low frequency buses serving DFW. As an airport hotel in the middle of the airport (but not connected directly to the airport), the buses should run very frequently. Instead the routing means riders have to ride to multiple terminals to get to their flight, using buses that depart the airport only once every thirty minutes. Next time, I might choose to stay at the Grand Hyatt, which is connected directly to the airport, to avoid the buses, but I still appreciated the comfort design of this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First the good features... This hotel is so close to the airport. The interior is lovely. It is modern, sleek and so air conditioned. The pool, with both good and bad features, is clean and maintained well. The bell boys (is that the proper term?) are friendly and helpful. Despite being so close to the runway the rooms are quiet. They are also spacious and clean. Now the bad... They charge you to use the shuttle and the wireless. Both things that the average traveler want to use. The front desk staff is a bit cold and rude. When my keys REPEATEDLY failed to work they did not want to let me into my room, even with ID, as the room was registered in my husband's name. Seriously. They are responsible for the lousy card keys and for knowing who I am as I was right there on check in and they gave me a key at that time. If they wanted my name they could have asked for it. They wanted me to wait for my husband to come back from a meeting to let me in. I got mad and they relented but why make me get mad about it. Then they thought a fruit platter would make it better. The food is marginal in general. The pool has no bar service and is noisy with car overpasses and airplanes.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for one night, as we were coming in from out of town and flying home out of DFW early the next AM. Rooms very spacious and clean. Beds were very comfortable. Bathroom was clean and well appointed. I did have a chance to use the fitness center and it was very clean, had good amount of equipment and plenty of clean towels. We had dinner and drinks in the lounge one night and the food was ok, typical bar food. BUT we had breakfast in the cafe in the AM, did the Breakfast buffett, and it was very good. Lot's of variety and good quality food w/ omelettes to order! Went out on the town that night and the concierge hooked us up with some ideas and free passes and got us a cab there and back. Even though this place is right at the airport, you do not hear any of the jets landing or taking off. I was very impressed with the sound proofing and it made for a great nights sleep! I would recommend this to anyone in town on business or pleasure and wanting a place to stay, very convenient to the airport and needing to fly out on American. If you are flying in or our on another airline, they will give you a free shuttle ride to those terminals, but they are not walking distance.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hyatt Regency (not to be confused with the Grand Hyatt) is across the parking area from DFW (concourse C). There is a shuttle that can take you from and to the other concourses. I was arriving late to DFW and this was a perfect choice. The Hyatt properties ard typically great and this is no exception. Nice lobby, good restaurant (believe called Mister G's), a coffee bar with Starbucks products and a sports bar. The room was great - clean, comfortable, nice sized HD TV. Some of the staff was disappointing. Our reservation was messed up and it took a while to straighten it out and even the next morning they struggled and were not overly helpful. The wait staff in the coffee bar and restaurant were good. I think the bellman steered us wrong with suggestion a car service over a taxi (it was $65 to downtown Fort Worth area and I think that was more than a cab. Anyway, it is recommended if you don't want to leave the airport. Take note: there is not a sign that I could find for the Hyatt Regency and you either need to walk to concourse C - around gate 21 and take a skybridge over (which was a bit dark and may not be recommended) or leave any concourse and catch a shuttle (better option).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel is beautiful inside, very WOW! Hotel staff from valets to front desk are incredibly kind. 2-queen room was comfortable, bathroom was nice size, elevators were fast and quiet. Just 10 minutes north of the airport is Grapevine, TX where there are plenty of restaurants and shopping. There is even a shuttle bus that will come pick you up and bring you back to the hotel. The pool is outdoors and it can be noisy with the planes and cars, but was always well stocked with towels and was fun for the kids. No spa, but the workout room was excellent. The few minor things that I didn't like: 1 - NO FREE INTERNET -it costs $10 a day? Come on! 2 - No guest laundry - I really hate wet swimsuits in the room all night. 3 - Pool is located far across the large lobby from the elevators, so my family of five drip, drip, dripped all over the tile floor. I felt terrible for leaving water drops everywhere especially since there was a formal ball about to begin and we had to walk through the guests. So sorry, we did use towels... just a bad site plan for that particular combination of events. My kids loved waking up and seeing the planes right outside the window and it was a really nice place to stay, but it is almost too fancy for my family!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked the Hyatt Regency DFW through the Hyatt website for a conference at the beginning of August 2011. After traveling for nearly 24 hours and arriving at DFW, we were very happy with the rapid response from the driver who picked us up and got us to the hotel quickly. The check in process was quick and smooth and we received exactly the room that we booked. I will say that I was very surprised with the location as most airport hotels are near the airport; from my room I had a great view of terminal C at DFW - this hotel is AT the airport! With that in mind, the noise level was not bad; although you can hear the aircraft taking off and landing, it was not so loud as to keep us awake. One significant limitation to this airport is the proximity to anything. If you do not have a car, there is little choice in dining options other than the outlets within the hotel which, although good, were quite expensive. There is a shuttle to Grapevine for a fee but we did not use it. I was informed by a staff member that if you needed to use a cab to get in to town, it would cost upwards of $60-$70. All in all, the Hyatt Regency DFW was fine for what we needed and although it is nothing spectacular, we would stay there again. The staff was very professional and we had no negative experiences to report.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Priceline picked the hotel for me and I stayed for one mid-week night during business in the DFW area. My favorite Dallas hotel used to be the Renaissance on Stemmons Fwy, but the Hyatt Regency gives it competition! I used the Hyatt automated check-in kiosk in the lobby, which worked well - albeit slow. It gave me a 4th floor room and when I asked a front desk clerk for a higher floor, she gave me top 13th floor right away. Nice views of the runways towards the west. Room decor is extremely nice; modern, swanky and everything in perfect condition. One of the 2 queen beds had a stain on the sheet, unfortunately - everything else was spotless. Very nice desk and chair. Didn't try the wifi. Had no problem with water pressure, despite the high floor. Had dinner in the lobby restaurant. Great food, good service, a bit pricey - but nothing outrageous when you consider the location. Ordered room service the next morning. It was a few mins early, but accurate and delicious. Central AC was fairly quiet and worked well. Flat screen HDTV with 30+ channels, several in HD. Only bummer was that I couldn't get late checkout since a big group was coming to the hotel. At least the staff was very apologetic about it so it worked out ok. I would definitely return! Sorry for the bad-quality pics from my phone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel recently to attend a college football game. Granted it wasn't that close to many of the main Dallas attractions, it was an upscale hotel and we got a room at a very affordable rate. We enjoyed our stay very much. The hotel looks like it had recently undergone some rennovations, so everything looked very new. The front desk was very kind and accomodating. My favorite part of the hotel was the excellent rooms and very comfortable beds. We had a room on the 11th floor with excellent views of the airport and departing planes. The room was also very nice in the sense that you hardly ever heard the planes taking off, so we got a good night's sleep. I was at first wary of staying at the airport because potential access issues outside of the aiport property. But this really was no problem. By staying at the hotel we got to park for free. Just be aware though that you MUST validate your airport parking ticket with the front desk at the hotel before you leave otherwise you're stuck leaving the airport paying unnecessarily for parking. I would very much recommend this hotel to anyone staying overnight at the airport and would even recommend it to someone looking to stay in the Dallas area longer than just overnight as this is a very nice hotel at a very affordable cost. We'll definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good Renovated Airport Hotel But Not Cheap”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My last review of this hotel was in 2007. The hotel is now completely renovated. Location: Right in the middle of DFW airport but it's not connected to any terminals directly. It's a short walk though to one of the terminals from the parking garage where you can then access Skytrain for the rest of the airport. Free parking included. You can also get the airport tolls validated at the bell desk or the front desk. Service: Good and friendly faces throughout. Rooms: All renovated overall so the quality is good with new furnishings. Room size is good and the bed is comfortable. There is an iPhone dock that serves as an alarm clock. The bathroom does not have a tub but just a large shower. Large flat screen TV is the standard these days. Runway noise was not noticeable. Breakfast: Booked on a corporate rate that included buffet breakfast (normal rate is around $17). Quality is decent. The omelette station does a good job, and the fruit selection was excellent. Cereal selection could have been improved though. Hyatt Place is better in that area. Coffee tasted diluted and poor. Other facilities: Didn't try the pool or the fitness center. There is ample convention space at the basement and a nice bar area. Internet costs money unless your plan includes it, or unless you are an elite Hyatt member. Overall: The hotel is above average but it usually costs over $200 on weekdays so it doesn't come cheap.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good Hotel For Business or Early Morning Flights. No Skylink Here Though.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is well suited for a business traveler that needs to stay near the airport or a family that needs to make an early morning departure from DFW. Don't be confused by the name of the hotel, the DFW Skylink does NOT connect to this hotel. It does connect to the Grand Hyatt which is actually further away from the airport, but made seemingly closer by the Skylink. We walked from the airport to the hotel. It was no problem the path is through the parking structure outside the 'C' Concourse, well lit, well marked, easy walk. In fact, if you are flying in and out of the C Concourse walking to the hotel is probably faster than taking the Skylink to the Grand Hyatt. It appears this hotel has a newly renovated interior. Rooms are modern, clean, and comfortable. Showers and bathrooms are great. I give the restaurant and bar in the lobby good marks. The food was good. The servers were very friendly and tried to accommodate the travelers that came in right at closing time, myself included. I do wish they had late night restaurants as I often arrive in Dallas around 11pm. They do have an all night coffee service in the lobby. You can buy very basic snacks and drinks from an attendee at a register. That's as good as it gets after midnight. It's nice to have airline information digitally displayed in the lobby and there is a complimentary shuttle that will take you back to the airport in the morning.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a beautiful, clean hotel. I was so disappointed in the service. I went to the Hyatt website to book 2 rooms. I chose the sleep, park and fly plan as we had an extremely early flight to Vegas. I made the reservation the night before we got there. When we arrived, we were told that they no longer had that package, but if we wanted we could park in the long term parking and shuttle back to the hotel. Our room rate was $135.00 for hotel and 3 days of parking, the regular toom rate was 109.00. I told them that I made the reservation just the night before on the Hyatt website, I was told that it was a third party website and that they had no control of that website. We asked for a refund, but was told that we couldn't get one because of the third pary website scam they were pulling, the rate was a guaranteed rate so no cancellaltion. The very polite trainee spoke with the manager on duty. They offered to let us pay an additional $75.00 and let us get a parking pass. They would not even give that offer to the other couple. They had to pay the airport parking rate for the trip which was 96.00. I was angry the whole night thinking about what a scam that this hotel was putting on. I have stayed with Hyatt many times and have always enjoyed their hotels and staff, I will stay at other Hyatt Hotels, but not at this one. I did not feel safe there as if the pull this kind of scam, what else would they do?</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Traveling from Reno, NV, to Houston, TX, via DFW Airport was quite the adventure: plane in Reno needed repair before take-off; arriving late at DFW, therefore missing our connecting flight; placed onto a flight (4 hours later at 10:45 p.m.) out of DFW to Houston which ended up being canceled due to "weather," even though we could hear and see other planes taking off; being told American Airlines would, however, provide cots and blankets for those stranded. After re-booking our flight to Houston for the next afternoon we took the airport Skylink to the Grand Hyatt. Their price for a double queen room was almost $200; we asked for any kind of discount, but there wasn't any. So, we took a shuttle to the Hyatt Regency DFW (on airport property but close to a different terminal). What a welcome we received there! Unbelievable. We were given a discount for being stranded on top of a AAA discount, a total of $50 less than the Grand Hyatt, and we were able to have a king room. Tom, the man checking us in, was a breath of fresh air after a very trying day. The hotel was clean, as was our room, and the room was very comfortable. Tom had asked if we wanted a late check-out (2 p.m.) the next day, since our new flight wasn't until 4:00, which we were very happy to take. We were able to have a good night's rest in very quiet, comfortable surroundings. I would recommend staying at this hotel for anyone who is stranded at DFW Airport.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hyatt Regency DFW on our way from Trinidad to Vancouver in April 2010. Prior to our arrival I called in to ask how long in advance I could have a Amazon Package sent to the hotel, since we wanted to buy our own baby crib for our daughter for this trip. The lady on the phone was pretty bothered, it seemed, and the question was not really answered in the end. So I just ordered, and fortunately we received the package just fine. We had a room with a Kingsize Bed, which was really nice and confy. I slept heavenly in that bed, like in all Hyatt beds. We were told upon arrival that there was a heated outside pool on the property, which we wanted to use, since our baby daughter loves dipping in the pool. Unfortunately we had to find out that the water was ice cold and the area around the pool so slippy (no signs nowhere) that I slipped out, with my baby on my arm, and fell badly. The baby wasn't hurt, but it wasn't a nice experience neither. By the way, the highway is right across from the pool... The restaurant on the property serves very nice food. Staff is nice (never met the lady from the phone there). The airport shuttles are operating every 20 minutes, which is good, so they are not too crowded and you always have a chance to get to the airport on time. If I ever have to transit in Dallas again, I would check back into this hotel. I would also recommend it to anybody who has to stay overnight near the airport.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A ROOM WITH A BALCONY”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I selected this hotel not only for the airport location, but to be able to open a door for air. I often wonder how well hotel air filters are being maintained and what size particles the filters are removing. Do not expect a lovely wide balcony with a great view, even if the room is facing a runway. This is not a resort, but having access to air is a rare luxury! Terminal C has a walkway to the Hyatt near door 21. Â Â  Â  At terminal C, as with all terminals, there is a light rail Â (within secure areas) and bus shuttles for Â transferring to other terminals. I understand that the Hyatt does provide shuttles every 20 minutes to other terminals. MY room was comfortable and 'hotel clean'. Decor was not 'WOW', but 'business' acceptable. The bed was comfortable and there was a 'white noise' of surrounding traffic The staff was accommodating. Â WiFI, somewhat unreliable, normally provided for a fee, was offered for free.Â  The only issue that I had with the hotel was the food. Â  Probably because it was Christmas eve, the only restaurant that was open was the lobby bar. The crab cake and salad that I ordered were rather unappetizing and in my opinion very expensive. Â Perhaps if they were more flavorful, I would have considered the prices to be more reasonable. Â Breakfast was better, and the service was Â excellent. In summary, this is not a luxury hotel, but more than acceptable with some excellent attributes. The rate charged for the room was very reasonable Â for a good night's sleep and I would not hesitate to stay here in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There are two Hyatt hotels next to DFW airport, I must admit that I made a mistake booking the Regency (much older looking building) and should have booked the new one â€˜The Grand Hyattâ€™. Although there was nothing majorly wrong with my stay I donâ€™t think I would stay at that hotel again especially if I intended in spending a little extra time using the facilities etc. I found there were a few niggles with the hotel overall such as: - There isnâ€™t a changing room next to the pool so if you wanted to use the pool you have to get changed in the hotel lobby restroom then walk through with your speedoâ€™s on past the bar and restaurant! - Once you have checked out there isnâ€™t anything else to do apart from leave the hotel as you canâ€™t go and have a work out for example in the gym and get all sweaty as there isnâ€™t a changing room there either and nowhere to have a shower! - WiFi â€“ Costâ€™s nearly $15 for 24 hours and is so slow it hardly downloads webpages. Call to complain then had to call a call centre myself to resolve the issue but was still running at 34kpbs.. - Breakfast selection wasnâ€™t brilliant, I managed to have a selection of fruit but that was all. There wasnâ€™t soya milk available. Donâ€™t get me wrong the hotel is nicely appointed throughout and the rooms are spacious with comfortable beds, feather pillows and more importantly quiet AC. However my room was a little dirty in places such as the desk chair was covered in stains, god only knows what though! Check in was really quick as I did this online beforehand so just used my phone on the scanner on arrival. Nice touch!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is for those who enjoy flawless craftsmanship, esoteric pampering, and the finer things in life. My husband and I won this hotel on priceline and were traveling with our 5 month old son. At check-in we were offered a crib which we gladly accepted. Our room was filled with little extras that make your stay comfortable including: aroma therapy "ginger" bath accessories and even toothpaste. The crib was delivered almost immediately, along with a small bottle of shampoo for our baby. Each room has a small balcony; nice to open and receive the breeze or drink your coffee in the morning. The night we stayed the lightning was beautiful to watch. The king size bed was comfortable with down blankets and pillows. We ordered room service for breakfast; the locks & bagels with tomatoes & capers and cream for our in-room coffee. There is a $3.00 and 21% charge added. There was no microwave or fridge and internet was $10 for 24 hours. My only suggestion when staying here is to put your "privacy" card outside when you wake up in the morning. The maid knocked once and then immediately proceeded to enter the room. My husband was in his boxers and I was just out of the shower. Normally, a maid will knock and then listen for an answer but this one just came right in. The next morning we put our privacy card in the key hole and were not disturbed. All-in-all this was a relaxing stay. The pool was a tad on the cold side but the water was clean and there were plenty of towels. The dinner menu was quite high; around $40 average for one person so we didn't get to try that but maybe next time. We would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very close to DFW!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is definetly a nice place......and being newly renovated is a great thing. LOCATION- If you need a hotel near DFW Airport, this is your place. You can't get much closer. It's possible to walk, but the easier solution is the quick shuttle ride. We waited less than 10 minutes before we were at the hotel. (Please note that the GRAND HYATT DFW, also at the airport is on the airport train route and even easier). However, f you have business outside of the airport this would be a very awkward location. SERVICE- Very professional and crisp looking staff. You definetly feel like you are in an upper-tier hotel. However, I think I may have caught them on a bad night when they were very full. There was quite a line at the front desk. And when I called both the phone operator with a question and room service, I had to wait quite a while before someone answered. However I must say, everyone was very friendly and professional. ROOMS- Absolutely beautiful. One of the prettiest and most lush "chain" hotel rooms I have been in. I was very impressed. Very modern, but also warm at the same time. I think have have done up Marriott as far as the level of luxury. Gorgeous color scheme and a huge plasma tv. The bathroom was equally impressivve with beautiful tile work and lovely amenities. Only two small negatives: The towel quality did however seem a bit chincy (too thin) for such a nice room. Also, the bathroom lighting was a bit harsh. BAR- I didn't have time to stop in, but there was a lobby bar that was hopping for sure. It was gorgeously decorated and looked like fun! For an airport hotel, this place is great. Certainly not cheap but you are getting a very nice room.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Excellent weekend value”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was traveling with my family and we needed a convenient place to stay at or near DFW on Saturday. I chose Hyatt Regency based on great weekend rate, the good reviews here and my previous good experience at the Grand Hyatt at Terminal D. The bus service from terminals on arrival was prompt and helpful; took only a few minutes from Terminal D arrivals. Staff was very courteous and prompt. We got a room on request at the 12th floor with great runway views from the narrow balcony (a sure hit with the 2 and 3 year olds). The room had two queen beds and the newly refurbished decor looked great. The beds were very comfortable and we got a great night's sleep. The bathroom shower had great shower head and good bath products; the floors had mosaic tile strips and walls had a nice textured finish; very high-end feel. The TV was an excellent LG LCD panel with plenty of high-def channels (a pet peeve of mine at many 'fake nice' remodels that have flat panels with bad SD signal). We ordered a full room service dinner, and although expensive, the quality of the appetizers and main course was excellent. One of the best room service meals that my wife or I have had. Our rate included a buffet breakfast, including made-to-order omelettes. Breakfast was also of very good quality. The only two negatives of our stay were a 15-minute delay in getting seated for breakfast (plenty of tables but at 10am on Sunday they only had two waiters on duty), and also oddly enough the buffet didn't include any juices so we had to pay $16 for orange and grapefruit juices. In all, the positives far outweighed here. Great stay, will stay again, would definitely recommend for a convenient overnight when at DFW.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Beware of the Hustle”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First lets go over the positives. Excellent location if you want a hotel near the airport. Their airport shuttle runs every 15 minutes. Sound proof windows, so we never heard the planes. Comfy bed. Reasonably priced. Has a bar and restaurant and a pool. Now the not so good part. Let's talk about the shower or lack thereof first. Whoever thought it was a good idea to have a open shower with no door should be fired. Half of the water from our showers ended up on the bathroom floor. We used all our towels cleaning up the pool of water every day. But the most insane thing about this hotel is the way their employees try to hustle their guests. Instead of calling you a cab they will pressure you into taking a car service which just so happens to have three lincolns sitting out front. DO NOT BELIEVE A WORD THE CONCiERGE/DOORMAN TELLS YOU about the car service being the cheaper option. Tell them to shutup and call you a cab. They are clearly in cahoots with thiscar service company and flat out lied to us that the car service was cheaper than the cab. SHAME ON MGMT for allowing this type of behavior. THEN, while we sat in the bar having a drink, we were approached by an older man who said he worked in the hotel restaurant. He tried to pressure us into cancelling our dinner reservations at Pappas Bros claiming it was really far away. THIS IS NOT TRUE. Pappas Bros is 10 miles from the hotel. We eventually had to tell him we were meeting friends there just so he would leave us alone! Extremly unprofessional and annoying. I was disappointed at the dishonesty by the employees. Instead of being helpful and honest with out of towners they preferred the hustle approach. Won't stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great weekend getaway for the price!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We wanted to get out of our comfort zone for Memorial Day weekend but still be close enough to Grandma's where Baby Girl was staying, just in case.... put in "4 stars" on Priceline-Name Your Own Price, and we got a winner! VERY NICE room for half the rack price and staff was VERY FRIENDLY. The rooms are well described in other's reviews so I'll just add two negatives: the bed was made with FLAT SHEETS ONLY (the Hyatt can't afford to use fitted sheets on their highly promoted Hyatt beds?) and the shower was a half-door walk-in SHOWER ONLY (be sure to put down the bath mat!) so taking a bath is not possible. The room was clean, but we were surprised to see our neighbor's room service trays out in the hallway for almost 24 hours. Be sure to try the Bananas Foster for Two at Jacob's Spring Grille - it's huge and delicious, but don't get caught hungry enough to pay $7.50 for a chicken salad sandwich at JETT'S coffee shop! Use the coasters in the vanity area for a free dessert and an upsize Starbuck's to get more bang for your buck. Also, the breakfast buffet was very good (great omelettes and Belgian waffles), but O.J. is an exorbitant extra charge not included in the $15 price. The pool has towel service for a few hours, but once the towels rung out, you have to ask the front desk to send more. Don't forget to have your airport PARKING VOUCHER VALIDATED coming and going and if you have a tolltag, don't use the tolltag entrances - use the "public only" ones, or you'll have to mess with paperwork to get the charges refunded to your tolltag account. All in all, a great local stay in a convenient area to restaurants, shopping, movie theaters, etc. (we know the area though, so this wasn't an issue) and would definitely recommend the hotel for a variety of reasons.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this airport hotel based on price. Having stayed at the Grand Hyatt on our arrival in the US 3 weeks earlier, we were a bit concerned that this might be a disappointing comparison. Not at all. It was an exceptional hotel. Overall, I preferred our experience at this hotel. All of the staff were extremely friendly and went out of their way to be helpful and our room was terrific - large, very comfortable and clean (not as modern and glamorous as the GH, but still a great room) and quiet despite overlooking one of the runways. We ate at Jacobe's Grille for both breakfast and dinner. Breakfast was delicious, but dinner was the real winner! By far the best meal and service during our time in the US. We also grabbed a couple of take away salads from the coffee bar and these too were really good. Our only difficulty was actually getting to the Regency from Terminal A. We figured there would be a shuttle service and that there would be clear signs on how to access it. However we couldn't find signs and being Australian, we had no cell phone connection to call the hotel. We were advised by an Information guy to take an airport bus to a certain point and walk the rest of the way. DON'T DO THIS!! If you haven't organised the shuttle, take a cab. However, the free shuttle is such an excellent service it's a pity not to take advantage of it. I suggest the hotel give clear instructions on how to access the shuttle on their website AND reservation confirmation to avoid the inconvenience we experienced. Despite our shaky start, I would certainly recommend this hotel if you're flying into any of the terminals other than Terminal D. It's hard not to recommend the Grand if you're flying into Terminal D purely for the convenience. But overall, I much preferred our experience at the Hyatt Regency.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the DFW Hyatt Regency, which is located on the DFW airport property, the night before a 6:30a flight. This is an older property that has been completely renovated top to bottom (including bathrooms) and is quite lovely. The room was very clean with flat screen TV. The bath had a walk-in shower type arrangement that you find in the newer hotels. The vanity area was separate with a granite countertop, which was nice. For the ladies, there was a magnifying makeup mirror - always appreciated. No shower caps though. They do provide toothpaste, soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion (I believe it was). There was a large full length mirror in the room and two smaller long mirrors on the closet doors in the vanity area. In our room, there were two electrical outlets on one side of the bed, but none on the other. However there were additional outlets in the desk area, which proved ample. The room was amazingly quiet for being at an airport. We did not hear any plane noise during the night. There was a complimentary shuttle to all of the airport terminals that ran 24 hours a day on the 20's (top of the hour, 20 minutes after and 40 minutes after). Also, free airport parking for nights stayed at the hotel. Just remember to get your parking validated. We had dinner at Jacob's Spring Grille and it was quite good with lovely presentation. May I suggest the crabcakes...excellent! My only two complaints are these: 1. There were two bottles of water in the room (about 16 oz size), for which a charge of $4 per bottle was levied if consumed. 2. There was a $15 per device/per day access fee for computers, i-pads, etc. This is not the place to stay if you are in the DFW area as a tourist, but would highly recommend if you have an overnight layover, an early morning flight, or circumstances that require you to be at the airport.</p></li>
