<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great building, awesome location, excellent service, the Crystal is hard to beat in Montreal. The location is very close to the party atmosphere of Crescent street and shopping/nightlife of St Catherine, but the property itself is a chic and sophisticated retreat when you've had too much of the local scene and want to relax. We especially liked the 12th floor pool/hot tub with a view of the city and Mount Royal. We will be back!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Based largely on Trip Advisor reviews, my husband and I stayed here 3 nights while vacationing in Montreal. Le Crystal is a new, sleek suite hotel in a very convenient location (unless you want to be in Vieux Montreal). We loved the privacy of the bedroom within the suite; the large, well appointed bathroom; and the lovely pool and exercise room. The location was good as well - near a Metro stop, shopping, Mont Royal and restaurants.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We are in Montreal at least 5 times a year and have now stayed at the Crystal at least 5 times now and I love it. Rooms are crisp and clean - very modern. I recommend it highly. Very convenient to Bell Center as well as St Catherine shopping. Breakfast in the hotel is pretty mediocre - but there are a million other places to go. Front desk staff is a little bit of the helpless "not-my-job" variety but the parking/bell desk is quite capable and friendly.</p></li>

I was very disappointed that after my bill of $564.00 was paid in full there was a $917.00 hold on my credit card 5 days after I checked out. I spoke with staff at the front desk who assured me it was my banks issue. After many frustrating phone calls the Hotel Crystal had to fax a letter authorizing the bank to release the funds.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You don't even have to open the door for yourself at this hotel and the lobby smells like flowers. King suite was perfect.

Had a very positive experience and only wished we could have stayed longer to enjoy the pool and outdoor hot tub! Walking distance to shopping on st. Catherine st.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was attending a meeting at the Fairmont and wanted to stay nearby but at a more modern hotel. LE Crystal was perfect! I loved my room design. Bedroom can be closed off from living room area. There was a small modern functional kitchenette for making tea or coffee in the morning. Small table and chairs. Loads of closet space and a good sized bathroom. I'm a big work out fan and the gym was small but functional. Not great, but decent. Hotel is walking distance to great restaurants ( loved Europea) and main shopping area.</p></li>

Beautiful bathroom. There is a little kitchenette. Strange not to have a toaster or regular coffee maker. Awesome expresso maker. Staff was outstanding. I lost my cellphone and two people got on the phone, called the places I had been and left messages of where to call if it was found. It was!

Service is very good. If you have time to try the pool, it is really great and has an amazing view but the last times I went you could not use it if you were in a business trip because of the opening hours Bfast could be a bit long to serve for business travelers. Could be a bit pricy. for business travelers, I would be ready to pay it if I could use the pool when I am back after a long day. Still a very good experience</p></li>

The rooms are not huge but they are adequate and they have all that you need to for a comfortable stay. I was particularly impressed by the bathroom which, for once, has instructions on all taps etc which are intuitive and easy to understand. How many times have you been standing there wondering how to make the shower work only to be hit by a jet of cold water when you least expect it? AT least that doesn't happen here. The restaurant is excellent and good value for what it is.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed in numerous hÃ´tels in MontrÃ©al. This one is top notch. Forget about the Hotels chains or the online supersearches. This is the one you want to check in for a romantic stay or for an all girls night in town or a family stay near the Bell Center for a hockey game (what else). The Blue Lotus aroma in the lobby is divine, the room well designed, the bathroom spa-quality, even the Nespresso machine is delivering quality. The top floor terrasse with whirlpool and view to the city and Mont-Royal is relaxing before more shopping or dining out, any day f the week!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 5 nights from June to July after coming across this hotel on Tripadvisor. Nice property with impeccable cleanliness and responsive staff. Bathrooms great. Front desk helpful. Can't speak to the restauraunt as we didn't eat any meals here. There were many options in the immediate vicinity (going two streets in either direction gives you a nice mix of european (Europea!!!), Ethiopian, Italian, Steakhouse (both high-end and upper-middle), Irish pub etc. Helpful about Jazzfest information. The times we went to the pool/jacuzzi it wasn't mobbed with kids (which was nice).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I initially picked Le Crystal because it had separate sleeping / living quarters but it impressed us in so many other ways, as well. The room also had a great balcony with a view of downtown and the room had great boutique perks. My favourite was the espresso machine for easy delicious coffee any time of day. Also, the room service was amazing and I'd highly recommend the continental breakfast for the fresh french pastries. The pool was fun for our daughter and they even had some pool toys and lifejackets for kids of all sizes. All in all, we'd stay there again in a heartbeat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I usually stay at the Queen Elizabeth when I am in Montreal, but I had to use some Hotwire credits before they expired. I got this hotel for around 180 with taxes, it was rated 4 1/2* on Hotwire. The rooms are large and the beds are very comfortable. There is a mini kitchen in the rooms. My only complaints would regard the noise coming from RenÃ©-LÃ©vesque blvd that can be quite disturbing. At check out, the morning bellboy, half asleep, wouldn't help us with our 5 suitcases, I wasn't happy. Fortunately, the man in charge of the front desk realized the situation and helped us. He got the tip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Although I have stayed at many hotels around the globe, I am very impressed with this hotel. Indeed, we stayed during the November 20th weekend when the hotel was at 100% capacity (big professionnal football and hockey games) and the service and cleanliness of the room were excellent. We had requested a few items before our arrival (crib and bathrobes for the kids) and everything was delivered as requested. Also, for anyone going to a sporting (we went the the Montreal Canadiens game) or concert event at the Bell centre, this is the place to stay at. The walk back to the hotel was less than a minute away.</p></li>

Bathroom is large with excellent rain shower and twin sinks.The main shopping street, St Catherine Street, is at the end of the road and the subway/train station and underground city all within 5 minutes walk.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I along with a group of 20 family members stayed at Hotel Le Crystal for two nights in early July. The place was just beautiful and what a great location! All 20 of us occupied nearly one floor of this luxurious hotel. The rooms were all suites and were amazing, with a large bedroom, separate living/dining area and a good sized bathroom complete with shower stall and separate bath tub. The hotel is very new and has a great, modern feel to it. They even had fancy coffee machines in each room that tape coffee capsules. Staff was also friendly and helpful. Great place, will definitely stay there again.</p></li>

Useful mobile phone app (you can call the room service from your Iphone, how cool's that?) I liked the hot tub (cool view when it's dark and very very cold). Not so good dinner in their restaurant. The room cleaning threw away some empty shopping bags which weren't supposed to be removed (I had the receipts in them which I still needed). I recommend the parking garage under the hotel next to Crystal (cheaper). I don't recommend the parking lot en-face (the one who runs it is an imbecile) I recommend this hotel.</p></li>

The staff at the hotel were fantastic and sorted everything out with no fuss. They let us into our room early and we were able to have a late checkout too. Nothing seemed to much to ask! The room we had was superb - great little kitchenette and very clean, spacious bathroom. Great beds and linen. Cannot fault this hotel - brilliant location - just a few minutes away from main shopping street and lovely bars and restaurants. Highly recommended. Would return again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed at. Value is exceptional. I had a 1-bedroom suite for the same price as a standard room at the Sheraton a block away; less if you factor in that internet is included. The suite feels like a small apartment. In fact it is a condo-hotel, and you can purchase a suite here to call your own. Rooftop pool is nice. One glitch is I had to wait 15 minutes in line to check in, but after seeing the room (which has a kitchenette and a bathroom the size of a small hotel room), all was forgiven. You will not be disappointed if you stay here... it is reasonably well located on the edge of the CBD, quite luxurious, and very comfortable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a beautiful hotel in the heart of downtown Montreal. Steps to shopping and many restaurants. Staff was very friendly, we arrived at noon and they let us have our room right away, which was appreciated. The room was immaculate. The little kitchen area was convenient and beautiful, grantie countertops, equipped with microwave, stove, sink, coffee/espresso/cappucino machine. The bedroom was a separate room, closed off from the rest of the suite with sliding doors. The living area was nice and spacious as was the balcony, furnished with tables and chairs to sit outside. Bathroom was beautiful but didn't have a bath tub, just a large shower. Would definitely stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One of the things that caught my eye about this hotel was the the modern look and especially the soaking tubs in the picture on the expedia web site. I called the hotel to confirm that all of the rooms had soaking tubs and the lady on the phone confirmed they did. When we arrived in our room, no soaking tub. The hotel did change to a room with a soaking tub, but not even close to the one on the picture! False advertising. The rooms are ok, the toilet has been broken for 3 days and running non-stop, even after i called front desk and told them to fix it. The hotel is nicely situated in the downtown area, close shops, metro and restaurants. The staff is great, very friendly and helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I took our three kids (14, 10 and 4) to Montreal, and stayed in a suite in the Crystal. The room was really big, very pretty, with huge windows that made it seem even more spacious. Plenty of drawers and closets so that we could unpack. A nice kitchenette and space for eating. The pool was nice, as was the outdoor hot tub. The location was quite good ... too far to walk to the Old City, but just a few blocks from a nice area of Montreal with restaurants, the art museum, etc. It is also near two or three metro stations, although the very closest station is on a very seedy block. But we just used the other stations after learning this. The staff was very helpful and friendly. Excellent stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was great! It's beautiful from the outside and the room and bathroom were both large. The bathroom had a glass standing shower and a jacuzzi tub next to it with designer toiletries. The kitchenette came equipped with everything (except a wine opener!) including a nespresso machine- which we used every morning. The hotel is right behind rue catherine and nearby many clubs/bars and shopping areas. It's also 2 blocks away from a BIXI station. We went for our honeymoon and received a small welcome note and small gift in our room which was very lovely. Would definitely recommend this hotel. There was also a lovely outside area in the back of the hotel with furniture. For us- it was worth every penny!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is the most magnificent property, the BEST location and the service is extraordinaire. Walk to St. Catherine and Crescent St, the Bell Center or arrange for the Bellman to take you to "Old Montreal." It just doesn't get any more convenient. The nightlife, no taxi needed. The fabulous restaurants, no taxi needed. Sporting events, across the street. Concerts, I'm sure this is were the "stars'" stay. The accommodations are superb, Internet access is FREE. A beautiful spa, excellent fitness equipment (with a view) and salt water pool and hot tub. The outdoor deck has a view of Mont Royal and the setting sun, BYOB. You can't go wrong at the Crystal, I wish they'd franchise so I could stay at them worldwide.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I took my 3 children (ages 18, 18 and 9) for a weekend and it was fabulous! Although we looked scruffy from an afternoon spent tree-top trekking and zip-lining at Arbraska Rigaud (fantastic), the hotel staff was very professional and friendly. The bedrooms were a little small but gorgeous. I loved the grand, elegant bathroom. If you like fresh air, request a room with one of the walkout balconies (80 sq ft +). The view might not be good but drinking an espresso from your private machine on your private balcony is pretty good! The saltwater pool was rather cold but refreshing and the valet parking was reasonably priced (C$20, I think). My only complaint was the bed. It was VERY FIRM and I'm used to my Tempurpedic.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 3 nights in August - before our kids (10 and 12) returned to school. The hotel is located across the street from the Bell Centre. It is about a 15 minute to old town. There are plenty of restaurants, shops, and other action within a one-two minute walk from the hotel. The hotel is very clean, has plenty of nice cars in the small parking area, and is located in a new, and fashionable, buiding. Our room was excellent and included a fireplace, sitting area, separate bed room, small kitchen areas, and 2 bathrooms. We started to refer to the room as our 'apartment' in Montreal. The pool is well managed and includes a beautiful outdoor hot tub. If I found a good price on a room on 'Le Crystal' I would run back. Great stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at Le Crystal last winter with my partner for a week around the New-Year period. I can truly say this gem of a hotel really sets the bar high for other hotels in Montreal. From our arrival the staff was extremely helpful, the room was immaculate, very spacious with an excellent bathroom and the Molten Brown toiletries were very much appreciated. Furthermore, the swimming pool and roof-top hot tub really added something special to our stay. The hotel restaurant, La Coupole too was exceptional. Valery at the concierge desk was really helpful giving us advice on restaurants, bars etc... she really knows her stuff. This hotel is very special and deserves the number one ranking on here. Thank you Le Crystal for making our stay so special.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We came with a large group and got 5 rooms for 4 nights. I would have to say, the service was incredible. Not one of the rooms complained about ANYTHING.....trust me, with my group that would have found something. This may not be a family style hotel, but this is the spot for those special weekends when you need to get away. All suites, awesome restaurant with a patio & DJ. Close to everything, shops, bars, night clubs, restaurants, anything you need. Montreal is great, but you better spend the cash and stay at the LeCrystal, its worth it. I give props to the house keeping crew, they had a lot of work and they maintained that place like no other. Thank You Francais (Frank) and the rest of the staff. Hope you will let our roudy bunch come back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 2 nights between Christmas and New Years and picked Le Crystal because we were looking for a boutique hotel. The staff were fabulous but the "suite" we were in was so cramped my wife and I had to turn sideways to pass each other. Also the King bed took up almost the entire bedroom and gave me a nasty scrape below the knee when I bumped into it's heavy wood frame with it's sharp edges. Positives: Great staff. Good location Negatives: Cramped suite, much too small. High price for what you get. Odd bathroom fixtures are hard to operate. Breaksfast was expensive and not very good - go up the street for many breakfast choices that are much better. Montreal has lots of hotels to choose from - I don't thnik we will return to Le Crystal.</p></li>

A great espresso machine, and it made the best espresso ever... yummy.

The hotel is about 1 year old located between St. Catherine's and Renee Levesque across from the Bell Center, great location. The staff was amazing, accomodating, and friendly. My suite had a huge bathroom, stand-up shower, and jet tub, a kitchen area, a little living room area with a swedish foam couch, a microfibre and faux fur throw, a separate bedroom with a swedish foam topped mattress (so comfy), a nice desk, bathrobes, slippers, 2 flatscreen tv's...I could go on. I could live here. The gym was nice and new (slight mildew smell). Hopefully they can keep the price reasonable, up the quality and cleaniness and updates as needed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a great time at this hotel. We let them know it was our anniversary and they upgraded us to a suite. After an embarrassing check in all went well. I am used to booking hotels through other websites which usually just charges you for the trip upfront, and you go to the front desk owing nothing. I however, booked this trip on Montreal's tourism website, and only had a reservation. When I got to the front desk they wanted to charge my card 3x the amount of the hotel room. I was not prepared for that, and had to move some funds around to be able to stay here. Like I said, very embarrassing. But the girl was sweet and nice, and they took care of it. Oh and if you go in the winter time, do not pay for parking in the street or in a lot. There is tons of free parking!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's not a bad hotel to be honest. But the receptionists lack the charm and organisational skills you might hope for a property in this price range. The rooms are spacious and well equipped. You just have to get passed check-in.. After I arrived early, I was told my room would not be ready until 12.30pm. FIne. The website said 3pm, so I re-arranged my plans and returned at the appointed hour. I was then told the room would not be ready until 3pm "as you know". I didn't protest and an apology was't on offer. However, I did look inconvenienced, so one of them started to find one. She was impressive: I have never seen anyone rattle off so many different forms of the negative without reference to a thesaurus. Finally, "You're lucky, I've found you one.". Computer said yes.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Convenient location: From the airport, take the 747 express bus for $8.00 (bus only takes cash or purchase a ticket from the vending machine at the airport); bus stop is at Drummond which is a stone's throw from the hotel. Plus, the $8.00 fare allows you to ride the local transit for 24 hrs at no extra cost. The hotel is close to the main shopping district, within walking distance, and close proximity to the tour buses to Quebec City etc. Service: excellent service, very friendly staff, bilingual, eager to help, appreciated my feeble attemps at French. Room was properly cleaned. If I were to nitpick, small things would have made the facilities perfect (shower cap, extra bars of soap would have been welcome). I recommend this hotel highly. Best I have stayed in to date.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is amazing. The staff is so friendly. We were able to check into our hotel at 11am instead of 3pm which was amazing because we drove from 7 hours away and were faster than what we had expected. We were in our rooom for about an hour and the front desk called to advise there was a plumbing issue in our room and we had to be moved but that we were going to be upgraded to a larger suite with no extra charge. After they came and helped us move all of our luggage and we were in our new room for a couple of hours, they sent up a tray of fruit and cheeses. Absolutely amazing. The hotel rooms are beautiful. The rain shower and bath are amazing. The outside hot tub is breathtaking and the pool is beautiful too. The atmosphere is just unbelievable and I can't say enough about this hotel!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My sister and I took our kids to the hotel for march break. This hotel is absolutely incredible. We had the superior room. Great city view. The beds are so comfortable the kids slept in to 11am every day. The pool was fantastic and clean. Life guard on duty. Gym had the highest end treadmills I've ever seen. The cleaning ladies just left us extra towels without asking. The pool also has towels. Hot tub is outside with space heaters so youre not cold going in and out. Same block as the bell centre and one block from St. Catherines street. The staff were really incredible. So polite and informative. We asked for restaurants to go to and they new the best ones, I asked for hockey tickets and they got them for me in my price bracket. Such a fantastic time. I will always stay at le crystal when I go to Montreal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went to Montreal for a long weekend without children. Hotel Le Crystal is in an excellent location - convenient to fantastic restaurants, Old Montreal and shopping. The hotel offers valet parking, which was helpful since we drove to Montreal. We stayed in a junior suite - small bedroom, small living room, galley kitchen. The decor was minimalist - clean, but not sumptuous. The bathroom was large, but not elegant. However, the shower was great. Hotel Le Crystal has two problems - the food and the spa. Service and staff are extremely attentive, but the food was the worst that we had in the city. Also, at least when we were there, the spa treatments are a waste of money. The young girls are friendly and talkative, but the massage left much to be desired. If we were to go to Montreal again, we would choose a different hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent a girls weekend there and we stayed in a Deluxe Room. The location of this hotel can't be beat. It's in the heart of downtown Montreal within walking distance to restaurants, shops, clubs... etc. It's very beautifully decorated and very secure as you can't use the elevator without a programmed key card. The rooms are very big and the beds are very comfortable. There is an espresso maker, a kettle, a microwave and utensils in the room. The staff was courteous and friendly and check-in was a breeze. They also offer complimentary coffee or tea in the lobby should you arrive early and have to wait for your room. The spa has amazing services and a very relaxing atmosphere. There's also a rooftop hot tub with an amazing view of the city. Although the hotel is pricey, you definately get what you pay for. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here because the price, based on what you get at the Fairmont, Queen Elizabeth, was hard to beat AND because of the reviews on Trip Advisor and the pics (on the hotel's site). We were glad we did! The hotel is only a couple of years old and the rooms and decor were very modern. More importantly, the bed was great!! We also loved the location and the pool. I would have given it a 5 except that I am a bit of a neat freak and did not feel the bathroom was quite clean enough. Also, the coffee in our room was not replenished without us asking on our third day there, and we had to ask for a second pair of slippers (only one was provided). Other than that, a beautiful place to stay, especially if you want a nice room for a very good price; we had a deluxe room which was a suite and the price was only $200 per night. Hard to beat!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our recent stay at the le Crystal Hotel was very enjoyable... the room was comfortable (huge bathroom and indows that opened for fresh air!) and the front desk service was outstanding...extremely helpful and friendly....gave great directions and were very willing to help with any dinner reservations The elevator had issues the weekend we were there and was mildly annoying since we were on the 10th floor but they worked hard to rectify the problem. The 12th floor pool and hot tub could be run better - the staff up there was cold and made you feel unwelcome....also the towels were very small and thin so you really needed two to just dry yourself off. But would highly recommend this hotel - it's in a great location - easy walk to shopping plus the bus stop is right there and the metro is only a couple blocks away as well so very easy to get anywhere.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is modern, shiny and new, with some attractive features. The reception staff were swift, welcoming, and helpful. Iâ€™m not sure if we were given a room upgrade, as the suite/ room was huge! There was a separate living room, and bedroom, a large bath, walk in shower, and generally much better than we expected. There were a couple of annoyances during our stay. Firstly although the room was "cleaned" every day, it was very much a low impact clean, with little effort put into tidying the room like in other hotels, it was a simple make the beds, change the towels job. Our other minor issue was with the friendliness and service in the bar. Despite not being particularly busy, the barman wasnâ€™t welcoming, and made us feel like he was doing us a favour by serving us. Other than that it was a very good hotel, reasonably close to the centre of town, in a wonderful city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent three days at this hotel, and I regret I couldn't stay longer. The reception is in a nice space, very elegant and full of light, and rooms are amazing: the bathrooms are big, not the usual hotel bathrooms in which there is no space, and they have the rain shower that I really love. The city view is interesting and also the fact that the bedroom is in another small room inside the room itself helps you sleeping, because you separate the area in which you work or read a book from the one in which you sleep only; I really appreciated it. Furnitures are modern and I liked the style, neutral tones of gray and beige mixed with glass and wood, they make look the room even more confortable. The hotel has also an amazing spa, a gym and a swimming pool, everything kept with the maximum of cleanliness and order. I recommend this hotel, it is one of the best at which I have ever stayed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of four stayed at Le Crystal this past July and loved it. We had a minor hiccup during check-in in that our room was not ready on time, and had to wait for an extra hour. During this time, we were allowed to use the pool and facilities and due to the incovenience, we got an upgraded suite and free breakfast the next day, which was not very well received and appreciated. The hotel iteslf is gorgeous and the suite was fantastic. It had all the ammenitites we needed/expected and more. The pool is clean and inviting. The balcony area is a little small and it can be tough to get a lounge chair, but the jacuzzi is quite large. This is actually on the twleth floor, which is the top of the hotel, but there are private appartment for about another ten floors above you, so you are not actually on the roof. All in all, it was an extremly pleasant stay and a great start to our holiday.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had an exceptional stay in an executive suite. The exec suite had the feel of a comfortable apartment complete with two full bathrooms (one with tub) well stocked with Molten Brown products , living area with fireplace, full windows on all sides, nice kitchenette (loved the expresso machine!) , a quaint patio, and more. It felt quite spacious and luxurious. Other tidbits : - We had room service which was fantastic (duck breast with sweet potato gnocchi .. mmmm). - The fitness center was way above average : large and with the best equipment. - Beds and linens were heavenly as well - Staff was extremely helpful On a side note : - Some of our traveling companions had a superior suite.... and it was VERY small almost to the point feeling crowded in with too much furniture. Night and day compared to the "executive suite". So if it is within your budget, I highly recommend it over the "superior" .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I travelled to Montreal last April for when the UFC was in town and chose this hotel over Centre Sheraton and Mariott Chateau Champlain where the rest of my friends stayed for similar rates. All I can say was my hotel blew theirs away. Beautiful rooms, nice lighting, all the amenities, big bay windows, a great dual-spout shower (rain shower + side shower) and got a late 3PM checkout at no additional fee. Only complaint is how strict they are about letting people up into your rooms. They make any of your visitors check in at the desk first, and you cannot access the elevators without a room key otherwise. A nice bonus is the baskets of fresh fruit available free by the elevators every day, a good way to start the day right at no additional fee.. Superb location too. Right across from the Bell Centre, and Crescent street so you can crawl back to your room all liquored up. Can't wait to return this December!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wow, I cant say enough about this hotel. Very classy and elegant. The staff were super friendly, infact they even helped me with some extra caricular activities that most wouldnt. The layout of the rooms is very nice and sound proof to all others. Its located right accross the road from the Centre Bell which was the reason for our stay. It is still very central in terms of walking to main shopping area and tons of places to eat all around. It was also grey cup weekend and seen alot of players and management at the hotel who were all just as friendly. We asked for a late check out as our flight wasnt until evening and they had no problem doing that for us as well. This was the nicest room ive stayed in and definetly lives up to its 5 star rating. I would recomend this to anyone and everyone, our group of four was between 28-35 years old and everyone of us couldnt think of one negative thing about this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We selected this hotel based upon location and views on Tripadvisor. This is a great hotel with a terrific location within walking distance to many of the downtown highlights and great restaurants. We had a superior room which was like a small suite with a separate room with a tv and couch. We especially liked the kitchenette with a frig, microwave, plates and silverware-very nice touch along with the Nespresso-type coffee maker. The design of the room is very contemporary with a clean look. The bathroom was large with two sinks and a European type shower with the rain shower head. Great shower with terrific pressure. Had 4 terrific nights slip in the bed which is unusual for me. I'd recommend this property to anyone staying in Montreal. The staff provided excellent customer service. Excellent attention to detail at this hotel. The parking fee was $18.00 a day so figure that into the cost if you are staying there with a car.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel is right near the Bell Centre and Crescent Street and is centrally located to many of the major office towers in downtown Montreal. Attention to detail and level of service was exceptional. The European "green" features for energy efficiency and comfort were not only interesting but highly functional. Upon arrival and without request, I was upgraded to a corner suite which was extremely spacious and well equiped for a business trip with an ample size desk and ease of connection to internet. Faxes that came in were promptly brought to the room by hotel staff. Considering the time of year for travelling the hotel was a very welcoming place to return to after a business day. Staff are knowledgable about restaurant recommendations and travel times. The only negative is the busness cenre is in the heart of the lobby and does not offer much privacy and can be distracting because fo noise. On the whole it was a great hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at the hotel in the late afternoon. We got a very nice room. It was very clean (which i find very important) and the kitchen gave it a more homey feeling. The room was a very good size. The bathroom was well-equipped and had everything you can think of. The staff was friendly and switched over to English when needed. There are a few good restaurants across the street and it's just a little walk to the big shopping area. There is also a metro-station very close by. I have nothing bad to say about our stay in this hotel and i would recommend it to my friends. It was great! We ordered food from the restaurant a few times and that was good too. The breakfast is not complementary but they do have a restaurant where you can use your breakfast without leaving the hotel. You can also bring stuff to the room and have your breakfast there, there are plates and cutlery in the room. Again, nothing but good things about this place!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My 21 year old son and I chose this hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday. We were torn between the Queen Elizabeth and this but when read the reviews about the QE being worn, we went with a 2 year old hotel instead. We couldnt have been happier. The rooms are suites and we had a small kitchen, desk, table with 4 chairs, couch and 2 chairs with TV and then a king sized bed room with a sliding door for privacey. It was the perfect suite for the three of us as the couch was a pull out. The bathroom was large and clean and the location downtown was 2 blocks from shopping and Crescant street wich is a big restaurant/nighttime spot. We really liked the desk with large hot tub and the pool was terrific. Small work out room but adequate. We loved the fresh apples each day and the staff was very pleasant. We asked for a room on a higher floor and they accomodated and it was very quiet. Really great experience and would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel and room was impeccable - great style, clean, chic, and functional. I actually stayed here twice in early 2008 and loved it both times. Cleanliness: absolutely spotless everywhere, including the gym (which was great by the way since it had a great view and state of the art machines). Service: polite and courteous from the front desk to the bellboy. Location: located right in the downtown core so it was easy to walk everywhere, from St. Catherine's St to the Bell Center (which was just right across the street!). Value: expensive but worth every penny as the rooms were just wonderful and so comfortable and stylish. Bathrobes were a great touch! Rooms: as I've said again and again, they were just fantastic. I have never stayed at a nicer hotel and I've stayed at my share of Fairmonts and equivalent hotels. Overall: Would return again and again and recommend it to everyone - just make sure you're willing to take a hit in the wallet!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Forgot to write this review until now. Traveled to Montreal for the first time last summer and stayed for 4 nights at the Le Crystal. Should have stayed much, much longer! The hotel is centrally located so you can walk to Mt. Royal or to Old Montreal. Everyone at the hotel was gracious and accommodating, from the front desk to room service. Room was well appointed and very comfortable. We had a suite with a separate bedroom. Bathroom was spacious - only minor complaints - there was a huge support pillar in the bath in a bit of an awkward spot (I banged my head on it). Also the area under the sink wasn't swept well - my husband cut his foot on some glass from a previous guest. Had this been the US we would have been comped and they would have been mortified. All this hotel did was ask if we needed a bandaid (smile). But, since it was a minor cut, we did not let it overshadow what was really a marvelous trip and experience. I would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I took a road trip from Fitchburg MA. to Montreal for July 4th weekend. It took about 6.5 hrs to drive there. We couldn't have been happier with this hotel choice! The lobby was stunning. The staff was very helpful with booking restaurants and reccomending night life. If you want a special dining experiance have the Chefs choice at" Toque".. You wont forget it!! Ok- more about this hotel.. I loved the room decor modern and comfotable.. I loved the living room space that included a flat screen tv. The bar and the choices of coffee in the room. The bathroom was huge it had a jetted tub and two sink vanity along with a glass stand up shower. We had to check out the outdoor jacuzz which was located on the 20th floor(I think). We ate breakfast at the upstairs dining area every a.m. This hotel is walking distance from St. Catherine st. and plenty of shopping. I give this hotel a 4-5 star!! Can't wait to go back!!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is the best hotel in Montreal! The service, the rooms, the Spa and the salted pool in the 12th floor are amazing. We arrived on a Friday afternoon to spend the weekend in beautiful Montreal. One week before the arrival my wife called the hotel Concierge to ask for a reservation at the Europea Restaurant (very close to the hotel). The concierge obliged and the reservation was ready for that Friday. The room assigned to us was big and clean; the big bathroom had everything; the staff is as friendly as you can have anywhere in the world. The location of Le Crystal is unmatched: metro line, banks, shopping, restaurants, parks and plazas all are at a walking distance; even, Old Montreal can be reached by a 15 minutes walk. The only complain I have is the lack a good bar in the hotel. I have been in the nearby Sheraton hotel (no match to Le Crystal) and I enjoy the bar in the lobby. I really think that a bar in the lobby of Le Crystal will add to the great assets of the hotel</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We like boutique hotels and Montreal offers a lot of good choices but we tried Le Crystal because of the kitchenette with the expresso machine which we wanted for early morning risings. The standard deluxe suite was very comfortable and offers more room than many boutique hotels. The bathroom was very roomy. We found our suite clean and quiet. Lots of extras like robes, slippers, umbrella, bathroom amenities, flat screen tv, ipod playing alarm clock. Wireless internet access is complementary. The downtown location was great for our interests and needs, although a first time visitor may prefer a Vieux Montreal location. We also tried La Coupole, both the restaurant for lunch and the bar after dinner. Lunch was very good and the bar was comfortable with good service. Used the gym and enjoyed the view from the 12th floor. The outdoor hot tub looked like it would be great. Service throughout was very good. We had no complaints at all and the price at $200 per night was good value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We are from Montreal originally and have now stayed at the Crystal 3 times when back to visit friends and family. The location is great... a short block to Ste Catherine street and easy to get on the highway when it's time to go. And if you're there for a hockey game you're right across the street from the Bell Centre. The main reason we stay is the fact that the hotel is all suites. When we have one of our daughters with us we can go to bed and she can stay up as late as she likes using the free internet or watching TV. Much handier than a regular hotel room. The suites are modern and the bathrooms large. I need to have internet access and it's free and fast plus having the kitchenette and coffee at hand means not having to leave the room until after a couple of espressos in the morning. We've always been checked in and out quickly and efficiently and parking is right next door so it's easy to get to your car or have the valet retrieve it. We'll be back next time we need to overnight in Montreal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were visiting for a hockey game at the Bell Centre. The location was perfect. The Service was excellent. Extra Umbrella's for the rain. Robes and Slippers in the Room. Every kind of Toiletry product you could imagine. Fluffy pillows and a throw on the sofa. The best hotel sofa that I have sat on. They are usually so uncomfortable. The Espresso Machine was a really nice touch as well. Our really sweet maid Karen, got us cream from the kitchen on her lunch break for the coffee. I loved the seperate bedroom which stayed nice and dark for sleeping in. The hotel is in walking distance to everything. I don't understand the person that complained about a store. There are several within 100 steps of the hotel. The closest is the esso station, but Shoppers Drug Mart and several other conenience stores are very close. If you like Italina I wasn't sure about the mixed reviews of Il Campari Centro across the street so we walked over to Bishop and ate at Davinci's. It was awesome. Ask for a higher floor to avoid the hockey crowd or club crawler noise.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my first time in Montreal, and I'll definitely be back - hopefully when it is warmer and after I've brushed up on my French (even though EVERYONE speaks English). We stayed at the Le Crystal for four nights. Below are the high points: - Convenient, safe neighborhood - Two blocks from Metro entrance and Bell Center - Twenty-minute walk to Old Montreal - Five-minute walk to get access to Underground City - Ten-minute walk to Musee de Beaux Arts - Gorgeous lobby and accommodations - Very friendly staff (booked tickets to Cirque du Soleil) - Very clean, new workout room with the typical hotel gym equipment - Molton Brown bath products - Excellent housekeeping (provided bottled water everyday) - Free wifi in the rooms which was very reliable and fast - Fresh fruit and newspapers available for guests in the lobby and on every floor - Very useful kitchen (espresso machine, electric tea kettle, microwave, and dishes/utensils) We didn't use the pool or the hot tub, but it seemed like plenty of other guests were loving it. :) I definitely would stay again!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed two days at "Le Crystal". Wonderfull, competent and smiling staff. Fancy but simple design. My brother and I stayed in a Junior suite, the sofa bed is no supplement so go for it! There was a convenient alarm clock/ipod dock/jack to plug our computers and play music. The bathrooms are huge and very clean (with a rain shower), great amenities. The hotel is perfectly located in the city center, litteraly 1 mn walk away from a nice terrace bar and a club and rue Sainte-Catherine. Nice touch: as we where leaving the hotel on the last day of our stay the valet offered us two bottles of water right out of the fridge for our trip out of Montreal. Don't go if you are fan of huge breakfast buffets, the hotel only offers plated breakfast and a small continental buffet, (but the Marriott next door offers one of the biggest buffets in town). Didn't try the restaurants in the hotel. Nice bar and terace inside for an evening buffet. Definitely the best place to find a outdoor hot tub with a great view. Heated exit for the winter, big indoor pool and saunas are a must try if you stay there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just stayed at this magnificent hotel for a long weekend and i was just captivated for every single detail the staff does to make memorable your stay. This * * * * * Property is located in a very special location in the corner of Boul. Rene Leveque and De la Montagne street, the in door pool on the 12th floor is just Perfect with a nice view to the south side of the city, the out door Jacuzzi is located on the same floor with an awesome view of the whole city and the terrace is really big for the nature of the hotel. Talking with other guess i could realize that this resort is very popular for new yorkers and some others guess around the world. The most of the rooms has no balconies, so i made sure i could get one on my reservation process and i just have to say that the view is really stunning compare to others hotels of the competition. The rooms conditions are excellent and very up to date, you can find from a rain shower to a pillow top mattress...its just a plus to stay at this hotel when you are visiting the Gothic City of Montreal. Its just an unbeatable World class quality hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The rooms and the decor will certainly impress any traveller. But the dismal room service, the inability to obtain anything from the front desk or the bellman without having to call 3 or 4 times are appalling. Management keeps replying to comments on this site but the responses let you see that this is not a very experienced team. Probably a great hotel for couples and travellers who are looking for a "nice place" as a base to visit montreal but not a hotel that has processes and tools in place to address the business person's needs without undue effort- The gym is a joke with one useless multi function machine and 4 treadmills- Not really a gym but a typical "exercize room" found in cheaper establishments. The service staff is poorly trained omitting basic things such as carrying a pen when delivering room service and without fail having them ask me for one to have me sign the bill. Small details a poor reflection on the establishment- Needless to mention the cheap latex foam put on each mattress as a cheap replacement to a real pillow top like in better establishment. The folks in this place have not realized yet that 10% of the population is allergic to latex....</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent five days at Le Crystal in July and after reviewing the web site were expecting a comfortable suite with amenities. But we did not expect the sheer pleasure of the quality of this hotel. A beautiful spacious room with separate king bedroom, enormous bath with soaking tub and separate shower, twin sinks, storage well beyond what we have ever seen in a hotel, Nepresso machine which delighted us every morning, the wonderful pool and spa. A joy to return to each evening after exploring the delights of Montreal. But what made this hotel even better was the quality of the staff, cheerful, pleasant and helpful without being cloying. Everyone we met: the desk staff, valets, the waitress at breakfast, the pool staff and especially our concierge. The staff should be commended. On another note: we finished our visit with dinner at Europee, truly an experience with an endless series of desserts. But we also delighted in a little restaurant around the corner on Crescent, Bistro le The au Logis, with a wonderful choice of teas and fresh, beautifully prepared, Korean specialities well adapted to Western tastes. Charming service, an elegant chef and her son, intriguing art work. A delight!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Firstly, I can easily recommend this property. It is an all suite property for a price that would get you a nice room at similar hotels in the city. The suite we stayed in reminded me of a nice executive corporate apartment, which I believe the developer was selling within the higher floors of this building. Several days prior to arrival, I called to request dinner reservations, including a late reservation for Au Pied de Cochon. They pulled through, which I really appreciated. An unfortunate event during our stay was out of the hotel's control. The city has a planned water shut off, which interfered with our ability to get ready in the morning. It seemed like it took hours for the rusty water to clear out of the system. But it did give me an additional appreciation of the very large bathroom with a large separate enclosed shower and top notch hardware. Toiletries were very high quality. I wish the management had been of greater assistance. All they offered were two small bottles of their house label water. Lunch downstairs was a good bargain, but was of just okay quality. Location is on de la Montagne, but seemed to be a little on the edge of the most desirable segment of this street.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We changed our reservation to Le Crystal at the last minute, when we heard that Montreal would be over 30 degrees C during our visit. For this reason, the rooftop pool and hot tub were perfect and we were very pleased that we stayed here. The room layouts are attempting to mimic a suite, and while it is nice to have the small fridge and sink, the rooms are quite choppy and broken up, with a very narrow bedroom. One thing I was disappointed in was the bedding - polyester comforters and plasticky mattress covers just don't cut it in a nice hotel these days! That being said, we were very happy with the location which offered us good access to points both north and south. There is a metro station nearby, bus routes to/from the airport, and the major shopping and nightlife areas are easily walkable. There are lots of great areas in Montreal so it can be tough to make a decision on a hotel... Take note that some of the top-rated hotels on trip advisor are on VERY busy streets, so beware - if you're looking for some peace and quite, be careful about properties on St-Denis or in the heart of Old Montreal. PS - if you like Polish food, you MUST check out Stash Cafe in Old Montreal. Simply fabulous.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was a great find! All rooms are suites, and packed full of amenities! A large bathroom with separate (and large) tub/shower, kitchen area with small dining room table, nice dishes and real silverware! Had an expresso maker in the room with nice selection of coffees, full size hot water pitcher for making tea (again, very nice selection). Multiple TVs including one at the foot of the bed. The hotel restaurant was a great choice for breakfast...highly recommend the french toast or banana crepes! Hotel staff was very pleasant, fluent in english, helpful with directions and suggestions for nearby attractions! Bell Centre is one block away if you would like to see the Montreal Canadiens...a block in the other direction you will find Ste. Catherine's street...where all the people and action is late at night, and it's very safe to walk around. It's a great hotel for business or couples! We were there to celebrate a special wedding anniversary and were very surprised to find a bottle of champaign on ice waiting in our hotel room after the hockey game, compliments of the hotel staff! The hotel made for a very memorable trip and I don't think you'll be disappointed if you chose this location!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my second stay at Hotel Le Crystal, both occasions for a girls' office weekend Christmas party in Montreal. It really is a gorgeous hotel, from the huge globular crystal chandeliers in the lobby to the roof top hot tub with a view of the city. One small drawback for a girls' weekend is that none of the rooms (all are suites) have two beds if you would rather not share, but there is a sofa bed in the living room area and the bathrooms are spacious, with a regular shower head as well as a rain one. The kitchenette has a microwave, kettle, espresso machine (coffee capsule style) as well as cutlery, dishes and a mini fridge, along with an assortment of tea bags. The WiFi is free, and the front desk staff are very friendly - every time I walked by, at least one would make eye contact and smile. The location is excellent as well, two blocks from St. Catharine's St. (and Ogilvy's!), surrounded by countless cafes, restaurants and shops and a five minute walk to two metro stations, Peel and Lucien l'Allier. We booked with their "Autumn Package", in which they give you a 50% discount on the second night, as well as a welcome package with coupons and a bottle of Fruits and Passions moisturizer. A very comfortable, cozy but chic hotel, I really enjoyed my stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Le Crystal in Montreal for our first getaway as a couple. The hotel was in the perfect location within walking distance to many restaurants, bars and shops. Our suite was bit small, but still had all of the amenities...kitchen, sofa, etc.. and was beautifully decorated. I was delighted to see that the hotel provided Molton Brown toiletries!! The bathroom was large in comparison to the scale of everything else in the room. Great shower! The pool and gym area were really nice. I can't remember what floor they were on, but somewhere in the middle of the hotel/condo building. I believe the condos were all the floors above and hotel floors were all below. At any rate, the pool area also included a terrace with a hot tub and the most amazing views of Mt. Royale and the city below. Although we took a peek during the daytime, we actually went back after a long day and took advantage of the hot tub and view one evening and it was even more amazing at night! We had brunch in the restaurant at the hotel and the food was delicious. But, it was way overpriced. There were so many great restaurants nearby we were left wishing we had opted for one of those instead to save a few dollars. Oh well. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel. We are planning to go back to Montreal and would stay here again in a heartbeat!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'm not 100% clear how the TripAdvisor rankings work, but I'm sure the equation takes into account the overall number of reviews. Being only 1 year old, Le Crystal must not have enough overall reviews, because make no mistake about it, this is THE nicest hotel in the city! I travel to Montreal at least 3 times/year and have been doing so for several years. I have yet to stay in the same hotel twice, just because there has always been room for improvement. That is, until now. All the previous reviews are right on: the highest quality bed and linens you will experience anywhere, exceptional service, high class furnishings, a bathroom to die for, and the quietest suites ever. Even the doors to each suite are quiet- slow closing, and completely sealed so absolutely no hallway noise gets through. The pool and hot tub area are beautiful. The location is central. Perfect. The only issue may be the price; there are other nice hotels around (although not as nice) such as the Gault, Germain (although in need of some updating) and the Loews up the street. I managed a decent price on skyauction, but they will have to try to stay competitive price wise. If you can afford it, well go for it! (just make sure you take the Metro and walk and explore the Plateau/Mont Royal area and not just spend your time downtown). La Colombe on Duluth- small French Bistro worth the trip to Montreal in itself!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I just spent three nights at this wonderful hotel. We had a spacious suite (non-fireplace, non-balcony suite). We really enjoyed having 2 TVs so I could stay up late and unwind out in the living area while my wife slept in the bedroom area. The hotel staff was all very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the rain-head shower and the soaking tub. The expresso machine was a nice touch and the mini-bar fridge had enough room to put leftovers in it for a later heat-up in the in-room microwave. Everything still had the new-feel about it in the hotel. The pool and hot tub seemed to always be busy during our stay. It would have been nicer for them to stay open a little later into the evening. The only negative at all was the temperature in the room. The air conditioning claimed it would go down to 18 degrees celsius which would be about 64 degrees fahrenheit. It never got that cool, especially in the bedroom. At night we opened the two large windows in the living room but because of the bed being behind a wall, the breeze never really hit us and made sleeping a little too warm for us. We're the type that wouldn't mike seeing our breath when we sleep so it was a little tough on us. Only other thing that caused me to leave one point off on cleanliness was a bottlecap that stayed in the same spot in the hallway for our entire stay which made us think they weren't cleaning the carpets in the halls.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is one of the best EVER! My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in May and it was the best experience ever. The staff was very nice and very attentive. Our every questions and every concern was addressed. The rooms are great. We were upgraded from the urban suite to the Superior suite without even asking. The bathroom was huge, with a large shower and jack/jill sinks. It was great to have the separate living and bedroom area. Speaking of the bedroom, the bed was better than the Ritz of any other place we ever stayed. It's a pillow top mattress with very soft sheets and great pillows. The Jacuzzi on the deck and the indoor pool are great places to relax before dinner after all the sightseeing and walking around. It is a very expensive hotel, but we got a great deal through Hotwire. The hotel is located on the English speaking side, walking distance to the Old Towne, the Basilica, the underground malls, bars and clubs. There is a great Irish bar across the street, The Old Orchid. If you are in the mood for an authentic French meal, Chez La MÃ¨re Michel, is a great restaurant. The food was delicious and the service was great. It's our family owned restaurant and our waiter, Marc, has worked there for years. Don't go to Globe restaurant regardless of what anyone tells you. The service is the worst you'll ever get, not worth the atmosphere or the money. If you go to Montreal, Hotel Le Crystal is a must!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went to Montreal for a long weekend with 2 children. Hotel Le Crystal is in an excellent location - convenient to fantastic restaurants, Old Montreal and shopping. The hotel offers valet parking, which was helpful since we drove to Montreal. We stayed in a Deluxe suite - small bedroom, small living room, galley kitchen and a balcony. We wanted a suite for our two kids (10 &12) to share the sofa bed and for my wife and I to have a private bedroom. That worked out fine. The decor was minimalist - clean, but not sumptuous. The bathroom not too small, and not elegant. The sinks did not drain properly (we called maintenance, but they still worked poorly). The balcony is a cement stoop with uncomfortable furniture. However, the shower was great. Service and staff are extremely attentive, but our room was not ready (it took about two hours after it was promised). They comped our parking which was acceptable to us. Hotel parking is $26/day. The open, unsecured lot across the street is $8/day. The concierge was EXCELLENT - he gave us great restaurants except one. Eat at: Beaver Hall, Irish Embassy; Winston Churchill; Eggspectations, Pain Diore. Skip Trinity (Greek seafood - over priced, too loud). Valet and front desk were also attentive. Overall our experience was fine, we were expecting a five star hotel and Le Crystal is 4 at best. It is not worth $289/night which is what we paid. If we were to go to Montreal again, we would choose a different hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am from Miami. I spent hours researching Montreal hotels before settling on the Crystal because it had a fireplace. It had that and so much more. The hotel itself was spectacular, the room ridiculously amazing, from the kitchen where I could cook small meals and make espresso, the giant soaking tub, the floor to ceiling windows, the fireplace, balcony, to small details like the turndown service with the next day's tempurature printed and the great toiletries. I could walk everywhere to great boutiques, pubs and restaurants, caught a hockey game across the street (and all of the players were staying at our hotel which made the elevator rides fun), had a guided tour pick me right up from the hotel, and was 2 blocks from the main train station. The rooftop jacuzzi was to die for, and i enjoyed a day at the spa which was great. Tip - join the Crystal Club (free) as I got free breakfast in my room every day (and on time) plus 15% off at the spa. The breakfast was so huge I saved parts of it to make grilled cheese sandwiches for lunch or snacks and sent my friend home with tons of croissants and danish each day. Everyone is so nice, from the front desk to valet to the lifeguard to the breakfast delivery guy and because it is a small hotel, they quickly and efficiently attend to every need. I have stayed at places like the Ritz Carlton, Beverly Hilton, and the Waldorf Astoria, and have never been so impressed, comfortable, or not wanting to leave a hotel like the Le Crystal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I booked the "Stress Free" package and stayed at Le Crystal for one night. Our room was a "superior suite" and we was quite lovely. It is obvious that the clientele are discerning and not likely to be staying at your average chain hotel. This is a boutique hotel that offers you very individualized service. Our package included a massage and "banya" treatment at Izba Spa. This unfortunately, is the one area where I feel we were let down. We spent the first 15 minutes of our 1-hour treatment in a sauna (which I don't care for), there was barely enough room for 2 people to lay down as we were instructed to do. After 10 minutes or so, our respective massage therapists entered the room and slapped us with wet oak leaves (presumably to invoke circulation through the body), rubbed us down with a mixture of honey and water, and then took a bucket of ice cold water and poured it on our legs and back. The result here really woke you up! Onto the massage, although the surroundings were peaceful, I would not put my massage in the category of "relaxation", once or twice, I pressure being used was way to much and was quite painful - I receive massage treatment regularly, so I'm accustomed to it. I was also disappointed that there was no time or attention paid to the face or scalp - in my opinion, a scalp massage is a must when doing relaxation therapy of this nature. In the end, I would certainly return to Hotel Le Crystal, but I very likely would not use their spa treatment again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went to Montreal for a birthday celebration with 4 other guys 36 - 50 years old. We wanted to be downtown and close to the Bell Centre for the hockey game and wanted to have space to relax in the room(s). Hotel Le Crystal is new, 3 years old. Walking in the door, the place even smells good! The staff was very friendly and helpful. The decor is very modern and nice. We had a larger deluxe suite which had a kings size bed, a large bathroom, a living room area with a pull out couch and other seating and there was lots of room for the extra bed they brought in for us. The other room was a smaller room that still had the nice big bathroom with double vanity, large soaker tub and lovely rain shower seperate from tub. The rooms were quiet, not even sure if we had neighbors and clean. There was a fridge, microwave and additional plates and utensils. Complimentary espresso with machine. Large closest for putting bags away. An umbrella even was found in the closet...which we used as it poured rain one night. We were a block of St. Catherines Street next to all the great outdoor life and one block from the Bell Centre, in fact, the visiting teams stay at this hotel. Fresh macintosh apples at every turn in this hotel, nice touch. Simple. The spa on the 12th floor was nice. The salt water pool was great and sitting outside in the large hottub over looking the city was nice and hot. All in all, I won't stay anywhere else in Montreal. Highly recommend this. The price may have been more but it was deservingly so. Worth the penny.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I took our daughter, son-in-law and their two kids for a weekend stay in Montreal and decided to try Le Crystal. We live near Montreal and have stayed at most of the major hotels in downtown Montreal and in Old Montreal. We had never, however, stayed at Le Crystal which is relatively new to the Montreal hotel scene. We decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed. The entire staff was very courteous. We had two adjoining rooms and because we arrived early one of the rooms was not yet ready. They allowed us access to our one room and quickly finished cleaning the second, then promptly notified us when it was ready. The location is right across from the Bell Centre so if you are going to a Canadiens game or any other event there, it is a very convenient location. Lively Crescent street is just one block over. It is an all suite hotel and we had two deluxe suites. Some of the comments indicate that the classic suites are small so that it why we opted for the larger suite. It was a nice size with a kitchenette area and a separate sitting area. The bed was a luxurious king with a bearskin throw on top of it. Nice touch. The bathroom was huge. It is a good hotel for families because of the large pool which is about three feet deep. Good for both laps and for kids to play. A lifeguard was on duty all the time. Great views of Montreal from the pool floor plus an outdoor hot tub which we scurried to on a cold January day. We didn't try the restaurant but did have a drink at the bar and it seems very attractive. Would definitely recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed at Le Crystal Montreal from December 30th to January 03 2010. I traveled from Florida with my 2 kids 6 years old and 8 months old and along with my wife we have booked our trip through Expedia which we did get great rate. After checking the pictures and reading reviews I had to give this 5 star 4 diamond hotel a visit specially under heavy snow and -2 F degrees. We have booked all our arrivals and departures through hotels Concierge Claudine (via email) she has arranged everything that I asked for along with special new years Ball at the hotel with our friends from Montreal. Hotel is located one of the best place in Montreal , new and convenient. check in and check out was great. we have stayed Deluxe suit and rooms along with amenities was excellent (spacious Bathroom) . Hotel has 1 restaurant Le Couple and Small cafe. cafe opens in the morning and closes at 3.00 pm I have tried to eat lunch there (mainly sandwiches and salads But I was pushed off by the waiter stating the sandwiches were couple of days old and he suggest I eat in the restaurant. We have dine at the main restaurant Brunch and 2 dinner nothing specially write about rude waiters and tasteless food very disappointing. We have ordered every morning Breakfast room service slow cold and many of the items missing coffe tea but no sugar omllets cold and no toast etc.. Cleanliness of the room was great and they do offer turn down service upon request. Very small bar right inside the restaurant .. I would have expect more from 5 Star 4 Diamond establishment but again we may stay again in the future</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Crystal is several months old as of this writing and although there has been some wear and tear (probably due to guests not being too careful), it offers good value for the money and was the cleanest hotel I've found in the city. We had a suite on the top floor which was quite comfortable -- it was probably about 700 square feet. It had a living room with wall mounted flat screen television, sofa, coffee table a couple of chairs, kitchenette with microwave, toaster and Liebherr refrigerator that was amply stocked with all of the necessities (from juice and water to hard liquor). With 1.5 baths, the master suite had a king sized bed, flat screen television, double bowl bath vanity with separate tub and shower. All in all, pretty comfortable. Not top of the line finishes (a lot of ceramic mixed with some crema marfil marble), although I was pleasantly surprised to see the Liebherr refrigerator and Franke undermount sink in the kitchen area . The shower had a rainshower head and separate hand held, so they're definitely trying to make you comfortable. The bed was firm (which I liked) and the room was quiet, so I was pleased. This is a good hotel for business travelers or those who like/need a bit of extra space (for kids). The standard rooms are really quite spacious too, so I'd recommend considering one of those. We opted for the suite only because we were offered a pretty good rate for it, otherwise I would have booked the standard room. I would definitely consider returning. The bar is nice and overall I think the hotel offers good value for the money. Perhaps they'll hike up the prices once they've gotten more established, but in the meantime, I'd give it a try.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked an Urban Suite in this hotel apartment for four nights. We were quite satisfied. The hotel is convenient located, one block away from the Crescent street. where there are many restaurants. We did not use the parking service of the hotel, as it was only available for valet parking, and it cost $24 per night. We parked our car at one of the Stationnement EM, which was only about 40 meters away, for $80 for four nights. We found it was easier for us in and out as we wish. The Urban suite we stayed was different from the one showed on the hotel's website; still, the room was clean and spacious. There were a lot of drawers and storage space, pillows, cushions and towels. Also, there are two flat screen tvs, one in the bed room, and one in the living room. In general we were happy with the service of the hotel, however there was some confusion with the bottled water provided on the counter. The first day I checked in, I asked the reception whether the water on the counter was complimentary. I had been told that the one on the counter is free and the ones in the mini bar are not, which I thought it was understandable and it should be. But, we got billed for a couple of times for consumption of the water on the counter. One bottle of water costs $7. After I made a complain, the hotel erased all the charge. Though I did not use the facility, but I had a quick visit of the swimming pool and the gym. It was on the 12th floor. The swimming is indoor with floor to ceiling windows, so it is quite bright, the hot tub is outdoor on the big balcony with a nice view of the skyscrapers and the Mont Royal. We enjoyed our stay at Le Crystal. We would like to stay here next time if we can get a good price again</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Upon your first glance of the Le Crystal Hotel, you know you are in a very good stay. The outside is very sleek and modern looking with a very nice lobby to sit in and relax. The front desk staff, bellhops and car valet's are right on the mark everytime. Julien was an exceptional pleasure at check out this morning with his true 5 star service. The service in the entire hotel is excellent and extremely efficient. We stayed in a deluxe king suite (the entire hotel is suites) which had a real nice living area with a couch and 2 nice leather chairs which was very comfortable for viewing one of the two flat panel tv's in the room. There is a seperate bedroom with sliding doors and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. I have stayed at many of the finest hotels around the world during my extensive business travels and I can never recall a bed as confortable. The rooms are so quiet, we thought we were the only ones staying in the hotel and I knew the hotel was close to fully booked this weekend! The suite also has a Nespresso coffee maker in the room which is well stocked with different coffee's, espresso and teas. There is a small kitchenette area of the suite with stocked refridgerator, microwave, plates and utensils. We had a very nice view of downtown Montreal and the location is a stones throw away from the Bell Center, home of the Montreal Canadiens hockey team. I was traveling with my wife and 2 young kids and they loved it as well. We only ate breakfast at the hotel restaraunt and it was excellent. The location is great for walking to shopping, the famed "uderground" shopping, restaraunts and night life. This hotel is true 5 star gem and it is not be missed while traveling to Montreal.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “New Years at Le Crystal...”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Le Crystal for New Years for two nights, it has a great location to crescent street and is one of the newer, more hip hotels in the area. The deluxe suite was great, providing us with all of the necessities with great little touches. Although the rooms were nice and modern, there is a bit of a cold, business like feel to them. The bathroom was wonderful and big with a separate deep tub that fits two, as well as a stand up shower. The bedroom is closed off to the living area and has a great fake fur blanket for extra comfort. There is ample closet and drawer space, which I imagine is great for longer stays. The little kitchenette area is more than sufficient. The only complaint I have about this hotel is the service. We were greatly displeased by the valet parking, understandably parking downtown is expensive, but to have to pay each time you want something out of your car is just ridiculous. The front desk as well was rude and unhelpful, I can only imagine what a sour image they portray to tourists from other countries. I hope this doesn't make people think less of Montrealers and our friendly attitudes. Room service was deplorable, we ordered two hamburgers, a fry and a sandwich for $65+, I didn't mind the price, but you figure that they could at least be friendly when bringing it to your room. The man who delivered was the most miserable person I have seen. The outdoor hot tub was a nice touch, especially in the cold weather! Would I recommend this hotel? I would, but more to business travelers, there is something lacking from this hotel, it's missing the charm that is Montreal. The service made you feel like you were a bother to them, and for that reason I wouldn't recommend to families or romantic getaways.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we stayed here for our 1 yr anniversary. we drove to montreal from washington dc so we arrived a bit tired and ready for some luxury treatment. this hotel provided exactly that. i had called in advance and Russell worked with me to have a handwritten note and some treats left in our room prior to our arrival as a small surprise for my husband. the staff was very willing to point us to the best restaurants and made great recommendations since we had not planned much ahead of time. we had a couples massage in the lovely spa in the hotel - i highly recommend allowing time to sit in the relaxation room after and enjoy some fruit and peace. the hotel was located right in the center of town, right off of rue st. catharine. we took a cab to old montreal a few times (about $10) which we highly recommend of "european" feel - cobblestone streets, cafes, souveneir shops, notre dame bascillica, etc. the amenities in the hotel were perfect - our room had a small fridge, great minibar options, fantastic bed/pillows, and molton brown products which are to die for. smell so good and make hair look perfect :-) we also had a large soaking tub which i enjoyed a couple of evenings. the bathroom was beautiful, clean lines, and spacious. there were 2 computers and a printer for guest use in the lobby. i guess i was just disappointed by the $26/night fee for the parking of our car. that seemed awfully high and should be discounted for guests over 2 or 3 nights. in fact, we loved our visit to montreal so much that we extended our vacation by 1 night (was just disappointed to be charged that parking for yet another night!!) we cannot wait to come to montreal again (the people are SOOO nice) and we will be looking forward to staying at hotel le crystal.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good value, but not the best 5 star hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Bit surprised by some of the rapturous reviews on the site-yes, the hotel is good value for money compared to other cities around the world, but it is in no way comparable to some of the top 5 star establishments. The foyer area is rather sterile and uninviting, restaurant food is quite good but breakfast is appalling! No freshly squeezed juice (or even Tropicana for that matter!), meagre selection of pastries and the worst coffee we had in Montreal. For a city with such great restaurants it was shocking, and room service was no better. However, the coffee in the Millesme cafe was not too bad, so it's worth paying the extra and getting your morning coffee there. For a hotel that's only a year old, you can already see signs of wear and tear-our carpet in the executice suite was rather badly stained, and the room was filled with the smell of smoke, which to be fair the staff did try to rectify.The kitchen area was nice, and I'm sure that if you bring a young family it is very convenient as there was a separate shower room/toilet and a sofa bed in the livign room area. The room was spacious (as we had the most expensive room bar the penthouse suite which was not available) but it wasn't exactly kitted out luxuriously and it's obvious they used cheap materials to build everything. However, the spa is nice, gym just ok, pool area hit and miss. Breakfast sorely needs improving, and staff could be a little more knowledgeable.Also turn down needs to be until later in the day, who wants their curtains all closed at 4pm?There are a LOT of curtains!STaff were perfectly nice and the bell boys/valet service was good. ALso free internet was very useful.Not sure if I would stay here again, but possibly if we came with a small family.The area is near shops and nice department stores, but Montreal has more charming neighbourhoods.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Modern and beautiful with great service and a lovely pool”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the contemporary, light-filled lobby to the very roomy, comfortable, and sleek rooms, Le Crystal delivers an exceptional, stylish, swanky experience. The lobby is hip without being offputting or unfriendly. It is well lit and there is no pulsating music. While there are glamorous people passing through all the time, the staff is friendly and we felt comfortable enough on one rainy day to play board games at a big glass table in the corner. Our room was extremely well-appointed and comfortable. The bed and linens are great, the bathroom was huge and the shower head wonderful (hot and powerful both). The products are good, towels plentiful, and the fixtures all modern and stylish. I would be happy to have the furniture and art in my own home. We were staying at the hotel over Easter weekend and the hotel went over the top to indulge guests (especially children) in candy and festivities. Lots of chocolate and jelly beans for everyone! We swam every day during our 5-day trip. The pool was cold but there was some sort of mechanical issue. Otherwise, it was the best hotel pool we've been too -- water not too chlorine-y, great seating for the grown ups, a nice hot tub on the adjoining outdoor deck, and an amazing view of Montreal. The gym, while small, is perfectly useful and has the same great view. The location is close to public transportation, in the new part of Montreal, and near some good restaurants. One negative is the hotel restaurant. We had breakfast there one day because my kids were begging. They ate from the overpriced buffet which, while European (maybe), was disappointing: dried fruit, cold cereal, mediocre fruit salad, etc. The service was inattentive and indifferent and we had to ask repeatedly for coffee refills (a must for tired parents at breakfast) and the check. Basically, you will be delighted if you stay at Le Crystal.</p></li>

<li>Our <span style="background-color:#aaffc3" title="p=0.998">room</span> was extremely well-appointed and comfortable.</br></br></li>

<li>I would be happy to have the furniture and art in my own home.</br></br></li>
<li>We were staying at the hotel over Easter weekend and the hotel went over the top to indulge guests (especially children) in candy and festivities.</br></br></li>
<li>Lots of chocolate and <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.996">jelly</span> beans for everyone!</li>

<li>We swam every day during our 5-day trip.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#9a6324" title="p=0.998">pool</span> was cold but there was some sort of mechanical issue.</br></br></li>
<li>Otherwise, it was the best <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.997">hotel</span> pool we've been too -- water not too chlorine-y, great seating for the grown ups, a nice hot tub on the adjoining outdoor deck, and an amazing view of Montreal.</li>
