<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is an older property that has been rehabbed as space permitted. Rooms are tight but doable. The biggest problem for us was lack of handicap accessibility. The lower floor is actually 3 levels and one has a full fight of stairs to get to the elevators from the outside entrances. Staff was friendly and helpful. Ok place to overnight but not for a long stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a great location and the rooms are very cute. Boutique style hotel with great staff and has a coffee shop on site (Seattles Best I think??). I have sent many friends from Victoria to stay here and they have all loved it. This hotel is my first choice for business or pleasure travel to Seattle as they always offer such a great deal! Keep up the good work!</p></li>

The room is small so don't expect too much from that. Would definitely be coming back here</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">An older hotel kept clean by a friendly staff. The location is downtown, close to Pike Market. Easy to/from airport by Light Rail for $2.50. Perfect place to explore downtown Seattle by foot. The rooms are more quaint than spacious, but cute in their old style way. Yes, you get sounds from the city, the hum of the elevator, and can hear your neighbors come and go, but this is a delightful hotel.</p></li>

I had excellent customer service from Jennifer who changed a reservation to a lower (on line) rate that I requested; she also arranged a limo pick up for me; all of this was done via email. The front desk (Andrea) was efficient and every employee encountered was friendly. I loved the wine reception. A great way to meet others staying in the hotel!

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is located conveniently in downtown Seattle close to the convention center. That description matches quite some others far more recently built ones, but they also go along with a higher price tag. There is no breakfast other than visiting Seattle's Best Coffee in the lobby serving great lattes and some muffins. For a small bite enough, but that's it. The room was clean and primarily filled with the queen-size bed. The bathroom was tiny. Fine if all you want is sleep after a busy day, but certainly no retreat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent 3 nights here and had a nice stay. The hotel was obviously old and you could tell that it had been updated to look more modern. The room and bathroom were small but clean. The bed was not very comfortable but tolerable. One of our complaints was that we could constantly hear the elevator going up and down at all hours of the day and night. The best part of this was the location. About a 10 minute walk to all the attractions in downtown Seattle and only a couple of blocks walk to the light rail line to the airport. Not my first choice to stay at but I would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The price was affordable, which attracted us to the hotel. Everything else was downhill. We checked into a room on the 2nd Floor. The hotel promises wi-fi, but there was no signal in our room. We moved to a room on the 6th floor. After unpacking we realized there were no privacy curtains and that our bathtub was clogged. We promptly put in a request to fix both. More than 24 hours later, still no resolution. We promptly checked out, and for a mere $15 more per night, checked into a 4-star hotel across the street (who gave us free wi-fi, complimentary breakfast, room service, and had a gym/pool).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location of this hotel was perfect for our art-get-away weekend. The valet was at the door waiting for our Jeep, and the clerk at the counter had our room information ready for us before we approached the count. The room was a little on the small side, but staying in the room was not our goal. When we did return to the room after a lot of walking to see the art museum and downtown seattle, we found a very clean room waiting for us to retire. The only down fall of the stay was the behaviors of other guests, a little on the noisey side. We will stay there again. They took very good care of us. Thank you!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for a night 18 december 04 and didn't quite live up to my expectations, but still a decent value overall. Very convenient location downtown, close to shopping. Staff were very accommodating and pleasant to deal with. There was a cozy coffee shop across adjacent to the front desk. The hotel was VERY clean considering it was an 80-year-old building, but the rooms were quite small and ambient noise from the other rooms was quite apparent. beds were clean and comfortable, but the pipes in the building made heaps of noise in the middle of the night. Probably not the best choice if you're a light sleeper, but still a good value right downtown.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. They were great for helping us find our way around to local attractions and helped us find the shopping and some great restaurants. The hotel rooms have been decorated with a nice modern esthetic, BUT the facilities need some TLC. The bathroom was cramped and the fixtures were very old and had a weird layout. The bed was super comfy. The hotel was in the heart of downtown Seattle and was walking distance to a lot of shopping and attractions. Overall it was nice but needs some upgrades. Oh yeah, parking was an additional $22 per day for self parking. The walls were thin and outside noise was an issue.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had a very bad experience in this hotel. The rooms have very thin walls and you can hear everything from the room next door. There was a constant loud humming machine noise coming from outside. People coming back at night drunk and making noise and partying in the corridors and rooms. I changed rooms twice but they were both equally bad. Eventually I changed to another hotel because I couldn't get a good night's sleep there. I'm not usually very fussy about hotels and I'm used to staying in not so good places but this was the worst hotel experience I've ever had. I don't recommend this to anyone who wants a quiet and clean room. Location is good though.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had three adults in our party, so the small rooms seemed even smaller. On the plus side, the rooms were clean, the location was excellent, and we enjoyed having a coffee shop located downstairs. Negatives were the very small, older rooms and the service was friendly but seemed very disorganized. The valet brought us the wrong vehicle and we had to make a second request for our car on another occasion. They also did not have any suggestions for a boat cruise or a nearby dry cleaners. Only one elevator was working, so after waiting 45 minutes for the bellhop service, my brother went to haul all of the luggage down the stairs ourselves. I do not plan to stay in this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place is fabulous! The room is a little small but coming from NYC that's no biggie (no pun intended)! The bed linens were really nice with a duvet cover and king size pillows. The shower was fantastic and they even provided a bathrobe. I think the one of the best ammenities was the congierge. They provided a colorful map of the city and gave really good tips based on our interests. They even told us the most efficient route to take to see everything we wanted to see. The only thing we weren't crazy about was the parking garage. It was a little bit of a maze. We didn't have to pay, not sure if that was a fluke or if the hotel validates parking. It was safe and right next door though.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Executive Hotel Pacific is the perfect place for a single business traveler, or budget conscious couple, who do not care about frills or bedding down in a room the size of a football field. EHP gives you all of the essentials, except a desk, but that's a minor inconvenience. The wireless signal was excellent. The staff was cheerful and helpful. The location is just a stone's throw from Pike Place Market, good sushi, seafood by the waterfront, and public transportation to/from the SEATAC airport. I've stayed there during my last 3 visits to Seattle, and I cannot imagine staying anywhere else. Plus, the price is a bargain. And...if you have time, check out Seattle's Public Library, just across the street.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a great location, right in downtown right next to the Seattle Public Library and close to all the malls in Seattle. It has a great staff that is very knowledgeable and friendly. The rooms are nice, could be better with the paint and wallpaper, however I'm not living there, so I don't mind. The only problem that I had this time was the A/C was very weak and for the first few hours, the temperature in the room was very hot. It cooled down eventually though. For some reason, the first time I stayed here, the A/C in the room I was in was very strong and I didn't have that problem. Possibly just the unit dying, and not a problem in the whole hotel. Overall, great stay at the Hotel Executive Pacific.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I found your hotel while doing a search on the Internet. We chose your hotel because of the convenient location to almost every attraction in Seattle was in walking distance or by transit. We booked a superior queen room but was pleasantly surprised to get upgraded to a king. The room was small but it was cozy and it suited us just fine. The staff at Executive Pacific was AWESOME!! Everyone from the concierge, front desk to even the maid service were all so friendly, helpful and very personable!! The only thing that I would change would be that the robes in the room were geared for a petite individual but then I didn't think to ask if they had larger sizes. All in all it was a wonderful experience!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was booked in this hotel by a company recruiter and was appalled by the condition of this hotel. I did not mind the room being small but the fact that the carpet was filthy, the dark layer of scum in the bathtub, the mold on the bathroom ceiling, peeling wallpaper, and blackened windows was enough to make me rate this place "terrible". I would never stay at any of these establishments again nor would I recommend anyone to stay there. The staff was friendly but when I asked if there was a room that had possibly been renovated more recently I was told they were all done at the same time. Fortunately, I was there for two nights. While I seriously considered changing hotels it wasn't worth the effort for such a short stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel staff were so helpful, telling me where they liked to eat, printing off maps and taking bus schedules and arranging a personal driver for taxi cost. Okay, so the rooms were outdated a little but this is reflected in the low cost I guess. The bathrooms are super cute with lots of mirrors and they were so clean and the housekeeping staff did a great job cleaning during our stay and giving us extra towels and toiletries. I didn't find it too noisy like other reviewers and the location was so close to everything... not hard to get around at all. Parking seems expensive at $20/night.. I know other hotels offer free parking. Would like to check out some upscale hotels but for my budget this worked perfectly. Would stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It doesn't look like much from the outside, but is very clean and fairly smart inside with really friendly and helpful staff. It also has a mini gym and 'Seattle's Best Coffee' shop located onsite - great for grabbing a quick coffee or bite to eat before you head out! We chose this hotel, as we were in a rush trying to find somewhere to stay for a conference we attended in Seattle in June and although there aren't any spectacular views or a great deal going on in the immediate vicinity, much to our delight, we found it was only a 10-15 minute walk in any direction to either the downtown shopping area, union square, pike market, the monorail and the harbour. Definitely one of the cheapest place to stay downtown and highly recommended!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This isn't the place to stay if you are looking for a luxury hotel. But, given the location and the price, this place rises to the top. We stayed here twice in a little over a week--the night we arrived in Seattle, and the night before we flew out. Both nights, we had rooms that were clean, comfortable, and quiet. I agree that the rooms and the bathrooms are small. However, they were spotless, which to me is more important. Staff was friendly and accommodating. We had read some of the negative reviews and decided that, if our first visit wasn't satisfactory, we would go somewhere else for our second night. Needless to say, we didn't find that to be necessary. Location is wonderful, and we will definitely consider this hotel again if we head back to Seattle.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading some of these reviews I was quite surprised by how wonderful this hotel really is. It was very clean and neat-- nicely decorated. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room that we had was what I would consider to be an above average size for a big city hotel. I did not find it too hot or too cold. The bathroom may be a problem for some people who are larger because the toliet sits right next to the bathtub. I also enjoyed having Seattle's Best Coffee Shop on the ground floor for breakfast pastries and coffee every morning. The hotel is within a close walk to Pioneer Square, the Piers, Pike Place Market, and Nordstrom, etc. We even walked back from the Space Needle at night and it was not really that bad-- but definitely pack your best walking shoes.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was a little underwhelmed with this hotel. The price was good, though, so I wasn't expecting the world. I had read reviews saying the hotel was run down. It isn't. It's an older property so isn't brand-spankin' new, but it is certainly not run-down. We stayed in a basic room. It was a basic room. Standard layout. Small bathroom. Excellent bed. The lobby is unimpressive. There are no restaurants in the hotel except a coffee shop. However, there is a great italian place just up the street with the best tiramisu. The staff were very friendly. We came with two dogs, so we're not the most desirable clientele, but the staff were all very accommodating. All-in-all, there was nothing really wrong with this place but I don't think I would stay here again. It was just very average.</p></li>

Every now and then we stay overnight, and when we do, this is our hotel of choice. The location can't be beat - close to Benaroya Hall where we see the symphony and right across the street from the library. Shopping is within a few short blocks. We especially like this hotel because it reminds us of the smaller boutique hotels we like to stay in when traveling. The rooms are cosy but not cramped, the amenities are good, and the customer service has been fine. On top of that, the price can't be beat. During the times we've stayed at this hotel, we've neither experienced nor observed any of the negatives mentioned in other reviews.</p></li>

Asked for our bags which were checked earlier, the desk lady asked when I would like to get the bag which I replied right now would be fine not later which she seemed it was to much trouble for her. When we opened the door to the room we were hit immediatly with cigar and cigarette smells. The hotel was booked so we could not change rooms. The front desk offered us breakfast vouchers which was fine but when I told her that the recent smoking in a non smoking room was unacceptable and that i would like a room credit the desk manager offered to leave a note with the manager and that was all she could do for us. If you are expecting executive class you will not get it here. from vancouver bc.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading the past reviews I was a little apprehensive on what to expect of this hotel... I booked a basic queen room through wotif.com for myself, partner and lil one, for just over $100 usd.. On arrival we asked for a free upgrade as we had heard that the rooms were on the smallish side, they obliged and gave us a king business room on the 7th floor. The room was good, big enough for us all and all of our luggage. The bed was super comfortable and we had no trouble sleeping at all... The bathroom was a tad small but it didn't really bother us too much!! The location is fantastic and you can walk to all the major attractions in the city - which was great for us as we only had a short time to see everything. The free drinks from 5-7pm was also a bonus!! I'd definitely stay here again if in seattle!! .</p></li>

<li>After reading the past reviews I was a little apprehensive on what to expect of this hotel... I booked a basic queen room through wotif.com for myself, partner and lil one, for just over $100 usd.. On arrival we asked for a free upgrade as we had heard that the <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">rooms</span> were on the <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">smallish</span> side, they obliged and gave us a king business room on the 7th floor.</br></br></li>
<li>The room was good, big enough for us all and all of our luggage.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#4363d8">bed</span> was <span style="background-color:#4363d8">super comfortable</span> and we had no trouble sleeping at all... The bathroom was a tad small but it didn't really bother us too much!!</li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel for 2 nights and left after the first only because it was pre-paid and we could not find another hotel. The room smelled like a gym locker. The bathroom looked 'reasonably' clean, but the tub needed replacing.... When I stepped into the tub the floor of the tub felt 'sloshy' and it had several cracks. As your moved around in the tub it felt like there was water beneath it and it was sloshing around. I think there was water under there - old, rotten, diseased bath water. The bath drain would not stay in open position so that made it worse. The bad thing is that we could of booked another 5 star hotel for about $5 dollars more over by the space needle, but we were not familiar with that area. I would check the room pryor to signing any papers and I would not pre-pay for rooms in this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at the Executive Pacific Hotel a good three hours before our scheduled check in time but the receptionist was quite happy to allocate our room immediately, so we dumped our bags and headed straight back out to a Mariners ball game and didn't return till midnight. We therefore totally missed the complementary wine tasting offered in our deal and I forgot to enquire whether it was to be held. So, we basically used the room to sleep and for that it was ideal!!! 'Executive' to me conjures up an image of a business standard hotel that I would say the EP doesn't quite hit - the room wasn't massive, the window was broken and the bedlight was suspiciously intermittent. But for a one-night rate of £76 for a double room bang in the centre of town and two blocks from University station, I'd say it was a result!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My cousin and I stayed at the Executive her first night in Seattle, and we both loved it. The beds were comfy, room was clean, and the AC kept the room at a nice, cool temperature for a fitful sleep. The decor has an Art Nouveau feel to it, which might be a bit off-putting to people who prefer more contemporary surroundings. If you appreciate the (somewhat) unusual, you will enjoy your stay here. Staff were friendly and attentive. Location is excellent and close to Pike Place Market without being too close. Aside from typical hotel noises (neighbors opening and closing their doors as they left), we did not have to deal with anything annoying or distracting. My only complaint was the slowness of the internet speed, annoying but not a deal-breaker for me. I would definitely stay there again with out of town visitors.</p></li>

I have no idea who she was or why the valet gave her a ride. Next we check in, get keys, go down 6 stairs to the elevator, go to our room, open the door, to find another person in our room. OMG. How awkward! Back down to the front desk to find out that there were no other rooms. In the meantime a drunk came up to us in the lobby, as well as a drunk/pan handler outside the front door. NIGHTMARE is the only way to describe this. Luckily, we called AMEX, and got moved to the Hotel Monaco across the street. We schlepped our own luggage to the Monaco, where they gave us complimentary wine, complimentary parking, and a lovely, clean room.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend getaway after three months apart. We spent very little time in the room since we wanted to do all the touristy things in Seattle, but it was always so nice to come back to our nice, comfortable room. The rooms are recently remodeled but still retain some of their "charm." This isn't really a "luxury" hotel, but it is definitely comfortable, clean, and quiet (considering it's right downtown). The location could not be better, an easy walk to Pike's, the aquarium, shopping, tons of restaurants etc. The space needle is about a 30 minute walk, but we opted for a cab which was under $10. The service from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we walked out was phenomenal. You can't beat the price for the quality of room, location, and awesome service. Will definitely be staying here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Take your money elsewhere! The hotel rooms are outdated and dirty! When we checked in we were ignored by the front desk attendants for more than 10 minutes while they talked among themselves. Once we got into our room, we opened the door and immediately saw that the room had not been cleaned (unmade bed, dirty room). We returned to the lobby and the attendants merely changed our room without apologizing. We got to our second room and were still not confident that the room was clean. My husband and I were too tired to fight a battle and got into bed after a LONG trip west. When we checked out, my husband told the front desk attendant that the rooms were not satisfactory and again... NO apology. Bizzare. When you pay an arm and a leg to travel these days, there is no reason to stay at this hotel... take your money elsewhere and enjoy Seattle!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I found the Executive Hotel Pacific on the net; I was looking for a hotel near the SAM (our primary reason for going was to see the Picasso exhibit) at a reasonable price. The EHP exceeded our expectation. it had a very nice urban vibe and was staffed by very friendly, helpful and fun people. The room was clean and well appointed. We appreciated the comfy bed and crisp white linens. The bathroom could have had some supplemental heat- but otherwise it was great. We were able to walk to all of the sites we were interested and had two great dinners near by (Serious Pie and Brooklyn ). There was parking right next door, but we walked everywhere so we weren't going in and out. Must say, I was also pleased to know the chain is Canadian based- happy to support the locals and the good folk back home. Highly recommend this place - can't beat it for the price !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was perfect for a girls shopping trip in Seattle. The price was great, especially for the location - the rooms are small, however if you don't plan on spending much time in them, it shouldn't be a problem. The beds were comfortable, more so than the average hotel room. The only downside is you can hear everything happening in the hallway, so if you attempt to sleep in you'll be woken by a vacuum at 8 a.m. Luckily the other guests staying here were respectful, and we rarely heard them. The staff were friendly and constantly helpful, they allowed us to check in early before we hit the stores. Parking was right next door to the hotel, and only $21 - which I think is a good deal for downtown seattle. I'm suprised travellers are shocked that they must pay for parking at a hotel - it's pretty standard in large cities where parking is at a premium.</p></li>

It is in a great location and very reasonably priced compared to other downtown hotels, the two items I noted above wouldn't stop me from staying here again - however, the heat in the hotel would. It was SO HOT! There is no A/C and the windows in the room only open a couple inches. There are also no fans in the bathroom.

We booked a superior room, but there was no room for anything, we were constantly shuffling our stuff around and tripping over one another. The worst part was the bathroom, and the sink faucet. It was leaking so bad that we called the front desk - they sent someone up and he fixed it to a slow leak but it was still driving us nuts, so we ended up turning off the main water lines to the sink. Someone in the room next to us wasn't feeling well (we know this because of the thin walls) and was up all night getting sick into his toilet - and lucky us we heard it all night. I mentioned to one of the employees about the sink and he wasn't concerned, just told me that this is an old hotel... We had requested early check-in, but we were not able to get a room untill 3:00 in the afternoon...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We are frequent visitors to Seattle from Vancouver Canada. Take the train down, relax and walk about 15 minutes to this refurbished hotel. It isn't five star but it is good value and great location. Rooms: clean and neat. Bathroom: smallish but very well appointed. Location: excellent access to SAM and a few blocks to Pike Place (but transit in Seattle downtown is free, so don't take the car and pay for unnecessary silly parking). Staff: helpful and professional. Shout out to the doormen/bellmen: great guys who hustle those cabs late at night. Stop whining about "it isn't big enough" "we have to walk uphill": Hotel has all the amenities of a more luxurious stay: robes, hair dryer, coffee maker and upscale toiletries. Seattle is a get what you pay for place as most are and this is my best choice for a budget conscious weekend get away. Save a few bucks and go out for a great meal. Only downside was a slightly noisy heating system- but you can get over that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First of all, the room was so small. I expected it to be cozy, and properly equipped, but it was neither. There was no table to eat at.. just a desk. In-room meals had to be eaten on the bed, or over one's lap. The staff graciously upgraded my family to a "King-Size Suite" which just consisted of a larger bed.. (which in turn made the room even smaller). The Bedding was stained, the staff didn't clean the room until I personally requested it.. TERRIBLE SERVICE! My husband and I opted for valet service, and for the extra charge, I think it would have been better to have just self-parked. Why in the world would a guest at a hotel have to pay to park there?! The staff did NOT help us with our bags, even though we obviously had our hands full, there was no ramp so all luggage had to be transported manually. The elevator took at least 5 minutes to get to the floor, and its button didn't work half the time. The doors on the elevator nearly crushed me, as they do not have safety sensors.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">So I stayed here alone for two nights. Staff was extremely friendly - great with recommendations. They allowed me to check in to my room several hours earlier than check in. The hotel is your typical downtown hotel in a historic building. In other words, pretty small (I had the basic queen room) but it should be enough for two people. Very clean, comfortable bedding. Location: although I thought Downtown Seattle had a surprisingly big city feel to it (it is very built up, great urban planning, great density in buildings) in reality, it isn't that big. That being said, all it means is that this hotel is very central and very walkable to all of the main attractions. One other thing, as mentioned by someone prior to me, the 5-6pm wine hour is really great. Free booze and you get to meet other people! And to the staff member who was planning to move to San Diego, I almost made it all the way to the airport on foot. Well not almost, I walked about 4 miles but the the area started to get a little shifty looking.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Friendly, helpful staff welcome you to this older downtown hotel. We booked the cozy Queen which included Valet Parking and continental breakfast. Upon arrival we were given an upgrade. The bathrooms are period, clean and tiny. The closet is also tiny so don't expect to hang a lot of clothing. The air conditioner in our room didn't work that well-but no matter weather had started cooling down in late August. The bed is a little on the soft side but some people like that. The continental breakfast served by very friendly people in the lobby coffee shop was fine-coffee or tea, juice and your choice of pastry. Newspapers were available in the lounge. Try and not get a room near the ancient elevators-they are very noisy. This hotel was great for a two day visit to Seattle. The location is excellent as you can walk to the Public Market, the Space Needle the water front areas and to the major department stores. Seattle is a great city- The Executive Hotel Pacific will serve you very well indeed for a short stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel for 1 night, booked for 2 but decided to leave a day early. Our room was a "cozy double" and it sure was cozy! VERY small room, some newish furniture but the building is aged. The headboards were quite worn out and the bathroom was something else. Had to shower leaning back as the shower head looked me right in the face, and I'm only 5'7". Let's just say the bathroom was so small that the shelf for the towels was inside the shower. The elevators were pretty scary, had to stop and wait after the doors had opened for it to adjust so it was level with the ground! The walls are paper thin, could hear every detail of the conversation the neighbors were having at 2am, and even with the windows shut, could hear men fighting out side around the same time. The room was clean though, no question about it, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Parking was crappy though, had to truck our luggage around the corner to the parkade, up some stairs, to get to the elevator to take us up to our car.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location is not great. The rooms are so small that with my husband, myself and three suitcases in the room, one of us had to stand on the bed in order to walk around. The walls are paper thin. The rooms overlooking the parking garage are flooded with fluorescent lights at night. If you don't mind having the blackout shades closed all the time, then this isn't a problem. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but there is a Seattle's Best, but it doesn't serve dinner. So if you land at night and want a bite to eat, you have to leave the hotel. The hotel and rooms are not inviting and you'd be inclined to spend as many hours roaming the city as possible. There's no lounge or lobby. The front staff was not knowledgeable or helpful and couldn't even recommend a place for breakfast. I would highly suggest you keep searching for another option if you are planning a trip to Seattle that is longer than 1 night. Thankfully we only had to suffer through 2. I am giving the hotel a poor rating because at least it was clean.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">So 4 of us stayed here during Black Friday - and we got a crazy deal for $59/night. We stayed 2 nights. Our room was 506, with 2 double beds and 1 bathroom. The room was quite small but beds were comfortable. Bathroom was suffice enough for whatever you need to do in there except the toilet flushes REALLLLLY LOUD. The room was fairly clean, save for a few pieces of wallpaper rolling back and the headboards had scratches from people obviously doing some very aggressive things in bed which was kind of gross. NOW COMES THE SAFETY ISSUE - 2 of our friends were going to meet us at the hotel after they went midnight shopping at the outlets. At about 2 am, they came into the room. The next morning, I realized that I didn't give them room keys so I asked how they got in. Apparently they just asked for room keys for room 506 and the front desk person made them without question. This caused quite a shock because if it wasn't our friends coming in at 2am to our room, it could have been ac omplete stranger coming in to do who-knows-what to us.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here when we came to Seattle to attend a Seahawks game. Because we splurged on tickets, we had to save on our accommodations. After an exhaustive search of rates, parking, and the bed bug review...this hotel stood out. We aren't disappointed at all. The location was excellent between the stadium and the retail district. We walked everywhere during our entire stay. The rates were the most reasonable in the area. The staff were excellent sending us to great restaurants and helping us find attractions. But...this is a very tired hotel that could use updating. The rooms and bathrooms were small (okay with us) and you could see the old charm from it's original days; however the paint is chipped, the tiles in the bathrooms were stained and moldy, and the carpets were stained. My husband and I didn't mind because the bed was clean and comfortable and we had a good rate. If you want a friendly hotel, good rates, and excellent location - book here. But if you need a fresh modern hotel room, you may want to look at some of the other hotels in the same area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Read the majority of the negative comments that shold tell you something. Its a early 1900 building that had some new carpet, and some marble in the front entrance and there you are. There is NO access for a whhelchair. You park out front and load your luggage in the hotel taking it down some stairs a placing it on a cart and hoping on an old clanky elevator. Once your done, you have to drive the car to a public parkade in the next building over. Its unfornate that you can not drive under the building and unload the car and have an elevator take you to your floor. The bathroom was smaller than small, the rooms we tiny, and carpet had a stain, and an electrical wire that was sheathed and screwed to the wall came off the wall. The door to the room had a deadbolt (thankfully), however, the old style manual slider lock with a chained piece that was connected to the wall was broken off and made me wonder if this room was recently broken into? The building should be knocked down and a new one constructed. Anyhow, its not worth what we paid. Its in an okay location, but in my opinion is a 2 star hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">So, let's start from the pros: This is place is in a good position, has a parking on the next door building (you have to pay extra, of course) and is below the average cost for a hotel in the city centre of Seattle. Let's go to the cons: Elevator was working intermittently, it happened that we sometimes had to wait for 20 min before we could use it, and once we used the stairs instead (bear in mind that we were on 7th floor). All the other guests had same problems, and complained with staff at the reception, but no one ever bothered neither sympathized about the situation. They were undergoing major repairs on the elevator, and they clearly should not have kept the hotel open meanwhile, especially considering the number of storeys. Going to the rooms: our was small, not so clean, and the bathroom was microscopic, too. We could barely fit our suitcases on the floor. We could hear noise coming both from the corridor, and from the neighboring room, which was pretty annoying especially late at night. It is true that we did not spend much on this stay, but next time I would rather pay 100$/night more rather than staying at this place again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had an enjoyable 2 night stay here in a central location in downtown Seattle. The hotel is 5 minute to central shopping area and 10 minutes to Pike Place markets. It is also only 10 minutes to the waterfront but beware the steep climb to come back that way. The University St SoundLink light rail station is only a block away which is convenient for traveling to/fro SeaTac airport. Arrived on a Sunday afternoon and was promptly checked in on the 4th floor in a smallish room but it was clean and looked quite modern. Not a bad look for an older style building. They are currently renovating the 5th floor and 1 of the elevators. The current elevators are old and pretty slow and I found myself running the stairs most times but that would not be practical if you were on a higher floor or had luggage. The lobby and mezzanine level with the free business centre looks great. I went downstairs and asked the front desk for some dining out suggestions for the Sunday night and they had no ideas for me, suggested I order pizza delivery. As I wasn't feeling like pizza I took a walk and found heaps of places within a few blocks and decided on eating at a British pub.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for three nights. On the plus side, this hotel is in a great central location in downtown Seattle; the new main library is right across the street and plenty of stores and services are within walking distance, so you do not need to rent a car. It's an old building with character, something that's hard to find these days. The price that we got was very reasonable too. The staff was very friendly and helpful and attentive to our needs; a special thanks to the very friendly doorman, Stanley. On the negative side, our room was rather small and so could not include a desk and chair. The window needed to be washed and some of the furniture is approaching the time when it needs to be replaced. The tub drain was extremely slow. Like a lot of hotels, the walls were too thin, but our neighbors quieted down, so we did not have to complain about it. The biggest negative for us was the fact that the elevator lobby is not level with the street, so if you have mobility problems or require a wheelchair, this is not the hotel for the disabled. But, we managed fine in spite of it. It is quite a hike up to the hotel from the waterfront--not for the out-of-shape!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I love old buildings and old hotels. Our room was in the corner on the top floor. We are directly across from the fabulous Seattle Public Library, which is a must see. The room is perfectly small and the bathroom is great. We love the old, deep porcelain bathtub with endless hot water. This alone makes me love my room. The one-piece modern sink is stunning and now, I know, I must have one of my own. We walked here from the ferry on Thanksgiving. FYI: If I'd known, I'd choose to go straight up the hill to third or fourth avenue and walk downtown to the hotel that way. I had my young daughter with me and we ended up walking a gauntlet of single, homeless or illegal, men sitting on the pier near the marketplace. It was uncomfortable for both of us, especially pulling our luggage along. It wasn't the highest vibration for sure. In addition, we ate a great Thanksgiving buffet dinner across the street at the Sazerac Restaurant located in the Hotel Monaco. Delicious! It was a lovely way to spend the holiday, for certain. If you like the energy and ambience of old hotels and adore hot baths and excellent customer service then stay at the Executive Hotel Pacific in downtown Seattle. (The free wireless internet is awesome too!)</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading some not so favorable reviews of this hotel, I made a point to check it out firsthand before commiting to a reservation. I had a very nice experience, from the friendliness of the front desk staff to the bellman who showed me one of the charming rooms. It was small yet cozy and efficient. Clean too. So I went ahead and booked a room there for myself and my sister. We were planning to see a play at The ACT Theatre that evening. Though small, our room was quite inviting and just right for the two of us. Pristine, upgraded bedding. The organic toiletries were a real treat. There was a CD player in the room which we used to play some of our favorite music. We were fortunate to get a room on the quieter side of the building. I must say also that the parking situation here is a good deal. For the self parking fee of $21 you get in and out privileges as well as being able to park in the lot until 6pm of the day of check out. I haven't ever heard of such a generous parking policy. The front desk staff and the bellman at Executive Pacific Plaza Hotel are really friendly and accomodating. This is a great value hotel in a great location, walking distance to so much that Seattle has to offer. I will definitely return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was barely ok- the location was terrific. When you enter the lobby, you either have to go down or up a flight of stairs to get to the elevator - not handicapped friendly, for sure. Also, the room was very small, dingy, with a non-working air conditioner. It usually isn't required in Seattle, but on 2 of the days we were there, we sure could have used it. The bathroom was small, could not accomodate my toiletries. The toilet lid did not stay up by itself - so it was quite an inconvenience for my traveling companion (male) and had to be held up with one hand. It wasn't something that could easily be fixed, because there was a ledge built in over it that was obviously not measured correctly. When the window was open, the bathroom door did not stay closed (painted over too many times), so we had to wedge a washcloth in the door. The bedspread was very old and cheap-looking, like something out of a cheap motel. The carpets were in bad shape, too. My pillow was lumpy - and only one per person. I had to ask for more - got them the next day, after a second request. The help was nice, as were the housekeepers. The location made it tolerable, but without some serious interior renovations, I would not choose this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My girlfriend and I wanted a nice place to spend New Year's Eve together. We usually stay at the Holiday Inn Express near the Space Needle, but we wanted something nicer. In all honesty, the Holiday Inn Express turned out to be nicer. I was excited to stay at the Pacific Plaza - it looked like a cute little romantic hotel. We got there to discover that parking was around the block (and $18 a day, which would have been fair if the garage was right there) - a long walk to the hotel in cold weather. The room was OLD and TINY. We couldn't both be in the bathroom at the same time. Also, our heat didn't work, and it was freezing. The pillows were the most uncomfortable pillows I've ever slept on (and the following weekend, I stayed at a Motel 6, and the pillows were BETTER there!). Also, we made it clear at time of making the reservation (and I called to confirm a few days before arrival) that we wanted ONE queen (or king) bed. We arrived to find two double beds. I was furious. I tried to switch rooms, but there were no more rooms with one bed. The only pluses were the location (right downtown), and the pet friendly policy. Oh, and they were nice at the front desk, just not very helpful. Next time, we're going back to the Holiday Inn Express!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's been 6 months since we stayed in this hotel over the Xmas season but I just wanted to say how much we enjoyed our stay here. Yes, late but still, I'm sure things don't change that much. We were apprehensive about the hotel before arrival from reading about it and the fact that it is a very old hotel in the downtown area. I was nervous that it would be in skid-row. Heehee. It wasn't. It was great that way. What sold us was that it is a completely NON-SMOKING hotel! YES! That did it. When we arrived, the room was small and seemed old but it was very clean. It could use more light. The washroom is very tiny like everyone says. Still, the location is GREAT and the room was very quiet. We faced the library, away from the main street. We enjoyed the easy access to everything so much that we left the car parked in the parking lot for 4 days. Yes, it did cost $18 a day to park. Ouch. The lobby/mezzanine area was actually bright, large and inviting. It was more contemporary and newer with sofa/reading area and free internet computers. Still, we loved our little cubby-hole and would definitely stay there again! It isn't a 4-star hotel but we were open minded enough to enjoy the old world charm. It's CLEAN and feels very safe. Those are the things that are important and oh... the price was good too. About $70ish a night. -Mae</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel in mid-September for 3 nights prior to our Alaskan cruise. It is centrally located in an upscale hotel area. We were able to walk to all the downtown sites and got the bus at the next block to go to the Ballard Locks. The desk staff were professional and efficient. Although we arrived early (1pm) our room was ready and we received an envelope with our itunes card (for booking on the web) and our key immediately. The bellhop took our heavy luggage down the few steps to the elevator and offered his future assistance with any tourist questions. Our room was small but comfortable. It was located at the end of the hall away from the elevator and facing the Seattle Library which is itself an architectural attraction. There wasn't any desk but it did have a club chair and ottoman for relaxation. The bed was very comfortable with higher point linens. The bathroom was also small but well appointed with toiletries and guest bathrobes. An unexpected perk was the complementary wine reception between 5-7pm. It was a real treat to be offered a glass of wine each night on our return. It was held on the mezzanine where we mingled with other guests or took our glasses to our room to enjoy while preparing to go out to dinner. It was a pleasure to stay at this hotel and I would recommend it to all Seattle visitors.</p></li>

Never being to Seattle before, I had to go with the online info to make my reservations....chose this hotel because the price was average and the online pics made it look very clean and friendly. Yeah.............NO! First off, we got in and the room had wallpaper peeling off the walls! The floors and bathroom were far from "clean".....there was MAN HAIR in my tub and I didnt have a MAN with me !!! Gross.........and there was a towel missing both nights so be sure to mention this to front desk so they dont CAHRGE YOU!! The rooms were small but this could handle because the online booking mentioned this...if only they had made mention of the other "attributes" My second night I met up with my husband so I went from a two double bed room to a King bed room. Not much better!! In fact aside from the stained pillows that "decorated" the bed, the dust was horrid, the bathroom had really bad rust in the tub and my TOILET SEAT WAS CHIPPED!! I mean honestly people, why should I spend over 100.00 a night for a room that cant buy a toilet seat once an a while! I was rudely awoken at 2am to the neighbours going at it! The walls were SOOO thin I could hear every conversation on either side of us going on in separate rooms! I will NEVER stay here again.......... Beware!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband & I stayed here a couple of weeks ago & were severly disappointed. First....we arrived in a lifted 4x4, they suggested we park 3-4 blocks away (they're not prepared for that even though we were in Seattle, really?). Second....they went ahead & accepted the truck, the valet could barely drive. Third....they say wine reception HA, they had wine glasses & no wine. Fourth....our room was so small (even when they said it was the largest they had) there's no way we could both move around at the same time. Fifth....when I went into the restroom there was dried blood on the door, can you say Bio-Hazard (gross). Sixth....I went down to retrieve something out of our truck only to find it with the passenger window down & every door unlocked (we had 2 Co. laptops in the backseat along with other professional goods, no to mention the truck itself). Lastly....when I brought the truck issue to the clerks attention, the best they could do was offer a budget breakfast from the in house coffee house. The next morning upon checkout I informed the manager on duty of ALL the complaints, he replied that the regional manager would be calling me about our aweful experience at their facility, 2 1/2 weeks later I still haven't heard from anybody! Don't waste your time or money. The best thing about this place is it's an easy walk downhill to the pier & all the wonderful things it has to offer! Good luck walking back uphill!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at this hate for the weekend of 4th - 7th Feb 2005. I booked the hotel some time ago, before some of the negative comments so upon re-checking the website before I set off I was a little apprehensive about what to expect. We arrived late and were greeted by a rather unfriendly bellboy, not the end of the world but certainly a long way of a warm welcome. Our room was fine, we’d been upgraded to a king and it was fairly comfortable. In the morning however I noticed that the bathroom hadn’t really been cleaned all that well. I would stay the standard of cleanliness was debatable, not too bad though if you’re not fussy. Having been out and about all day my husband and I returned ot the room around 4pm, and it was a cold inside as it was outside. I check with reception nd they said that they have to turn the heating off during the day to prevent the system from overheating! What! Heating came back on at 8pm. Another point to note was that the walls are very very thin. Our neighbours were watching Bridgett Jones; we managed to hear every word, given that I’d seen the film before I wasn’t so excited about hearing it again at 11pm. On a positive the location was great. The hotel cost $89 a night (booked directly – no breakfast) although I did notice Expedia had rooms going for $79 a night. We didn’t’ spend an awful lot of time in the hotel, I do think you get what you pay for, nothing more nothing less.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My bf and I stayed for two nights in July 2011. We booked online and got a decent rate for a Deluxe King with wine reception. We were able to drop off our bags at 10am and park the car in the parkade. Upon our check in around 4 pm we discovered that there is no such thing as a "wine reception". They haven't started that program yet!!! False advertising...... Not that it's a huge deal, but c'mon...take it off the website. The room was pretty small, but really....we were only there to sleep. The bathroom was slightly larger than a medium closet. And there was no fan. Which is bizzarre. Maybe this is why a lot of the reviewers complain about the musty smell. Thanks to TA we brought a scented candle :) The bed was comfortable. Room temperature was perfect. We were supposed to have free wifi in the room, but alas.....there was no signal in the room. In the stairwell there was perfect reception, but not the room. In the morning i was able to pick up the Kimpton's signal from across the street. We complained three times about it. Apparently they rebooted the server, but that obviously didn't work. We had an iPad, iPhone and Blackberry...none of them were getting the hotel's signal. Not terribly impressed about that. But again...we were only there to sleep. But don't advertise things you don't have. The location was perfect. Close to Pike Place, the waterfront, the Ferries...... I would stay again, but only if I got a really good deal.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Stay away from room 801!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Executive is a good hotel for the price. Don’t go expecting anything fancy but the location is wonderful and the rooms are fine. However there are a few things about this hotel that are not mentioned when you book a room that are important to know. First of all the hotel parking lot is almost 30 dollars a night. Second they do NOT have any sort of AC until May. Thirdly, and in my opinion, most importantly do not stay in room 801. The 8th floor is hot, stuffy, and gets very little ventilation. The 8th floor is very hot and and with no AC it is kind of an uncomfortable stay. Also you have to keep the window open, which happens to overlook the parking lot, which means it is also very noisy. However the one thing that was just ridiculous was the room, 801. We were booked in this stuffy and warm room with no AC, but that was bearable. However, 801 is also adjacent to the elevator motor. If you stay in this room I guarantee you will hear the grind of the motor starting every time someone uses it. Therefore we had the window open, the motor of the elevator, and drunks in the hallway (not the hotels fault), all night. Was my worst hotel night stay ever (and that includes sketchy hostels in Europe). However when I called the front desk at 4 am crying because I couldn’t sleep they moved me promptly. Therefore my biggest advice to people staying here is to request any floor but the 8th and DO NOT stay in room 801 unless you like constant noise. I cannot fathom why they do not rent this room sparingly.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One of my favorite things about staying at this particular hotel is that it isn't pricey and the location is great. It's literally a block or two away from the station (I took the Link Rail from Sea/Tac to Downtown in 30 minutes for only $2.50). It's a short 5 to 8 minute walk to Pike Place, a MUST SEE if you're going to be in Seattle for any reason. The location is also perfect if you're wanting to go to nice restaurants and close to several interesting bars. It is also a 8 to 10 minute walk to the two malls: Westlake Center and Pacific Place. As I spent most of the time in Seattle wandering around and taking in the sites, I was only in my hotel room late at night and in the early morning. The hotel was fairly nice, it wasn't dirty or gross, but it wasn't like I was expecting anything too luxurious and I wasn't disappointed. The only real complaint I have about the place is that the rooms get a bit too hot and stuffy. The weather outside was nice and cool and the temperature in the room was the opposite. The first night, I turned on the a/c thinking it would cool some while I slept, but I woke up several times because it was hot and had to sleep without a blanket. I was able to open the window a few inches, and even left it open the entire day while I was out, but the room's temperature was still a little uncomfortable. Other than that, the staff was really friendly. I asked someone at the front desk about good bars and restaurants to go to and he provided me with a map and circled all his favorite places. His suggestions were wonderful!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed only one night in a Superior Queen room with one of the hotel's "Hot Escape" rates, August 2011. I was in Seattle, sadly only for one night, to meet my sister in law and niece who were coming to visit from Munich. I must say the hotel was perfectly fine. The front desk staff were superb; nice, friendly and professional (typical of Pacific Northwest people). We were in different rooms types on separate reservations but were accomodated on the same floor of the hotel. The room was great, looking out on Spring Street. It was a little careworn, but very clean and the bed, built in drawers and other furniture was in good condition. The hotel was obviously older and had lots of interesting places to put things. The bathrobes in the closet are always a nice touch. The bathroom was very nice, on the small side, but well appointed (shower/tub combo was great). I don't need a huge bathroom, since it is only used for a very limited number of necessities; however there was plenty of shelf space to put toiletries, etc. on. We didn't use the inhouse restaurant, but did have a lite breakfast in the Seattle's Best Coffee shop in the hotel. The hotel's location is wonderful!!!! We parked the car (using the self park option in the garage right next door) and didn't need it at all for the day and a half we were in Seattle. You can walk everywhere, so convenient to everything. Slept well the one night as the bed was comfortable and check out the following day was easy. We stored our bags for much of the day without a hitch. I would stay again next visit to Seattle, location, rate and comfort were all A+.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel Nov 25-29th, and this is our 3rd time staying here. This is a great hotel because not only does it have an awesome location in the downtown area of Seattle, but it also has a coffee shop basically in the hotel, and the coffee is great. Plus if you don't like that coffee shop...just walk down the street about a block and there is a Starbucks! One thing we love about this hotel is the fact that you can pretty much walk anywhere from this hotel, no need for taxi rides! We had reserved online with the advance purchase and got 20% off plus when we arrived and asked if it was possible to get an upgrade to a king size room, it was free! The bed was very comfy, the tv was good, alittle small, but it had cable tv, the room itself was clean and had everything we needed...one thing that would good in the rooms would be a mini fridge for drinks. The bathroom is nice, it was a little small, but it was clean & have everthing we needed. A couple bonuses that we liked was a safe in the room as well as free wi-fi in our room! One thing to be aware of (we were not) is that you will be charged for all local calls. We did not know this, and when we got a bill at the end of our stay, I did dispute the charges because for one thing we were not told about this and also many of the calls we made had not been answered, so we felt we should not be charged. The Manager was great, and did discount the charge by half, which was good, but just beware...don't make any local calls at the hotel! Our room faced Spring Street and could be alittle noisy at night, but its the city, and most hotel rooms are noisy in the city. Overall this is a great place to stay for comfort, value and location!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Reminded me of the Tower of Terror at Disney”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we stayed in the hotel while we had four days in Seattle between July 25 and July 29. It was the only one available when we booked through United vacations. Other unavailable possibilities are located close by. My first impression when we arrived from the airport at 1am was that the decor was dull and dreary, and our mood wasn't helped by the necessity to drag our cases down a small flight of steps to reach the elevator. The overall decor of the hotel and the room reminded me of the build up to the "Tower of Terror" ride at Disney -- dark, less than welcoming, with an old fashioned lift. The room on the 8th floor was ok, but there were black marks on the lower part of the walls where items, or feet, had inadvertently connected. Our room was also too close to the lift, and we could hear the lift mechanism. Like some other reviewers, we could hear people in the next room without much difficulty. In hindsight, maybe we should have asked for a better room, but we figured that we weren't going to be in the room much, so we'd persevere. You can't fault the location. It's right next to the city centre and the public market, and the tour buses pick you up from the hotel. There are some good restaurants within two or three blocks, because the hotel only has a coffee shop. We fell in lucky, we were in Seattle on the night of the excellent Torchlight procession (unintentionally). There's 900,000 people live in Seattle, and half of them must have been in the procession! The people are nice and friendly, the trips we had were excellent, but the next time we go to Seattle, we won't be staying at the Exec Pacific -- unless the owners put their hands in their pockets and pay for a much needed major refurbishment. It's a waste of an excellent location in a friendly city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my second time staying at this hotel; I travel to WA every few months for business and will not be staying at this hotel again. Not that it was the worst place Ive ever stayed, but as a solo female traveler I didn't feel comfortable. The staff is kind and quick with checking guests in but when I got up to my room there were a few issues that I wouldnt have expected - the pillow covers and duvet were dingy and looked stained; like they could have used a good bleaching or perhaps the hotel should invest in a new set. One of the lamps in the room did not turn on at all, and the window facing the main street wouldnt open. There was a small window in the bathroom that when opened did not have a screen and was close to a floor of the parking gagarge. It wouldnt have been difficult for someone to climb from the garage to the window and in - being a solo female traveler this is not something I would want to worry about. The mattress was lumpy and worn, with deep indends on the left and right that had been worn in over time with a high stiff ridge in the middle. The hotel could have if not purchsed newer mattress', flipped the ones they have to ensure a more comfortable nights sleep. Parking is in the Olimpic Garage, a short walk around the corner, but you have to take a short flight of stairs up to the elevators that take you to the parking levels - not comvieniet with luggage. The rental car I had for the trip was also broken into in the parking garage which has no cameras and is not well patroled. There was broken window glass in other parking spaces and all the staff of the garage did was sweep it up. When I notified an attendent my vehicle had been broken in to and items stolen he just shrugged and walked away. For the cost of the room and parking (nearly $200 for one night) it wasnt worth the hassles and condition of the room.</p></li>
