<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved my stay at Le Meridien in Dallas. The room was a very good size given the price that I paid for it, it was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The pool and Jacuzzi were perfect temperatures and relaxing as well. It is right by a very nice mall. Given the price of this hotel along with the quality of the rooms I am surprised that this hotel is not in the top 20 recommendations in Dallas on here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel lobby has modern decor. It is situated just a block away from Galleria, however it is not too far from some bad neighborhood. Check with front desk if you feel like walking in the evening, which direction "not to go". The rooms are specious with the modern decor. The bed was OK but pillows were least comfortable. I requested for another pillow but I was told that the hotel sold out and no softer pillows were available.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was thoroughly disappointed in my stay at Le Meridien. The service was poor. No one offered to carry our bags, no door man, check-in attendant rude. When we got to the room the A/C didn't work. They came to "fix" it, still didn't work. I was offered no compensation. The room in general looked 'tired'. I will not stay here again. I paid almost $200 for a large suite for the night. Better off staying at a Holiday Inn than this dump.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I like this area of Dallas and it was very useful for our travels. We were on the 8th floor on the inside, and the bed and room were spacious and comfortable. I'd be weary of a lower level inside room though as it could get noisy depending what's going on downstairs. Nice staff, who was helpful, but the cost of the parking considering the area is pretty absurd, but I've yet to find a good hotel with reasonable parking. But outside unsecured parking for $18 is pretty silly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here Labor Day weekend 2010 just for a quick getaway to Dallas. I was very impressed! It was clean, elegant, and the service was very good. The location for leisure can't be beat. We walked 5 minutes and we were in the Galleria. The only downside was the apparent lack of circulating air in the room. It didn't seem like we could get the fan to come on. Also, the booking price was cheap, but by the time we parked for 2 nights, had room service and two meals, we spent an additional $170.</p></li>

The dinner was also wonderful. We had the ribeye steak and it was cooked to perfection!! The service was impeccable. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and this was our first time at Le Meridien but will definitly not be our last. I read the other reviews previously and was a little weary of the hotel. However this was not the case. You will not be disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I must have just arrived in a cranky mood the last time I stayed here, because this time everything was great. My room was so spacious and hip, I felt like i was in a one-bedroom bachelorette pad. Everyone was very helpful, friendly, and professional - from the bell staff to the front desk to the restaurant. I spent hours at the huge Galleria mall directly across the street. And my room was quiet -- i slept like a log. Meanwhile, it's about half the price you would pay for all of this elsewhere. So i'm now a fan.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great place to stay. It has a modern atmosphere. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, with an interesting layout that includes a seating area. The bed was comfortable; certainly a critical point for any hotel. On the tech front it offers a swivel mount flat screen TV with easily accessible ports, an iPod/iPhone dock alarm clock, and free in-room wifi. The front desk staff was pleasant, and helped us several times during our stay. (Thanks, Jenna!) We will certainly be back next time we're in the area!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got a steal on our rooms at this hotel, and I'm glad that we had the chance to experience it. The modern look was great and easy on the eyes. The location is directly across the street from the Galeria with the Valley Mall less than a mile away which makes this hotel a great place to stay for shop-aholics. The staff was courteous and accommodating. The rooms were larger than expected and well kept. The only complaint was that the pool (located on the lower level) seemed small and was constantly over-run with children.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">WE decided to stay at Le Meridien GAlleria because the proximity to the mall but not attached to it which would have cost much more. Rooms are extremely spacious and very clean and well decorated and appointed. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is because some of the services I always expect from this chain like spa were absent. None the less, if you are staying at this property it's because you are in Dallas to shop and therefore out of the hotel most of the day anyway. If I return to Dallas this is where I want to stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 3 nights at Le Meridien for our 13th anniversary. It was so nice and we were so pleased with the room. The room was clean and comfortable. The price was also good, at $104 per night. Our only complaints were the charge for parking. It's just an outdoor lot- why not include for free? Also I would liked the ice bucket filled each day. I left a note to that effect next to the tip, but it did not happen. Otherwise the service, cleaning, turn down, etc... was excellent. Olga did a fine job. We would definitely stay there again. Awesome location.</p></li>

Their valet works hard, its just bad policy by Le Meridien.... The rooms are cool and big, but honestly I would rather deal with a nicer Holiday Inn Express. This hotel needs tremendous work on their parking policy or at least have free parking for their local guest.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for the weekend and found the room and the facilities to be wonderful. The hotel is very comfortable throughout. The rooms are huge and the TVs are 42 inch plasmas!! The pool was freezing cold but nice and the workout room is ok (not very big or much equipment) The best part about the hotel was the staff. They were all very friendly and professional at every moment. Beware -the parking is 18 dollars per day. You can park across the street at the Galleria mall for free but the hotel will charge you anyway. I did get them to remove that charge very easily.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, right next door to galleria mall so easy asscess to shopping. We paid $50 for this room on priceline and we have stayed in many 4* hotels in dallas through the years, but I must say this was one of my favorites. Usually when you get a room on priceline you get the rooms they don't want to give anyone else Not the case at this hotel. We were put in a suite on the top floor. Large room with furniture, nice flat screen tv, and the decor was amazing. The hotel was not large, but easy to access anything you needed. I will stay at this hotel again for sure!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was thinking that all of the reviews that I saw and the rate I got were too good to be true.....I was WRONG! The hotel was very nice, the staff was helpful, responsive, and courteous. The room was HUGE considering the price we paid and similar hotels in the area. You do have to valet your car for $20 per day, but if you figure it into the price of the hotel, it is STILL a great deal, plus, who doesn't love valet? My girlfriends and I are definately going to stay there again and I am going to find the wall paper that they have in the restrooms and use it in my house.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Le Meridien Dallas for 3 nights for work. The hotel was recently renovated and it is very trendy and nice. I got a 2 bed suite and the room is huge. It's nicely decorated and things are clean and neat. The hotel is right next to the Galleria mall which is good. If you are willing to walk a bit you will see a CVS somewhere. The bar and restaurant are right down stairs where you can see from your floor. It's fun to look down but it gets pretty noisy at night. The other complain is that you have to go with their valet parking which cost you 18 bucks per night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here (7-month daughter and I) with my husband (who stays here 1/month) while he was here for business nearby. It was a very convenient location across from galleria and Starbucks a block away. We used their crib and luckily rooms are very large and can easily accommodate our family. The interior is an odd style, all rooms fave inward towards bar/lobby so we could at times hear lobby noise but really not bad. I found housekeeping to be a bit slow (left room at 1030a, back at 445p and not cleaned yet) but did a nice job each day. We enjoyed saltwater pool and hot tub one day.</p></li>

My husband had the best martini he has ever had; my caesar salad was the best I've ever eaten. The staff is above and beyond helpful, knowledgeable, and welcoming. The rooms are funky -- retro and fun with lots of space and storage, along with free Wifi, refrigerators, and huge plasma TV's. The beds are wonderfully comfortable. The Galleria and other shops are well within walking distance -- Macy's is right across the street. I love this hotel!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I were looking for a relaxing weekend in Dallas. If you want to shop this is a great location; however if you want to relax, not so much. The valet parking always seems understaffed here because it is mandatory. The room was as clean as to be expected, but the bed was harder then what we like. The restaurant/bar's waitress seemed less then happy to be there and the food is nothing to brag about. Our room service breakfast was on time, but cold. Who wants to eat cold eggs and English muffins? The indoor pool is tucked away at the bottom corner and gets to a max depth of about five feet.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am in Dallas very frequently for work and for years have stayed at the Dallas Sheraton North but our company is now using Le Meridien instead. Decor is very nice-modern and my room was huge! The issue was the noise level in the evening/night. After a long day of travel I wanted to go to bed early but the noise coming from the bar/lobby area (although I was on the 8th floor!) was incredible and prevented me from sleeping until after midnight. The issue appears to be with the open concept hallways that allow all of the noise on the first level to travel up. Value was good for the money however overall.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The lobby of the hotel is very sheik. Check in was easy and the staff very friendly. My suite was huge with a full sitting area and separate bed room. My only MAJOR complaint that it was almost impossible to sleep at night due to the smoke alarm bright green light on all night right above the bed. That and the funky new age bright alarm clock made sleeping next to impossible. I ended up sleeping on the couch in the other room to avoid all the lights. If you visit this location I suggest you bring along some black electrical tape to cover the smoke alarm light. Room service was good as it should be for the price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Well you get what you pay for and we had booked a special rate for one night with Hotwire.com. The hotel was pretty and in a good location close to highways for travelers, but it smelled funky seemingly due to poor air circulation. When we were shown to our room the smell was even worse--kinda musty with an acrid, smokey scent. I called and had us switched to another room on a different floor only to find it was the same. Gross. It was quiet though, and the decor was different, more modern. I just couldn't get over the smell. The service was ok--no free parking though, and there never seemed to be enough staff on duty.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this room via hot-wire and they are normally spot on with their star ratings... This was a huge miss... The hotel was not clean, they gym is a joke, no outdoor pool for sunning, the pool is indoors in a basement and reeks of chlorine. This stay was so bad, that even though I paid in advance for 4 nights, I checked out after only one night and stayed at another property... It was that bad and the hotel staff was not accommodating at all. There were only two vending machines and both were out of bottled water and they had none in the hotel... Would never recommend this hotel to anyone... At best this is a 3 star property.</p></li>

While traveling with my husband for a getaway weekend I was treated with great customer service at an amazing property. Not only was this hotel beautiful, it was a great experice from start to finish. I have to say the valet department was a huge pluss. To be greated upon arival with such a high level of service and professionalism made the biggest difference in our stay. There were a few guys from this department and their supervisor that really made our stay. All I can say is if your looking for a great place in Dallas that has a very high level of service. Stay at Le Meridien you wont regret it!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here as part of Super Bowl traveling team. Sky high rates but then every hotel in town jacked up the rates. Room was spacious with work counter, free wi-fi, empty fridge ready for my own things, and good bed. Hotel was a bit weak on the bathroom toiletries, including leading someone else's hair conditioner in the room for me to toss upon check in. Don't like the valet only parking arrangement which was a drag. Restaurant was so -so, much better to walk across the street to Galleria Mall and find a spot in the shopping center. Room service only available at limited hours - if you arrive early/late, don't expect much in terms of options.</p></li>

If you're traveling for business you won't feel the costs, but if it's for pleasure this can really affect the budget.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at this property 3 times and will stay again. It is across the street from the Galleria Mall and a couple of blocks from Valley View Mall. I love the atmosphere and modern decor. I Love: the room layout, decor, spacious rooms, flat screen tv that pulls out from the wall and swivels, ipod dock, elevators move fast. I also love the price! can't beat it. Be aware of additional parking fees for self parking and valet. If you use valet parking, be sure and tell them not to park your car under a tree! The birds will make a horrible mess!! Don't stay in room 510. its next to the "associate lounge" so people are going in and out of there all night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After looking for a nice hotel for a girl's weekend, I stumbled upon Le Meridien. For the price, I was very impressed. Our suite was very spacious and had plenty of room for all of us to be comfortable. The beds were extremely comfortable. The location of the hotel is great for shopping at The Galleria, but it is a little drive to downtown. However, it was in a nice area and we felt safe at all hours. The service was just okay. Nothing spectacular, but not terrible. The atmosphere definitely caters to women (pink, black and white- feminine decor). It's modern and has a sexy vibe. We enjoyed the look of the hotel, the location and comfort. Overall, it was a nice weekend stay.</p></li>

Once I arrived for check-in, my room was not even ready. I was upset at first but then was settled when they offered a compensation for my having to wait much longer than expected. AWESOME! Le Meridien really does care about their customers. This place is very pretty and very modern. The pool is extremely small and I did not get to enjoy it. Really that's the only flaw I have to mention other than the room situation. But other than that, Spencer at the front desk was wonderful! Taylor the valet was great! Josh from Palette was super!

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Renovated hotel - skimped on odd things like the elevator panel. Room was pretty big, a couple of sticky spots on the carpet. Location is average, behind the mall facing a parking structure and you have to make u-turns coming in from the freeway (from DFW) AND when leaving to get back on the freeway (to DFW), which can be annoying. Service was hit or miss - housekeeping staff was great, some at the front desk were less helpful than others. A few didn't care at all. No upgrades for SPG Gold members. Worst was the valet parking - not necessary in North Dallas. Free internet was a nice perk, but kept disconnecting me. Wouldn't return to this SPG property - there are better choices out there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed at this hotel for a handful of times now, and though the bathroom floors could be a bit cleaner (hair, water stains), I have found the hotel to be a very comfortable place to stay with large rooms, great toiletries (Cinq Mondes), and quiet. The suites are usually very tidy, and bright. The staff is usually very accommodating. The only thing that I would like that other Le Meridiens offer as a service is a free shoe shine and Financial Times which are not available. The gym is very nice, but the smell of the chlorine from the neighbouring pools could cause some nausea. There is also no self parking available. If you're looking for a hotel with less foot traffic, this is the one for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I absolutely love the decor and comfort that Le Meridien has to offer. Its very modern and easy on the eyes. I live about an hour away and often come here to relax and enjoy short staycations! I have also fallen in love with the absolutely fabulous martinis that your awesome mixologist/bartender/navigator Bryant makes. He is always very friendly and quick to jump on my indecisiveness as far as what I want to eat or drink. He is also very informative to me as well as other guests on cool places to go visit in the area. Overall this hotel is a wonderful experience and far better than its competition such as the dreaded hilton across the road. Bryant as well as other staff members make each experience enjoyable !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel seems to me to be trying to be what it's not. What it is is a reasonably-priced tourist hotel next to a popular mall. What it is not is a luxury property, or even a comfortable one. The room was poorly soundproofed; we heard guests in the hall and elevators going up and down all night. Except when the HVAC was on, which was remarkably loud. The room lacked a dresser or drawers for putting things away. Most unfortunately, our room did not receive any cleaning service - we had to call at 10 PM to ask to have someone come to tidy the bathroom. Attempts to make the property funky (huge TV, nifty wallpaper, etc.) did not compensate for noise and lack of service. I'd take the latter over the former any day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a cool place to stay. The rooms were huge with a nice bathroom, refrigerator, nice pull out LCD TV, couch - living area, and okay bed. The staff seemed very young and inexperienced. They were not rude just seemed a little unsure of things. Had a slight issue at check in but it eventually got handled. The $18 parking would suck but you can park just across the street in the galleria parking lot for free and seems safe. There is plenty to do and lots of places to eat at the galleria as well which was a big benefit. We did not swim however the pool is indoor and looked like a nice well kept area. Overall I would for sure stay here again and this should be rated a 4 star easily. I will try and book again soon!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has only been open about 6 months, so it still has the new feel. More importantly, the hotel is really well thought out. If you have ever stayed in a room that was work unfriendly, you know what I mean. The room is perfectly laid out with a large work area. There is a wide screen at the end of the work area. There is plenty of room to relax as well. As for an INSIDE room. it is quieter and it provides you a view of everything in the lobby for who is at the bar to your car being pulled up by the valet. It is ideally located close to the Galleria and many great restaurants. The staff is exceptional. They went out of their way to make sure that all was going well. This will be our base location in Dallas from now on.</p></li>

Although the hotel is not necessarilly geared toward children we were made to feel welcome w/them in tow (although they are well behaved). We had breakfast at the restaraunt which was excellent. There was no children's menu,per se, but when we ordered for the children the waiter did suggest a "child's portion" which was more than enough for them and less expensive. The location can't be beat. It is in North Dallas/Addison near the Galleria and World Market and a lot of great restaraunts. The room was excetptionally clean,comfortable and chic..</p></li>

I did request toothpaste and I was told that it might be awhile because I am the only one down here??? Full service hotel and you are the only one working??? The positives - The server in the bar named Maria or Marie was wonderful, she was always smiling and making sure your drink was full.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For the price we paid, I would not complain ever! A 4 star hotel with a one night stay for about 75 dollars. Normal price everywhere else was around 180 a night. Beautiful lobby, very open, beautiful European/modern look inside and out. Check/in desk was very small, I like seeing a long check in desk, with many people working behind it... Maybe it was Colombus day thats why it was understaffed. Otherwise everything was perfect at this hotel. Comfy beds nice showers, nice TV, couch, all the above. I rate it a 10/10 for price and sleep oh and the rooms we had were standard with a king size bed and it was really spacious! ONLY downfall is the valet parking, there is no free parking, and overnight parking is 20 bucks, but you can find free parking around the area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recommended Le Meridien Dallas North to some of my out of town friends - my best friend lives next door @ Villa Piana - so the location was great & they could walk to the Galleria. First, they force you to valet even if you're not staying long. They need to have a row that people can park elsewhere if they want to. Second, the power kept going out & although they did apologize they could've offered free drink coupons for those of us hanging out at bar area. You could get your valet ticket validated by bartender, but the evening valet acted rude about it - trust me, wish I had the tip money back. I sent an email to the Le Meridien with no response back on these issues. I also didn't realize that they allow pets, I don't think I will ever stay there knowing that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I love the decor in this hotel; it's modern without the "cold" feel. We were in the area to visit family and the Galleria, so the location of Le Meridien is perfect! The rooms are spacious and very photogenic, and I particularly liked the glass elevators and the faint underwater bubbling sound they were playing inside. Now, the cons. It's no shock to anyone that this is a pricey stay, but I hate that you end up paying more than just the expensive nightly rate. Expect to add parking fees, and if you'd like breakfast, most items are in the $10-$15 range. The bed was comfortable, but the couches as chairs are NOT. They're definitely more for show. I was happy to see a robe in the bathroom, but it was stiff and itchy. Overall, I had a pleasant stay. It's nice to splurge occasionally!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There are things that you could pick on about this hotel. The location, while right across the street from the Galleria, is not particularly scenic, surrounded by large vacant lots and surface parking. And the service was a little rough around the edges at times, although very friendly. The size and decor of the rooms more than make up for these minor shortcomings however, especially for the price. The rooms are huge, and ours (on one of the upper SPG floors) had one of the highest ceilings I have ever seen in a hotel room. The interior design is clean and modern, without being minimal or cold. The iPod dock and auxiliary inputs for the TV were a nice touch, and the bar-height table and stools would be a perfect place to get some work done. Great value overall, and highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One night stay, the valet park situation is bizarre and a joke - but the service is great and everyone seems to like their job at the hotel. Hotel is very nice, defintely 4 star or 4 diamond quality. Large room and most seem to view north dallas and the galleria but there are a few that apparently have a view of the huge atrium - which is unique and provides an international flavor. Music throughout the day seems to come from the Middle East and the crowd tended toward young affluent.. Food downstairs is nicely done in a busy kitchen that is viewed from an angle off the floor. The TV's at the bar seemed small and difficult to watch unless you were sitting right in front of them. I would return again. Nice property. Also internet did not work for me at the highest floor - but worked fine in the lobby.</p></li>

The room was large and the beds were cozy. The staff did tell us the breakfast buffet was open untill 11am, be warned this is for the weekend only and we were told this on a Monday morning so when we arrived at 10:30 we found no buffet. Although we were slightly irritated since I had called the front desk less than hour earlier to be certain of the buffet times, the restaurant staff was friendly. We ordered off the menu and were pleased with our meal. Over all a nice stay. The parking is a bit expesive, 18.00 a night but that might me common for the area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was excited about staying here during an overnight getaway. From the time you walk into the hotel, there is an overwhelming sense that everything is completely fake and staged. Its like an Ikea show room, from the furniture to the linens to the wall paper. The supposedly lush rooms felt like they were put together overnight. The bathroom was atrocious!!! The tile floor was disgusting and the bathtub/ shower was tiny! I woke up the next morning feeling even more exhausted because of the poor quality bed. To make matters worse, the staff (with the exception of the valets who were very nice) was off-standish and snotty. If I am paying 200 plus for a one night stay, It should be wonderful. I shouldn't feel like I don't deserve to be in the hotel. Over all I would never suggest Le Meridien to friends and I will NOT be staying here again. It sucked!!</p></li>

When I spoke w/front desk about entire situation, all she c/do was give me 4500 points for the entire situation!!!! Parking card didn't work and overall while everyone tried to help they didn't seem able to help effectively. Bedroom was tight sized compared to large living room.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visited the Dallas area to celebrate a friend's 30th birthday and we stayed at this property which I did not know was part of the SPG awards group. My friend was unable to get reservations, but when I called and gave my SPG member number, I was booked right away! I received the Government Rate and I was upgraded to a suite with free parking for an additinal 30 dollars, which was worth it! The room was nice, modernly furnished and roomy! The Hotel is located right across the street from the Galleria, so we were able to shop until we dropped and only have to cross the street to return to the Hotel! The Hotel Desk personnel were AWESOME and the Valets were very courteous! The Hotel was tastefully decorated and the bar was nice and we had appetizers which were also very tasty. This was my first time staying at this property and I will gladly stay there again on my next visit to Dallas!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband selected this hotel for a post-Christmas mini vacation. We liked most aspects of this hotel: The room was spacious; the staff was very helpful and friendly; the shampoo, conditioner and shower gel were wonderful; the location is amazing if you like to shop. Our biggest complaint would be that we couldn't get our room temperature below 72 degrees, which is way too hot to sleep comfortably. We were on the 11th floor, so maybe it was an issue of all the heat rising to the highest point. We could have called the front desk, but decided to tough it out since our stay was so short. The only other negative was the $20 fee for valet parking. We got such a great deal on the room that we didn't mind it too much - we would have liked to know in advance that it was mandatory. And since the wireless Internet was free (most hotels charge $10-15 a night) we recouped the valet parking cost.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed at the Le Meridien Dallas North and I give them a 10! All the staff, including the velet guys were extremely friendly and courtious. The rooms are wonderfull with not alot of junk that you don't need or won't even see during your stay. Comfortable beds, clean bathrooms and the hotel is very chic but not snobby. Room service was great and the food came within a reasonable time and everything was satisfactory. Even when I ordered breakfast at 330 am it was as I ordered it and the wait staff was pleasant. There is a charge for valet parking but it is certainly worth it especially when it's 900 degrees outside. Plus you have in and out privilages throughout your stay and if you have visitors or collegues who come to the hotel for dinner or drinks with you, their valet is complimentary. In all I HIGHLY recommend this property. Compared to some of the other similar priced hotels in the area, you get a whole lot more for your money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My friends booked a stay at Le Meridien Dallas, and we had a great stay. The hotel was in great shape and the front desk reps were very kind. The bus boy that parks your cars and takes your luggage up, put our clothes in the storage closet and left them there. That rubbed me the wrong way, however they were great and figuring out where our lost luggage was and brought it to us within 30 -45 minutes. You pay 20.00 for parking overnight so be aware of that and 5.00 for a day. We stayed in the executive suite and the room is set up awkward. Hard to explain but the tv is in the middle of the room causing you to have to lay on the far left side of the bed in order to see it. I would suggest that they reconsider the set up of the room it just did not seem to flow. Other than that, the hotel was great, the comforters on the bed are nice and plush! Very nice for a ladies weekend ...o yeah and it was VERY clean which is VERY important to me. Will definitely visit again</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's stylish and chic - but the rooms are not functional. There's no written material about the hotel in the room -really! I guess you are supposed to be so hip that your intution allows you to figure out the amenities yourself. There is not a single drawer in the room - really! There no self-parking in a suburb with an open lot outside - really! It's so obvious the mandatory $18 valet charge daily is for revenue and not for guest convenience. There is literally no place to store clothes that don't hang. So staying here for 3 days out of a suitcase was a pain and the large room look cluttered. The lack of storage was so bad that the extra toilet paper is on the closet shelf with the hairdryer. The only storage are three open shelfs in some furniture. It's nice to have a high large desk with two bar stools - but the metal chairs are so uncomfortable that I'd rather work on the floor. The bed linens are great, but the bath linens are nothing special, if you can get housekeeping to bring any.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I took a short trip to Dallas for my 40th birthday and stayed at Le Meridien because it was centrally located and close to the places I wanted to go. The room I stayed in was a Jr. Suite and it was gorgeous. It looked just like the pictures I had seen online, which isn't always the case with hotels. I opted for the pre-pay rate because it was almost $60 less per night, which made this an incredible deal. The room and bathroom were very spacious and CLEAN and decorated so cute (see pics). There was a large wall mounted TV that I loved. I ordered room service 3 times (breakfast once, dinner twice) and the food was incredible and the staff that delivered it was polite and professional. My room was cleaned each day, and I never noticed any noise at night. I slept like a baby. The parking is for hotel guests only, and I was issued a card on arrival. There was no additional charge for parking. It was truly like a mini vacation for me, and I'll never stay anywhere else when I'm in the Dallas area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Members of my extended family stayed here for a wedding weekend, and I could not have been happier. I travel for work a lot, and wish every hotel I stayed in could be this perfect. Room was large, clean, quiet, and very well decorated. Great flat screen TVs and iPod docking station. Comfy bed. Fitness center had everything I needed, and TVs on the cardio equipment. Pool and jacuzzi looked nice although I did not have time to use them. We ate in the restaurant a lot, and the service was delightful. The breakfast buffet was nice. Food was decent. Two minor complaints: the cab service is extremely spotty and slow. The hotel should warn guests to call for cabs well in advance. We asked the front desk to call a cab, and 30 minutes later he was still not there. Hotel should be aware of this problem and sort it out for guests. Also, a very kind person at the front desk, with the excellent intention of helping my parents with an early check in, referred to them as an "elderly couple." They found it embarassing.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “The only awkward part was the hooker in the elevator”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is well-suited to shoppers, as it is right across from the Galleria mall. The parking lot was well lit, athough pricey at $18/night for park-it-yourself ($24 for valet), but I felt like my car would be safe here. The lobby was nice and the staff generally helpful. We asked for a room on the top floor (10th) and it was clean and quiet. Very large for the price. As others have stated, rooms have a modern decor that is well-appointed. It had a fridge, but it is a mini bar fridge that didn't get cold at all. I think they allow pets, because I heard a little yappy dog through the wall in the morning. If not, someone did a good job smuggling in a dog. You have to use your hotel key inside the elevator to get to the floors, which is a nice feature. The only awkward experience was the man meeting the (obvious) hooker in the elevator. She looked like a classy hooker at least... but yeah, still a hooker in a nice hotel. I know that kind of stuff happens at hotels, but I'd rather not be anywhere near it.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for the better part of two weeks in April and think this is an undervalued hotel. It doesn't cost that much, but the rooms are quite large, comfortable and well-kept. It's not as fancy as the Westin Galleria across the street, but it also costs a lot less too. As a Starwood Platinum member, I'm not sure whether I was upgraded to a suite or not (they never said) but the rooms I received were in line with actual suites at many other hotels I've stayed at, so it frankly reflects well on the hotel if I wasn't actually given an upgrade. No other benefits for Platinum folks though. Room service was fast and tasty enough (as far as room service goes), but you can always walk to the Galleria to get a lot more dining options. The hotel only offers valet parking, which is an unnecessary $20/day charge, but the valets are pretty efficient and when I lost my ticket, they helped me find my car without making a big deal about it. I would definitely stay here again (but I must admit, if someone else is paying for it, I would opt for the nicer Westin Galleria).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a very nice "looking" hotel, but dont let the smooth taste fool you. The place is a lemon that is nicely decorated. Nothing worked! The toilet in my second room kept over flowing every time we used it! When they finally sent someone to fix it (after several request), I was told that he was not sticking his hand in the toilet so if it had to be done, my party and I better start gathering volunteers right then I was in sheer horror at the hotels staffs non chalant attitude. After the so called fix, the thing overflowed again and no one ever came. The toilet was still overflowed at the time we checked out of the room. There were ants in the room also. When I complained to the manager, she comped one of the two rooms I'd rented. Now here I am three days after checkout, looking at my credit card statement showing I was charged again for both rooms that I prepaid before I ever checked in. They never credited my account back for the comped room and actually charged me again! Rediculously poor services and a terrible experience. Do not subject yourself to this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My worst stay at this hotel. I stay there about every 6-8 weeks, always in a suite. I have asked repeatedly not to be given room 225. So when I showed up this time what room did I get â€“ 225. Any other similar room was â€œnot available.â€� The refriferator was not working. After crawling around on the floor in a poorly lit room I figured out it was unplugged. I plugged the power in â€“ still did not work. Engineering brought a new one and said he didnâ€™t know why the other unit was there â€“ they were â€œno good.â€� Next I went for ice. The ice machines on the second floor, the third floor, and the fourth floor were all out of order. There were big holes in the closet wall as if someone had ripped the safe off the wall and no one had repaired the damage.. I hate to leave on a sour note, so I must note that, while Sr. mgmt was unreachable, the front line staff was and always is friendly and courteous. All in all, it was a distressing visit, and probably my last one. Even though Le Meridien is closer to my business and somewhat less expensive, it is back to the InterContinental for me!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Room was pretty nice. Air conditioning was kind of loud, but it didn't keep me up at night so it was no big deal. It might be a problem for a light sleeper, though. My hubby loved the 42'' TV. My main observation with this hotel was the service. There were some staff that went above and beyond, but others seemed like they were at the end of their shift and just ready to get out of there. I do want to give a special thank you to the valet gentleman who drove us to our restaurant almost 15 minutes away after the woman at the front desk forgot to call us a taxi like she said the would. Normally, that kind of mistake wouldn't really bother me, but on several occasions I observed this lady flirting with another employee and I feel like we would have made our reservation on time if her mind wasn't elsewhere... Anyway, I don't know the valet's name, but he's a black gentleman in his 50's and he was working at 9pm on the night of Saturday, April 10th. Anyway, the proximity to the galleria mall was great, the bartender was awesome, and the room was spacious and comfortable. I'll consider this place when I visit Dallas again next month.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were attending an event at the convention center, and did not want to pay downtown prices, so we looked for a hotel that was a bit further out. The Le Meridien was just fantastic. It took only 10-15 minutes to get to downtown and is directly across from the mall and several restaurants. It is also within walking distance to a movie theater. Our check in process was perfect. There is a constant "clean" smell as you walk into the hotel, and everything looks just very "crisp". Tony at the front desk made sure to take very good care of us. Our room was ready right away. When we went to our rooms, they were both just wonderful. There is nothing that I can think of to make them any better. They too were very "crisp and clean". While staying at the hotel. The handle on my shower needed to be repaired. It was done within five minutes of me informing the front desk. The hotel is very modern, and it seems that there is nothing that has been overlooked. There is free wi-fi throughout the hotel, and free computers in the lobby to use. The staff made the stay. The would totally bend over backwards for the guests. We will stay here again for sure!!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A fav place to stay when in Dallas, LARGE rooms!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When we have to do an overnight in Dallas, we usually select to stay at Le Meridien for a number of reasons. First, with a family of 5 the rooms are ginormous! There is plenty of room to move around, the bathroom is very large as well. We generally go online and "bid" for this property as it usually takes our very low bid for a 4 star property near the Galleria. Speaking of the Galleria, it's right across the street from Macy's parking garage. It is rather enjoyable to stroll the 50 yards to great shopping without having to fuss about a parking space. On the down side, all guests must valet park their car to the tune of $20 per night however, the valet staff are very friendly and helpful. There also are no fans in the very large bathroom. The ambiance is very European, little wonder since Le Meridien is also located in many European cities, including one in Paris. The decor of the hotel is au courant, with a black & white theme and purple accents. They had a composer create a 24 hour loop of music that is reflective of all cultures as well as environments. I've recommended this hotel to many people as the quality for the value can't be beat.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you arrive in the daytime, the white walls show their wear, the decor is a little harsh, and the trendy vibe seems a bit too IKEA. I checked in late afternoon, sun streaming in and the room looked dingy, every defect showed. But like most things, when you hit evening and dim down the lights, it's much prettier. So when I returned later that night, the turn-down service had left me a dessert treat, turned on ambient lighting, and the room was actually quite beautiful. Note - housekeeping is lacking as of June 2011, bathroom floor was very unclean, I will spare you the detail, but they did come in and clean it for me. The coffee maker had used coffee pods in the water reservoir which was gross, but again, front desk came through and delivered a small pot of coffee prior to my 6AM call, which was a fine solution. In summary - trendy decor like a Zen inspired IKEA concept, responsive staff, generous room size, very nice towels, firm but comfy bed, small saltwater pool in the basement, decent size workout room. The downside: inadequate housekeeping, hefty fee for valet parking (required, no free or self park). For the money, I'd pick the Westin next door as a first choice for overall quality.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I will never stay at this hotel again! After using Hotwire to reserve the hotel, with their feature where you do not see the hotel name/info until you pay, I began doing research on the hotel. I was VERY disappointed to find that the hotel requires you to pay $20 for a MANDATORY valet parking. When asking the "Guest Services" employee, over the phone, about this policy she was very short with me and quite rude. The manager said he'd "take care of things", but did absolutely nothing - so he's just as useless as she was. We had a bottle of wine, as we were celebrating our anniversary, but had forgotten to bring a wine opener. We called down to the front desk, and my wife spoke to a manager who said it would be no problem to get the opener up to our room. Over 1 1/2 hours later I called back and was told one would be sent right up - which it was, 30 minutes after that call. Aside from all of that, the bed was as hard as my cheap $200 mattress I sleep on at home - my wife and I both woke up in pain. This hotel is extremely medicore in quality, and extremely dirt poor in service. I will NEVER ever stay there again - and will make sure and tell anyone I know to stay away as well. Word of mouth can kill a business.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed in this hotel for 9 nights. It's location is excellent, the galleria mall is a stone's throw away. The only other positive is that the rooms are large in size. We are SPG members and frequently stay in SPG hotels but after this experience we will tear up our memberships. The hygiene in the hotel was poor. There were bad BO odours in many areas including the elevators at all times. Our room was large and pleasant in cheap modern decor but it had not been thoroughly cleaned in months. You could easily see a thick layer of dust on the carpets, particularly along the edges of the room. On complaining to the duty manager he viewed the dirt and organised his cleaning supervisor to clean the room herself which in all fairness she did beautifully. During our long stay here we requested for the same supervisor to clean our room several times. The main cleaning staff appear over worked and barely manage a superficial wipe down of the surfaces. The hotel should make standards of hygiene a priority. Secondly they should make customer service a priority. The staff were polite and friendly but really average. This hotel is a glorified economy travel lodge. Not what you would expect for SPG in the States.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my first time staying at Le Meridien Dallas. I usually stay at the Westin Park Central (well recommended) but it was booked. Location wise, this place is in a good spot - close to local businesses and of course the Galleria Mall. I arrived at the hotel at midnight and was annoyed that valet parking was the only option there for $20/night. So I parked across the street as other reviewers have. Decor of the hotel and my room were very hip and modern. They gave me a nice spacious room. However, I was annoyed that the remote didn't work. I called down to the front desk and engineering wasn't around at that time to replace it. Then I discovered the toilet paper holder was practically falling off the wall so it was slanted down. The soap dish rack was also broken in that wasn't fastened to the shower wall properly. Albeit minor, these things don't make for a good impression for a hotel that you'd consider more upper-tier. Their elevators have "soundscapes" - instead of literally elevator music, I heard rainfall one night and crickets last night. Loudly. Overall, for the value, it's a good place to stay. The hotel just needs to pay attention to the detail and make sure the rooms are in working order! And get rid of the valet-only option!</p></li>

<li>I arrived at the hotel at midnight and was annoyed that valet parking was the only option there for $20/night.</br>
<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 0.955&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>So I parked across the street as other reviewers have.</br>
<span style="background-color:#911eb4">LOCATION</span>: 0.922&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Decor of the hotel and my room were very hip and modern.</br>

<li>They gave me a nice spacious room.</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 0.944&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>However, I was annoyed that the remote didn't work.</br>
<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 0.989&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>I called down to the front desk and engineering wasn't around at that time to replace it.</br>
<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 0.975&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Then I discovered the toilet paper holder was practically falling off the wall so it was slanted down.</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 0.998&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>The soap dish rack was also broken in that wasn't fastened to the shower wall properly.</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 0.991&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>Albeit minor, these things don't make for a good impression for a hotel that you'd consider more upper-tier.</br>

<li>Their elevators have "soundscapes" - instead of literally elevator music, I heard rainfall one night and crickets last night.</br>
<span style="background-color:#e6194b">BUILDING</span>: 0.975&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>

<span style="background-color:#008080">VALUE</span>: 0.998&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>The hotel just needs to pay attention to the detail and make sure the rooms are in working order!</br>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Decent but attention to details is lacking”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Le Meridien for a Saturday night and found the hotel to be decent. It is very modern with loud music blasting upon arrival in the valet parking area - it would have been more soothing to have toned it down a bit. Everyone was friendly at checkin and the bellhop was very nice. This is a remodeled Embassy Suites and they have done a nice job of making the rooms spacious and more modern. They funtion very well for a family. However, for a full service hotel, this hotel is lacking in their attention to detail. We called housekeeping to bring us plastic cups three times in an hour and they finally arrived 1.5 hours later - note there were none in our room upon checking in. The bathtub in one of our rooms was stained yellow which was not very pleasing. There were only two bath towels in a room with two double beds. There were no instructions of how to access the internet (note that it is free wireless which is nice). In my mother's room, the clock was set an hour ahead and the alarm went off twice at 5am and then at 6am which was not a nice way to sleep in. In any event, for a cheap price, this hotel is acceptable. It is personal taste but I would prefer to spend $50 more and stay somewhere more soothing like the Westin Galleria. Also note that the valet parking is $20 and there is not another option.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A benefit of this hotel is that it is across from a huge mall-- so if your aim is to shop, this is very convenient. But the quality of the hotel is poor. Although the lobby looked very stylish and rooms were spacious, we were extremely disappointed with our visit. Our room did not have ANY drawers. . .I have never before stayed in a hotel room with no drawer space and cannot imagine what the designers were thinking. There were two shelves (one on the night table between the beds and one small one under the TV. But they were both open, so visitors to the room would see one's laundry. They were also low and dark, making it a pain to find a pair of socks. The sheets were cheap and not soft, the room had a minibar that was totally empty, cups in the bathroom were plastic. The rooms seemed cheaply built in terms of noise. We found it difficult to sleep as noise from the hallways was very loud at night. Most annoying was that our room was never made up! We came home late at night (after 10pm) and found the room had not been served. At breakfast the next morning, we learned that other guests had the same experience. We got a good rate at this hotel-- about $70 a night. I guess you get what you pay for-- and I wouldn't pay a nickel more for this place. The Westin one block away is far superior and worth the price difference.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at Le Meridien for a night with friends in September and enjoyed every moment of it. From the moment we arrived we were treated so well! With a wonderful greeting by the valet then a fast and friendly check-in (we also enjoyed picking out our own custom room key!). The room was very large with 2 extremely comfortable double beds, flat screen tv, and a lounge area with a large couch. Also, the close proximity to the Galleria is great, we enjoyed the mall quite a bit. 2 comments about the service- after a night out in Downtown Dallas my friends and I were craving some late night snacks and the room service menu didn't have much that appealed to us at the time. Since we had been drinking we were sort of stuck were we were!! We called the front desk and they suggested that we have the valet drive us to wherever we wanted to get food and then bring it back, which he happily did! I have never heard of such a thing but it was incredibly thoughtful and convenient! Also, the next morning I went downstairs to the lobby in hopes of getting some coffee and breakfast with my friend. Unfortunately the bar area had stopped serving food but we asked a man in the area and he said he would have whatever we wanted brought out to us. So, my friend and I sat in the lobby (in those great whimsical chairs) and had a leisurely morning filled with conversation, coffee, and wonderful service. I would not hesitate to go back when I return to Dallas!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Planned a "staycation" with my girlfriend for our anniversary and pricelined a room. I was excited to find a four star hotel at a good price and couldnt wait to check-in. From the first moment i had misgivings. The teenage looking kid that checked us in had never heard of a restaurant that was extremely close to the hotel and could not/would not offer us guidance as to whether driving was appropriate (no biggie). After returning from dinner, we decided to have a few drinks at the bar. It was about 1030pm when the fire alarm went off and the entire hotel evacuated. We waited outside (along with many other scared and confused people) for a while until finally a manager came out and said it was a false alarm. He offered no other explanation and most certainly did not offer anything for anyone's trouble. We decided to call it a night. Back in the room, both myself and my girlfriend had a terrible time trying to sleep (she didnt at all) because the thermostat wouldnt adjust and the room had no sound protection from an elevator that sounded like the death star preparing to fire.... when i brought up the elevator noise and the faulty thermostat the next morning (10/24/10), the short, female working the front desk's only reply was that, "[I] would know to ask not to be next to an elevator the next time [I] stayed." thanks to that moment of epically bad customer service, there will never be a next time. and ps. the men's restroom downstairs was filthy.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Impressive meal at Palette Restaurant”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We live in Dallas and dined at their restaurant for the first time. Our initial impression upon arrival was disappointment because the parking is valet only and we prefer to park ourselves. Upon entering the hotel, we discovered the restaurant was the lobby bar which was not the ambience we were hoping for and after standing around for a few minutes feeling ignored, we realized it was a seat-yourself venue. However, the place is very elegantly appointed and we did not experience any disturbing noise factor as can typically occur in a lobby or bar area. Once seated, the disappointment ceased. Our waitress was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and anything else about the hotel we were interested in. Everything we ordered was well prepared and very tasty. The fried calamari was perfectly cooked and served with an Asian type of sauce -- very unique and a delightful surprise. The pork tenderloin medallions were melt-in-your-mouth and included a light sauce that added another dimension of flavor without smothering the pork. The flank steak special was also perfectly cooked and tender. For dessert, the chocolate molton cake was recommended and we also tried their version of strawberry shortcake using a lemon poundcake. I love chocolate but this shortcake version was my favorite. I would be remiss to leave out the lemon drop martini perfectly prepared by the bartender with fresh-squeezed lemon juice and sugar rim. We'll be back and hopefully soon!</p></li>

<li>However, the place is very elegantly appointed and we did not experience any disturbing noise factor as can typically occur in a lobby or bar area.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I love Le Meridien and choose to stay here while passing through as the Westin I usually stay at had a very high rate for the evening. I paid a rate of 179 and was rather disappointed when I looked into Starwoods in the area two days later and found the same room for 79. At 179 this property was a poor value. Likes: Everyone at the property was very, very nice. Mir at checkin was quick, pleasant and professional. The valets and the guy who brought up room service were very nice. Being upgraded with my SPG Preferred status. The room was very quiet. Good location with easy access to 635 and North Dallas Tollway. The valet did get me bottled water for my drive when I asked. Dislikes This property is old and lacks the charm (local art, funky decor) of other Le Meridiens I've visited. Room service meal was not very good. I know not to expect 5 star, but I did not even eat my salad as the dressing was very mayo-y....like mostly mayo, gross. Also, they delivered the wrong dessert. But I was too tired to call down and ask them to exchange it. Also, they only brought one set of silverware, napkin for the two of us. I LOVE Le Meridiens bath products, but my bottle marked lotion actually contained shampoo. The towels were very scratchy. Paying to park (20). I could easily have parked my own car in the lot right by the front door. I rate this property as average because it is nothing special. I would stay again if I was able to find a good rate but now I know it is not worth paying in the high 100's range.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel and ammenities were decent but there were a few things that made this hotel very unlikeable. The hotel was extremely understaffed having only one person to check people in and having only one valet. Maybe they are merely accepting of the fact that people don't visit this hotel. Secondly, what little staff they had was extremely unfriendly. I was basically asked what I needed when I went to the front desk and was handed the key to my room. The third thing that irritated me was the fact that you had to pay $20 to park your own car maybe 50 feet from the entrance of the hotel. I am used to paying to park but $20 is extremely unreasonable. (TIP: If you ignore my review and just really want to stay at this hotel. Park your vehicle across the street at the Galleria. It's free!!! Tell the front desk you arrived in a cab.) Lastly, we heard strange sounds in the middle of the night coming from our restroom. We woke up the next morning to a sink filled with unimaginable substances. I was going to take a picture and post it on here but I feel as if that would be too much. Unfortunately, this hotel could be really nice because the facilities are nice and the rooms are large with most having some sort of view. I wouldn't stay here again though. Not until I can be assured they have made some changes to their business model. One more thing. Don't be the first person in the pool/hot tub in the morning. I don't know what time they get cleaned but it isn't before 10:00 a.m. We saw some strange things floating in both.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are looking for a place close to the Galleria this is it. It is directly across the street from the Galleria which is awesome because then you don't have to fight for a parking space at the mall. Downside - all parking at the hotel is valet and overnight for that is $20. The valet is quick, friendly and so are the bellmen. The hotel is also secure. After hours you need your key just to get in the main lobby doors. The elevator also requires a key and you can only navigate to your floor, the lower level (pool, fitness equipment) and the main floor. The check-in was quick and they were quick to change us from a double room (priceline.com) to a king suite at the first request. The room was decorating to beautifully in a chic decor. The bathroom is large and wonderfully decorated to match the rest of the room. The TV is huge. It has directly beneath is all sorts of "hook-ups" for AV wires, VGA cables, etc. We attached a VGA cable from my laptop to the TV and watched DVDs. We didn't try the room service and kept a Do Not Disturb sign out so I can't comment on those. The one thing I did love was the free business center. I was able to print our boarding passes and maps for the region we would be traveling to without spending a penny. Hole punch, stapler, color printer, even a how-to book for the computers operating system. Check-out was fast and easy. I didn't see any ants that the other reviews mention (something I was worried about - in fact I didn't see a single bug). Overall is was a nice experience and I would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very nice hotel, right next door to the shopping of the Galleria. I stayed in a Suite which was very nice with a separate bedroom and living room, furnishings are all modern and hip. Living area had a large business desk area, couch and a 42" plasma. Bedroom had a queen sized super comfy mattress and a 32" lcd. The bathroom was a bit disappointing, the tub appeared old and stained. The lobby is brightly lit and clean, lots of sitting area as well. The staff was super friendly, the front desk agent let me use the business center at 2am which was nice. Main level also has a bar/restaurant that are combined into one. I had buffet breakfast with my rate, it was a bit disappointing. . I wanted to load up a plate and go back to my room but the lady told me she would have to charge me $20 to take my plate upstairs so I ate in the restaurant, Nothing tasted good except the coffee to be honest. Lower level has a pool and exercise center. A few downsides to this property though.... The hotel is valet only at $20 a day. You can park next door though at the galleria...Look for the Macy's entrance, it's maybe 100 feet from the hotel entrance. This was filled with cars at 3am and there is no posted "Tow Away" signs so it didn't appear to be an issue. The suites are nice but they are only 1 bed, to get 2 beds you have to stay in a regular room. I guess mainly cause the bedroom is too small for 2 beds. The Valet staff was very understaffed, It appears the valet guys are also the bellhops... At 930pm we had to wait 10 mins to get our car, when we left there were 9 cars in line for valet.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Spacious, modern rooms but not a high-quality experience”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Here's what we liked: -Lovely lobby, quick, trouble-free check-in. -Very nice, comfortable lounge area; everyone seemed friendly and relaxed. Full bar with an experienced bartender. -Neat, modern rooms - a nice change of pace. -Rooms are large - although not billed as suites, they are much larger than the typical hotel room, including fulled size couch and chair and a counter bar/table with stools. -Comfortable bed. -Some convenient features in the rooms, including mini fridge and swiveling flat-screen TV (easily viewed from bed or living area) -Decent view and easy access to the Galleria mall. Now, for the down side: -Self parking is pretty expensive for what you get; small, barely secured, uncovered lot. There's no good place to leave the car when checking in, and the valet staff seemed disorganized and unprofessional. -Staff at the desk seemed pretty indifferent about their jobs. It wasn't a warm or friendly welcome. -The walls were extremely thin, creating noise problems even in our 10th floor, exterior room. Drunken patrons tromped up and down the hall ALL NIGHT and we heard every hoot, holler, shriek and giggle like they were in the room. Truly terrible night's sleep as a result. -Furnishings and features were just too cheap to meet expectations for a 4-star hotel. Towels were large but cheap and thin. In-room coffee was very low quality and stale. Tables were made of painted plywood . No glassware provided - just a couple of dinky plastic cups. -Bathroom needed a good cleaning. There was ground-in dirt in the high traffic areas of the floor and in the textured tub. The location is good, as is the first impression of the hotel. Don't think we'll be back, though.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Trying hard to be hip - mandatory $18 per day valet parking”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a really nice place. Beware discount travelers. You can book a room at this hotel for a competitive price online. Realize that there is only valet parking at a rate of $18 per night. There is also no vending onsite. Bring drinks and snacks or be prepared to pay at the mini bar or room service. Otherwise, the place is really nice. It is upscale and hip. The furnishings are reminiscent of IKEA style (but higher quality). I found the provided "premium" shampoos and conditioners not to be up to the hype. A coworker had to go buy their own. I found them satisfactory, but I am a short-haired male. Sometimes the hotel seems to be trying a little too hard to be hip. There is odd ambient music in the elevators. Many times I boarded the elevators with a guest that had just checked in. The look on their face when a soundtrack of chicken sounds started playing was priceless. The business center is lackluster. There are Macs that aren't fully functional (once again, hip over practicality). Also, the fax in the business center doesn't work. The rooms feature a very hand bar with stools, as well as a large flat screen tv that can be angled to any viewing position in the spacious room. Wireless internet access is marginal in the rooms. It works fine in the lobby. If you are going to need full speed internet access in the room, I suggest bringing a long cable. I like to browse while laying in bed, but my 10ft. cable wasn't long enough. On off-peak days, the wireless in the room was usable. I would consider other places if I am in Dallas on business again, but if my mission was romance with the wife, there are few places better in Dallas than the Le Meridien. It is directly across the street from the Galleria Mall, so it's also perfect for shoppers.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I were scheduled to stay at Le Meridien for a few days as part of a larger road trip across the southwest. We booked the hotel based off the rave reviews on Trip Advisor. But after staying only one night at this hotel, we had to check out and find other accommodations in Dallas. The problems started with the open concept of the hotel itself. Few reviews mention this, but the hotel is designed with an open-air concept that exposes most rooms to the expansive lobby/bar/elevator areas. The rooms are not sufficiently sound-proofed to limit the reverberant noises originating from the main floor. In fact, at 2am we heard a piece of silverware fall onto the lobby's marble floor from ten floors up. Not to mention earlier in the evening when we were subjected to loud music and crowd noise from the bar area. Bottom line, if noise is an issue for you...take note. Second, as a four-star property we expected the room to be immaculate. The bathroom floors had stray hairs in the corners; the walls and doors were worn and chipped. And the bathtub was far from new. There is a fridge in the room, but it doesn't work. Third, wireless internet service is complimentary, but when we arrived we were told that they were having server issues. In other words, no wifi anywhere in the hotel. They gave us an ethernet cord to connect in our room, but that did not work, either. The only place where the internet worked was in the business office on the main level, which was busy with fellow travelers checking their emails. The hotel staff had no idea if or when the wi-fi service would be back. The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful, and some of these issues were certainly out of their control. In fact, they understood why we wanted to check out early. But it baffles us that this property can earn a four-star rating with the kind of noise and cleanliness issues we encountered.</p></li>
