<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Little Gem Stayed at Hotel Mela at the end of March and we were well impressed. It feels like a relatively small hotel and is tucked away but just off Times Square which makes for a quiet place to relax but close to the action to sample the delights of the city. The rooms are small but extremely well appointed and comfortable which in our opinion was more important.</p></li>

The hotel is very modern and has a fantastic restaurant, Saju, attached. The location is ideal as it is half a block from Broadway and Times Sq. We walked everywhere from here.I cant express how wonderful this hotel is and recommend it to all who are looking for a hip New York break.</p></li>

After a long day of travel and sight seeing all I wanted was a hot shower and a good nights sleep. All I got was a good nights sleep. No hot water in the shower. Management did refund nearly half of my bill after a few e-mails. Room was very clean, staff friendly, lobby unremarkable. Excellent location, but a little pricey.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful Staff! Great Hotel!! The hotel was beautiful and in a great location. The rooms were small but luxurious. The hotel staff was sublime. The concierge services, or as they call it agents of desires were fantastic especially a fine gentleman named John Paul. I look forward to staying here the next time I am in Manhattan! There is a wonderful Scottish restaurant /tavern next door that I could not seem to leave!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was GREAT It's all in what you are looking for. We were there for two nights ($250 per night-deal at travelzoo.com) for the tree lighting at Rockefeller Center.The comments and photos (both official and by contributors) are accurate. The rooms are small and facilities minimal (fitness room on second floor/ restaurant next door). It is not a resort and is not advertised as such.But it is convenient, clean, and elegant.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful hotel, Wonderful location!!! I read Trip advisor all the time and couldn't find a good review for a NY City hotel. This was newly renovated and didn't have any reviews at all. I took a chance and it was well worth it!!! The service was excellent, check in was great, and the rooms were clean. The biggest plus was the location - right at Times Square - you can't go wrong. I would definitely recommend and stay again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Mela is WONDERFUL From the time we checked in, until a hotel staff member hailed a cab for us at our time of departure, we loved the Mela. The staff members were pleasant and accomodating. Our very clean room and bathroom were more spacious than we expected. The bed was very comfortable, with great pillows and a fluffy comforter. Excellent location for walking to many destinations in Manhattan. You will love the quiet, elegant atmosphere of the Mela.</p></li>

The Hotel itself is a design lover's dream with well appointed rooms, plush sleeping set-ups, and very clean as a whistle. Situated a stone's throw from Times Square on 6th on one side and Bryant Park on the other (Ave of the Americas)-you are perfectly positioned for a great time.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel! Booked this hotel as part of Virgin Holidays package. Was really impressed with our stay. The hotel is in a fantastic location, 1 min from Times Square. The staff are all very friendly and helpful. The room itself was small but is to be expected in New York. The bathroom was amazing! It was very clean and we ordered room service twice and it was excellent. I've stayed in other hotels in New York, that I have been happy with, but this was by far the best.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Horribly Overpriced This is a prime location next to Times Square, but the hotel is nothing special. The rooms and beds are small. I got a twin bed which was shorter than I am. The view from the window was a brick wall. There was no time of day in which sunshine reaches the 3rd floor room I was in. The hotel tries to imitate the W with the same music and style points in the lobby and other areas, but I've stayed at the W Times Square and the Hotel Mela is not in the same league.</p></li>

Having read the other reviews on Trip Advisor, I was a bit concerned about the size of the room. Happy to report that there was no need for any concern. The Deluxe Twin room that we were booked in was plenty big for the two of us. The hotel is in a great location, the staff is incredibly friendly and the rooms were very clean. I will definitely stay at this hotel again and will recommend it to others.</p></li>

The room was extremely comfortable, with several subtle appointments and touches which certainly did not go unnoticed. John Paul, the Concierge, was very gracious and human to us, even when suggesting places to go for dinner and nightlife. Likewise, the rest of the staff was always friendly and accommodating. Five Stars all the way for the Hotel Mela!!</p></li>

I was initially a little concerned because of the negative reviews, but after seeing my room I was very pleased. We were upgraded to the executive room, which was a nice size. The decorations and furnishings were top notch. There is NO better location. We walked to most things but the subway was only a couple blocks away. Everyone was super nice and courteous. I would definately stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Kind of liked the Hotel Mela Check was very slow - they seemed as though there was not a room available, but the room number typed on the document that I had to sign for credit card validation had indidcated to same room that they gave me keys for.I entered the room and it had been used as a smoking room! I asked to be moved. They downgraded me to a standard room on anohter floor.Check out was even longer - 20 minutes +/-. then the internet was down, so they emailed my bill to me.Just was not a smooth operation!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the Mela! We stayed for five nights in the hotel. We traveled with our 19 month old son. The hotel was very child friendly. I was a little worried about the noise, given the location, but we couldn't hear a peep! We would go back in a heartbeat! The staff were incredibly friendly, the rooms were clean and you could not beat the location! The front desk staff were always helpful, giving us tips on where to go for meals, what places to see, etc. We did not feel the room was small. It was a great size. We look forward to our visit again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice Hotel... Stayed here 4 nights for a business trip. Friendly staff. Got an early check in at 9am at no added cost. Hotel is centrally located in the middle of Times Square but tucked away in a smaller street so it's not as noisy or hectic. Very modern, clean, and well decorated. Nice H2O ammenities. The only problem I had was the dark room. Lighting was poor and no sunlight from the window since there's another building in very close proximity to the hotel. For the price at $525 a night, I would probably stay at a bigger hotel with a view (or sunlight)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Mela. Great Location. Great Service. The Hotel Mela is steps away from Time Square. Within minutes we passed a bunch of Broadway playhouses, and so much glitz and glitter that our midwestern eyes sparkled. We were on a baseball weekend, and we caught the subway a few blocks away and quickly made it to Yankee Stadium.The staff was exceptionally friendly and always helpful. The only regret we had was that we couldn't stay longer. There are so many famous landmarks with walking distance that you can't turn a corner without seeing something you recognize.</p></li>

I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean and have everything you could want. I have recommended this hotel to many people who also travel to NYC, either on business or pleasure trips. I will continue to frequent it and recommend it to all. It is cost effective, in a great location (W44th St near Times Square) and has a friendly helpful staff. The restaurant, French Bistro style, attached is also a rare find.</p></li>

The staff is exceptional. There is always a smile and a friendly hello from housekeeping, front desk, etc... Ian and Freddy were great from the moment we checked in up to our departure. We had dinner at Saju, ( located right next door) and I have not had such great service in a very long time. Our server Elyse was very pleasant and a true professional. I just don't want to stay anywhere else in NY. Thank you all for making this trip a memorable one.</p></li>

Modern, subtle furnishings, efficient check-in, and great location [walkable to Times Square]. Room was small but well furnished, great quality bed, good minibar if you can afford those things, bathroom was modern with shower, variety of television programs etc. There was also an Ipod dock which you could connect your Ipod/music player to and hear via speakers. Overall pleased with this hotel. Did not access restaurant/room service so could not comment on this.</p></li>

The Hotel Mela may not have the grand lobby of some of the larger hotels but the clean comfortable rooms more than make up for this. Every employee we encountered were friendly and helpful.Every request we made was handled quickly and courteously. As this was our first trip to New York we struggled to pick a hotel and we suggested this hotel to our travel agent. It turned out to be a great choice and we will not hesitate to stay here on our next trip to New York. We will definitely recommend this hotel to our travel agent and anyone else looking for a great place to stay in Times Square,New York City.</p></li>

I don't think I've ever been treated so politely and thanked as much as the staff did. The room was nice and modern, and if you travel to the city often, you know what you are getting size-wise. The room is very bright and cheerful and the bathroom is nice sized as well. I have stayed in another botique hotel one block closer to 5th, and this hotel is brighter, more spacious, and I was not using a sink the size of a Campbell's Soup can!! Great bath amenities as well.The Hotel Mela will definitely be my new NYC hotel!! Incredible value!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">5 days of Mela My wife and I had a great time at Hotel Mela and look forward to returning. Thestaff was wonderful starting with the front desk upon our arrival. We were surprised to receive an upgrade on our room for our 8 year anniversary. Mela was very well located around Time Square and easy to pick up the subway to go south into SOHO, Chinatown and the Financial District. We saw Wicked at the Gershwin 8 blocks North. We also walked to David Letterman the second night of our stay. We could not have had a more enjoyable time in N.Y. I believe it is because we found the jewel right in the center. Hotel Mela not Central Park. However the Park was Fabulous.</p></li>

<li>Thestaff was wonderful starting with the front <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1" title="p=0.997">desk</span> upon our arrival.</br></br></li>
<li>We were surprised to receive an <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.608">upgrade</span> on our room for our 8 year anniversary.</br></br></li>
<li>Mela was very well located around Time Square and easy to pick up the <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.946">subway</span> to go south into SOHO, Chinatown and the Financial District.</br></br></li>
<li>We saw Wicked at the Gershwin 8 blocks North.</br></br></li>
<li>We also walked to David Letterman the second night of our stay.</br></br></li>
<li>We could not have had a more enjoyable time in N.Y.</br></br></li>
<li>I believe it is because we found the <span style="background-color:#557585" title="p=0.588">jewel</span> right in the center.</br></br></li>
<li>Hotel Mela not Central <span style="background-color:#e6beff" title="p=0.793">Park</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>However the <span style="background-color:#e6beff" title="p=0.793">Park</span> was Fabulous.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved this hotel! This beautiful little hotel is located on West 44th Street...literally a 1/2 block away from Times Square - within walking distance to the big theatres which eliminated the need for a car - which was nice because driving in Midtown Manhattan is CRAZY!The staff were all very professional (not a single bad apple - OK...pun intended!), courteous and friendly. We stayed in the deluxe king room on the 2nd floor. One small inconvenience - don't stay on the second floor if you can help it - the gym is on that floor and if someone is watching the TV, you will hear it in your room. Other than that, I would have NO hesitation in staying at this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Valentine at Hotel Mela New York New York, Hotel Mela Hotel Mela from Maple, Canada.  These words would have been Frank Sanatra's saying (In his Song) if he were still around. Perfect stay and excellent service from David and his staff at Hotel Mela is how I would discribe my stay at the Hotel last month. The guys there were so helpful and the location (TIME SQUARE) is perfect. The rooms are very clean and the people cleaning are very helpful. My wife and I came from Toronto, Canada and went for our 10 wedding Annv. Now we are hooked. We will be going every year from now on. Hotel Mela is great to stay if you want a classy place to sleep and just hang out for a few days while visiting New York.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Small rooms, yes, but FABULOUS staff and location Our small, neat room was wonderfully comfortable and appointed in contemporary style. Good value. Besides the can't-be-beat location, we were wowed by several members of the staff. Jean Paul at the front desk seemed authentically and personally glad to see us - even when he was headed off duty, guitar over shoulder. On the Desires desk, Tirone Reina is exceptional. He helped us with everything from salon appointments, to restaurant reservations and even tracked down and PERSONALLY delivered two bottles of a particular champagne. Do be prepared for small rooms. Also the maids didn't remove dirty champagne glasses for 2 days, or dump the long melted ice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent We have just arrived back from New York having stayed for 4 nights at the Hotel Mela. We had a fantastic holiday which was complemented by great accommodation. Our room was just as is pictured on the hotel's website and it was ready when we arrived early. The towels were changed daily, there was a hairdryer supplied and there was free wi-fi. The room was quiet, which is amazing as Time Square is just a few steps away. It was thoroughly cleaned daily and the bathroom had a very powerful shower - just what we needed after a long day of sight seeing. All of the staff was friendly from the concierge to the house keeping. We would definitely recommend this hotel for a great location and comfortable stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel and Location (but look out for the cab story) Great modern boutique style hotel in a great location (you can see Times Square from the bedroom window albeit 100m away or so). A little pricey but that's no different to hotels generally in this area. Rooms are great. Only thing to watch out for is the story that's fed to weary travellers about catching a yellow NY cab or the hotel's valet airport service. We were told that the NY cabs running to the airport run on the meter so will be astronomically expensive in traffic. This is a lie - the yellow cabs are a flat rate ($55-60 including the bridge toll and the tip). The hotel car is $75. Soured the end of the trip slightly but otherwise a great hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic stay It was our first trip to NY and we travelled at short notice so didn't have too many expectations as to the hotel. Nevertheless, it was absolutely perfect. The rooms were small but perfectly acceptable although our bathroom was a little tired. The staff were there if we needed them and always welcoming. For example, I had tried to use the complimentary wireless internet connection one morning but my laptop couldn't find a strong enough signal. When I got back to my room that evening, I connected straightaway. The breakfasts next door were a great start to the day too. Location was a little noisy but when sleeping just off Times Square, what do you expect? New York was a wonderful city and we can't wait to go again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just As Wonderful The Second Time! My daughter and I first discovered the Hotel Mela in the summer of 2007. We were in the city for a broadway show and absolutely loved the hotel. It was stylish, very clean and the staff could not have been more gracious. The location is perfect, right in the heart of the theater district and close to restaurants and shopping. When we were planning our trip to the city for this summer we knew right away where we wanted to stay. I will admit I was a bit concerned that maybe it would not hold up to the standards of last summer. I am happy to say everything was as fresh and clean and again, the staff could not have been more helpful and courteous. We are already looking forward to a return trip next summer!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Mela was great My wife and I traveled from Atlanta and stayed here over a weekend in late June based on the reviews, and we weren't disappointed! It is very modern, clean, and wonderfully located in the Theater District. The room was perfectly decorated and very livable. The only negative is that everything is very small. As two women in the elevator (which holds four people maximum) said: It's like a minature hotel. The lobby was small, the room was small, the bed was small, the desk was small, the window was small, and the bath was small. I felt a little bit like a hobbit in Lord of the Rings. Having said that, the rate was good, the location was great, the staff was very pleasant, and all the furnishings were first rate. We would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I can't possibly imagine a better place to stay in New York Look, this hotel is in downtown New York. It's a stepping stone away from Times Square, a casual jog away from Central Park and mere minutes away from the Empire State Building. Please, please do not expect that you will get a large room!So, if you resign yourself to the fact that your room here is probably going to be smaller than your home bedroom, then there is simply nothing else negative to say about it. As stated before, the location is just perfect. The rooms themselves are exquisitely finished to the highest standard that I recall ever seeing in a hotel. It's not cheap, but by New York standards, it's certainly not expensive either and represents great value for money. In short, it's just a brilliant place to stay in New York. Highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice Location ... Good Pick Saw a deal on TRAVELZOO for a nice rate $219. It is a new boutique hotel that aims to please. If you are in NYC for Broadway Show and major Touristy Things then this location 44th St 6/7 th Ave is right in the middle, it is quite busy here if you are looking for quiet and slow ...this is not it.The staff was real nice. The lobby is nicely done, but small and not great for hanging out as we had 14 friends together for weekend. They are in the middle of construction on Asia restaurant and lounge which should be a great draw when it opens in June 2007. The standard rooms are small as they are in Times Square and space is a premium, but decorated quite nice and neat. If you can upgrade to Executive Queen it is a fair bit larger.Overall ... good expeience, nice staff ... would give it a 3.5 to 4 Stars</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Absolutely loved it !!! I took my Girlfriend to NYC for a Valentines break and we chose the Hotel Mela for our stay. This place is fantastic. The Location is as good as any Hotel in NYC, it can only be a 40 second walk to Times Square!Rooms are very modern, very clean with well stocked mini bar and snack basket and very very comfy beds. The rooms are a little small but hey, your in New York...By the time you get back to your room you'll collapse into bed anyway. The rooms are so quiet on a night too which was great when you consider Times Square is almost on your door step!The staff and bellboys in the reception area are incredibly helpful at all times.Whilst in New York I proposed to my now Fiancee and the our trip was truly amazing in every way. We both can't wait to go back and would definately stay at the Mela once again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lovely Boutique Hotel off of Times Square Outstanding service, clean room, great location and value; what else could you possibly want? This is a boutique hotel, so you can't expect the rooms to be huge. If you want a large room, look elsewhere, but this is New York...how much are you really going to be in the room? The room I was in was actually a pretty good side; very comparable to other NYC hotels (that aren't boutiques). Flat panel television, lovely snack basket (with reasonable prices), mini bar, extremely well appointed room, clean bathroom, comfy bed with many pillows, etc. - this place is a winner. I got a hotel room, off of Times Square, for $199/night on a Saturday night in New York! I can't say enough about this hotel. I honestly thought about not posting a review because I don't want to give away this secret hotel! LOVE IT!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic LOCATION and Service The Mela was a fantastic experience. I was in the City for the first time, but my girlfriend had been there many many times staying at places like the Four Seasons, Ritz, Peninsula, etc; she was blown away by this place. I like many got the basic room but it was more than ample to satisfy her shopping fetish; which means bigger than a Saks dressing room x2. The service impeccable from check-in to check-out. We had issues with our mini-bar in prepping to go out and within five minutes they were there to take care of it. Also, fantastic help in getting to Yankees game on Subway. Service was Fantastic.Both places next door are great for drinks, early and late, which include Saju and St. Andrews the only Scottish Pub in the City.Certainly would recommend to anyone and have not mentioned the location which is phenomenal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Lovely hotel, lovely location Confused by the various websites and guidebook recommendations I asked a friend if they would recommend the place they stayed at in NY recently (March). He did and since the price seemed not too unreasonable given the location I booked online through the website. There were a few complications with our arrival and so I rang the hotel to ask questions regarding possible changes to our booking and found the staff very helpful. This continued on our arrival and we found the hotel more than lived up to expectations. The location is fantastic, a stones throw from Times Square and central Manhattan, while having no noise problems and the hotel was clean, well-equipped and very comfortable. I will definitely be recommending it to other friends heading that direction. An added bonus is a lovely Scottish bar and restaurant next door.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Value, Great Location My husband and I have been to New York several times over the past few years and stay at a different place each time. We've stayed at the W, the Doubletree Times Square, the Warwick, etc. This time we stayed at Hotel Mela the week before Christmas. We just happened to find it online for a fantastic price compared to the other hotels during the holidays. We took a chance and were very please with it. The rooms are extremely small (what you would expect in a European hotel) but very clean, modern, and comfortable. If you want to be in the middle of the city, close to times square, and within walking distance to basically everything else (theater district, park, museums, etc) it is the perfect location for you. Although we didn't eat at the hotel, the restaurant looked very good. It was a nice surprise for us and overall we were very happy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice everything except size We stayed in 1403. The first thin you see when you open the door is how close you are to the wall from standing at the door way. Our superior queen bedroom' square footage just barely had enough for luggage on the floor. Going back and forth to the bed, you had to be slightly careful not to step on your own stuff cause space is limited. Nice furnitureVery cleanNice bath and bath productsBut it felt like a tiny dorm room.Aside from that, the people at Mela were all great and friendly. The restaurant next door Soju? was pretty expensive but it's really convenient. Much of the time is spent outside of the hotel. We were so active in the day that by the time we got back to our tiny room, we just slept and didn't mind the small space anymore.The greatest asset Mela is the location, a 1 minute walk away from Toys R Us at Time Sqr. The service is great!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Mela - Will Keep Coming Back! I consider myself to be quite particular about customer service - especially when traveling out of town on business. While the facilities of Hotel Mela were quite impressive all on their own, it was truly the customer service that made this a particularly memorable experience - one worth sharing with others. Every member of the hotel staff greeted me cordially at every turn - regardless of their role within the hotel (from concierge and front desk to housekeeping). Particularly memorable was that a staff member (already in the elevator) stepped out at one point so that I could take the elevator as to not inconvenience me to wait longer. I am a firm believer - in all aspects of life - that it is the little things that count and Hotel Mela excels on the little things. I highly recommend it for anyone wishing to feel pampered and appreciated.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A nice find near Times Square My wife needed to book a three-night stay for a group of us near Times Square as part of a birthday celebration weekend for me and came across the Hotel Mela. We've been to New York on a handful of occasions, and I have to admit that I had never heard of the Mela. But what a delightful surprise!For starters, we received nothing but friendly and attentive service from the entire staff for our entire staff -- not to be underestimated. And OK, yes, the room size is a bit... cozy, shall we say, but they were very clean, very comfortable, and for the most part, pretty quiet for being a couple of blocks from the bustle of Times Square. (And honestly, how much time do you actually spend in your room when you're visiting the City?) If you're used to the size of European hotel rooms, this is right up your alley. And, of course, it's hard to beat the location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful!!! May, 2008Hotel Mela New York, NYMy girlfriend and I both turned 60 this year and wanted to celebrate in a big way. We picked this hotel on Times Square by reading reviews on several sites. They all were very positive. We were not disappointed. The hotel may not have been as opulent as some of the older hotels but it is very attractive. It is 2 blocks off of the main street and close to all activities on Times Square. The subway is very close by. Two of the staff Nick and Phil helped us with tickets to Wicked and instructions on how to navigate around town, as did all the staff. Our air conditioner was not cooling and they were up at our room in just a few minutes, and this was late at night. Most responsive service I've ever had. Do not hesitate to stay here. The beds were comfortable, and room size more than adequate, and very quiet and clean.Sincerely; Linda  Kathy</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Shockingly bad hotel-waste of money! I CANNOT believe that I just spent $400 for a room that barely even fit the queen sized bed we requested (it felt more like a full-sized). My husband and I could barely be in the room together at the same time with our luggage - there was nowhere to put it! There weren't enough towels for one person, let alone two, and there was no fan or exhaust system in the bathroom - so when you took a shower, the hotel room was also steamy. To make things worse, there is no coffee maker in the room - and it took me 5 calls to room service to even order my $8 pot (about 2 cups worth) of coffee. If we were going to be in town for more than one night, I would have left - TOO SMALL!On the plus side, it was clean, and everything in the room (furniture, bedding) seemed new. Good location if you like noisy Times Square and the theatre area, but I feel like I got ripped off big time!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Compact and bijoux Spent a week at The Mela in late May. Rooms tiny but very comfortable and stylish, though given the free wifi a desk area would have been helpful. Excellent and reasonably priced minibar service including large basket of goodies, replenished daily. Housekeeping excellent. Sadly our view was of a derelict wall and there was a ventilation fan outside which was somewhat noisy but really, how much time do you spend in a New York hotel room? Bathroom also compact but well kitted out. Air conditioning excellent and reception staff very helpful (we had to move three times on arrival - first room non-smoking, second next to a very noisy generator) and nothing was too much trouble. Location good but a bit near the mania of Times Square for my liking though to others this may be ideal. The bistro next door is excellent. I would stay again but would perhaps go for the extra cost of a larger room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Mela: Perfect In Many Ways! We were fortunate to stay at Hotel Mela for five days, June 28--July 2, 2008. Our son gave us a Christmas present of 5 days in NYC to see a Broadway Show and 3 NY Yankee Games before the old stadium closed, so he had chosen the hotel and paid for everything! We had read the reviews stating that the rooms were small, so we were prepared. We did find it a bit tight but it was beautiful...very modern, very clean, with an extremely comfortable bed/pillows. It is close to just about everything...shopping, subways, theaters, restaurants. The Bistro, their restaurant next to the Hotel, was a wonderful place for breakfast, too. But most of all, I praise the staff...they were ALL very helpful, and pleasant; they seemed to enjoy and take pride in their work, from the housekeeper, to the maintenance person to the receptionists. We LOVED this hotel and would definitely return if we were in the area again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stylish, Comfortable, Sexy but small rooms Got a great deal with hotwire.com on this property. The location is absoultely fantastic. 1 block from times square.The good: New, clean rooms, Luxury bed linen and towels. LCD TV with Cable, Great common areas and first class service. Restaurants nearby are very good and charge back to your room. Location is second to none and VERY New York. Decor is very stylish and Aircond worked perfectly. Great bed.The Bad; The rooms are small (but most Hotel rooms in NY are) and there is limited cupboard space. If youre travelling with a lot of luggage you may struggle. The room we had was lacking in Natural light as it looked onto a lightwell and other windows.Overall the hotel is charming and very well run. There is little to complain about but check out the room sizes if this concerns you. Keep in mind though that this Hotel represents outstanding value for money.I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">great choice of hotel for our week in NYC My wife and 14 yo son shared a small but clean and comfotable room for our visit to NYC. I called the hotel direct and spoke with Pamela in reservations who could not have been more helpful. we soon found that staff from domestics to concierge were pleasant and helpful without exception.Our room was cleaned daily and sheets were changed. The bathroom was small but adequate. The decor was contempory producing a relaxing airconditioned environment...a real haven in the heart of this vibrant city.the view from the window wasnt great...looking over rooftops..but for us the view wasnt that important. The bed was very comfortable. The location suited us well. Turn left and times sq is 100m away. Turn R and you are on your way to Bryant park with its.subway connection.The red flame diner is also about 100 to the right on leaving. Here you will get a reasonably priced hearty breakfast.No hestation in recommending this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">bang in the middle I stayed in Newyork for 9days last year september.My partner and I usually like to stay in a mid-range hotel for the first few days and then go super classy for the last couple of nights.I really liked this hotel. No, it wasnt the biggest room but we felt that we didnt need tons of space. It was cozy and ultra modern. No view so to speak but less then 20 seconds round the corner, times square BANG!nothing like that first glimpse of that place. We went on to stay at the Sofitel and I remember thinking I want to go back to the mela! thanks to everyone else that posted their reviews because they really helped. The hotel is pretty much central to all things in mid-town. However if your wanting to go to some of the hip spots such as the meat packing district, greenwhich village and chelsea then dont stay here! and do not go to any of the restaurants suggested to you by the tour guides on the tour buses. They are money traps and the food is CRAP</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">great hotel in a great location Stayed at the Mela from 09th to 12th November 2008. Hotel itself is located in an adjascent street right a few meters away from Time Square. We stayed in a Mela Suite which was not as big as I was expecting but like everybody says... it s New York. The room was extremely clean and for once we had an impeccable bathroom. Decoration was pleasant and furniture cozy.The room was located on the 14th floor and away from the street (back yard) it was even possible to sleep with open windows (I know we are Europeans !!). From reception staff to cleaning staff all were very helpful. We only used the restaurant next door for our breakfast and it was perfect. On the day of departure we were able to keep the room until 1400 which was great. All in all excellent hotel. The only negative points I have to make is first the size of the room and second the almost non existent possibility to store any clothes/luggage. I will definitively come back to this hotel in the furture.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Service, Great Location I stayed at Hotel Mela for 8 nights on a business trip. It was ideal for a base, half a block from Times Square, to run around to meetings all over Manhattan, watch a Broadway show and walk to various wonderful restaurants.I was surprised by the pleasantness of everyone from the front desk to the cleaners. Everyone was cheerful, always happy to help and clearly cared about the facility.I spent a lot of time in my hotel room, working between meetings. The room service from the restaurant next door was nice food, delivered fast and there was plenty to choose from -- breakfast, lunch and dinner. The room had everything I needed: iron and ironing board, lots of plugs for my laptop and phone charger, constant free wifi and a constantly tempting minibar.The hotel atmosphere is fresh and fun, with beautiful dark wood and splashes of colour, with a modern sitting room by the elevators with a chess board and backgammon.I would highly recommend this hotel -- my stay was flawless.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">FANTASTIC New York VALUE Hotel Mela is a BEST BUY for New York City. My husband and I are picky travellers and have high expectations when we stay at hotels...especially in large cities. Hotel Mela is FANTASTIC.The hotel is ideally located in mid-town Manhattan. You can be in the hub of Times Square by walking 1/2 block west of the hotel or in the quieter higher end area of 6th and 5th Avenue by walking 1/2 block east of the hotel.It is a small boutique hotel with EXCELLENT service. Chris, who checked us in, was extra nice and helpful. The room was small, but this is NYC and they are all small. With that said, we had a nice little desk/chair area for our luggage and a separate area with bed, TV and night stands. The decor is modern with little extras of WONDERFUL bedding and nice H2O bath products. Also, the hotel is spotless and the maid service was excellent.I cannot say enough great things about this hotel. And, thank you, TRIP ADVISOR, for yet again, helping to steer us to a wonderful hotel find. You cannot go wrong with the Hotel Mela.</p></li>

<li>You can be in the hub of Times Square by walking 1/2 block west of the hotel or in the quieter higher end area of 6th and 5th Avenue by walking 1/2 block east of the hotel.It is a small boutique hotel with EXCELLENT <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1" title="p=0.999">service</span>.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good Choice! Just got back from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Mela. This hotel was great! My friend and I do an annual girl's trip weekend to NYC and are always looking for good boutique hotels to stay at. At the end of the day, if the price is right, and the criteria we look for are met - that's where we stay.This hotel is comprabale to other NYC boutique hotels in that the decor is funky, and rooms are generally small. However, what makes this hotel stand out, is that it is relatively new, therefore the rooms are extremely fresh and clean. Secondly, the staff were fantastic. They were friendly and efficient, without any of this pretentious attitude that you get a certain boutique hotels. There is no bar or lobby scene, but the hotel has its own restaurant next door (didn't get a chance to eat there, but it was always busy)Location was great if you want to be near Times Square and all the theatres.The only negative - I like to have tea/coffee in the room and there was nothing available, not even in the lobby. Other than that, my stay was great.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Can't complain, would stay again We booked via a last minute web deal inc flights with Delta (flight empty both ways- brilliant) The Mela is bang on Times Square but not noisy, and near some great irish bars. We had a standard room which was average size and nicely appointed (similiar to UK Malmaison) we were pleased with the room, and the staff. On the second night we encountered a problem in the room (common in NYC mostly unavoidable) but the night manager immediately transferred us to a suite and refunded that nights cost- can't say fairer than that. I would recommend the Mela and stay there again. Their reaction to our problem means that this review is fair and I am not going to dwell on the issue we had, They sorted it quickly and efficiently.Its clean, central, good value and modern, Our first room had a shower and bath the second room a large walk in shower, the in room toiletries are very nice.Most NYC rooms are very small, these are average, but you do get a flat screen tv, desk etc etc, all nicely done.Staff were all friendly and efficient.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel I stayed at Hotel Mela last weekend (12/12-12/14) with my mom. We visited NYC to celebrate her birthday and do some shopping. I absolutely loved this hotel! The location was so convenient to everything. Even though it was only 1/2 block from Times Square, the street was surprisingly quiet and we heard very little traffic noise. The front of the hotel was decorated beautifully for Christmas, so that left a great first impression! The lobby was sleek and stylish, but still very cozy. And it always smelled really good...like baked apple pie or something! And I can't say enough about the staff. There were always several staff members in the lobby ready to help with whatever we needed. Check in/check out was quick and simple. Everyone was just so courteous and helpful. The room was a little small, but we expected that and understand it's typical in the city. It was stylishly decorated, though, and VERY clean. I loved the beds - so comfy - and there were plenty of pillows. The bath products were amazing! What a great experience - I would definitely stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Yes, small rooms...but great location, helpful staff, nice furnishings Ninety percent of NYC hotel rooms are tiny. That's just the way it is. So don't be shocked by the Mela's postage-stamp sized accomodations. They are nicely appointed, fairly clean, and convenient to Times Square and many other NYC landmarks. The staff was very courteous and helpful. My only quibble is that the Mela touts itself as a 4 star hotel. Sorry, it is 3 star at best.The Mela lacks many amenities that you would expect in a 4 star boutique hotel -- no restaurant, no spacious lobby or lounge, and a tiny workout room. The Mela is a boutique hotel in the sense that it provides small, well appointed rooms. There really is no lobby -- there is a checkin desk, and a central cushioned sofa wrapped around a support pillar, but there is no room to sit in the lobby, read a newspaper, or meet and chat with friends/other travelers.Still, if you can get a room at a good rate (I booked for $189/night for late March), this is a great deal. If you get above $300/night, however...I suggest shopping around a bit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location Location Location Situated right at Times Square the location of this hotel is key. The hotel is clean and staff extremely friendly. The boutique style rooms are small but very adequate and tastefully decorated. We had a standard room with shower room but had requested a bath as well as a shower and luckily this was accommodated. A mini bar and flat screen TV, along with a CD/MP3 player are provided.....although little time is spent in the room. This is the ideal location to explore Manhattan. Two blocks from Central Station and right in the heartland of Broadway theatre. A full array of bars, restaurants and diners right on your doorstep but do take the time to walk down to Soho, Little Italy, Greenwich Village and Chinatown etc. Savour the atmosphere of each... A walk in the other direction will take you to Central Park - dont pass the famous Carnegie Deli opposite the Carnegie Hall - a must for all! We visited over Easter, on the tail end of St Patrick's celebrations so the city was buzzing with many tourists. Will be back soon and will defo stay at Hotel Mela....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A most pleasant experience We actually booked two deluxe rooms at Mela as our son and his girlfriend were accompanying us for the five days we were visiting New York. In advance of arrival I had requested higher floors, as I had heard the noise levels from the street could be bothersome and was very pleased to find the kids' room was on the 15th floor and ours on the 11th. Even though both rooms faced 44th Street they were very quiet indeed.The kids' room seemed a bit smaller and had a bathtub. Ours had a desk and shower only, which suited us fine. Yes, the rooms are small, but beautifully appointed, luxurious even and as we were pretty well there only to sleep, it was no big deal.The staff certainly were friendly and attentive, providing extra bathrobes and promptly delivering additional toiletries like shampoo when required. Never left or entered the hotel without an enthusiastic enjoy your day or welcome back. That was nice.Location is excellent, lots of thngs to do within walking distance and great restaurants and bars right on 44th.Would definately stay at Mela again, ditto for the kids.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">great stay at Hotel Mela Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Mela which we thoroughly enjoyed. We originally wanted to stay at the wonderful Sofitel again, but couldn't get a room there anymore, so we went for the Mela instead. Yes, the room is rather small, but how much time do you spend in it when you are in Manhattan?! The hotel is beautifully designed, very stylish, everything is brand new and clean, and that is more than I could say for lots of other hotels in NYC! We loved the very comfortable bed and beautiful bedlinen, nice flatscreen tele, well stocked minibar,windows that actually open, and the bathroom was great - fantastic complimentary toiletries, and a great shower(contrary to another review, it is easy to operate-really can't see what is so difficult about it!!!)front desk staff was very nice and helpful too, and as it is not a huge place it has a nice personal atmosphere.I would definitely recommend the Mela and return there anytime - I couldn't fault it, and although we were initially disappointed that we could not stay at the Sofitel, we enjoyed the Mela just as much.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location and Nice Staff Definately make it worth it I recently flew to New York from Michigan for the first time with some friends. We were looking for a hotel that was reasonably priced with a great location. We were happy with our stay at Hotel Mela at a little under 225/night. Once you step outside your door you fall into Times Square (Subways take you anywhere its amazing, even though I got to admit in NYC a little confusing) which is great. Also Bryant Park is a block away. (Again a little cold nowadays but beautiful)Being in New York and hearing about the size of the rooms I was expecting a 2 X 2 box, but I was pleasantly surprised. The room had a nice flat screen, very comfortable.The staff was also very nice, I think because its a new hotel they are taking every precaution to be super nice, but I hope they keep it up. When we called for something they brought it within 15 minutes at the latest. I gotta say for the price and location, this was the perfect place for US to spend the weekend in NYC. Gave us everything we needed, even a gym with flat screens so that I could get in my daily jog.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location and efficient service We stayed in New York in March and the hotel had only been opened for a couple of months. At the time the reception was very small and at a bit cramped, especially with people checking in and out of the hotel. The revolving door was not working and we all have to queue by a single door with all our suitcases. We found it funny that when it came to our turn, the doorman walked past us to help some girls behind us with their suitcases 鈥ell they were pretty.The first night my boyfriend tried to open the window and the handle came off however we only had to wait for a few minutes for someone to come and repair it.Everyday we overheard people complaining about their room size and elevator鈥檚 noise but we were lucky and had not complaints at all. By European standards we had a spacious room with all modern facilities and in a quiet part of the building. We loved the plump and cosy duvet and the bathroom productsThe location is excellent as it is in the midst of things, just a stone throw from the subway and bus stops. Will definitely stay here again next time we head to NYC.</p></li>

The morning of my departure I recieved a bill with room and tax charges. I showed the front desk agent and she said it was probably a mistake but she had to inform her manager KEN. KEN was apparently the front desk manager on duty with a nasty attitude. He was arguing with me telling me my priceline reservation was not a prepaid reservation. I had confirmation showing that I paid $1700 forboth airfare and hotel charges, but he was insisting that I was wrongand that my confirmation was not enough information for him. After a while of arguing back and forth I left the hotel that morning and came back in the afternoon too find out the outcome of my PRE-PAID reservaion was indeed allready paid for by priceline!!That KEN was just pure nasty and obviously KEN can't apprehend what a manager should do. KEN, don't be to quick to judge, study the case before deciding on the status. BAD KEN! I think this is the time when a superior can learn from their agents.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overpriced, stinky bathroom, rooms that are beyond tiny Bottom line: wouldn't stay here again.i stayed here because i like the central location and the sofitel was incredibly expensive. this place was no bargain but $200 cheaper than the sofitel.Nice people - doormen, guy at front desk - but a pretty lackluster hotel. The rooms are beyond tiny. I was asked if I was going to be using a desk in my room because rooms that had queen size beds didn't have desks (don't fit). I was so i got a full size bed that was squeezed into a corner. the shower was less than 3' x 3' and the shower head sprayed out into the bathroom as you adjusted the water.The real ick of the experience was opening the door into the bathroom - the stench of mold/mildew/must was overpowering. If it wasn't so late in the day and I had already prepaid I would have switched hotels and paid more. Another traveler I met in the elevatorsaid his room had the same issue with the stench.the smoke alarm also decided to start beeping at 3am (needed a new battery) and there was a houseekeeping cart seemingly permanently stationed on the floor, but not the biggest issues.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Size matters I have never seen a hotel room this small. I knew the previous reviews were right as soon as I entered the elevators. I thought that I had entered the Land of the Lilliputians; only 3 average size people can fit. The room, billed as a superior queen, was about 9 by 9. There was no place to put suitcases or hang coats. The closet was a piece of furniture that had hangers, a mini safe, the iron, ironing board and a few shallow drawers. Couldn't hang up raincoats without wrinkles. We just put our coats on top of the suitcase on the floor. No chairs were in the room; the only place to sit was on the bed which was more like a double size bed. However, the linens, comforter and pillows were nice. Although the bathroom looks modern, the shower door hits the toilet when opened. The hallways are narrow and made more so as the cleaning carts have found a permanent home in the middle of the halls. No coffee maker in the room and no coffee available in the lobby. The staff was pleasant but confused. The only good thing about this hotel is its location; close to theaters. We like to try new hotels but will not return to this one.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pleasant stay at Hotel Mela Stayed overnight at the Hotel Mela while visiting my son who works in Manhattan. I chose this hotel because of its proximity to the Minskoff Theater and the Lion King. The show has a permanent home at that theater right on Broadway at the heart of Times Square. This hotel, tucked in a quiet part of West 44th Street, is so very close to Times Square and that is a big plus. It has a very small entrance and lobby area and the elevators are small, but it is very clean and well done visually. I had a deluxe King room which was certainly big enough for two people to relax comfortably. The air conditioning with digital wall thermostat was great and the room was very clean with modern, up to date interior design. No exciting NYC view if you are looking for that, go somewhere else. Everything I needed was in the room, but no coffee or tea if you want that. Bountiful snack and wet bar, but I would never pay for that. It was nice to be able to stick my drink inside the fridge though...the bed was moderately comfortable but I have back problems and most beds bother me. Lots of pillows. I would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Book Hotel Mela for your stay in NY city. We just got back from a two night stay from Sept.25 to the 27th. Hotel Mela is within walking distance to anything and everything , 1/2 block from Time Square. There's a food and beverage market type store about three doors down. You can buy wine, water, fruits, cereals, bagels, medicine, anything really. As for the staff at Hotel Mela, well, they just care. They're efforts are genuine and you can feel that they really want to make your stay a positive experience. I happened to be there on my 40th birthday, and around 5pm, there was a knock at our door. It was the concierge delivering a delicious melt in your mouth chocolate cupcake and a Birthday card signed by several of the staff. It was a nice extra touch. Tirone at the Your Desires desk was also helpful and pleasant. Check in was quick and professional. The room was NOT too small, clean and well decorated. The elevators are small, but 5 adultes fit fine (with no luggage). It's about a 10-15 minute walk from the NY Penn Train station. I would return to this hotel with no hesitations. Did I mention the awesome price of 159$ night (on the 26th).</p></li>

On this trip I also stayed at the millennium Broadway it鈥檚 just across the street from Mela, and I paid the same rate as I did at Mela, and the 2 hotels are world apart the rooms at millennium are more then twice the size of Mela, and almost every room comes with a view of time square, I will write a review of millennium, also I have stayed at Marriott marquis its just across time square and about 50$ more a night but its diffidently worth it, my advice is do not stay at Mela choose one of the many other nice hotels in the area at the same or even lower rates then Mela.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Location, great stay! The hotel is in an excellent location - a stone's throw away from Times Square! We had a party of 4 and had booked the Mela suite. W arrived very early and had to wait for the roon to be free. The hotel management offered us 2 rooms rather than the suite so we can settle in as we were so early. We were given an executive suite and told to collect the key for the other room later that day. Later that day, I got the key to other room and discovered that the room was MUCH smaller than the executive suite. When I mean small I mean after putting a suite case in the room there would be no room to walk around! I asked for my room to be changed and the hotel accomadated my request!I was shown the Mela and Desires suite and must say that the Mela suite was very small and the Desires was a little bigger but still not as big as I had expected. We were fortunate that we were given 2 rooms as we had much more space - with all the shopping to do in NYC, space in the room is a must!The staff were wonderful! Always polite and very helpful! The hotel is modern and the house keeping was excellent as well! A great location - being a stone throw's away from Times Square! I would defnitely stay there again!</p></li>

At the corner is ABC studios which always has something going on for the morning news. Couple of doors down is Starbucks (need my starbucks in the morning).

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice boutique style hotel close to Times Square. Be prepared for small rooms! Okay I know what you are going to say, what hotel doesn't have small rooms in NYC?? Right? Well this one makes the rooms look larger on the websites but don't be fooled the rooms are a bed and a somewhat larger bathroom. The bed takes up the entire room. Other than that this is one of the most boutique style hotels I have stayed in well in NYC. It is the best location I have seen for Times Square access being one block away and on a street that is not so busy. The lobby is small and the staff are helpful. The interior is very trendy and upscale and despite the tiny elevators and the tight hallways, the rooms have all the latest amenities. They even have LCD TVs and wet bars. This is a nice little place to stay well in the city and being down there for my birtday and being close to all the action is even better. You literally can just walk a block down and be in the center of Times Square. The hotel is situated midtown. I would highly recommend this place, but be warned, don't be fooled by the pictures. The rooms are a closet. Although all the places in NYC are tight, the Holiday inn (I know what you are thinking) had huge rooms for half the price!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pack light We visit NYC several times a year and usually book our hotel based on rate and location. So I've stayed in a wide variety of hotels over the years. The Mela would certainly not be the worst but also not near the top either. We booked a deluxe king which is not their smallest room and it was really tiny! There was virtually no place to put luggage so we ended up having to keep one suitcase in the bathroom. The room was also very dark and on one side you could barely see even with every light on. The bed was very comfortable and the bed linens were of good quality. The bath towels were a little small and thin.The staff was pleasant but not overly knowledgeable. I asked one of the concierges for a restaurant recommendation one evenng and he was not able to come up with anything (I asked about something casual in the 50's around Carnegie Hall) so I just resorted to my Zagat Guide.The location is very good if you're planning on seeing Broadway shows. The little restaurant next door was good for a drink and we had a pretty good dinner there one night as well. The breakfast prices are way too high so we just went up to the Red Frame a block away for breakfast.If I got an extremely good rate, I'd stay here again but otherwise I've found quite a few other places I prefer.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I done good! Not knowing what to expect having never visited New York, we were pleasantly surprised by Hotel Mela. The price was very affordable for mid Manhattan in summer ($221/night) and the rooms were lovely. Location was everthing and allowed us to walk or take the subway to most everything. We hit 9th Ave. amost everynight to eat, affortable, walkable and just enough off the tourist beat to have great food and interesting folks. We booked the king sized bed and I believe one step up from the regular room. It was small, but suited our purposes beautifully. Well until we discovered the water leak in the bathroom, but before we could even moan over our misfortune the staff has us whisked away to another room, an upgrade and it was delightful. Walls a little thin, so if you are going to be upset by the crying child, yes we heard them, then not the place for you. But who goes to New York to spend much time in their room and frankly not sure how long the poor kid cried as we were in our rooms to sleep or long enough to have a beverage, nap, shower and out again. The Hotel Mela was wonderfully clean, met my white tissue standard. It may not fare well over the years as it is an older building, but as long as the staff continue to keep it as clean as it was when we were there, it's a definite must.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, wonderful Staff! The staff were wonderful from the moment we arrived until we left. They were very attentive and helpful. Two of the four of us were celebrating 40th birthdays so they sent a complimentry bottle of champagne to each room.  It is a great location, a minutes walk to Time Square. Very central for anywhere that you want to visit. We walked mainly but the underground trains were very cheap and quick.  Carmines Italian and John's pizza restaurant were very good. Both on the same St as the hotel. You just turn left out of the door and cross Time Square. Ellen's Stardust Diner is great too, they all sing and dance. Great breakfasts if you have a good appetite! I thought macy's was the best all round shop but if you want a real bargain Century 21 is good. It is by the World Trade Center. Like TK Maxx but loads bigger and better. World Trade Center is very moving, but take your tissues! Empire State was good for the views. The free ferry to Statan Island took you near to the the Statue of Liberty, great for taking pictures. Wall Street is a lovely area, some nice shops and places for lunch. Central Park is good but it was raining when we went.  There are so many great places to visit, it is just a case of prioritising as it is difficult to get around them all. We travelled in two couples so we were torn between sightseeing and shopping. You really need to do both!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not a four star but a nice, relaxing hotel with a good staff in NYC This hotel has a great location near the theater district yet is still somewhat removed from the bustle of Times Square. The staff was extremely nice as well as helpful. The hotel has modern furnishings and is tasteful. The ELEVATORS ARE EXTREMELY TINY.......even the little people from the Wizard of Oz would have felt cramped. The fitness area is nice and the hotel has two computers available for use w/printer.....if you have your laptop wireless internet is available in the rooms.Our room was small and had no view but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was a decent size. Everything was tastefully decorated. Also the standard 12:00 p.m. checkout was nice.The hotel restaurant (Saju) is actually pretty good and attracts actors from the theater across the street. We had the seafood pasta and the pork tenderloin. The food was excellent but our waitress was more interested in chatting up the bar patrons than checking on us. St. Andrew's pub is right next door and is a good place to grab a sandwich or late night pint.All and all we had a very enjoyable stay at the Hotel Mela but I have to confess that I would not stay here again unless we got a good rate on hotwire, etc. Anything more than $200 a night for a room here is not worth it. Also the hotel, though nice should be classified more as a 3 or 3.5 star as opposed to a 4 star.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">"Fantastic" Lets not have any misconceptions. Most hotels (that are affordable for normal middle class persons) are slightly smaller than say your home bedroom/en-suite, and this is exactly how you will feel in Hotel Mela. However, this hotel is excellent in every which way especially for young professionals/singles looking for a cultural weekend in the big apple without the hotel bill of a chain hotel. What you will encounter when you walk through the revolving door are very friendly (but not false or over the top) staff and a modern boutique style reception area playing chilled out music and (due to a slight air con problem) a very mild temperature for March (which im sure will have been sorted). On entering our small standard room we were delighted to find everything as illustrated on their informative website. Great decor throughout to match some trendy finishes in the shower room (I guess baths are installed in larger suite rooms) all of which compensated perfectly for its size. I would say for comparison for Brits, you will find the room is roughly the size of a typical Travel lodge although it has a far superior finish decoration and finishes wise that would rival any 4 star hotel in the UK. I cant really give this hotel an more superlatives as it is as its website describes and is located about 50 yards from time square which is a great location.Will stay next time I return,One very happy architect.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Friendly Spot At a time when hotel rates were through the roof, as it was the holiday shopping weekend, we were able to get this 4 star hotel at a very reasonable rate. What a gem! This is a boutique hotel, with comfortably simple decor, located just one block off of Time Square, so convenient to everything. As close as it is to the hubub, it is very quiet. ( Well, there is some street work being done across the street that involved jack hammers during the day....but we were usually gone by then) The rooms are small, as are most in NY, but certainly adequate. The beds and pillows are ultra comfortable. The hotel is very clean....I don't think I have ever seen such a large and efficient housekeeping staff. The toiletries, robe, minibar and munchies are all top notch. All of the staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. The concierge, Tyrone, was especially helpful in finding and making dinner reservations,suggesting shops, helping us in using the subway,arranging car service for return to JFK, and even scoring nicely priced tickets for the sold out Jersey Boys at the last minute! The hotel is connected to one restaurant, of Asian cuisine...and there is another on the other side, St. Andrews, Irish-Scot menu. We ate at St. Andrews and were not particularly impressed. There is no free breakfast here, but you can get room service. All in all, we were very delighted with our choice, and we would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A diamond in the rough. Booked Hotel Mela via Hotwire.com for $134 -- by far the best value I've ever gotten dollar-for-dollar in NYC. Mela does not offer the views of Times Square that a hotel like the Millennium does, but what it lacks in size it makes up for in quality and personal attention. All of the staff were pleasant and helpful in every way possible. They let us check in early AND gave us a free room upgrade. The hotel itself is chic and modern without being ostentatious. The rooms are well-appointed with comfortable beds, flat-screen TVs, thermostat-operated climate control, and more. The bed and linens are both extremely comfortable and there is an abundance of pillows made available to you. The bathroom was nice, with a rainforest showerhead and wonderful toiletry products. Location is excellent, right off of Times Square on 45th Street. Just far enough to not have to step right into the throngs of sightseers when exiting the hotel, but close enough that you can soon join them if you desire. There is also convenient access to the subway, with the Times Square/42 St entrance right around the corner.My only regret is that I didn't book my entire trip at Hotel Mela. We stayed there for the last night of a 6-night trip and it was the perfect way to cap our trip. I would highly recommend Mela, especially if you can find a good price (rack rates on their website are in the $350+ range).All in all, I highly recommend this hotel and hope to return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Small, central and smart We came over from London to stay at the Mela for four days as part of a whistlestop break. Described as a boutique hotel, due to the fact there is no restaurant, bar or lounge space in the hotel, it is a stretch to say you'll enjoy a boutique hotel experience in its truest form. That said, the decor is smart and clean - the hotel earns the moniker 'boutique' by virtue of minimal, reasonably cool furnishings (ie dark Lombok-esque furniture etc) in the small spaces that exist ie the room, the lobby space and the two sofas by the lifts. Location-wise, it is great for Times Square (equivalent to Leicester Square for those who have not visited from the UK) and Theatreland if that's what you are looking for. It's a 15 / 20 min walk to the shops on 5th / Lexington or you can hop in a cab for a 5 min ride if traffic is good.We encountered a bit of noise from the roads below - but that's what you expect if you're staying near Times Square and it's not unacceptable by any means. Beds are very comfy, and the rooms with a shower not a bath are slightly larger.The staff are a good bunch and really helpful - a real plus point for the hotel.All in all, a decent hotel but very small - which is understood and acceptable if you're just after a comfy bed to crash in a central area. But next time I think we'll try somewhere marginally cheaper that has a few amenities ie late night drink / lounge area, and most probably not near the hardcore touristy Times Square area.Love NYC - who wouldn't - and will be back soon...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent stay at a fantastic hotel Excellent hotel,location and service.We asked for a room higher up and got one on the 14th floor-quiet, very large comfortable room for 2 people despite other reviews I had read. However, I suspect this was a deluxe room and not standard so we may have been lucky.Rooms have a contemporary decor and were very clean. There were no tea/coffee making facilities in our room(suggest you take a travel kettle) and although there was free internet access for laptop users in the room there was a charge of 7 dollars for 15mins internet use if you don't have a laptop(located on the 2nd floor)- but you can get free access at the tourist info.centre a few minutes away in Times Square.  All hotel staff were extremely helpfu and friendly with all sorts of info,nothing was too much trouble for them. They always treated guests with courtesy .The lobby is very small but who wants to sit in a lobby in New York anyway- there are plenty of bars and eateries nearby.Area around 8th Avenue has more affordable and better restaurants than nearby 7th ave otherwise worth venturing towards Lexington ave and beyond-quiter than the Times Square area.Although the Mela is so near Times Square, it is on a quiet street and centrally located for all other famous tourist sites - all easily accessible by walking/subway/buses.Worth buying a Citypass and subway pass(can use on buses)if you are there for a few days.Also try to buy Broadway show tickets online as there is no guarantee of getting any for the show you want to see-discount tickets for us never existed-all seats are sold out. Overall a fantastic stay in a fantastic hotel and city and would recommend to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a nice surprise I chose it based on price and reviews.I was thrilled to walk into a room that reminded me more of a bed and breakfast decor instead of a stark hotel room.The view was brick courtyard.Flat screen tv, very comfy assorted pillows on the bed, which was also very comfortable.Little things like coffee not being replaced, used glasses not being replaced, having to order ice (which means a tip) instead of helping yourself. No biggie. Just things that should be standard. Might have been a new maid.They have a giant basket of chocolates and treats that you will be billed massive amounts of money for if you eat any of the food. Same with the mini bar. I was afraid to drop the basket as I had to move it around the room. There was not a lot of table top and they sat it right in front of the tv. The lobby is tiny. The elevator hold only about 4 people. It says 3000 pounds, but they are tiny. We never had to wait very long however, because there are not a lot of people in the hotel.It was nice to have a small hotel, short hallways, and 10 seconds from room to the street. Ok maybe 30.Staff was very accommodating. The little oriental restaurant attached to the hotel charges 24 dollars for a breakfast of juice, fruit cup, eggs, The coffee was 3.50 for a little cup. I was very ticked off at that.You can walk to a ton of places within 5 minutes.Even MacDonalds on the corner of 6th and 47th (3 blocks away).Walk to everything Broadway and around town. You can even walk from Penn Station if you don't have heavy luggage. Straight up 7th ave 10 blocks.When the rates go up I will go back to my main stay, The Edison, but it is really nice while it lasts.I will definately stay again if I can afford it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Trip So my wife and I took a trip from Boston to NYC for the night and we wanted to do the tourist thing and see Times Square, the Empire State Building, and Rockefeller Center. After reading all the reviews here at Trip Advisor, we chose Hotel Mela. We arrived at the Port Authority and from there to the hotel it was about a 5-10 minute walk. Hotel Mela is right off Times Square and it's amazing how much that side street calms down, it was very peaceful and quiet. Hotel Mela's lobby is plain, but clean and classy. They have 3 elevators which are a small. Any more than three people would be a problem. I was worried reading all the reviews about how small the rooms are but I was very surprised to find our room with a Queen size bed was larger then some other hotels I have stayed in. If staying for more than a couple days, it might get a little tight with luggage, but room size was not an issue for us.The room was very clean and everything looked brand new. It's the first hotel I have stayed in that didn't smell like a hotel. I'm kind of a clean freak and I felt so comfortable.The bathroom was very modern and nice, the shower products, as everyone here has said, were great. I didn't even bring my own.One problem with the shower door was it only covers half of the actual shower. Water went all over the floor, not a problem for me but more for the cleaning people I guess.The only issue I had was the price. Unless you get some kind of special deal, this is an expensive hotel to stay at. I guess I feel like they could have done more for us considering how much the room cost. But the room was so clean, the location perfect for walking all over Manhattan, and my wife and I felt very safe there so to pay a little more for all of that is probably worth it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the mouse Having to go to New York on business can be a pleasure.Normally I stay at the Kintano in New York ( Stay there if you can) but due to cost cutting I was put in the hotel Mela.I got into New York early Sunday afternoon and we had requested an early check in so we could get some shopping done before work.I was not able to check in till 3.30 pm because the rooms were not available. While the staff apologised they did not seem in a hurry to sort out the issue. I had to keep pushing them.Anyway once I got to the room it was furnished in a modern style and the bathroom was a good size.( I had a delux room)The much mentioned bath products were not replaced once used which was a disappointment.The bed facing the door was not fitted to the edge so there was a nice gap around the door which let in light and noise ( the 4 am pick up of the breakfast menus on the doors).Beds were really comfortable and I was settling in well until my 2nd night when I heard a nice rustling noise in my mini basket and low and behold I found a mouse eating the chocolate.I was too jet lagged to complain that night ( I must have been really jet lagged) the next morning the staff did look mortified.They paid for my mini bar bill ( I wish I had more than one bottle of water now) and gave me and my boss a free breakfast at the great Bistro next door.While checking out the very helpful door man said they had a similar problem with a mouse 3 weeks before. I did not dare ask if he knew which room it was.The rooms were still not cheap ( About 拢150 per night) so I don't think we will be staying there again,They did have a good small gym where there was fruit out for residents to take. There seemed to be free internet access near the gym as well as WIFI in your own room if you had your laptop.</p></li>

<li>I did not dare ask if he knew which room it was.The rooms were still not cheap ( About 拢150 per night) so I don't think we will be staying there again,They did have a good small <span style="background-color:#e6194b" title="p=0.653">gym</span> where there was fruit out for residents to take.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Whoaa Dudes!!!! Just returned from girly shopping/ sightseeing trip in New York and Hotel Mela was great. In the lobby you are greeted by friendly and courteous staff and the ambience is lovely, there are candles burning which give it not only a warmly feeling but they are scented too and so the lobby smells gorgeous! Rooms are just as good, and the H20 toiletries which are raved about were very nice (to allow for valuable space in my case for shopping I didn't even feel the need to pack toiletries as I knew I could use the good quality ones supplied). Rooms also had a turn down service on an evening and the maid was very helpful in asking if there was anything we wanted. Chocolates were left out each night which was a nice touch. We stayed in a deluxe twin in despite having 2 large cases and accumulating lots (and lots and lots!) of shopping bags the rooms were a good size. There is a huge basket of snacks in the room to tempt although as always in hotels these were overpriced. I personally don't see why you would need to tuck into these though when you can go to the fab deli a few doors down and get a whacking great feast of midnight snacks! If you are a bit peckish when you arrive the hotel does provide a complimentary snack and drink which is another nice touch. The deli down the road is also good for breakfasts. Despite been so close to Times Square I was surprised that you could't hear ANY outside noise (we were on the 8th floor) which was a big bonus. For anyone that hasn't been to NY before this location is excellent as Times Square is full of everything you could wish for in NY - the bright lights and lively atmosphere, a stack of fabby restaurants and close to the sub and to the shops . It is the best hotel I have stayed in when I have visited NY and what more could you wish for ... great price, quality rooms/service and well located. I will definitely return.</p></li>
