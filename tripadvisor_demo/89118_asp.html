<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel, real charm. Good if weird service. Only, if they give you room 311 refuse it, it's in an alley with no natural light and even worse, beside the creaky staircase to the upper level with drunk people going up and down all night. They may as well be in your room. Also, don't even think of cashing in the complimentary coctaills at the bar, unless you like drinking in a hole with clouds of smoke.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent location, just a few (short) blocks to everything in the French Quarter. The room was nice and clean, comes with all the amenities too (e.g., wireless, iron, hairdryer, nice continental breakfast). Didn't get a chance to check out the pool because it was early January (although the weather was pretty good, for winter!). My only complaint that there wasn't any self-parking available, only valet parking for $24/day. Otherwise, I'd totally stay here again.</p></li>

You couldnt ask for a better hotel staff then they have. Everytime i asked for directions they give you a map and tell you excatly how to get somewhere. price of trolleys and so on. The room was very nice and homey. We stayed in room 114 right outside the beautiful fountain. This hotel makes you feel like your at home. I would stay here again and again.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here recently and loved the hotel. The location was perfect...close to everything we wanted to see. The price was only $79/night plus $18/night for parking. The floor of our room seemed to be at a slight angle, but besides that the room was very comfortable. The bathroom did not have much counter space. The air conditioning worked great (good thing because it was HOT outside!). The front staff was very helpful and courteous.

We loved having an airconditioned room to come back to every so often to get away from the heat. (The swimming pool was great too) The hotel is old and that gives it so much charm. We stayed in room 222, it was very quiet and we loved hearing the carriages go by! We had a couple different friends recommend this hotel to us. We were very glad they did!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I have been staying at the Hotel Provincial for 10+ years, and it is usually the only place we will stay. The staff remembers us every time we visit, and does everything imaginable to make every stay unforgettable. I returned to the Provincial with my husband years after a trip with my family, and it was still as wonderful as I had left it. The beauty of the courtyard, charm of the brick paths and bubbling fountains, and glow of the gas lamps will transport you back in time while still providing modern day luxuries.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The rooms were adequate but ours, even though the whole hotel is non-smoking, smelled like an ashtray. We ran the AC the whole stay and that helped alot. The location was perfect, the staff attentive and except for the blower in the French Market park at 6:30 AM, it was quiet and peaceful, especially for NO. We like to stay in the Quarter since we go for oysters, crayfish and Stellas! restaurant and the "show" is going on all the time. Antiques, silver and art galleries are great to brouse through. Great for a quick 3 day weekend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We've stayed at several French Quarter hotels (one of them was on Esplanade and really awful). The Provincial was by far the best: the room was attractive and nicely kept, the staff was pleasant and helpful, the location was excellent (in the best part of the Quarter). In addition, there's a wonderful in-house restaurant (Stella) and Cafe Beignet just adjacent. It couldn't be more convenient. Best of all, our room overlooked a beautiful interior courtyard filled with trees and a fountain. We would definitely stay at the Provincial again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our 3rd stay at the Provincial and it did not disappoint. We are spoiled by the convenient location, just a few blocks from most places you want to go in the Quarter. In the heat, it is very nice to be able to go back to the room and freshen up without hiking too far. The parking lot in the middle of the property is another convenience. We stayed in the Petite Suite this time and it slept the 5 of us quite comfy. The staff is nice and helpful. They came pretty quickly to bring us more towels when we returned to our room after 11:00 pm.</p></li>

Nice rooms with new flatscreen tvs. Great,safe location in the French Quarter. No need for a car here, you can do everything on foot when staying at the Provincial.

We arrived early. They held our bags and called us when the room was ready, which was before their stated 3pm check in. Room was clean and spacious for a basic hotel room. Some rooms on first floor open onto courtyard or pool area, so people are right outside your room all day-the pool and courtyard areas are a nice place to unwind. We were on the second floor which was nice. We have found the place to stay when we return next year.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a great location, about two blocked from Bourbon Street, but right in the French Quarter. Our room was one flight up a long flight of stairs. The furnishings were old, and the room had one brick wall with a fireplace. The room faced the courtyard, and was very quiet. Check-in was a pleasure. Because the street uas undergoing some construction the day I was there, I was given a discount. Breakfast was included, but it was just ok. it was served in a drab function room because the usual location was being painted. I really liked this hotel and would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros: great location. Friendly staff. Clean. Great deal - I booked through my anecdotes card and got 4 nights for $300 incl taxes. Cons: continental breakfast needs improvement. They are building a new breakfast area - which led to quite a bit of construction noise. Difficult to relax between the pounding of the construction and the kids screaming in the courtyard pool. If you need quiet time request a room other than the courtyard. I was also bothered by the "antiques". There is a difference between antique decor and old, broken furnishings. It's a unique place. Great part of the Quarter.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As are many New Orleans hotels, this one was French and quite quaint. The room was disconnected from the main lobby. The location was perfect and just down the street from Jackson Square. The staff was always respectable and was at our beckon call. The room was quite clean, quiet and comfortable. We never heard anyone else during our stay at this hotel. The most difficult part, as the weather was not cooperating, was our inability to eat our continental breakfast in the lobby. You either had to find a small available table and chair, or you had to take it back to your room. The other place to sit and eat was outdoors.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent five nights at the Hotel Provincial in February 2004. It was a positive experience and I'd stay there again. The location is very good: close to everything, but on a quiet street. My experience was enhanced by being assigned to perhaps the best room in the place: one of the rooms overlooking the street with its own private balcony. I was put there after my assigned room turned up dirty when I arrived. It isn't the most modern hotel, so it's not good for travelers who expect all the modern conveniences (convenient internet connections, honor bar, business center, etc.) It has off-street parking, which is big plus if you have a car.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here with friends after a cruise, loved the location, just a short walk from all the action but away from the constant noise of Bourbon Street. Rooms are set around a central courtyard and the doors open direct to the seating area or the pool, so if people are having an early breakfast and/or a cigar, you will hear them chatting and smell the cigar smoke, pool area room is quieter. Wifi works well but the standalone PC is very slow and needs help. Staff here are wonderful and very helpful, it was the 2nd hotel we had stayed at and for the price and location would be the one I would go back to, it's a lovely building, highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Can't say enough good things about the Provincial-- great location, close enough to be in action, but quiet enough to get a good night's sleep. Our room was by the front courtyard, allowing easy access to the front desk-- who were more than helpful with food and sightseeing recommendations! The free coffee, tea, and contential breakfast was a lovely perk, not to mention the coffee is actually the good stuff! It was fun to watch the "Haunted New Orleans" tours stop by the front of the hotel to take pictures-- I did not get any type of "eerie" feeling while we were there. When we return to this wonderful and beautiful city, we will be staying here!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The French Quarter location couldn't have been better. A few steps from the bustle of the French Market down by the river, and a few steps the other way to the nightlife of Bourbon Street! This restored Civil War hospital has charm in abundance! We had a second floor room overlooking a courtyard, which had a small swimming pool nestled amidst the greenery, which we could use anytime of the day or night! Beds were comfortable and our room was huge! We skipped the small continental breakfast provided by the hotel, preferring to sample breakfast at the endless number of fantastic cafes of New Orleans, or just beignets and coffee at Cafe du Monde at the French Market!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Yes, this place is cute. It's in a really good location. It's got a nice little courtyard and a couple of swimming pools. The room had fancy canopied beds and interesting antique art work. However, the bathroom was total rubbish. So small, you had to climb over the toilet to get the door closed. Moldy and dingy. It was like a 1950's motor court motel's bathroom. I consider this unacceptable in a hotel. Second to a clean, comfortable bed - I need a clean, comfortable bathroom. Especially at this price. Also, the staff was kinda friendly, but maybe a bit more on the abrupt side than really felt welcoming. The next time I visited New Orleans, I stayed somewhere else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked a "Deluxe Double" with 2 queen beds. On check-in, the valet walked us out to the parking court and pointed to the building which held our room--no offer to show us to it, no offer to carry our bags. The room numbering system is a bit peculiar--533 is on the third floor in building 5, which we found because we ran into other guests, not because of any information from the staff. Room was small and a bit worn, but clean and quiet. During a four-night stay, maid service appeared only once, so beds were un-made and supplies not replenished. AC stopped working during the last night of our stay--fortunately it was cool in NO that night. Stella! restaurant is on premises.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband & I have been to New Orleans 4 times, and we've stayed at this hotel the last two times that we've visited. It is the most beautiful hotel. The rooms are all done with Victorian-era furniture, paintings, etc. The first time we stayed there we went with another couple and shared a suite. It was just great! 2 nice beds, our own patio, and a huge bathroom. The second time my husband just went and we stayed in a deluxe room. And it was smaller, but just as nice. The staff is wonderful, very helpful, maid service is exceptional. Also a great location in the French Quarter. Close to the French Market, and only a few blocks away from Bourbon Street. I highly recommend this hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed the Hotel Provincial during French Quarter Fest. The location was great; we even stopped by the room as we walked back and forth thru the Quarter to different Festival events. We enjoyed the antiques. Our room was in the main building overlooking the pool. We kept the transom window above the doors open and the ceiling fan on low - great for atmosphere and we didn't need the air conditioning. There was a slight musty smell in the room, maybe because of a leak in the sink faucet. The furnishings could use some renovation to make them top notch, but they're nice and old like the French Quarter. The staff, especially the bellmen, were really helpful. They were one of the best parts.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were really enjoying our stay, everybody was very helpful until the last day of our visit. We had added a day on a couple of weeks ago and we confirmed when we checked in. However, nobody told us we were going to be required to change rooms for the last day. We happened to stop by to get our car around 3 PM and found that out. We had told them in a previous phone call and on our first day that we did not want building 5, but lo and behold that is where they were sending us. So we cancelled and left. Unfortunately for all the quaintness, there was a communication gaffe and also no apology by Robert to even try to work it out. It was "it is our only room, take it or leave it". We will not be returning.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a great place to stay. We had been here five years ago came back and were not disappointed. Rooms were really nice. Ask for the 500 building and for a balcony. Step out your window onto the balcony overlooking Decatur Street. A table with chairs are on the balcony. So pour yourself an ice cold tasty beverage and sit and enjoy watching all the people go by. Usually can hear music from across the street. Better in the afternoon in the shade. If you need a refrigerator just ask them at the front desk if one is available they will get one for you. I also like that your car is parked in a fairly secure area but easily accessible. We do not go to New Orleans that often but when we do this is the place for us!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I, along with our 22 year old son traveled to New Orleans for a family get-away in January. I spent many hours in search of the right hotel for our stay, and I was not disappointed. The Hotel Provincial is in a great location, close enough to the French Market, Canal St. and the Bourbon St. area. At night, it is quiet and peaceful. The people at the desk are very helpful when asked for suggestions on dining, etc. The 3 of us shared a room with 2 very comfortable double beds. The TV was a new flat screen, and a mini refrigerator was placed in our room at our request. There is a continental breakfast served in the lobby, however we never made it in there. We slept in every morning and missed the spread!</p></li>

We had a group of 5 couples and everyone was completely happy with the hotel. We were given great rooms - right at the pool/courtyard. The hotel truly has a "New Orleans" atmosphere - full of character and charm, and in an absolutely Perfect Location!!! I found the staff to be friendly also. I am assuming the rooms other people have stayed in who have written the bad reviews for this hotel might be in one of the buildings behind the pool area, although they were renovating a building back there when we were there. I was in room 112, and our friends were right around us, on first or second floor, so requesting a specific room might be not be a bad idea.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We could not have asked for more. Located about 6-8 blocks off the heart of Bourbon St gives you quiet sleep. Very close to Jackson Square, French Market, Margaritaville, etc (We recommend Margaritaville for inexpensive drinks, 5-6 bucks vs 8-10 on Bourbon...and you can get it to go!). The hotel is beautiful, supposedly the most haunted hotel in America according to a google search. Decor is beautiful, classic New Orleans luxury, without the price tag. Staff was friendly and the hotel was spotless. The bed was a welcome comfort after days of walking and having a great time. The only complaint: walking up a long flight of stairs to our room after walking all night and in the New Orleans heat! We LOVED this place, can't say enough good about it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed there December 26th through the 30th. The prices were $69 for one night and $89 for the other three nights. We had a room overlooking the parking lot (which was not bad since we could see if our relatives were there yet). Mainly we saw other roofs. We stayed in room 535 which is said that the 500 building is haunted since it use to be a confederate hospital. We did get a strange picture (which I will include). Breakfast was fine. I loved their big muffins. They also had coffee, juice, eggs, rolls and bagels. We were within three blocks of Jackson Square and a block to the Urseline Convent and Beuregard/Keys house. You could hear the people next door at times. They did forget to bring us soap for the first night. Not a biggie. We would like to stay there again.</p></li>

Our room was large, with a big brass bed, two stuffed chairs, a smaller chair, a dresser and a large round table. The bathroom had a sink with a large marble counter, in a separate room from the shower and toilet. There's a small closet, too. Plenty of room for our things. The furniture is not new, and the carpets may have had some spots, but it was clean and comfortable. The A/C worked perfectly when the humidity became unbearable (in March).

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 6 days at Hotel Provincial. The room (101) was clean. The mattress was terrible. Every time one of us moved it woke the other up. Room 101 was a deluxe room with a king bed that was on a courtyard. Unfortunately, we were also the first room that everyone went by after a night out on Bourbon St. It was noisy at night, especially when people sat in the courtyard talking and laughing loudly and smoking at all hours of the night. You could smell the smoke in the room from outside. Then you heard everyone else traipsing by the room to go to breakfast. Needless to say we didn't get much sleep. Their idea of "luxurious" bedding was a white quilt with 200 thread count sheets (yes I checked the label). If you stay here, ask for a room that is in the back so it is quieter. Staff were nice. Good location in the French Quarter.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We needed one room for just one night after visiting western LA. for a few days to catch an early flight home the next day. So we took the best price off of a travel web page. We have been to Nawlins 5 times total since katrina and have seen this hotel advertised before on our travels so we were curious. The lobby under construction for a bar area was no big deal to us. The separate buildings of the place with courtyard and parking is unique to where we have stayed before. The steps to the room could be a problem for some but the room with it's own balcony and decor was neat to us. There are plenty rooms ground floor. You are at one end of the quarter so the walk is a ways to canal street but that's what you do in the Quarter....walk....and it's good for you and fun and safe and interesting. We found the room to be just what we needed for the night being quiet and peacful and very comfortable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Arrived 5 hours prior to check in. They were kind enough to let us park and return later for check in. Terry was a really great valet guy, very helpful. Nice continental breakfast in the morning, the usual fare. Coffee 24 hours in the lobby, nice pool. Car was parked right next to hotel for easy access. Rooms were very large, most comfortable bed ever. Only issue was when drying hair and iron were one power was knocked out twice. Once was on a Friday night with minimal staff. We had to get ready in the dark until someone (friendly Terry) could flip the breaker. This is an old hotel so this could be expected. Late check out of noon was great, and they kept the car for an extra few hours. Free internet, but could be spotty. Sometimes I could get a wifi connection, sometimes no. Close enough to Bourbon and Jackson square, 3-5 minute walk, but far enough it wasn't loud at night. Would stay again, loved it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed at the Provincial a couple of times and it's a gem. It's located close to everything in the French Quarter, but far enough away that you don't get a lot of noise. I felt safe walking the streets around the hotel. The rooms are nice, with antique and traditional furniture - the bathrooms are a bit old, but get the job done. The place is much larger than it looks and has great - affordable - on site parking. There is also a good sized swimming pool that is NICE on a hot day - which there are many of in New Orleans! The staff is wonderful - very helpful and accommodating. Breakfast is included in the room rate. It's pretty basic - bagels, toast, pastry, hard boiled eggs and yoghurt. It wouldn't take much to make the breakfast nicer - it would be the only area where I think they could easily improve. Overall, it's a terrific hotel and my friends and I all try to stay there when we are in the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One thing do not go by the picture featured on the web site. The rooms are nice if you like the older charm of New Orleans. But if your looking for a 4 star hotel this is not the one. The rooms are quite drafty and stale smeeling. The carpet looks like the homeless from New Orleans had spent a few nights there. The tub and shower would be nice if you were born in the 1800s because weve heared that the average height of a person was 5 foot which is what you would have to be to take a shower or a bath. When we first arrived at the hotel the bellman took us to room 520 which was quite nice except that it was already occupied. Come to find out we were supposed to be in room 320 instead. All in all the location was excellent and if you dont plan to spend anytime in the room and dont want to take a shower its for you. As for us we would not recomend this hotel unless your in a bind and just need some place to stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel based on reviews of previous travelers. I was not disappointed. The Provincial is in the quiet end of the French Quarter, literally a few blocks from the river, trolley and the action. It isw a complex of 5 buildings. (We were in the main one facing the pool.) Our room had canopied beds and antique furniture. The bathroom was smallish but adequate. There is a flat screen tv and a ceiling fan, plus ac. My only bug about the room is that there really is n't sufficcient light to read by at night. The room comes with a complimentary continental breakfast. There is a 5 star restaurant (Stella) on the premesis. The hotel staff, from housekeeping, bell hop to desk clerks were outstanding in their southern hospitality. Any questions were cheerfully answered, directions given and even noise problems solved. The hotel is walking distance to Cafe DuMond, all of the fine dining establishments and Bourbon Street.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed at the Provincial many times over the course of 15+ years. My recent stay, June 18-20, found the hotel to be in good operating condition. I had first booked a room at one of the large corporate chains, mainly because they offer high speed Internet connections. As time drew closer to my date of departure, I decided to support a local business. The staff at Provincial was pleasant and accommodating. My room was cleaned every day. I had a deluxe room which appeared to have been freshly paintied. The door of my room opened onto a lovely courtyard. As one reviewer noted, there is no in-room/lobby coffee service. However, Stanley, the restaurant accessable through the townhouses, is open for breakfast and lunch. Stanley makes a good cup of dark, New Orleans coffee. I recommend the Provincial as a Quarter location. Given the circumstances, I'm tempted to give the hotel and "excellent" rating. Very good is a more applicable rating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You really cannot ask for a better location when looking for a hotel in New Orleans, the Provincial is slap bang in the middle of the French Quarter. But you're safe from the noise of Bourbon as the hotel is a good three or four blocks away in a much quieter area. The hotel itself - the website is a bit misleading because it only shows pictures of the rooms clustered around the pool area. There is actually another bigger building at the back. Nothing especially wrong with this - the room was fine, comfortable beds and clean, but make sure you check before arriving if you want to stay in a room by the pool. Breakfast again is nothing special, just a muffin, pastry and coffee but suited us fine. The hotel, while not especially luxurious, fits in the with the French Quarter style and you really do feel like you're in the middle of the Big Easy as opposed to a big souless, hotel chain where you could be anywhere in the world! Enjoy your stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Husband and I stayed at this hotel because he was attending a conference here. We were not expecting much and were pleasantly surprised. The hotel room was large and clean. The decor was a little old fashioned for my taste but it suited the historic building. The bed was extremely comfortable. Our room faced Chartres St. and had these huge louvered windows. They were gorgeous but at night you can here every conversation, every car and every horse and carriage clip clop down the street. If you are a light sleeper, request a room further back. The hotel offers many quiet little courtyards to relax in and a rather basic continental breakfast. We walked to Cafe Du Monde which is only a few blocks away. The hotel also offers coffee and tea all day, and the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The location could not be better. It was really close to all of the sights but far enough away to escape the late night craziness on bourbon street.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel for a week while attending a convention. We chose this hotel as many of our fellow conventioneers were staying here as well. The best thing about this hotel is it's location: Very close to the street car that takes you along the river to Riverwalk; on the edge of the French Quarter so away from Bourbon St; lots of great restaurants within easy walking distance. If you decide to stay here, be aware that the hotel is located on a busy street corner with trucks going by on starting at 5 am. Be sure you get an inside room facing the courtyard. We requested a quiet room only to have to move because our room was on Ursuline and very noisy. This hotel is in bad need of a overhaul: Carpets need cleaning; rooms need repainting--just generally shabby. This may not be true of the new section at the back of the property. On the plus side, the front desk staff were very polite, efficient and helpful--couldn't have asked for better service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiancee and I stayed at the Hotel Provincial for the first Mardi Grais after Katrina and it was GREAT!!! We were there from 2/24/06 to 3/1/06 and were very pleased with everything. From the moment we pulled in, a friendly valet/belhop unloaded our car and carried our bags up to our room. The front desk was very helpful in locating some local attractions and gave us a map of the area. the room was great, French doors entering into a tastefully decorated room which overlooked a large courtyard with a fountain and a pool. The bathroom was perhaps the onlyh gripe as some of the tile along the tub was cracked, however that was the ONLY thing we could find with the place. Our car was always brought promptly when asked and the maid service was great without being introusive. You're two blocks from Bourbon St. and likewise to the Mississippi River. Plenty of good resturants within walking distance. Definately would stay there again if we return to New Orleans.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Provincial for 3 nights. It is in a good location - nice and quite but close enough to all the hot spots. The room we were in (500 block) was at the back of the hotel and was very noisy as it was next to the lift and some large air con vents on the ground floor which kept us up, other guest were very noisy and woke us up several times during our stay. The room was large enough, bathroom small and the room was stuffy and hard to breath. We only had breakfast one morning and it was average but would do for some, we left early the day we checked out and would not allow us to take a muffin or bagel on the way as it was before 8am, which I thought was a little rude. The courtyards are lovely if you are staying near them and not at the back end of the parking lot. The staff were fine but not as friendly or as helpful as I have experienced in other hotels. I would reccomend this hotel to others but if we returned we would try somewhere different.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I rented two rooms at the Hotel Provincial Jan. 10 for 4 nights, was pleased with the friendly and helpful staff. The first room I was in was too small so I requested another room, which they did so immediately. I upgraded my son's room to a two room suite for an extra $20, it was very nice and roomy, the decor in both rooms was very nice. My son was in room 324...I would definitely recommend it! I was in room 515, which is quite roomy..there is renovation going on in building 5, which 515 is in, but no big deal! I saw room 314 I believe it is, was really nice with 2 double beds, a couch and sitting area, each room is different, some large, some small, but all decorated in antiques. No cookie cutter rooms here....good prices found thru the internet, would definitely recommend the Hotel Provincial. One last thing, there is a nice courtyard with a fountain off from the hotel lobby, the rooms there would be good with your entrance to your room in the courtyard.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location of the hotel is primo for walking to whereever you want in the Quarters. The setting is beautiful. Gorgeous Courtyard. I feared there would be a lot of waterbugs/palmetto bugs with all the water and vegetation, but I didn't see a single one. The staff is very attentive and nice. The breakfast was skimpy though- coffee, tea, OJ, pastries, apples, and hard boiled eggs. Rooms are hit or miss. The first night we were in a corner room right on the street and that was horrible. I have a phobia that prevents me from sleeping on the first floor, so they moved us to a gorgeous suite in the 400 building the next day. The walls are ridiculously thin, but the noise from the heating and the tv drowned most of it out. My friend found a nail clipping in her bathroom upon chekcing in. And her room was above the restaurant so she heard the piano until closing, which could be good or bad. I got a great deal from Orbitz, but probably will not opt to stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On a whim, my kids and I decided to stay a weekend in New Orleans. We saw a flyer at the Louisanna Welcome Center advertising Hotel Provential, it was a great rate. They were very nce about giving me the rate, the hotel was not the fanciest I've ever stayed at, but it was really nice. Very very clean. And it smelled good, a little old but good. Lots and lots of character. Loved the pool and courtyard. Employees were nice and helpful. I felt safe at night in the hotel without my husband. It all felt personal, not like a big chain hotel, more like a visit at Grandma's when all the cousins are there too. The perfect location was great. We didn't wear ourselves out getting to the places we wanted to explore, or the tours we went on. New Orleans will never recover from the hurricane, but they will survive and flourish. Despite the damages still showing in so many places there is a great deal of life left in the city. And it is wonderful to see it making a come back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My new bride and I had stayed here many times and loved it. Finally, we decided to get married there this summer, and that was a great decision. The staff there was so nice and they did a great job taking care of my wife and I and our party of about 20 guests. Hotel Provincial is a beautiful old place in the heart of the French Quarter with cozy rooms and a really nice pool. (I don't think there are many pools is the French Quarter.) There's also a pleasant courtyard with a fountain where we did the wedding ceremony. It's close to everything, but it's far enough away from Bourbon that it remains peaceful. Part of the complex was once used as a Civil War Hospital and there are rumors of ghosts and such, but we've never seen anything strange (unfortunately!) Everybody in our party commented on how much they love the place and how they want to come back. My wife and I will also be returning, and we'll definitely stay at the Provincial as we have on every visit since 2000.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went to New Orleans in December because of the low hotel rates (and just because!), and the Hotel Provincial turned out to be a very good value for the money. The location is perfect - only a couple of blocks to Cafe DuMonde and Jackson Square, only a few blocks to the Bourbon Street madness, yet on a quiet street. Our room was the one over the driveway (the one I read complaints about in other reviews here), but we had no trouble with noise. The room was small - typical of a European hotel room or any room in an old hotel in a city center like this. The bathroom wasn't fancy, but it was fine. The bed was a queen size, which is good for us because we normally sleep in a queen, and king size beds always feel too gigantic! The hotel is reportedly haunted, but we didn't see any ghosts. Darn! The only complaint was the continental breakfast, which was very limited. Oh, and the transom window over the door let in light from the hall even when all the lights were out in the room.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed 4 nights in February at the Provincial on the 3rd floor of the 500 building. The room had a large desk for my laptop, a small table and chairs, a dresser, a flat screen TV and a king size bed. The room overlooked Decatur Street and the French Market. During the day, there was a jazz band that played across the street at the Gazebo Cafe, the music was a pleasant background noise for working and by 9 p.m. it was quiet even on the street. The hotel is in a pleasant part of the French quarter. I walked each day to the Marriott on Canal for a convention and the .7 mile walk which I usually took down Rue Royal was a nice window shopping experience each day. Breakfast around the corner at the Croissant D'Or is a must-do. The only negative I have is that the mattress was a bit firm for my liking and the rooms are in need of a bit of sprucing. But mattresses are very subjective and it is normal that a 100 year old building would need a bit of TLC. I would certainly stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a typical case where you get what you pay for, nothing impressive! A big plus for the hotel is its location: just a couple of blocks from the Cathedral (on the same street) in front of Jackson Square. The hotel offers complimentary breakfast (Ok for American, lame for foreigners) and parking which is very convenient as you park your car and forget about it. This hotel comprises a group of five more or less recovered buildings. I was in room #534 (building 5) and it furniture was in pretty bad shape. Ah, if you get this room and wonder about the open tube showing from the ceiling above the hand basin, it is the drainage for the air conditioner unit which drains directly into the sink below. So if you are washing your teeth be careful not to get the back of your neck all wet with condensed water. Lately, I tried to post this comment on the hotel web page (www.hotelprovincial.com) and it was censored so do not believe everything is just perfect as the messages seem to indicate.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For our first trip to The Big Easy my husband and I decided to step out of our hotel-chain comfort zone and try somewhere with a boutique-feel instead that came highly recommended by a friend. The French Quarter location is excellent, just a short walk to the energy of Bourbon street yet far enough away from the action to ensure a quiet night sleep. There were short bursts of building noise as the hotel renovates a much needed small bar and breakfast area at the front of the hotel, scheduled to be completed September 2011. Hotel Provincial may need a lick of paint here and there but that doesn't detract from it's eclectic charm. The courtyard area has strong European influences and it was hard to believe that we were still in the Deep South. The courtyard it was a perfect place to relax and recharge after a night out, and the hotel was the ideal choice for our two night stay in New Orleans. The charming aura of the hotel fitted in perfectly with the endearing bohemian atmosphere of the city itself.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for a special event on Bourbon street. The hotel is just enough off Bourbon street to be away from the flash and glitter when you need a break or when you want to sleep. The hotel itself is darling. We got a room overlooking the pool on the second floor and loved it. The pool courtyard is simply beautiful with the antique green pool surrounded by red brickwork decking and walls. There are numerous courtyards in the hotel and it is lovely to walk around exploring them to find a peaceful spot by one of the fountains in one of the courtyard gardens. The hotel is pretty secure. The Lobby door is locked late at night and entry is through the locked security gate with presentation of the room key for ID. The hotel is close enough to everything to walk everywhere, not only on bourbon street but also close to Decatur with all of its shops and restaurants, Jackson park wtih its artists and performers, and the riverfront. We booked through travelocity and we were very happy with the rate we got. We will return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Don't get me wrong, I love this hotel and will keep coming back, but the room that we stayed in off the main courtyard needed some updating other than the flat screen TV. First of all, we didn't sleep well in the mornings due to rude people who, after getting their free breakfast, congregated in the courtyard moving around the heavy wrought iron chairs and talking loudly. Not the hotels' fault, but still we couldn't sleep past 7am. The room smelled strange, like a pepper spray smell...we had to get some incense from the voodoo store to mask the smell. Also, the bathroom was in major need of attention. It was no better than a cheap interstate motel bathroom. The exhaust fan was as loud as a lawnmower (I kid you not) and the tub was stained with cigarette burns. What I love about this place is the georgious grounds which are kept in prestine condition and the free internet in the main lobby. Maybe next time, we'll get a suite and hope for a better nights sleep... Be sure and eat at Irene's Cuisine just around the corner...</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of 4 wanted to stay in the French Quarter in a non-chain hotel and this was the perfect choice for us. It has the cutest little courtyard with a swimming pool and a sitting area. There are several buildings that make up the hotel. We paid forty bucks to upgrade to a bigger room in the center of the courtyard. It came with two very comfortable beds, a couch that folds out (that wasn't so comfortable) and a bathroom. It was nice enough, but the courtyard made it for us. We grabbed a drink from the bar at the hotel and sat in the courtyard to just relax after a long day of walking the city. This hotel's location is excellent. One block one direction is Decatur which is where Cafe Du Monde is located, the french market, the parade, etc. It's all right there. One block the other direction is Royal and then Bourbon.Just a few short blocks to Jackson Square, the Riverfront, anything you want. All kinds of restaurants, bars, shopping are just steps from the hotel. We will definately stay here when we return to New Orleans.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is older which gives it charm. However, the rooms are not as clean as they should be. The carpet was dirty, old and the ceiling fan was covered with dust. The housekeeping staff was very stingy with the towels and shampoo. They also did not dust the room/furniture well. The furniture was cute but they really need to upgrade their beds. The vents need to be cleaned badly. The air quality in the room was worse than the outdoors. The Front Desk was not very efficient. For a New Yorker, they were too slow moving and when booking an excursion, one Front Desk rep said to could not answer any questions nor could he give me any suggestions. Shortly after, I went to ask another female Front Desk and was helpful and actually booked the Steamboat excursion for us. However, it turns out her calculations were wrong. We didn't find out until we were at the Will Call window. Overall, the hotel does not get favorable reviews from us. They really need to work harder on their customer service from their cleanliness to retraining their staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Provincial August 21st and enjoyed the location, but the hotel needs some work on guest services. There was a dirty rag left right outside our door and there was no top sheet on the bed. The night manager brought us a sheet that we put on, but left the dirty rag outside the door. The outside doors have a visible gap to the outside, which explains the entry point of the mosquito that bit me all night long. The air conditioning was noisy and very musty. I turned it off in the middle of the night and used the ceiling fan only, until the noise became too much. The location is great, but the place is not a bargain for what you get. We stayed three night at the Hotel Pavillion the week before and loved it, with only a $20 per night room charge difference. The night male managers were very curteous; the two female desk folks couldn't give us the time of day. The valets were terrific and most helpful. I have to say I was disapointed by the glowing reviews others gave this place as I often make a decision based on the reviews.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having enjoyed a charming stay at this hotel several years ago I was hoping that its slightly off the beaten track French Quarter location and quaint courtyard layout - with rooms arranged around pools and fountains - would provide a pleasant respite during a recent business trip. Unfortunately it seemed that the rooms had not been maintained, or possibly even cleaned, since I was last there. Knowing the hotel, I asked for an interior (off-street) room when booking but was given a room on the main street when I checked in. Staff accommodated my request for a room change, but it took 6+ hours, and a quizzical attitude regarding one's ability to ignore bizarre or illegal behavior on account of this being "the Quarter, honey." I finally ended up in a room with a slow drain (5 minutes+ to empty, making for a logistics challenge) in the bathrooom sink, a mysterious pipe opening in the ceiling which leaked liquids onto the vanity area (and me) at all times, and which actually faced onto a different street.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The staff of The Hotel Provincial is beyond compare! Our stay started with Margie, the sales manager. She helped us arrange rooms for about 20 guests from all over the country. She was a wonderful help making sure that everyone had the room type they needed. On our arrival everyone from the front desk to the bell hops were more than helpful. When my future mother-in-law wanted a diet coke, one of the staff members went out of her way to get it for her. The rooms were full of character and ambience. The hotel is a comfortable walk to everything in the French Quarter, but away from the noise and smell of Bourbon Street. The courtyards were enjoyed by everyone in our party. The parking was great because it was on site and the cars were available when needed. My husband and I stayed in the Honeymoon Suite and loved it. There was a balcony, beautiful antiques, high ceilings, and an old brick fireplace. If you want to stay in a place with lots of New Orleans character, an awesome location, and staff that goes above and beyond Hospitality....then the Hotel Provincial is the place.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Watch out for the shower & get a room in the back!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is away from Bourbon street enough that it is quiet at night, but our room at the front of the hotel near the check in area was very noisy in the morning due to people loading their cars and dragging the luggage carts across the cobble stone drive. Checkout time was noon and we were awakened twice by the cleaning staff, once at 9 and again at 10 to ask if we were leaving that day. I don't believe I should have to put up a DO NOT DISTURB sign until after checkout time, so maybe I am to blame, but a note to remember to other travelers. I have not had this problem at other hotels. The water in the shower during the evening was VERY erratic and would go from warm to hot to freezing back to scalding hot, etc. Good pressure, but hard to enjoy a shower. That occurred about 8 pm when I expect alot of usage. I showered again the next day about 11 am and the problem was non existent, so I suspect just alot of usage contributes. Shower when everyone else isn't! Parking was secure. I would stay there again, but I would get a room at the back where I think it would be quieter.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just returned from a week in NO and were extremely happy with our choice of the Hotel Provincial. After reading some negative comments about building #5, we requested a room in any other bldg when booking through Expedia. We were apprehensive when we arrived to find our room was in #5, but it turned out to be just fine with us. We had a window overlooking the French Mkt, and a view of the river off in the distance. The building is old, but the room and bathroom were good sized and clean. We thought it was charming with its chandelier, old style furniture and decor, beautiful courtyard, and the sounds of the ships coming into the harbor. Very New Orleans. We have stayed in 3 other hotels in NO in the past, and the Provincial has absolutely the best location if you want to be in the French Quarter. Our only complaint was the bed was pretty hard, and our non-smoking room smelled like cigarette smoke a few nights when the people across the hall were smoking, but that can happen in many hotels. We got a great rate and will definitely stay in this hotel when we come back.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were at the Hotel Provincial for 3 nights and loved it. We had a room that opened into the beautiful courtyard. This hotel is older, but that's to be expected in the French Quarter. The room was comfortable, clean and cozy. The bathroom was quite small, but we expected it to be small. The AC/Heat was very quiet. There was no microwave, refrigerator or coffeemaker in the room, but there was 24 hour coffee near the lobby. Breakfast included muffins, bagels, cereal, coffee, hardboiled eggs. There was 1 luggage rack, but room on the dresser for a 2nd suitcase. The TV had 40+ channels. The hotel staff was pleasant and helpful. The location is ideal if you want to walk almost anywhere in the French Quarter. Also, this location is much quieter than the hotels on Bourbon Street. Be advised - there is a daily valet parking charge for parking your car, but almost all the hotels in the French Quarter charge for parking. However, the parking here is in a secure, enclosed parking area. The courtyard is a charming area where you can sit and drink coffee, read the paper, etc. The hotel has both a fountain and a swimming pool within the courtyard area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have visited New Orleans 13 times over the past 20 years and last stayed at The Provincial about 10 years ago.we had considered staying there again in 2007 but our tour advisor said there had been some security problems so we stayed elsewhere. This time we decided to take a chance and book The Provincial.Our room was in the main building,was a reasonable size but the decor was a bit 'tired' - but the pool and courtyard areas were very good.Our main problem with the room was that in looked out onto Chartres Street and suffered from traffic noise late at night and early mornings. Unlike a previous complaint the air con worked ok in our room. Initially disappointed that there was no longer any hotel breakfast restaurant but the free continental breakfast made up for this. Our main disappointment was not the hotel but the fact that,outside of the Jazz Fest dates,there is very little live jazz to be found - apart from the excellent Palm Court Restaurant/Nightclub on Decatur. Also a combination of Katrina & recession seems to have hit New Orleans badly with closing some of our favourite eateries closing, many shops missing from River Walk Shopping Mall and the demise of the main music stores.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Provincial is in a wonderful location, near enough to the night life in the French Quarter, but far enough away to enjoy a peaceful, relaxing break. We stayed at Hotel Provincial at the beginning of May, we were 'in town' for the Jazz Fest (what an experience!). Hotel is just lovely, with the right amount of antique furniture to give it that 'Old World Charm' ambience. Room was a good size, with plenty of hanging space for clothes in the bathrom. We were lucky enough to get a room with access to the balcony. Great for people watching and enjoying a drink whilst listening to the music from the restaurant across the road. Staff at check in and out were very efficient and pleasant, the sort of service we have had at most US hotels on our travels! House keeping were very discreet, never saw a housekeeper, but room was spotlessly clean. Continental breakfast and all day coffee were most welcome as a start to the day. If you decide to get pastries from the bakery just around the corner, go early, you can queue for ages! To sum up, a lovely hotel with great staff, good prices for Jazz Fest week. We will probably return to New Orleans in the future and will definately stay at Hotel Provincial.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having visited NOLA many times, we were searching for the perfect place for our quick get-aways. We found it at the Hotel Provincial. The price was more than right as we found a coupon at the visitor's center. The grounds and facilities were beautiful. The staff was very accomodating to our requests. We were originally in a room that faced the street. When we asked to be moved, they came to our room immediately and took us to a much quieter room. The courtyards were the perfect place to relax and read, or have a quick picnic of Central Grocery muffalettas in the cool shade. After a day of walking and exploring, the two pools were a great bonus for coolng off before heading out to dinner. The location is ideal; it's a close walk to many of the sites and the French Quarter, but far enough away from all of the noise that comes with that area. The staff knew we were there to celebrate our anniversary and had a listing of special romantic places for dinner (several of which we had not heard about or visited from our previous trips) waiting for us when we arrived at check-in. The staff was always very friendly and accomodating. We will definitely be making the Hotel Provincial our place to stay on future trips to NOLA.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This historic hotel is dripping with old New Orleans charm and I would stay here again. Valet parking is on site, which I appreciated, as I didn't have to worry about the location of my car. The original room we were given had a balcony, with a floor to ceiling window for access, which was very cool, however, the room had a horrible moldy odor that the air conditioner just couldn't overcome. After two nights of sleeping with my head under the sheet so I couldn't smell that odor, I spoke with some of the other guests and found that none of them had a complaint. I asked at the front desk for a different room, explaining the problem, and they were very curtious and offered us a choice of two different rooms. We moved within 20 minutes and were extremely happy that we did. Although the second room didn't have the balcony, it had a ceiling fan (wonderful) and a small courtyard with a table and chairs. The staff was friendly and helpful, with a great knowledge of the restaurants and local activities...I loved them. If you go, be sure to compare prices on the bus tours and with a GPS, it's an easy drive to some of the plantations. Admission is about $15, while a bus tour is about $50. Be sure to go to Willie Mae's Scotch House for lunch...the best fried chicken in the world! P</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at Hotel Provicial for 2 nights since he had a 3 day business meeting at this hotel. We were in building 5 and there was an elevator that we never had to wait for. The room was small and needed updating. Bathroom sink water was not always hot and the shower had a hard time regulating the temperature. The bathroon sink clogged on the first day we were there. Carpet was ripped in several spots and the flat screen tv very small. The room itself was clean but very noisy (toiled made noises all night and the fuse box in the closet was loud) There was alot of music from the French Market right outside and people on the streets. The location is great, right in the French Quarter and an easy walk to Riverwalk for shopping. The staff is very friendly and pleasant. Courtyards and pools are beautiful and well maintained. Continental breakfast that included pastries, muffins and apples. Coffee and hot tea available at all times. We skipped the breakfast and walked the 2 blocks to Cafe DuMond for hot beignets. We would not stay here again just due to the fact that we did not like the rooms. I had requested a king bed several times and while the hotel seemed empty our request was not honored. The double beds were very uncomfortable. Price was reasonable at $129.00 a night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at Hotel Provincial for 2 nights. The hotel complex includes 5 buildings and is within walking distance to just about anything in the French Quarter, which was great. That said, we were very disappointed in the room. We paid for a premium room, which we were told meant that our window would face the courtyard or pool area. Instead, our room was in the building furthest from the main building, the room and bathroom seemed shabby, rather than just dated, and our only window faced the street. No big deal, but we were charged for a premium room. When we questioned the view, we were told that a premium room also included looking out at the street, so we just accepted rather than argue. Thing is, the room was so small that the space between the window and the bed was about one-half foot. You really couldn't look out the window without standing on the bed. Also, because the streets are so narrow, all we could see was the trees that lined the street. If you wanted to look at the street you had to put your head against the window and look down. Also, when the air conditioner was running, it was very loud and about 30 seconds after it shut off, there was a very, very loud noise - needless to say, I didn't get a good night's sleep. The room was overrated, and If you book a room there, don't bother to pay for a premium room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband, daughter and I were looking for a hotel with a pool since we would be in New Orleans in the heat. We also wanted a room which offered more than the average 2 double bed size since we would be there almost a week and have different sleeping and waking up patterns ( I hate spending all my time in a hotel room sitting on the beds). We wanted to be in the quarter at a reasonable price. Not too much to ask, right? This hotel delivered all we wanted, and was in a lovely, quaint setting to boot. I called the hotel directly to ask a question about the suites listed online and was able to get a petite suite with 2 queen size beds and a small sofa/sitting area. It was very quiet and we had a lovely courtyard, often to ourselves. The pool was close to us and nice, not very busy when we were there. There is a smaller pool through the back courtyard of Restaurant Stella!, be sure to look for it. The hotel is made up of 5 separate buildings, the 500 building was a civil war hospital and is reputed to be haunted. If you go on a haunted history tour, they may stop at your hotel! Freaked my daughter out even though we had read about the haunting, but also gave her a cool story to tell her friends. The only problem we had was the air conditioner was not super efficient and the room was more damp when it was on. But, we would definitely stay here again on our next trip to New Orleans.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose this hotel based on its proximity to the French Market, Fiorella's, and Jackson Square; its status as a quaint historic property; and its views. In all of these areas I was completely satisfied with my stay, especially for the cost ($145 per night). By booking directly by phone, my parents and I were able to get a room with a balcony; we wound up in building five with a lovely shared balcony looking out onto Decatur. The balcony, which one has to climb out the window to access, was the best part of the room. In the lovely May weather we were able to sit outside and people-watch while we chatted and drank margaritas. The room itself was not new, which is to be expected based on the descriptions of the property--it was clean, however, and filled with antiques and furniture that was somewhat scuffed. We laughed that nothing in the room--from the prints on the walls to the large mirror on the wall to the actual air conditioner vent--hung straight. For us this was not a problem. We considered these aspects part of the hotel's charms, yet for others this may not be ideal. The staff on hand was very helpful and polite, and parking, I felt, was a steal: valet parking for $18 per night. That's good for the French Quarter. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel for those looking for a quaint, affordable stay on this end of the French Quarter. With those criteria in mind, I have absolutely no complaints!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I and several friends visited New Orleans for a family wedding recently. Several of us stayed at the Provincial in a wide assortment of rooms. Ours was a beautifully appointed delux queen with 12 foot ceilings, a fireplace, a gigantic antique bed and armoire and lots of charm. The wide screen television and free high speed internet were a great amenity to have, as was the coffee, tea, and assorted baked goods each morning down in the lobby. The courtyards are nice, too, especially with the wonderful November weather we enjoyed down there, but I wouldn't swim in either of the pools on a bet. The bathroom was probably the only real minus, as the venting in this old building is, well, old, and the shower didn't drain until well after the shower was completed, plus it wasn't terribly clean. Our friends and others in our group had rooms which ranged from dark, damp and cramped to a lovely, bright condo overlooking a beautiful courtyard and garden. One family changed rooms after the first day because they were so disappointed with the room. It seemed that the biggest gripe everyone had was about the bathrooms, general cleanliness and the damp smell. The staff was nice, the location good and rates quite reasonable. Plus, you could print your boarding pass using a convenient computer/printer in the lobby. I don't think we'd stay there again, however, as there are too many other options available.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Provincial for two nights based on the trip advisor reviews. I was on business travel and needed to be in the French Quarter. The location is great (you are about less than a 5 minute walk to the famous Cafe Du Monde). The hotel itself has a lot of charm and from what I gathered, did not sustain much damage from Katrina. My room was a cozy queen bed and clean. It clearly showed its age (chipped plastering in some places, traditional brown decor) but I guess that goes with the charm. The only thing I would say is that if you are a serious business traveler and in need of business amenities--you won't find it here. The only thing the Provincial had was a fax machine (no business center, so I had to use efax to fax myself documents). I would suggest the Omni Royal if you are looking for a more business-traveler friendly hotel. The staff was very sweet and accomodating and everyone said 'hi' to you when they saw you. One thing I thought was a little weird was that I did not get daily maid-service--I am not sure if it's because of reduced staff with Katrina or not--but if you call the front desk they are pretty quick in getting whatever you need. Oh...and the Provincial is on the list of officially haunted New Orleans Hotels. I didn't know before I got there. It's pretty cool. I experienced some phenomenon, but nothing scary. The window doors opened by themselves--could easily attribute to the wind (for those skeptics out there). All in all, a good stay. No problems.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “French Quarter Wedding”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Late review. French Quarter Wedding. I selected this hotel for our wedding after much research on Trip Advisor and personal knowledge of the Quarter. We stayed Feb. 23 â€“ 28, 2011. Had a block of 15 rooms scattered throughout the hotel including building 500 at the back of the property. If you are looking for a hotel that exudes the French Quarter this is it. Yes it is old. Yes the furniture is worn. Yes things may not quite work like a 5 â€“ star hotel. However, the property is well maintained. The beds were comfortable. The rooms were clean. The plumbing lacked at times. The staff was accommodating and friendly. The hotel was decorated for Mardi Gras. We have found with anything in New Orleans â€œjust askâ€�. This is not a cookie cutter hotel. If you want all the ultra-modern conveniences stay at the Hilton. If you want the charm and ambience of the French Quarter stay here. If you are planning a small wedding in the Big Easy, you should consider this hotel. We traveled in from the Baltimore area and everything we did was set-up by phone and email. The staff was awesome in helping us prepare for the wedding. The photographer, musician, and the selections suggested for a group dinner were all spot on. A short civil ceremony was held in the courtyard next to the fountain. Robert was extremely helpful with on-site preparations. The courtyard fountain was also the gathering point for everyone in the party. From the morning coffee to the afternoon wind-down it was the place to relax. The hotel is convenient to the back end of the Quarter- a short walk to The French Market and Jackson Square.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here July of 2004 and found it to be somewhat expensive, but so was everything else in the French Quarter. The best thing about this place is that it is away from the noise of Bourbon Street, yet close to many of the things you will want to do in the French Quarter. We stayed three nights and only took our car out of parking one time. Our room off of the pool area had more charm than your typical hotel chain room, even if it was a little dark. We did have an issue one night with people swimming in the pool past midnight--the rooms off the pool are quite close to the pool, so you will hear people splashing around. And we did have the maid come by before 10am one morning when we were still in bed ... there are also bricks outside the first floor courtyard/pool rooms, so you will be able to hear the maid rolling the housekeeping cart past your door if you sleep in (and this is New Orleans, so you will be sleeping in!). Rates were cheaper Sunday through Wednesday, going up ten dollars a night after that. I thought July would be a time to get a cheaper rate (cuz it IS hot), but we still paid $149-$159, and that was booking through the hotel so we didn't get any of those bad rooms people keep talking about on this site! All in all, I would probably try another hotel next time, just so I could experience another place, but I would recommend it to others staying in the FQ, and I would be willing to stay here myself. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel had a more authentic feel to it. If you are going to the FQ, stay in a non-chain hotel, but make sure you have done your research.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is fair value for the price ($75.00 on hotels.com).... We were here for five nights the first week in January and initially, things were not so great. I had read all the negative comments in regards to building number five, and attempted to call and verify that we were not pre-blocked into this building. We were not and I asked for any building but five. We checked-in and were given 526.... Yikes. I was nervous, and bit upset as because one, it was in building number 5, and two, it was for my fiancee and I, it had two double beds. I was assured that the room had just been renovated, and that they would get me into a queen or a king the next day. It took until the third day to get us out of that room, and the worse part, for those two mornings, it appears they had neglected to tell us that the renovation/construction was on-going... BEGINNING AT 7:00 AM (no exaggeration) each morning.... On both a Friday and Saturday mornings.... Not a way to build repeat business. 7:00 AM? Both days I phoned down, and although Tanya, Joseph, and Erica are really nice folks, the last thing I wanted to hear was, "we asked them to stop, but they won't"... Okay, now, that was the bad part of our stay. The great part our stay... When they did move us (to room 422)... It was a very nice room. With great motif, great bedding, great facilities in general. And again, the staff, from the three mentioned above, to the bellmen (Terry and David)... All appeared to genuinely care. So, if you're debating on whether to choose this hotel... The positives are all there... Great location, great staff, great accommodations (if you can get the right room)....</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First, the good stuf. Nice historic hotel. In good walking distance from most everything in the French Quarter, and just far enough away from the craziness of Bourbon Street. And now the rest... We booked directly through the hotel website a week prior to our stay. We brought our email with our confirmation number along with us. Upon arrival, the woman at the desk said there was no reservation for us. She looked at our confirmation email as though it were written in Chinese. They managed to put us in a room, however, we would have to switch rooms the next day. This was rather inconvenient as we didn't feel like we could settle in at all the first night. We also had to work our room switch around lunch reservations. The woman working the desk that night we arrived did not seem competent to handle the problem, nor horribly apologetic about our hassle. The room was nice, but the bathroom left plenty to be desired. The toilet was rocky, the shower was dingy. There was a big wet spot on the carpet next to one of the beds (I don't even want to know...) The doors to the outside were difficult to close and took slamming to get them shut. This makes for a very noisy place. Also, given that the doors did not seal properly, as people sat outside in the courtyard below to smoke in the morning, the smell permeated our room. It was rather awful. We got back from a long day and found that our keys had been reset and neither of them worked. I've spent far more time dealing with the front desk than I would ever plan to during a hotel stay. I guess the gentleman waiting to make complaints the night that we arrived should have been a clue.... Regardless, the location is great. Just CALL to place/confirm your reservation, and request a room away from the courtyard if you want to stay away from smokers.</p></li>
