It's not the Ritz-Carlton or the Four Seasons, but it has charm, friendly staff, an incredible location, amazing on-site restaurant (try the bloody marys!) and a neat pool and courtyard. The rooms are nicely furnished and comfortable. I am coming back for Halloween and looking forward to it.</p></li>

I was also disappointed that we didn't get a room with a balcony that I wanted, considering most of the rooms have balcony's.

It was so much nicer than the Marriot we stayed in last year. The hotel was quiet, and so close to everything! The staff was friendly and so helpful.

Room was spacious and overlooked the courtyard. The staff was friendly, efficient and helpful. Located 1/2 block off Bourban Street and 3 blocks from Jackson Square, it's close enough to the fun and far enough away from the smells and noise when you're through for the day.</p></li>

However, I was seriously dissapointed. The service of the staff was horrible. As someone said earlier, I believe I would fire most of the front desk staff. Everyone we came in contact with was rude!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful! Wonderful! My brother and I came home to New Orleans to look at our mother's home in Lakeview. We were hunting a place to stay when we saw the banner on the balcony of the St. Marie. Were we ever pleasantly suprised! We found a warm and inviting hotel with a pleasant and accomodating staff. All this in a city that is in recovery mode. Our family home was destroyed but we found a new home away from home. Thank you Hotel St. Marie.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Quaint, clean and professional, great location This is a great stay in New Orleans. The hotel provided great service and the staff was very professional. The rooms/hotel were very clean and nicely decorated. The rooms have balconies that overlook and beautiful courtyard. To top it off, it's right in the heart of the French Quarter about a 1/2 block off Bourban Street on Toulouse. I will stay there again and would definitely recommend it to others.</p></li>

Rooms are small, but very clean and comfortable. I would stay here again, no problem. We ate an awesome restaurant in French Quarter called Irene's, amazing. Can't say enough about it. You will probably wait more than hour to be seated but defenitely worth it!!!! Also go to Mothers for po boys and Port of Call for the best burger in town.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The quiet jewel in the quarter Was apprehensive about staying in the French Quarter with the sounds of a party echoing from Bourbon Street. But found this small hotel, only 1/2 block off of Bourbon, to be a quiet jewel. With a good hotels amenities and a friendly and helpful staff, I found myself able to complete my buisness and enjoy some of the nightlife made famous by Bourbon Street. I highly recommend the Hotel Saint Marie for buisness or pleasure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Charming French Quarter Hotel Friendly staff and good housekeeping. Our room was clean and attractive. Good location within the French Quarter; the block north of Bourbon St helps to buffer it from the noise and crowds. Second floor rooms with balconies facing Dauphine are larger than other floors and quieter than those on Toulouse. Shady interior courtyard is small but pleasant, and a nice break from the heat on the streets. On-site, enclosed valet parking.</p></li>

They are absolutely excellent. From the lobby staff to the barman to the cleaning staff they are all kind and couteous. My colleague was ill for 3 days while staying at the hotel (not the hotel's fault - it started before we arrived) and the staff couldn't do enough to help us. Highly recommended.</p></li>

The front desk clerk, Tasha, was so helpful and greeted us when we came in and went out. Everyone was very personable! Our room was wonderful, clean and the balcony really added to the ambiance of the whole French Quarter experience. Thanks for a wonderful time and we will recommend your hotel to our friends.

I highly recommend the Hotel St. Marie and guarantee you will not be disappointed. I would not stay anywhere else!</p></li>

Last time we stayed at the Prince Conti (nice) and before that the Place d'Armes (Cool)...but we wanted to move around and get another vantage point. The Hotel St. Marie offered that and MORE...much more. The staff is wonderful...the rooms charming, and the location is perfect! Tosha took amazing care of us. And Zack is cool, too.If you can't handle quirky, you don't need to be going to the Quarter.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">many problems in 6 nights We had reserved 2 same floor rooms. Desk clerk said no way ,small hotel, and don't give a ---- attitude. Lack of wash cloths was a daily problem after maid service. One room had a live MOUSE at night  desk clerk said what do you want me to do about it? Next day rodent glue traps were in stair wells. The pool turned green on the third day and remained un usable three days later at checkout. Absolutely no water pressure for showers. Will return to New Orleans but not to the Hotel St Marie.</p></li>

New Year's morning we were awakened by the pitter patter or should I say munch munch of two little mice. As I watched them devour a bag of crackers and then scatter, I looked under the armoire and discovered already present traps. Eight hours later the pest control came and baited them again. Management apologized and comped us a wonderful meal in the restaurant and credited our bill. A class act done without a problem.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Experience! I took a group of 11 American history teachers and their spouses to New Orleans recently for a working vacation. We stayed at the Hotel St. Marie, just a block off Bourbon Street and centrally located near most of the sites we visited. The staff did an excellent job of making us feel at home and providing us with a place to meet and eat each morning. The hotel rooms and other facilities were wonderful. All that went on the trip said they wouldn't hesitate to return to the Hotel St. Marie again. A Great Experience!</p></li>

The staff was friendly, the location was terrific for access to Bourbon Street, and the room was very nice. Be sure to request a room with a balcony (preferably one facing towards Bourbon), as the view is great...and you can have a few cocktails while watching people stumble from Bourbon to God knowns where. We would certainly stay here again on our next visit to New Orleans.</p></li>

We have been hunting a place to be regulars at and I think we have found it. Had a nice room overlooking the courtyard. The flowers were lovely. The staff was warm and fiendly and very very helpful. The hotel is just one half block from Bourbon Street, but once inside her doors we were in a haven of peace and quiet. The hotel is small (only about 100 rooms), but has everything we needed. We will recommend it to everyone we know.</p></li>

Great F.Q. location at Toulouse and Bourbon, yet not noisy from Bourbon St, quiet hotel guests, charming, clean but fraying room, lovely courtyard with a small pool. Tasty breakfast at the hotel's restaurant. You'll have your usual daily parking fee of about $25 (typical for F.Q. hotels). I recently stayed at the Iberville Suites in the Quarter and liked that a bit better for approximately the same price, but I would definitely stay at Hotel St Marie again.</p></li>

The room was adequate, but my partner fell through one of the flimsy chairs, the lightbulbs kept burning out, and the water pressure was next to nill. The front desk receptionist, let's call her Catatonia, never cracked a smile once and didn't seem the least concerned over our problems with the room. The bartenders and service in the restraunt, however, were superb, and the bell hops were helpful. Nice location, very centrally located.</p></li>

We walked every where we wanted to go From French quater market, convention center, casino and superdome. We booked a suite an it was wonderfull. Had a kitchen, nice huge room with balcony, From the balcony you could sit and see the people wlaking across burbon and here the music from some of the local bars. The location and room was priced right. You got more than your moneys worth. The Hotel staff was nice a friendly. very helpfull and smiles all the way.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Outstanding hotel and staff We stayed at the Hotel St. Marie on our honeymoon. It was wonderful. The staff was courteous, friendly, and went above and beyond to help in anyway they could. Hillary's the hotel resturant was outstanding for breakfast. I highly recommend it. The hotel is 1/2 block from Bourbon St. and so close to everything in the quarters. The valet parking is perfect and use a cab when in New Orleans. The only thing I did not like was our room window overlooked the central air units, but other than that the place is ideal for a comfortable stay in New Orleans French Quarter.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Best hotel in New Orleans! Have been to New Orleans four times and this hotel is the best! The location is wonderful, not even a block away from Bourban! The hotel decor is very charming and the pool area was great! The rooms are huge! I stayed in a queen sized room with three other girls and we had plenety of room. We requested a balcony so that we would have a view of Bourban Street which was really nice. The staff was wonderful! We had a 6am flight and the staff made sure that we didnt have any problems with getting a cab to the airport so early in the morning.Hotel St. Marie is the Best!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great As Usual This was the second time staying here. We had stayed last year as well. We have a special place in our heart for this hotel. It is great and homey. Unfortunately the restaurant is no longer there and they are working on getting a new tenant. Remember that many places are still trying to get their businesses in order after the Katrina tragedy. Staff is very friendly and helpful and courteous to your needs. If you are looking for state of the art high frills kind of place, then look else where. If you are looking for a good boutique, old charm New Orleans hotel then make your reservations now.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent!!! We recently stayed a long weekend at the Hotel St. Marie and loved every minute of it! The staff was terrific, helpful and friendly. Breakfast at the hotel was wonderful and the lounge staff was great.Our room's balcony faced the beautifully landscaped court yard and with the property being located 1/2 block from Bourbon Street, it was very quiet. The hotel was EASILY within walking distance to any place in the French Quarters you would wish to visit as well as the Riverwalk and downtown. Our group of 13 loved our stay so much that we have already agreed our next annual get-together will be held here again.Can't wait till next year!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Oh Yuck The pictures that are listed on the Hotel St. Marie's website tell a very different tale than what is actually going on at this mediocre hotel. The staff was not friendly, and although we booked our stay months in advance, we were given a room right next to the garage. The smell of gas and fumes was enough to upset us the first day-until we learned that the only other room was on a smoking floor! (We chose cigarette smoke over gasoline fumes.) I had to go downstairs every time I needed a towel and the ice machine was broken. The stay could have still inspired fond memories if the staff had been at least a little nice. Not a good place to stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A nice hotel...great value and location The Monteleone didn't have a room for one more night, so we had to check out and we stayed at the St. Marie. It's no 4-star like the Monteleone but it's a very nice hotel. It's kept clean, it's comfortable, and its location is great, just 1/2 block from Bourbon and Toulouse, and 3 blocks from Jackson Square. It's amazingly quiet so close to the Bourbon St party scene.Got a great rate thru Orbitz ($74) and the room was large and comfortable, with a courtyard view. Pool is small but the water was great, and the courtyard seems miles away from the wild scene a hundred yards away.I would definitely stay at the St. Marie again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, nice clean room After reading some of the reviews we were going to stay elsewhere, however when that reservation got messed up we ended up in going to Hotel St. Marie. We stayed on the second floor with a balcony. It is a great location (one blk from Bourbon Street). The room was nice and clean - yes the doors can use some paint etc., but it was not bad. Not a 4 star but a good 3.We felt secure and did not have any unexpected guest (rodents etc.). The staff was very helpful and friendly. Parking at $25.00 per night was expensive, but ........Overall, ppl in NO realize that they need the tourist. Very nice and helpful. Went mid week, so it was slow.</p></li>

The Hotel St. Marie was very clean and nice and the entire staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. Our only negative was the dining room being closed for construction. The complimentary sweet rolls and juice were appreciated but after a day or two we'd much rather have a real breakfast to start the day of non stop activities.There is so much to do in New Orleans and we felt so welcome by all who work and live there. Thank you for such a wonderful mini vacation and we will definitely return to the Hotel St. Marie. Mark  Carol Alman</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel with a great Quarter location We booked the Hotel St. Marie for a law school graduation celebration and had a wonderful time. We had three rooms with inside balconies overlooking the pool area. The rooms were huge by Quarter standards and the staff were overly friendly and very helpful.The location could not be better---1/2 block off of Bourbon but none of the noise. We have stayed in the Quarter often but this was our first time at the Hotel St. Marie. We will definitely book again. Great value for the price.Fantastic summer rates have now kicked in. Book a trip and help re-jazz New Orleans. We enjoyed this small hotel immensely. Let the good times roll again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great deal for a wonderful stay! Just returned from a three night stay at the Hotel St Marie, in the French Quarter. What an excellent value for the location. The room size was more than adequate and very clean. We actually could sleep at night, being a half-block from Bourbon Street, yet close to everything we wanted to do. We especially enjoyed the small hotel bar and excellent bartender, Jerry...thank you! There was a convenient small family owned grocery store, Toulouse House Grocery, just around the corner, that makes excellent french bread sandwiches and at a very good price. We were so happy with our stay at the Hotel St Marie that we will definitely stay there for all future N.O. trips.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very satisfied: good value for the price! We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights, and while it wasn't the best hotel we ever stayed in, it was far from the worst. Our room was in the 600 building, and we had to pass through the parking garage to get to our room. As others have mentioned, this hotel is only 1 block from Bourbon Street, but our room was very quiet and comfortable. It is an older hotel and has a lot of charm. Our room was somewhat dark, but it was cleaned daily, and with the air conditioner, we didn't have any problems with dampness. The bed was very comfortable and we slept well. The continental breakfast was just okay, but the coffee was good. For the price [$80/night], we were satisfied and would go back again,</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Locatiom, location! We stayed at the St. Marie for 3 nights. I was amazed at the rate of $66 a night! The location is absolutely the best! We walked everywhere, were only a block from Bourbon, but it was very quiet. We felt very safe here, and felt that my car was also safe. Nice old hotel in good shape, was very disappointed in the pool, as it was too cloudy to swim and appeared neglected. The courtyard is very pretty, but on closer inspection, we did not swim, and did not see anyone else swimming even though it was nearly 100 degrees. Staff was OK, not terribly friendly, never greeted us at all as we came and went. Concierge never spoke, just stood at his station. Continential breakfast was nicer than most. I would stay here again for sure, just hope that they start taking care of their pool.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pretty Tired Property I needed a place to stay in New Orleans for two nights, and after canvassing various websites, chose the St. Marie for its deeply discounted rate of $69 on Orbitz w/ a free balcony upgrade.This is a good hotel for $69. The thing is, the rates travel above $200 depending on the day of the week!The elevator was out of order, half the lobby floor was taped off for tile repair, both restaurants have been closed for over a year, the door to the balcony that I shared with two other rooms could be jimmied open by a two year old, and my tub took 5 minutes to drain. Orbitz lists this as a 4 star property, but that is a mistake.So how to read my review....I guess if you can grab a room for 59 or 69 dollars, go for it. If the rate is any higher, there are plenty other hotels you should choose instead.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not bad Though the check in time was, as usual, 3-4 pm, I arrived at the hotel little after noon to pre-register and get my luggage to their storage room. The unaccomodating man told me to come back by 3 pm, almost promising me that my room would be clean by then. Around 3:15, I asked if my room was ready and it wasn't. It'll be ready in 5 minutes. 5 minutes turned out to be 35 minutes! Several other guests were in the lobby waiting for their rooms to be cleaned as well. Hotel St. Marie definitely had a super shortage of cleaning staff! Finally get to my room and it's cute and quite big. Small TV though! Putting the iron/ironing board in the bathroom was a good logical touch. Bathroom had a heater light. Tremendous water pressure in the shower, which was great. Comfortable night's sleep, and super cheap rate of $80 TOTAL.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Can't wait for the next visit Our three night stay at the Hotel St. Marie was very pleasant. The hotel is just a short walk to Boubon Street with many places to shop and restaurants. The hotel offers valet parking which is perfect, since parking in the French Quarter is at a premium. Breakfast in the hotel bistro was good with large servings and a reasonable price. The bar is a nice place to relax and enjoy a drink and catch up on a football game. Even though the hotel is located on a busy street, our room was very quiet; our room did face the courtyard and overlooked the pool area. The rooms are clean and large. The hotel staff is very friendly and professional. The location is great, and we felt safe wandering the surrounding areas late at night before returning to the hotel, we encountered no problems and look forward to our next stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Absolutely Perfect! This hotel has it all... great location, great price, great staff, and nice clean rooms...nothing fancy but clean and great for the price. Also the staff goes over and above to make sure you have a good stay. When we arrived our room door was jammed and we couldn't get in, so we told the staff and they said they would fix it for us and in the meantime we could have drinks in the bar on them. The Door was fixed in 15 minutes but we were told we could continue drinking on them for as long as we liked. It was a great way to start our vacation. I just hope everyone was able to get out before Katrina hit.... we felt so lucky to have been able to see New Orleans before that catastrophe but its hard now to not think about all the people we met in that city that were so nice to us, including the staff of this great little hotel.</p></li>

The hotel is an amazing journey back in time,,, the architecture, decor and courtyard are Vieux Carre at it's finest......................ah, to love New Orleans! It is also centrally located, Armstrong Park off the historic Basin St. is just a short walk away. Also, right outside the front door, turn left and you're on Bourbon, (it doesn't get better than that) Royal St. and next stop Jackson Square.....................all at your immediate disposal! The hotel itself was a delight, more personality than anywhere I have ever stayed from London to Toronto the the W New Orleans, the Hotel St. Marie was definitely a Top Experience. The hotel, the rooms, the courtyard and the staff............................FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Bad experience all around We requested a room on the Toulouse side of the hotel over a month in advance, (and contacted them to remind them of this request twice before we arrived) and when we got there the guy at the check out desk put us no the other side and said, Well, it says all over the reservation not to move your room, but someone did anyway. No apologies, just too bad for me. The room was dirty, the pillows were completely flat, and the TV picture was so bad that it was almost unwatchable. The worst part is, when I told them I was unsatisfied with my stay, they acted like they didn't care. no apologies, no nothing, just too bad for me again. If all you care about is trying to be near Bourbon St., then the price isn't bad, but there are plenty of hotels near Bourbon that are probably comparable and since the service was about as bad as it gets, anywhere else has to be better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our new NOLA hotel I cannot say anything bad about this hotel. We had not been back to NOLA since Katrina and decided to book a last minute Memorial Day weekend trip. The summer rates had just kicked in so we got a great deal. We normally visit in March or November and usually pay double. The hotel is right in the middle of the Quarter. Great so that if you needed to pop by the room real quick it was no big deal. This is the 1st boutique type hotel we have stayed at in NOLA. We normally do the chain places. Never again! We got the King Superior room with exterior balcony. Somehow we got hooked up with one of the big balconies and LOVED it. It was a little noisy at night due to it being so close to Bourbon. There is a little store a couple doors down that was very convenient. Room was very clean and spacious. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Give St Marie a try .. you won't be disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just give me the French Quarter! The St Marie was alovely hotel, with big rooms. It is one half block from Bourbon St. on Toulouse st. A great location . We found the best laid back restaurant on the northwest corner of toulouse and Decauter. The food was great and very well priced. The two dollar and fifty cent salad was incredible, as was the sandwich my husband got. The waitress at the bar was a hoot. We went back three times. It does get really busy so avoid the lunch and dinner crowd. The best oysters we found was at Felix's on Bourbon street, just don't ask to watch  American Idol. It was a fun place and the prices were good. An all day bus and streetcar pass was $5.00. We got ours at the park on Toulouse and Decauter. It is a great way to get around on those busy streets.We went to the cemeteries, garden district. Magazine Street, as well as a Mall. They come all the time so you don't have to wait very long.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">So So Stayed at the Hotel St. Marie during Jazz Fest. The hotel is in a great location - about half a block from Bourbon St. The staff are friendly and helpful with things like directions, restaurant recommendations, and obtaining cabs. The downsides were few, but important enough to mention. We had a room with two double beds. It smelled musty and damp. The smell lingered the entire time we were there, but did diminish some after two days. The bathroom door was slatted, so if you like privacy in the bathroom, forget it. The courtyard with the pool is quaint but extremely small. For extra $$, you can get rooms with a balcony and couryard view. However, the balconies barely hold two people and the distance between one side of the courtyard and the other is probably only 30 or 40 feet. Also, as other reviewers have noted, the walls are thin and you can hear people in the rooms next to you and in the hall very clearly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good location, nice place Great location, a half-block from Bourbon Street. Was quiet while we were there, but might pick up more noise at a busier time of year.I was a little bit afraid of what the room condition might be since it's an old building, but it was quite clean and comfortable.Paid extra for a balcony room, but it wasn't what I expected. We were in a corner room, so our balcony also had windows to the hallway (so anyone passing down the hall could look onto our balcony). There weren't any chairs, so we would have had to drag the padded chairs from the room. This was a little bit disappointing. But then again, it was so nasty hot and muggy out there, even at 6:00 in the morning, that it wasn't comfortable anyway.Hotel staff was pleasant. No problems.Not a lot of privacy for the bathroom. There were louvered doors between the bedroom and dressing area, and then another louvered door between the dressing area and the bathroom.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">perfect spot We booked this stay in August wanting to experience a different culture...and boy did we. The hotel was very nice with cleanliness and welcoming crew all the way around. We stayed in room 520 which didn't have much of a view but we didn't really need one considering we were always on the go. We used the pool on a couple of occasions, usually just to rest and eat a muffuletta and have a cold beer. The mornings were nice downstairs with coffee, juice and either a danish or croisant and of course my morning paper. We were far enough from Bourbon street that we didn't here the noise but close enough to enjoy the excitement of all the fun things to experience. You can walk to everything if you enjoy walking and have good pair of sneakers. We always like to have a resteraunt in our hotel but was told that theirs was under construction, but it looked like it was just closed down. try this place you'll be happy..Mike and Mary Beth from Norwood,pa</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great service! The hotel is a bit older and the rooms were just average, but the location was perfect for guests looking to be in the heart of the French Quarter (it's just one block off Bourbon), but far enough from the noise and action that it didn't impact our sleeping.The best part of all was that the hotel staff was exceptional. They provided wonderful customer service, even providing one of my friends a guest room to pump (breast milk) after we had checked out for the day.We had the do not distub sign on the door, and they didn't enter the room but left fresh towels by the door each day. That was a nice touch. It was also nice that they provided towels by the pool without having to worry about taking your own towels. The pool and surrounding courtyard area was fairly small, but the hotel itself is small. So, think more quaint than big and noisy.I'd definitely recommend staying there again because it was an enjoyable trip, good accommodations and wonderful staff.</p></li>

<li>They provided wonderful customer service, even providing one of my friends a guest room to pump (breast milk) after we had checked out for the day.We had the do not distub sign on the door, and they didn't enter the room but left fresh towels by the door each day.</br>

Beds are comfortable and have nice linens.Overall, I've gave it a 4 out of five stars.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just...so,so.... After reading the glowing reviews about this hotel...we couldn't wait to get there. Yes, what a great location right in the middle of the Quarter, but hey, thats about it. Over three days we spoke with most of the personnel working in the hotel....they really don't seem to care if your there or not. The desk clerk at night even had a little attitude. As far as the room.....PLEASE don't let them stick you in room#519. It is a HOLE! We booked a Deluxe room with double beds....they looked really nice in the pictures.NOT!I'll make this short and simple....tiny,tiny room.....very dark, window like a port hole, mattress(I hope your back likes springs), bathroom more the size of a coat closet......very dated(hunter green and mauve) and really depressing. Our friends had a somewhat better room down the hall in # 512. Word to the wise.....get the Superior room if you can....because the Deluxe is a joke. I love New Orleans...have been many times....but never again at this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Hotel 4 of us, my 25 yr old brother, 84 yr old granny, my wife and I (in our early 30's) stayed here for 4 nights in December(4-8th). The hotel is in a perfect location, 1/2 block off of Bourbon St. Very close to the action and noise and fun but we could still sleep at night. There are numerous bars, shops and restaurants within walking distance (even for granny), and the French Market/Riverfront area is about 4 blocks away. There is plenty to do while you are here, if you can't find something then there is something wrong with you. Our room was very clean and a good size and everything worked properly. The staff was great (we had an incedent with my brother, too much booze and messy sheets at around midnight, and the staff was right there with new sheets 2 mins after we called. They took the bad ones with no problem or complaints.) On our next trip to NO we will hope to stay here again. No complaints at all. If you get the chance, go to The Cat's Meow (1 block down Bourbon) for some hilarious karaoke.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Let the Good Times Roll... at the St. Marie! This hotel was absolutely awesome to us! My wife and I visited New Orleans during the week of 7/10-7/15 and we had a blast. I've got to give props to our girl Jerry at the front desk, she was phenomenal! Our check-in would have been somewhat adventurous, had it not been for her prompt attention. We got there early on Saturday and though check-in wasn't until 3pm, Jerry allowed us to check into our room three hours before then. Thanks Jerry. The location is great. Just two blocks away from world famous Preservation Hall. You must go to this place if you want to listen to some real, unadulterated New Orleans jazz. You're only about 4 blocks away from Jackson Square. Can't beat it! The pool isn't what we expected (somewhat dirty), but heck, we were away from the hotel having fun for so long, we didn't need it. Our room was very clean, cozy and on the fifth floor. This hotel is great if you value location and customer service. We had a great time and we plan on staying there again and again!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved The Marie What a perfect location.. After working with the Red Cross during Katrina, my daughter spent her 21st birthday at the Prince Conti (a sister hotel) in the French Quarter and vowed when she got married, this was going to be the destination. In November, she got engaged and we went on line to make reservations. The Prince Conti could not accomodate us for her time frame, however, the Marie could and the rest was history.The staff was wonderful in making sure all family/friends were located on the same floor with balconies facing the quarter. Sitting out on the balconies listening to the music coming from the corner establishment was fabulous. The room sizes were perfect. My daughter, her 2 friends and myself shared a suite and it was awlsome. Whatever we needed, they were happy to accomodate us. We had alot of fun and they seemed to enjoy the family and friends who decided to get a tatoo in honor of the bride.We are planning to go back next year around the same time(week after Mardi Gras) and we will definetly stay there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First Stay at the St. Marie The clerks who run the front desk are not as friendly as they should be. I'd actually fire some of them...seriously, I would.I rated the front desk as 'marginal during our stay for 3 days and 4 nights.The room was fine. Not a 5 star room by any menas, but it was adequate.The man who was running the hotel bar was very nice and he made up for any of the short-comings of the other hotel staff.The location of the hotel is without any doubt, it's best feature, as you can walk to any place you desire without having to have a taxi.New Orleans is one of my most favorite places to visit and I visit it frequently, and I will stay at the Hotel St. Maire on my next return visit as well.I go to Orleans to EAT FOOD, relax and enjoy watching the weird people.......not to say in a 5 star hotel. A bed is a bed...but I want a bed that I feel safe in, when I am in New Orleans. I feel safe at the Hotel St. Marie.So the Hotel St. Marie fits my ticket perfect...and the prices are right, if you learn how to negotiate with them as well.Enjoy...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Worked for us. OK, here's the whole run down...Booked a few days ahead of time. Orbitz had the best rate of all the sites, which came to around 75 with taxes and fees. Think the room istelf was $64. Wednesday night stay only.Called ahead to ask for a room on a lower level floor and they were very accomodating. Checked back when our flight was delayed and they assured me it was no problem. Arrived, and checked in with no trouble, nice room on the 3rd floor. Sizable, with a bit of a musty smell, but hey, it is New Orleans, everything smells that way. Clean sheets and bathroom.No other problems so to speak of. Cleaning lady knocked on the door quite early considering the fact that we went to bed around 6 AM but we should have hung the DO NOT DISTURB sign I guess.Checked out after noon, left bags with the bellhpp and explored Bourbon Street a bit longer. No problems with the bags and they had a cab waiting as promised when we got back.Definitely worth the money. Will probably try and stay there next time I go back if the rooms are still reasonably priced.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location gives it **, otherwise a solid *. The first 4 nights we stayed at a horrible bb (Fairchild House), after which this place felt like heaven. First of all the location is awesome, 1 corner away from Bourbon Str. 2nd, they have an elevator which is cool. Then came the second thoughts. Do not stay on the 5th floor! The rooms do not have windows that you can open, except the few that have balconies looking at the pool. Once you turn on the a/c the dust will start your allergies right away. Remember NO was built on a swamp, so mold is everywhere. Do not eat at the restaurant, it is overpriced and the food sucks. For the money this place is ok, but as some other people mentioned it already, the staff have serious attitude problems, which you will notice in other places while in NO. (Good places to eat at: Mother's, Acme Oyster House, Gumbo Shop) The reason I gave it two stars only was that we got a room on the 5th floor in which we could not open the windows (that is just stupid.) If you don't care about the things mentioned above, this is a good choice becuase of the aweseme location in the heart of the FQ.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, average accomodations stayed at the St. Marie recently. It does have an excellent location near the heart of Vieaux Carre. We paid about 75.00 without tax. Had I paid much more than that, I would have felt cheated. Nothing terrible mind you, but after waiting an hour for my bags to brought to my room from storage, I called to remind them. Still had to wait 30 minutes. The knob on the light switch was missing, rendering it impossible to use. Was told they would take care of it-they didn't. They did switch rooms from a view of the A/C units via only one small window, to a larger room with three windows. One suggestion, and this goes for all hotels, will you please put up another towel bar or at least a hook or two so we can have a towel at the sink and not fighting over towel rack space?!! One final comment re service. On our day of departure the valet pulled my car up, got out and walked away while I had two bags at the curb. Personally, I can go for carrying my own bags and skip the tipping, but this guy didn't even try. All he had to do was lift two small bags into the trunk and my two bucks would have been his two bucks.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Faded lady The Hotel St. Marie is in a great location and the price we paid was very good. However, the hotel is more of a faded lady rather than a grand dame. The room we had was quite large, but the wallpaper was fading and peeling in several places and the carpet was coming up and frayed. The same could be said for the hallways. We were subjected to two of the rudest front desk staff that we have ever not had the pleasure of dealing with. When we arrived, we were told that check in begins at 4:00 which meant that we would be allowed into our room at any time within the next hour or two! However, you had to sign several times indicating that you were aware of checkout at 11:00 under threat of an extra night's charge. While we were trying to check in one person was trying to change rooms and another hotels. The front desk person told the hotel changer that the hotel she wanted to go to had critters. It was across the street! What does that say about professionalism? However, once we were checked in, and away from the two front desk staff, our stay was pleasant and we would probably stay there again as long as we had a room facing the courtyard.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not our Favorite We stayed in New Orleans both before and after a cruise in December, 2006, including 3 nights at the St. Marie. The hotel is located in the French Quarter, within easy walking distance of everything. While I hate to criticize anything in New Orleans, given the continuing tragic post-Katrina situation there, we felt that the St. Marie was really showing it's age. The beds were saggy, there were cracks in the bathroom sink (which didn't drain well), they use only 75 watt bulbs, so it's kind of hard to read, the electrical outlet by the coffee pot was coming out of the wall, the hot water was unreliable and the soundproofing was poor. On Christmas day, we realized that housekeeping had not cleaned our coffee pot or given us clean glasses. We asked if they would, and they agreed, but didn't follow through. When my husband went to the front desk to ask for some clean glasses, he was told that they don't change glasses every day, and they didn't give him new ones. The bar--with lots of clean glasses--was right across the lobby. Next time, we would definitely stay elsewhere. The staff was nice, but didn't make up for the poor maintenance at the St. Marie.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful Retreat! I brought 34 teachers to the French Quarter for our annual summer retreat. We had 19 rooms. We had a wonderful experience. The hotel is close enough to walk to all the historic museums and homes the French Quarter is famous for, and it is close enough to enjoy the nightlife the Quarter is also famous for and have a quick walk back to the hotel. The rooms were very nice and clean. The rooms which face the outside streets are a little noisey at night because of the 1 block proximity to Bourbon Street,so if you are a light sleeper, ask for a room that faces the courtyard. Personally ,I loved going out on my little balcony to see what was going on! The staff went out of there way to make sure that all my teachers were taken care of. We used their meeting room for our staff development and it met all of our needs. The continental breakfast was just enough to start our day and we really appreciated the fact that we did not have to leave the hotel to find breakfast before our meetings. The Group Sales office was very easy to work with and went out of there way to make sure our needs were met. Everyone of my teachers want to return to the Hotel St Marie for next year's retreat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is place is the best! This is the second time I have stayed at the Hotel St. Marie and I just love the place. Clean, friendly staff and you cannot beat the location- around the corner from Bourbon Street. My family and I stayed during the French Quarter Festival (which is awesome as well) and we booked way in advance. The hotel does a great job having you pay in advance and sending out reminders about your upcoming stay. We stayed in rooms 310 and 319. Both with double beds. Room 310 was slightly bigger for some reason- but both great accomodations!!! And though it may not have been warm enough quite yet to use the pool- it still looked wonderful and inviting and the courtayrd is so beautiful and a great place to meet in the morning before exploring the French Quarter. And I recommend eating at Hillary's right in the hotel- we had breakfast there twice- no wait and good food in an open-aired restaurant. Nice, relaxing and very friendly waitstaff. The hotel prices may be slighlty more than the other hotels in the Quarter- but I beleive you pay want you get and if safety, location, friendliness and clean is what your looking for then its worth every penny!!!! Way to go Hotel St. Marie!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Four and a half stars Just returned from a stay at the St. Marie last week and overall it was just fine. I had a balconey room that was very large, very clean, bathroom was fine and certainly large enough. Staff was amiable and helpful with suggestions and booking tours. Noise was never an issue and the bed was comfortable. The only minor thing was I couldn't adjust the flow on the shower head, but they fixed that and believe me it was no big deal. I would certainly stay here again and would recommend it highly, especially if you prefer larger rooms. Unfortunately I didn't try their restaraunt, Hillarys, but I did eat breakfast a few times in their Bistro and that was nice and very convenient since it opens at 7:00am. I enjoyed some wonderful meals at Peristyle, always a favorite. Dickie Brennans Steakhouse was wonderful too and the service was impeccable and if you're looking for very large shrimp at VERY reasonable prices try the casual Deanies Seafood on Iberville. I know some people will disagree with this, but I really enjoy the Jazz Brunch at the Court of Two Sisters. It also helped that the weather was absolutely gorgeous the whole time I was there which made the Court of Two Sisters more appealing to sit outside.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Christmastime at the St. Marie My boyfriend  I traveled to New Orleansf for a last minute holiday getaway. We chose this hotel based on positive feedback from trip advisor reviews. The hotel is in a great location in the French Quarter and a short walk to everything. The room was a double on the 5th (top) floor with a balcony overlooking the lovely courtyard. The door to the room did little to prevent noise intrusion so you could hear people coming  going  talking loudly in the middle of the night (our room was right off the elevator). The room was clean, if not a bit worn around the edges. When we inquired about the (very) low water pressure in the shower we were told this was an area wide service problem. The valet service was great and the hotel staff was very friendly. New Orleans is an extremely damp  humid place which leaves a bit of a musty smell in the air, especially with carpets, but you get used to it. The price was right, but not a luxurious hotel by any means. However, we went to New Orleans to take in the sights, not hang out in the hotel room. I think the popularity/price/location of this hotel makes it a good value but also explains why it's a bit worn. I would recommend this hotel to travelers who aren't too picky about the details.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">No problems here We visited the St. Marie last week on a short break from the UK as part of a group of about 40. We arrived around 6pm when we were welcomed by the owner who poured champagne as he told us about the history of the hotel, pointed out the main points of interest and told us how to get there. No one had any complaints about their rooms. Ours was a third floor courtyard view (much quieter than the street facing rooms). It was nicely furnished and the period style of the furniture is in keeping with the style of the hotel and the French Quarter generally. I have read a number of reports on this thread about the rudeness of the staff. Whilst they didn't exactly laugh and joke with us, they certainly weren't rude. Just efficient. If you want real rudeness, don't go to the French Quarter, go and visit Paris. The location of the hotel is just about perfect. It is a 15 second walk from the hotel to Boubon Street, but just far enough to be away from the incessant noise. From the hotel front door, Jackson Square is less than 5 minutes walk and the Mississippi river is about the same. You won't find a hotel in a better location than this. Even if you experence a few problems, at the end of the day, your hotel is your base from which to see the city, you will find it hard to do better than the St. Marie.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It Has to be the St. Marie! After coming from Cape Girardeau, MO to New Orleans every year, we found the St. Marie four years ago and now consider it our New Orleans home. Unlike so many other hotels, the staff - from the manager to the front desk to the bellman, the housekeepers, everyone...is very friendly. We have stayed in the historic part of the hotel, which is a real treat if a room is available (those go fast). The regular rooms are quite nice, large, lots of bells and whistles (though we wish the rooms had mini-fridges), including free internet access. The courtyard is small but attractive and restful. Hillery's is one of the best places in New Orleans to dine, and the Bistro turns out great breakfasts at reasonable prices. The streetside bar is a fun place to start a conversation with locals or other visitors, and Gregory the bartender is absolutely wonderful. Here's just one example of how accommodating the staff is...as we were checking out, two women were checking in. They asked if the hotel had a business center with computers. The manager said no, it didn't, but if they needed access to a computer over the weekend, he would arrange for them to use his. When you walk into the St. Marie, you don't get the feeling that staff is being nice because they have to...you truly feel they are happy to see you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A jewel in the Quarter! My friend was getting married a downtown church. So my husband and I decided to make it a get a way weekend in our own area. We live in River Ridge a community a few miles from New Orleans. We choose the St. Marie because of its perfect location. But we love it because of its wonderful staff. They made us feel so special! They greeted us each time we came and went thru the lobby (frequently, because we could go back to the hotel so easily). But even the housekeeping staff was friendly and pleasant (this has not been my experience in other hotels).Now about specifics: our room was clean and well appointed (perhaps a bit dated in colors and design) but very nice and comfortable. The hotel has valet parking, which is important to us because of the parking difficulties in the French Quarter. The pool and beautiful patio was charming. We met our friends in the patio before going out the night before the wedding. Everyone said that we had found a jewel in the Quarter. Many of the rooms have balconies, ours did not but it was still lovely and the view from our windows was great. I have mentioned the staff, but I must say again how friendly and pleasant everyone was all of the time.We will stay there again, should we do a weekend in the Quarter and we will reccomend it to our friends who come to New Orleans.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Awesome Location This city is so unique to other american cities that you feel like you are in another country. Life is very laid back in this environment. For new comers staying in the Quarter is an absolute must! The Hotel St. Marie was superbly clean. The staff was very friendly, and its location was literally a jump, hop, and skip away from Bourbon Street. The hotel also had a nice restaurant, bar, and pool and courtyard. Parking wasn't free but when we found free parking in the quarter on Decauter, the concierge let us park free in their garage! The hotel seemed very simple in comparison to the beauty of the quarter. However, it is a great price at $70.00 - $90.00 a night. I have no complaints about this hotel what so ever. I can really only vouch for this one. However, Next time I might stay in the Price Conti or Place D'armes because their location is futher away from Bourbon ( and Tourists) I haven't seen the inside of these hotels but if they are as nice as The Saint Marie I know I would be satisfied - They looked to be more New Orleans style etnic in the brochures. And they are run by the same mgmt. which means clean and friendly! I feel that staying in Jackson Square is more appealing than off of Bourbon Street - but who am I? Actually I lived in New Orleans from 96-98. Off of Decauter - you have Cafe du Monde - cool bars, restaurants (way over priced) and great shopping.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You will Love the St Marie I have just returned from New Orleans and stayed again at the Hotel St. Marie. This is maybe my fifth or sixth time - I have lost count. The hotel has two sister hotels - The Prince Conti and the Place d'Armes both also located in the French Quarter. Everything about the hotel is great - location, staff, ambience and the BIstro Moise and Hillary's Restaurants are top notch. Located just steps from Bourbon Street, the hotel is in the heart of the French Quarter action, but somehow manages to be a quiet boutique hotel. AND.... in walking distance to just about everything. Best of all I got the hotel at $68.00 per night!!! I spent about what I pay for one night in NYC for 5 nights in New Orleans. Do yourself a favor and stay at this little gem - you will go back. Within walking distance of the hotel is EAT on Dauphine Street (the old QSR - Quarter Scene Restaurant) had a fantastic breakfast there and they have terrific fried green tomatoes. Speaking of breakfast - the Ramada just down the street from the St. Marie and a fantastic breakfast buffet for $11.50. Other great places to eat - Mother's (best po'boys) on Polydras Street and Mona Lisa Restaurant for the best pizza ever.Also Irene's Cuisine is a place where you will never get a bad meal. Best of all - I already have my reservation for the St. Marie for the weekend before Halloween - can't wait to get back!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall nice...but noisy.. I was in New Orleans because the University I graduated from was playing Tulane in football. Unfortunately/Fortunately, it was also Voodoo Festival Weekend.Because it was Voodoo Festival weekend, all hotels had jacked their prices up. But that is slightly understandable. The staff was really great. I checked in with ease. It is a cute, adorable boutique hotel. My room was really nice and I had a balcony overlooking Toulouse street which I thought was cool at first. I really liked that I was less than a block from Bourbon which is where most of the action was since it was a crazy weekend. It helped that it was only a block from where all of Memphis fans were meeting up at the club Razoos.The only problem that I had with the hotel is the noise. I could hear all the noise out in the hall including at 3am. Then because it was a crazy weekend there was more traffic than probably normal for Toulouse. The doors to the balcony are probably not well sealed because I heard all of the noise outside on the street that didn't seem to end until about 5am. I know the hotel can't control the noise but they need to have a better way to buffer out some of the noise. It sounded like the doors were open which they weren't.Overall, a good experience. It was clean and comfortable. If I stay there again and get a balcony, I will request the courtyard side. It overlooked the pool area and was really nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">great place! Just returned from a week at the St. Marie. Great hotel for the price and location. John and Zach at the desk were great! Troy at the hotel bar is lots of fun, ask him to make you a scurricane, his version of the hurricane, great and not too sweet! The staff was always helpful with suggestions and getting a cab. There were a couple of down points. We arrived early 11:30am and knew our room would not be ready, no big deal, they said they would call us if it was ready before 4pm, the check in time. Came back to the hotel at 4pm and the room still was not ready. They got us a drink at the bar but we didn't get into our room until 5pm. If you need a wake up call check to make sure your phone works. We only used this service twice and it didn't work either time, we set the room alarm clock as a back up. Lastly, they really push the package city tours if you ask for advice. Our group doesn't like the whole see the city (french quarter, St Louis #1, garden disrict) in 2 hours approach and we were asking for their opinion on one particular tour, we were told (by someone other than John or Zach) we were wasting our money on these seperate tours. Their recommended tour 2 1/2 hrs, $45 plus, all 3 things. Our plan, Park ranger tour, french quarter, 2 hrs, free; St Louis #1 plus Armstrong park, 2 hrs, $15, Garden district, 2 1/2 hrs, $15 with a portion of the proceeds for the last 2 going to Save Our Cemetaries.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice Hotel Great Location I just returned from a week long stay at the Hotel St. Marie and had a great time. I found the hotel to be clean and very affordable. The courtyard was always kept in good shape and is nicely landscaped and lovely at night with the right accent lights. An earlier review and pictures on the website show a brick wall at the end of the courtyard with no vegetation, but it now has trees and plants against the wall which only enhances the New Orleans Courtyard experience. The pool was also nice to have in the LA heat with plenty of chairs and tables with umbrellas to sit back and read. The rooms were cleaned early in the day which made coming back to the hotel after a few hours walking around the French Quarter in the hot sun for a nap a pleasant thing. The staff was very friendly and always ready with a hearty good morning or have a nice evening. The Hotel St. Marie is just steps to Bourbon St but miles away when it comes to the noise. I was very happy to see the progress in and around the French Quarter and Canal St. There were more stores and restaurants open and for longer hours than last year. I did not venture past the FQ but I understand less progress is being made in those areas. The Gumbo Shop, Brennans, Court of Two Sisters, and Mulates provided culinary pleasures, at those places you cannot go wrong. The meals were fantastic. I found my 2007 New Orleans vacation experience a safe and wonderful time. No fights, no arguments, no theft, just people doing what people come to New Orelans to do, eat , drink, and be happy!</p></li>

<li>An earlier review and pictures on the website show a brick wall at the end of the courtyard with no vegetation, but it now has trees and plants against the wall which only enhances the New Orleans Courtyard experience.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful! This propery is perfectly located within the French Quarter, in a an area that is walking distance to everything, a block from Bourbon street and yet is quiet during the late hours. (Live bands from down the street can be heard from most places just outside the property in the twilight hours, however.) Check in was easy and the receptionist was friendly and talked to us like we were old friends. Parking is free, in a secured garage and is valet and the building is immaculately clean and comfortable. The bed was soft and our room had lots of character--certainly not a standard, generic cookie cut out a hyatt-is-a-sheraton-is-a-marriott room like any of the big chain hotels. This is a little, distinctly individual boutique hotel that has all the charm and uniqueness of the local culture, and the low price we paid for it is almost criminal! I wish we could have gotten a superior room with a balcony, but as we only stayed one night there for a stopover on our way elsewhere and were on a budget, we got a standard room. Our room had no windows, but just four steps outside the door to our room was a lush, semi-private courtyard that more than made up for the lack of windows. My boyfriend and I hope to return for a much longer stay sometime soon, and will happily splurge the extra $10 a night for a room with a balcony. I was only here one night but I fell in love with this place!! Not a 5 star luxury, but more cozy and interesting than any well known brand hotel and way nicer than what one could normally expect to get for the price paid. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was ok. Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and thought it was quite charming and was really impressed with the hotel's staff, not so much the front desk but the housekeppers and maintenance staff. Especially the young man working the parking lot. Your car is very safe in their private parking lot. The breakfast was fine, freshly sqeezed OJ and delicious danish. Save your appetite for the delicious food whereever you go! Unfortunately, we did encounter a few problems that really bothered me.carpet in room was filthy, so filthy your feet would turn dark by walking on it. The room smelled moldy or musty and in fact my allergies were really bad when I was staying there. We didn't sleep much that first night because our room was near bourbon street and felt like the band was down the hall (luckily they sounded really good)!! And people returning from partying were loud and didn't help either. We called the front desk and they changed our room and while it was still noisy, it was much better. Our bathroom smelled funky, and while the linens looked clean, the room just didn't feel as clean as it should be but I think because it was old. the elevator wasn't working one morning but we were on the 2nd floor so could just walk down for our breakfast. So, if you want to party hardy in NO, and won;t be back in the room till early in the AM, this is the place for you. If not, ask to stay in room away from the noise. It's close to Bourbon street and really a cute place to stay, and very reasonably priced.Would I stay there again? I don;t think so, the french quarter is full of charming hotels like this and I would be willing to pay a little more to stay in a cleaner place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Honeymoon stay I would stay here again in a heartbeat. This is an old building with many layers of paint, odd hallways and a slow elevator. That's about the worst thing that can be said, and that's not too bad. It's very charming. From a location/price/value point of view, it has to be the best deal in N.O. It's greatest strength is its staff who are friendly and professional and customer oriented. They were all great. One got the impression they were not just there for the job but that it was a good place to work and that spilled over into the smiling, eager service. They took great pride in making sure you were satisfied. The service in the attached bar and restaraunts was also top knotch. The food was pretty good too. The t.v. channel selection was basic but who cares. There is only one ice machine and that's down by the lobby so a third floor thirst is quite a trek. You're literally steps away from Bourbon Street but there is a real quiet feel to the hotel itself. We had a balcony that we never used. Never hit the pool either. When management found out we had just been married, they sent up a bottle of bubbly, gratis. The room was spotless and roomy. The bed was comfortable and the linens were clean. Everything else in the quarter had gotten so expensive. It seems a Po Boy averages around $10. What's up with that??? They need to rename it.It's getting harder to find good jazz and blues. It seems that the quarter has gone MTV and instead of opening the windows and letting the tasty tunes flow out, now they got boom boxes blaring rap and rock into the street. Maybe I'm getting old but it seemed better ten years ago. On the other hand, the aquarium, Imax and zoo package deal was a great bargain.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Charming and Delightful My husband and I recently stayed at the Hotel St Marie while in New Orleans. It is located just off Bourbon Street, which of course is an experience all on its own. We were treated with great courtesey and a willingness to help at every encounter with the staff. The front desk staff was especially helpful with recommendations for dinner or things to experience. The men at the Bell Desk were also ever helpful in stowing our luggage when we checked in, since it was well before our sceduled check in time, they held our luggage so we could go walking around or have lunch until our room was ready for us. Our room was wonderful, the heat lamp in the bathroom was a unique touch, helped to warm the floor on those chilly mornings. We were in a balconied room facing the street, though I did look at the rooms that had balconies facing hte courtyard and those views were just beautiful.It was wonderful to be able to sit on the balcony and read a book, or enjoy a glass of wine, which I did plenty of.The housekeeping staff was unobtrusive and asked us daily if we wanted them to clean up to room, we opted not to have them enter the room and to just provide us with anything we needed, such as additional towels.we did not use the pool facilities, though it did look inviting, we visited in winter and it was a bit chilly. The courtyard was beautiful as well.The hotel itself is in a older building so not everything is brand new, the elevator was a bit slow, but not too bad. The decor is charming, it fits the time period of the older, wealty style of French Quarter decor. I loved it and was fascinated at the little things that give the hotel its quirks. It is central in the French Quarter and we found it was easy to find being of Bourbon street and within walking distance of most everything we wanted to do.Overall, we had a wonderful experience and would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the French Quarter.</p></li>

<li>We were in a balconied room facing the street, though I did look at the rooms that had balconies facing hte courtyard and those views were just beautiful.It was wonderful to be able to sit on the balcony and read a book, or enjoy a glass of wine, which I did plenty of.The housekeeping staff was unobtrusive and asked us daily if we wanted them to clean up to room, we opted not to have them enter the room and to just provide us with anything we needed, such as additional towels.we did not use the pool facilities, though it did look inviting, we visited in winter and it was a bit chilly.</br>

<li>The courtyard was beautiful as well.The hotel itself is in a older building so not everything is brand new, the elevator was a bit slow, but not too bad.</br>

<li>The decor is charming, it fits the time period of the older, wealty style of French Quarter decor.</br>

<li>It is central in the French Quarter and we found it was easy to find being of Bourbon street and within walking distance of most everything we wanted to do.Overall, we had a wonderful experience and would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay in the French Quarter.</br>
