The hotel is very safe and clean.The staff are very helpful and friendly.The telephone did not work well and the cable TV was marginal but then this is New York and there are better things to do than watch TV! I stayed 5 nights and will stay there next time I am in New York. A good budget hotel.</p></li>

The tv had horrible reception and it was so noisy we had to buy ear plugs. The only good thing was the location because there was a bus stop right outside. The staff was friendly and helpful.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is near Times Square and all the touristy action. It's also on a major intersection and is a low-rise building, so expect lots of noise when you're sleeping. The window was broken which made for a cold breezy evening in November. (Heat not yet on). The bathroom had lots of mildew and pubic hair. It was the same pubic hairs from one day to the next. Do they not clean?

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is really good value. It's fairly basic, with shared bathrooms but this is common in NY anyway. There was a sink in our room and towels, shampoo and shower gel provided. It was very clean and the staff were good. We didn't use the kitchen but i think they were pretty basic - it's as cheap to eat out as do a supermarket shop here anyway! For a central location and good price, so long as you're not wanting anything too big or fancy, this is worth a look - we'd definitely stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my first trip to New York. The Americana is in a great location, only a few blocks away from the Em[ire State and from Time Square. The area feels perfectly safe and is probably best described as a business district. There are a number of coffee shops and small delis near the hotel. The room was clean and comfortable. The only drawback was the shared bathroom, but there were a number of them on each floor and they were very clean. Id be happy to recommend this place to my friends.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in 3 different hotels in NYC in August and as far as I am concerned this was the best value for a single traveller. The only negative that I can think of was the traffic noise, but hey it is NYC and I was there to sightsee, so I just got out and about. Even though I shared a bathroom, I never had to wait to use it and it was always clean. Internet in the lobby was convenient and the service was friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again. Flat screen TV was a great bonus.</p></li>

This is a perfect hotel for those who doesn't want to spend a fortune on sleeping in a town that never sleeps. It's clean and tidy and safe. And it's perfect situated in midtown Manhattan close to where the action is. Irrespective of you're a bum or just a smart tourist this hotel offers every facility you'll need and so you can spend the money on things that really matters instead.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect position, just steps away from Bryant Park and five minutes more to Times Square. The room in which we were staying was very minimal, with two beds and enough space to move around and TV. Of course it was very noisy (because this is NYC, and I challenge you find a quiet place in Manhattan) and not perfectly clean but definitely comfortable. Shared bathroom were indeed super clean and I never had to wait (maybe it's only luck but it's also true that there are many bathrooms to use).

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Security at the front door is questionable (everyone that rings the front door gets in without any further scrutiny). The rooms are small, which is OK for a relatively cheap hotel in NYC, but no charm - felt like a dorm room. The rooms and bathrooms were fairly clean but still smelled funny (our room smelled like a locker room - a disturbing mix of cleaning solution and smelly feet). The bedspread felt greasy and is probably rarely cleaned. At $250 per night, I expected more - even in NYC. The location is great; near Times Square and Bryant Park.</p></li>

AmericanaInn certainly hit the spot for being a simple place to stay. I had no problems checking in or finding the place, everything is really clean including the bathrooms. Most of the times they were empty so I didn't have to wait (only in the morning around 9ish does it get occupied). Otherwise, it's pretty basic and there's cable tv.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We only stayed one night. It was one of the better hotel values in the area. The bathroom and shower is shared, but we never had to wait to use it - so no problems there. The rooms are clean and a little small. But the price is right. I would stay there again. If you speak Spanish they are very accommodating as well - fluent in both English and Spanish. This hotel is closeby to lots of things in Manhattan. No frills here, but that's what I expected. I'd stay here again. They have some discounts for local attractions - we did the NBC tour, kinda fun, and got a couple bucks off.</p></li>

We booked the cheapest room possible as we weren't planning on spending any time in the hotel beside sleeping so our room didn't have its own bathroom which I wasn't keen on; but it worked out fine, the shared bathrooms are clean and there was no problem with availability. The rooms are small but clean, more than adequate for our needs. If you're a light sleeper I recommend taking ear plugs as the road outside can get a little noisy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I live in NYC but booked a night at this hotel for my husband and I to stay Saturday night closer to the nightlife. The room was small, but not a problem. The bathrooms are shared, but in your room you have your own sink and a medicine cabinet with a mirror. So to get ready I didn't have to use the bathrooms. There are multiple bathrooms on each floor and an elevator. It was cozy but not luxury. We just needed a place to crash so it was perfect. I wouldn't recommend bringing a bunch of luggage. I would totally recommend this to a friend who wanted to stay downtown at a really low price!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Place in within easy walking distance to all the major attractions. Extremely clean both the room and the shared bathrooms. Toliets had a habit of blocking (happened twice in my 5 day stay) but were very promptly fixed once housekeeping was informed. Though the person doing the blocking never seemed to think of this themselves!!! Bit noisey due to its central location but nothing that kept me up or anything. Room very basic - bed, washbasin, draws, closet. Very small but was barely in it so not really an issue. Was meant to have cable tv but I could not get a picture of anything watchable but again thats not what your there for.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Americana Inn from 20th-26th march, and for two females travelling alone this was a brilliant place and location. The rooms were cosy and warm, a little on the small side but we only slept and showered there! The security was great you had to buzz the door to enter so the staff knew who was entering the building. The bathrooms are shared but they were always clean and i never had to wait to use it, if it was busy there a 3 per floor. The staff were very friendly and helpful. In general if you want a clean, safe, close to everything hotel then this is your place. I will definately stay here again. I loved New York!!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is an ideal location when staying in New York. One block from 5th Ave, one block from Times Square, 5-10 mins walk to Central Park, Empire State Building and 30 seconds from Macy's! Staff were friendly, hotel was clean and the a/c system was excellent considering the extreme heat in NYC! Bathrooms are shared but they are clean, and there is a sink and wash area in the rooms. We had 2 single beds which suited us but I'd check when booking to see if they have double rooms. Our room cost £100 per night which was the cheapest we could find in such an amazing location without resorting to a hostel! Definitely recommend this place and would stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our first trip to to New York. Came across this hotel here and booked then held our breath. Well we are home now and we have only good things to say about the place. Ok the room was small, the bathroom (3 of them) was outside in the hallway but it was very clean and safe. The location was simply great, two blocks from Macys, empire state, subway and a walkable distance to the Broadway shows. There is a fantastic breakfast / diner just across the road Guy and Gillards. Really helpful at the front desk, organised shuttle bus to JFK. So for the money it is grat value, you only really sleep in the place and use it to keep the shopping safe while you go back for more !</p></li>

Where else would you find a clean comfortable place to stay at those prices. You were near all the main attractions what more do you want. Get real and get a life!! We stayed at the begining of dec 05 and found the place excellent and clean. OK it wasnt the Savoy, but I wasnt paying top hotel prices either. I guess that those who wrote the negative reports about the place are natural moaning people who wouldn't be happy were they stayed.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My sister-in-law and I stayed here for 3 nights while we were in town visiting family. The location is great - it's within walking distance to Times Square & the Empire State Building. We walked back to the hotel at night & felt completely safe with the neighborhood. The room is a bit tiny, but I think that's exptected for NYC. The beds were a little uncomfortable, but honestly we were so tired from walking around all day that we still slept just fine. :) The staff was very friendly. We had no issues with the shared bathrooms at all - we never had to wait for one to be open & they were very clean. Overall, it was a great value for the location & I would stay there again!</p></li>

The dumpster trucks don't run on the weekends, but you can hear them during the week -am. You can crash here very easily. There is a safe at the front desk so that you can store your personals. There is a market across the street, Empire State Bldg two blocks away, Broadway a slight walk, Rockerfeller Plaza and so many other places to visit. The room is small but not tiny. It is bigger than a nice comfortable small room at the Park79. The Americana Inn is clean, close and affordable and the picture does not do it justice as it is in a good area for me. There is Internet here also - Free.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I spent 2 weeks at the Americana Inn in April/May 2006.We actually chose it because of its central location: near the main attractions, 5th avenue, Empire State Building and Time Square. We had a great stay there: even though the room was very small, it was very clean, and comfortable. We had a double room with a sink, a wardrobe, a chest and a large window. Obviously it's NYC and it's sometimes a bit noisy but it's ok. We had to share the bathrooms and they were very clean (even late at night) and always available. The staff was extremely helpful and nice to us! I do recommend it to anybody willing to spend a good time visiting NYC without spending all their budget in accomodation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this on the strength of the reviews here on tripadvisor, while the hotel was not terrible our room was tiny (which I expected,) our bedding was very worn and full of holes, there were loose wires in the room and because the room faced out on to 6th Ave it was very noisy; my friend could barely sleep at all. The staff at reception often dealt with our enquires while on the phone talking to friends or playing computer games. The toilets were often blocked and the ceiling fell in our nearest bathroom. I've stayed in numerous hostels in Eastern Europe and only one was worse than this place. If your looking for a place in NYC I would either pay a little more for a better hotel, or book in to a hostel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was very reluctant to stay at a "Hotel" with a share bathroom, but was within a budget. Once I got to the hotel I noticed how clean it was, the convenience of the location of the bathrooms, with in 10 steps of each room and the attentions of the staff made my experience great. Even though the bathroom floor was, only on a spot between the toilet and the sink, soaked. The bathroom was clean, not smelly at all. The hotel even has a luggage room where you can leave your luggage after you check out for the day, internet access at a fare price, the downside is the lack of WiFi connection. But the location is the most important point of this hotel, just three street blocks from time square. I strongly recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Myself and my partner stayed here for 3 nights on 20th Feb. I was worried as I'd booked on the net and some people have had problems with reservations but it couldn't have been simpler. The staff were polite and friendly and checking in and out went without a hitch. I thought the room was on the small side but after talking to friends who paid a great deal more for their hotel, we had the larger room. It was clean and sharing a bathroom was not a problem, it was always spotless. It was noisey, but it is NYC, the city that never sleeps. The first night was also very hot due to the heating. We mentioned it at reception and the other two nights were a lot cooler. On the whole great value for money and great location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You see so many bad stories about bargain hotels in NYC, dirty, bed bugs, unfriendly employees....and to my surprise this is NOT one of them. Rooms are bargain sized, with only the basics, but a comfortable CLEAN bed, and wall mounted flat screen. Sink in room, and shared bath were fairly new, and above average for cleanliness. All employees that I came across were friendly and helpfull. On all three days I passed housekeeping in the hall and was greeted with a smile !!! Location is handy to all NY has to offer by train, and walking distance to Times Square. For a inexpensive get away, where you will be out and about enjoying all that is NYC....this is the place ! Enjoy a great meal or another show with the savings.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">New York... What a buzz... I travelled to New York alone and felt absolutely safe at all times. The hotel is excellent for single female travellers as there is no access to the hotel unless the receptionist lets you in. The single rooms are tiny (and I mean tiny but I was never in my room anyway so who cares) but do have a sink and mirror. There is a shared bathroom for about 4 rooms which are clean and I never had an dramas getting into them when I wanted. The staff were friendly and you are literally 5 minutes walk to Times Square & Empire State Building and a nice stroll to Central Park. I would recommend a helicopter flight over New York and the Hop on Hop off bus is excellent value at just $50 for a 2 day unlimited pass.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Although not very close to a subway stop, the general location of the Americana Inn can't be beat, just around the corner from the major retailers on 5th Avenue. It's a very basic hotel, more like a rooming house since the bathrooms are mostly shared. However, the single room I was in had a large window, new sink, TV, closet and phone (very rare at this price in NYC). The bed was a bit on the soft side but I didn't experience any of the noise problems reported by other travelers. The key card was a bit finicky at first but I finally got it to open. Bathrooms were large and clean but remember to bring your shower slippers! Also, there are lots of tourist materials in the lobby so pick some up while you're checking in or heading out.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having searched for reasonably priced accommodation, my husband and I eventually settled on The Americana Inn in New York City. The hotel is around 7 blocks from Penn Station, not easy to navigate with big bags so be prepared for weaving through pedestrians and traffic if coming from the station. The room we were given was really small, only just enough room for our bags and us! There was a basin in the room which was helpful as we had opted for the shared bathroom. The room was clean, nothing fancy. The only complaint I have is the aircon unit in our room - it was so noisy and woke me up often. However, apart from that, not too bad. The location is pretty central - a couple of blocks to Times Square and Broadway. Don't expect luxury and you'll be fine!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here with my girlfriend in early April 2009, we choose this hotel purely on price and location, the price was good for New York and the Location was great, right by Times Square, Empire State Building, and the New York Public Library. What let this place down was the room itself. The rooms are very small and all bathrooms are shared but are clean, the room was not much larger than the double bed inside, with just enough room to store your case. We felt it cramped for two people trying to get ready each morning. The room was very warm and had no climate controls of any sort. Noise from the street was average for a city that never sleeps. I would only stay here if you are on a budget or just need a hotel for a place to lay your head for the night.</p></li>

We went with little expectations, but were surprised at how nice it was. Having stayed in New York before, I cannot see any difference between this hotel and a 4* one; the reception staff were very friendly and always around to help, location was fantastic, one block from Fifth Avenue, a few blocks from Macy's and Times Square, the rooms were indeed small and basic, but we were hardly there to even notice! There was enough room for us 2 girls and all our shopping!! The only thing was that there aren't en-suite rooms, you need to use one of the bathrooms in the corridor, but there are plenty of them, and they are clean and homely.

Now tell me how it is possible to pay $65 per night in midtown Manhattan and stay in a spotlessly clean, very secure, and courteously staffed hotel anywhere else. It isn't. I am quite literally still stunned by the Americana. The price, as NYC rates go, is unheard of. And for this ridiculous sum I had a comfortable, small, immaculate room, nice and cool in the worst of the July heat this year. I've paid several hundred per night at more fashionable places, and for the difference I got a lot of cable channels I never watched. My only fear is that the Americana changes hands. Trust me, guys, this is good little hotel. At the prices they charge, this is an ASTOUNDING little hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 4 nights, we arrived hours before check in time and were given the key to our room straight away. The rooms are small but are exacly as pictured, so knew this when booking. The room was cleaned daily, fresh sheets, towels and soap when needed for the in room basin. The shared batthrooms were always clean and we never waited to use them. The hotel is in a good location, a few miniutes walk to time square and other attractions. The only one slight issue, as this hotel is on the corner of 6th Avenue, we did sleep with the aid of ear plugs. This was not a major issue but wouldnt have been able to sleep though the night without them. This hotel also offered a baggage hold and on each floor there is a kitchen with fridge and microwave. Overall this was a great priced, good loacted hotel. Would book there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is in a fantastic location. We were close enough to walk nearly everywhere in the tourist area of Manhattan (Times Square, Grand Central, Rockefeller Center, etc.), and there are subway entrances just a few blocks away. As two females who'd never been to New York before, safety was a priority. We never felt unsafe, even at night. We were also unsure about how the shared bathrooms would work, but we never waited for a bathroom once. The bathrooms were kept extremely clean. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful, especially when we needed to leave our bags at the hotel after check-out but before our flight. The rooms were small, but that was expected & not uncommon for New York. The beds were very firm and bedding needed updating, but after walking around the city all day, we were generally too tired to notice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 3 nights on a stopover visit. The hotel is a perfect choice if going to New York, Location is key in New York! The hotel is on 38th Street - so a couple of blocks from Macys, empire state building and a couple of blocks in the other direction to Times Square and broadway. The hotel was very clean and modern, rooms are small as are all in New York. Although we shared a bathroom we had a sink in the room which makes a big difference, and easier to share a bathroom. The only possible thing I would note as a con is that it is a low rise building so there is no getting way from the street noise, we were on the first floor beside 39th street and found it very noisy, but the air-con drowns out the sound, so didnt bother us. Overall I would defo stay here again when in New York, spend the money you save in Macys!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just got back from a weekend in NYC and I stayed at the Americana Inn. I am a student and I had to travel with a budget. Within 10 minutes of being at this hotel, I knew I would stay here everytime I came back to NY. It was very clean, always smelling good, the staff was very polite. You cannot beat this location and price!! you are just 2 blocks from the 42nd street-bryant park subway and very close to shopping and times square. The hotel also held our luggage for us all day on sunday after we had checked out because our bus did not leave til later that day and we were able to get an extra day in NYC without lugging our baggage around. I never had to wait for the shared bathrooms, they were so clean also. I give this a 10 out of 10 and definitely advise anyone to stay there. For the price we paid, we were amazed by this hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Despite the previuos comments - AC WORK! Beds are clean and comfy.The location is perfect. For those who is going to shop, Lord and Taylor is right round the corner, Macy - a few streets away. Lots of diners and deli shops around. One night there were no single rooms and i was given a big one with 3 beds for the price of a single.It got a good view on the 6 Ave. If you prefer a quiter room, please note that your window view will be a brick wall. single rooms are really small ((( on the trird floor there was no hair dryer, unfortunately. But i think if you contact a concierge, the problem will be solved. One concierges is Dan - he is really a great professional. Advise: if you reserve the room in advance, please bring a print out with you. The system may lose your reservation but you will be given a room with the rates on ur print out.</p></li>

The rooms were as described basic but very clean. The staff were polite and helpful.The room was serviced each day as well as fresh towels being provided. There is a TV in the rooms and a large closet. An electric oil filled heater was provided which was good as it was cold when i stayed. The hotel is central for the underground system which was easy to use and cheap. (buy a metro card)Times square is 4 blocks north and Macys srore is 4 blocks south. There is also a diner close by on broadway called Harry's which was great. Small safe deposit boxes are available (Free when i was there) the neighbourhood is good and there is an irish bar close by on 38th Street. There are also 2 Deli's close by.6th avenue is noisy so take some ear plugs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having just read the two bad reviews on this site i can say that for a buget trip with no frills it is PERFECT! Me and my friend went to new york for the first time in Nov. We wanted somewhere clean safe and centrally located for visiting all the sights. The Americana was perfect for this. After all we were only in our rooms at night and out exploring all day. The room we stayed in was clean and tidy and although we had to share bathrooms you never had to wait as there are a few on each floor, one next door in fact. The location was ideal, you step outside and you are in the centre of all the Sights with the empire state only round the corner. If you want to go to new york and want somewhere clean, safe and certrally located and dont want to pay the earth for a room you will only sleep in i would recommend it. I would definately stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When I booked the Americana Inn back in october for 13 nights over xmas and new years and read the reviews on this site I was a little worried, but I had nothing to worry about... the hotel is in a great location - very secure as you have to be buzzed in to get into the hotel.. there was a life... the front desk people were great. I was worried about the size of the room but this is my 6th visit to NY and the rooms were as big as other places.. we had a triple and our room was right next to the bathroom. The rooms were cleaned every day and towels replaced, and or the price over xmas and new years there isn't enough great things I can say. There is also a 24 hour deli/convenience store across the rd which was open on xmas day and new years day... it is a 4 block walk to either times square and a subway station. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had extended a business trip by one night and was previously staying at The Hyatt, so it was with trepidation that I approached the Americana Inn. I buzzed the buzzer, and went up the stairs to check in. the guy at reception was very friendly and helpful. The place was like some of the better hostels you see in Europe; the room was sparse but clean. With a decent bed, air conditioning, a TV and sink. When I entered the room, it had just been cleaned so it smelled of disinfectant ... this though didn't go away the whole night (but i would rather have this than cigarette smoke or stale air!) Every floor had around 4 restrooms with showers, and these were spotless. It was also incredibly quiet, no late night door banging. The location was great, round the corner from Macys, the Empire State building and Time Square. I will definitely stay there again</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My stay at Americana Inn dated back to Oct 2003 (the dropdown menu of the year of stay provided only options of up to 2005). First off, the location was great and the recep was friendly. The room i was given was very small but cosy. There was a sink in my single room and the shared bathroom was just right next door. It's pretty clean and well-kept but there were some guests who tended to leave their towels on the bathroom floor after they're done using them. Pity my room did not come with any view except that of the other parts of the building since mine wasn't a street-facing room. There were large trash bins situated along the common corridor where everyone could dispose of their food and junk. This is really convenient for everyone but i definitely did not fancy the occasional visits from the teenie-tinnie nymphs (baby roaches) which came running into my room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose this hotel by opening the yellow pages & finding the cheapest-sounding hotel (I didnt have internet at the time of booking). Paying $80 a night, I wasnt expecting much but I was really happy. Although the room was small, and the lack of carpet made me feel like I was in jail, it was pretty clean, and the hotel was quiet. I had a TV, sink & closet in the room, and the bathroom was roomy, with a shower and toilet. The bathroom was a little unclean however, but I think I used it just before the cleaning ladies came, because the next time I went in it was spotless. The front desk staff were very nice, and there was a soda machine and an internet-connected computer for free use in the lobby. The location is perfect for travellers, 2 minute walk to Bryant Park, 5 mins walk to Times Square/Empire State Building/Penn Station/Grand Central, 2 mins from Subway, right on 5th Avenue.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Americana Inn in nov 2008. As a 22 year old girl travelling alone, i was so pleased to find you had to buzz to get in the front door and the room could be double locked inside.The staff were sooo friendly and very helpful. Though the weather was very cold out, it was very toasty and warm in my room! My room was very clean and bed was made every day. It wasn't facing on to the road so it was very quiet at night (except i was right by reception so could hear people coming in and out). The shared bathrooms were always spotless and i never had to wait to use one. My only niggle was slight draft in my room coming through the gap where the air con unit was set in the window, but thats it!!! (i just slept at the other end of the bed) It is a great location for a first timer to new york and really great quality and safe place to stay on a budget and i would stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at Americana Inn on 2 previous occasions both times was not disappointed. First time a friend booked it on-line, and because my vision of New York was of opulence and luxury was slightly put out because it is quite basic. Booked Days Hotel on Broadway in December 2006 and was absolutely mortified to get there and be surrounded by cockroaches which are my worst nightmare, however because I'd been there in February 2001 had the good sense to thankfully get booked into Americana Inn after hot footing it from Days Hotel. It couldn't be better, as I said basic but spotless and bug free, staff are very helpful both reception and cleaning staff. If you want a hotel which is perfectly situated 2 minutes from 5th Avenue apart from all the other benefits you'll do well to book this small hotel (now I'm wondering if I've done the right thing telling you about this little gem) Anyway booked it again December 2007 and it was great.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great place to stay without going completely broke in NYC---stayed here recently for the third time and absolutely love this "little tiny hotel" It is worth the money, rooms are clean, bathrooms are in the hall but very clean (5 bathrooms to every floor in a 5-story building), never had to wait in line for bathroom. Was noisy from outside streets---but hey, NYC is the city that never sleeps anyway. Could ask for an inside room that is somewhat helpful. Soap/shampoo/towels included everyday by cleaning staff. Like the convenient kitchenetts with fridge and microwave. Staff is very friendly and helpful; got my needed wakeup call at 4:00 am; and luggage held in office after checkout. Was appreciative of honest staff: friend lost white bathrobe---by accidental pickup upon room cleanup---reported to staff and was located by housekeeping and returned! Hotel highly recommended, look at this hotel as my "timeshare" away from home.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed there a weekend 22-25 April - 3rd floor. Room: Room small but sufficient; there was a small sink in the room, closet and set of drawers for clothes. The toilet and shower are common but were clean. TV also in the room. Hotel situated within walking distance of Times Square so good location for shows and restaurants; a little far from a subway especially if have a lot of luggage. We got a taxi to Penn Station which costs about 5 dollars; it is from Penn St that you get the connection to the main airports (JFK & Newark). Towels were changed daily. The bed was comfortable. Staff at the reception were very friendly and efficient. Street noisy - but if you have been walking the pavement all day as we were you just crash out anyway. Earplugs are a good idea - ask for a room at the back - I think there are some. The lift always stops at the 2nd floor on the way up and down - probably for security reasons. Overall a good value hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was just as I expected after reading the reviews listed on trip advisor. It's basic & minimal but does the job for a clean and decent place to crash after a long day exploring the city. The reception staff were all nice and helpful. I stayed in a single room which was very small but this was expected! However I had no problem fitting in a large suitcase + you have the cupboard space with hangers & rail. The flatscreen TV was also great. The rooms were a little too hot but better than being too cold. My room backed onto a building site which was extremely loud at 7am every morning which was a bit of a pain. Also the hotel is just that little bit too creaky/old so when the couple in a surrounding room is having a little fun it's very very loud for you....not so enjoyable! Overall a good place to stay if you are on a budget & don't mind some basic accommodation. It doesn't really have a hotel feel to it, more like a hostel but I'd recommend it & return again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed for 8 nights--4 in a two twin bed room with my sister and 4 nights in a double bed room solo. Both rooms were small but adequate with large closet, small sink, and close to shared bathrooms. One room was on the street side, but with AC running, street noise wasn't a problem. As other reviewers have said, the staff is friendly and helpful, the location is excellent, and rates were wonderful at $87 + tax single and $100 + tax double. Rooms and bathrooms were very clean and shared bathroom was always available. Towels, linens, and pillows were fine. Supply of liquid soap and shampoo were available in room. Working TV and AC. Little refrigerator (great for storing breakfast milk, OJ, yogurt) and microwave at end of hall helped keep food expenses down. Nice Indian restaurant around the block on 39th. Three grocery/deli/food shops nearby. Beautiful Bryant Park 2 short blocks away. Easy walk to Times Square and subways. I hope to stay here again on my next trip to NYC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked our room through Air Canada. We arrived before the check in time but since our room was ready they allowed us to check in early. When we arrived the elevator was broken but was fixed by the next morning . This hotel has small VERY CLEAN rooms with shared bathrooms, bathrooms were very clean. The bathroom next to our room had a broken shower. We stayed Friday - Wednesday - The shower was broken the entire time. Many bathrooms on our floor so we used another bathroom to shower. Clean rooms, beds very comfortable. Clean, inexpensive, great location, walking distance Empire State Building, Time Square, Byant Park, Madison Square Garden. Great deli just across the street - able to get good inexpensive food and take it back to our room. TV not many channels. The rooms are small, great place to stay if you don't intend to spend much time in your room. This hotel was great for what we wanted. A clean, comfortable place to stay.

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was the second time I'd stayed in the Americana. Five star luxury it certainly isn't but it's clean, comfortable with friendly staff. The rooms are basic and aren't en suite but you know that from when you book. The linen and towels are changed daily. Since we stayed 3 years ago the rooms had been painted and there was a brand new flat screen TV on the wall of our room, so I assume there is in every room. Admittedly the rooms are noisy from traffic noise but that's the price you pay for being so central in Manhattan (junction of 6th Avenue and 38th Street). You're 5-10 minutes walk from Macy's, the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden, Grand Central Station, Times Square, Rockefeller Centre, Fifth Avenue and numerous subway stations. I suspect any other hotel that central would be much more expensive. It's handy to be so central when you're in NY. You're on your feet so much it's helpful to be able to pop back to your room to drop off shopping, have an hour's lie down etc. I would certainly return to the Americana.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from staying seven nights in this hotel and all in all, it was great value for money. Don't expect the Ritz, but if you want a clean, centrally located hotel on a budget, then this is the place for you. The sheets and towels were changed daily. The room was small but clean and simple. Only a few channels were available on the television but if you are going to spend time in New York, why watch the tv anyway? As stated, there are communal bathrooms but they were clean and we never had a problem with rushes or unavailability. If you simply want to use this place as a simple base for exploring around, then its perfect. If you want luxuries, pay a lot more and stay in another up the street. But seeing as Times Square, Empire State, Port Authority and all other attractions are a stone throw away, it was perfect for us. This hotel has the world's slowest elevator!! So take a book when going up a couple floors!! No, honestly, it was great value and I would highly recommend this hotel to future no frills and budget travellers to NYC.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “We loved the Americana Inn Hotel in New York”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got home from NYC, and we were really lucky for finding the Americana Inn Hotel for our stay. It's a low budget hotel located few blocks from Times Square and several other atractions. We stayed at a small double bed room, with shared bathroom and we were very concerned about that. But when we got there, we found out we didn't need to.The hotel is very clean, the house keepers work all day long. There is a restroom for each 2 rooms, so the restroom was always available (just like 3 bathrooms for each floor). The restroom was always very clean, and the shower is great. The bed room was very clean too, and there's a sink and an lcd tv on it. The bed was very confortable and sheets were new and very clean too. The hotel seems to care a lot about security, we felt really safe in there. I just don't recommend you to stay there during the summer time, because the bed room doesn't have airconditioning, but there's heating for the winter time. Employees were very kind and nice to us, helping in anything we needed. So I recommend you for sure to stay there, and to have a great time in NYC as we had.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great location, clean but worn around the edges, not the best night's sleep”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros: Can't beat the location. We flew into Islip and took the train to Penn Station. You can easily walk to the hotel from there. From the hotel we walked to times square, a show off-broadway - the location can't be beat. Clean bathrooms (shared), Frindly/helpful front desk staff. Cons: It was rainy and muggy and we had no air conditioner in our room to cool off and remove the dampness from the air. We cracked the window to cool off but that only made it more damp. Mattress was sagging/hard, pillows very thin, bedding worn/holes in blanket (but it appeared clean). Linoleum floor in room, no scatter rugs etc. No bath mat provided and the bathrooms have a drain in the middle of the floor and they are constantly wet. (Bring flipflops for bathroom trips/showering). Noisy hallways (lots of echo when people talk, tote luggage, open/shut doors). No internet. It looked as if they were getting ready to put window units in some of the rooms- but not ours. Call ahead to make sure you've got AC if the weather is going to be warm. In a nutshell, great for tourists who just need a clean/safe place to crash for the night.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed one night in november 2011 It gave us the opportunity to stay one more night in New York at a lower price (we were logging at the DoubleTree the night before). It was clean and the staff was nice and helpful. We had the minimum we needed to stay one more night in New York. The rooms are little (no queen bed available, the rooms are too small) but clean. There was a personnal sink in the room but shared bathroom, wich were cleaned when we used them. It was very noisy, more if you are close to the elevator wich makes a "beep" every time somebody arrives (we asked to change room when we realised this, and the staff was very accomodating). The location is perfect to go to Time Square and around. The elevaror is very small, the entree also... it was quite an experience to stay a night there, but defenitly worth it for its strenghs, wich are, for me, the great location and the price. We were disapointed with the parking just in front of the Hotel that charged us more than they told us when we arrived and had no choice to pay... since they got our car and were not open to discuss/negociate. Be careful with the parking deal!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Americana Inn, What a surprise”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Americana Inn Hotel on Tuesday and Stayed until Thrusday morning. I went to New York to go see a concert of my favorite artist, Darren Hayes. I looked on Orbitz to find somewhere with a decent price. Luckily, I found the Americana Inn and I did some research on it to see if it was a safe place. I read so many great reviews and booked my stay. I got there and it was nice to know you had to get buzzed in, so one could get in without them knowing. They had cameras in the elevator and it would always stop at the 2nd floor where the lobby was. So, once again I felt safe staying there. The room was small but it really didn't matter cos all I needed was a bed. I enjoyed the windows would open cos the first day there was a warm one and I needed some air. There is a shared bathroom. Its a normal bathroom, not like a dorm style bathroom. I think there were 3 bathroom on our floor, one on each corner. Whenever I needed to use it, it was always open. Also, the place had a shared computer in the lobby. You just had to feed it dollar for a ten minutes use. Its a great place to stay if you're not in need of a lot of ammenities or room.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One thing you have got to give the Americana is that you will be hard pressed to find a better located hotel for the price in New York. As far as location goes, you are in the middle of Manhattan. IF you are looking for a clean, simple hotel, this is for you. The shared bathrooms are interesting concepts, each bathroom services about 4-5 rooms, that said I never had to wait to use it in the 5 nights we were here. The hotel is noisy, well the traffic noise is anyway. The rooms that face the road, some have air conditioning but most don’t, being an old building, it gets very hot at night so if you want to sleep, pack ear plugs and get the good ones. Other than that for location it is brilliant for all the New York sights you may want to see on a budget. There is a great deli diagonally across the road and the little Chinese place next door to the deli has the biggest serves of food you are likely to see. The General Tsao’s chicken is worth a visit on its own. Word from the wise, the meal is enough, not starters required, my wife seems to think the meals are big enough to share but you can make your own assessment on that, I am not a great sharer</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just back from a four night say in The Americana Inn. It was my first time in New York and I spent much time researching affordable acccomodation. I booked through the hotels own website and got it for 150dollars a night taxes included,excellent for Manhattan prices. The hotel is in a great location,clean and near all the main sights for a first time traveller. We arrived at Penn station and walked to the hotel in about 10 minutes. The rooms are very small and after 2 days it started to feel claustraphobic. We had a lot of shopping and there is only a small closet with two hangers to store everything. The shared bathrooms are no problem as they are always available and clean. I am not sure if I would stay here again due to how basic the rooms are but if you are looking to do New York on a budget for a few nights this place is ideal. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. Personnally if I was to go again I would prefer to pay a few dollars more for a bigger room or perhaps stay away from midtown and try accomodation downtown or uptown as it is cheaper and everywhere is easily accessible by subway. Loved New York-Top of the Rock awesome!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">just came back yesterday from the americana and as the previous reviews have said the hotel is in a great spot. Having said that there are too many downsides to the hotel for me personally. Firstly really really noisy, impossible to sleep without earplugs, not just the traffic but the walls of the rooms of the hotel are so thin you can hear everyone coming and going, The beds are so noisy i even heard people in the other rooms turning over in bed! The shared bathrooms even though they were fairly clean most of the time were a real pain, the bathrooms were busy and we ended up walking around the corridor trying to find one that wasnt being used. The bathrooms were cold and damp and the bathroom plugs didnt work it was a shower or nothing. The rooms are very basic and not much room inside you end up with stuff all over the floor not much space to store anything, The tv was useless about 3 channels that actually worked no movie channels or anything overall I can understand why people are getting carried away with the location it is handy but really even though it is cheaper than most hotels its worth spending the money and going somewhere that has better amenities and is more comfortable</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This being my first visit to NYC, I was taken somewhat aback at all the hotels that required guests to share bathrooms. After looking the prices of the ones that would provide me with my own restroom, I reluctantly decided to go with the "community" bathroom option. So, I expected the inconvienance of using a shower that a perfect stranger had just used. And, to my delight, the bathrooms were kept clean. The rooms were crap. The beds were tiny and hard. The TV didn't work, the linoleum floor was cold and dirty, the walls were cracked, and the sink nasty looking. The location wasn't bad in terms of proximity to Times Square and the Empire State Building, but with the extensive subway system in Manhattan, pretty much everything is a few minutes away regardless of your hotel's location. Plus, being located on the bustling 6th Ave. meant that we were constantly awakened during the night by horns, yells, and sirens. On our final morning, there was literally someone jackhammering directly outside our window at 7:30 am!!! If I were to do this again, I would definitely pay a bit extra to stay in a nicer place; I would even be willing to share restrooms again as long as the room I slept in was comfortable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I took my boyfriend on an affordable trip to NYC for his birthday. I found the state of our room at the Americana Inn to be filthy and DISGUSTING. Upon entering our room, we were horrified to see that they did not run any type of air conditioning or ventilation, and felt our room was musty and uncomfortable. Affordable or not, we were not the slightest pleased with the cleanliness of the hotel. After our short visit, we left feeling disappointed. On our way home that same day, my boyfriend realized he had contracted some sort of rash- all over his body. Thankfully- I did not have any signs of the rash- but I had decided to wear more attire to bed than he had. Unfortunately for him, the rash was all over his body. We were disgusted and mortified at this discovery. We thought out our trip and realized with no air conditioning and a damp and warm room, mixed with poor housecleaning, he had contracted RING WORM. He is currently at the doctors, and I have already made two phone calls to the manager without any type of reassurance or compensation for our troubles. I am completely disgusted and angry at this hotel and their non hospitality. This is lawsuit material and I would discourage anyone from staying at the Americana Inn in NYC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was very surprised about how good the location of this hotel is. On the corner 38th St and 6th Ave, Times Sq starts at 40th St so it's only2 blocks away about 6-7 minutes walking. I had room 1st floor towards the back of the hotel so there wasn't a view apart from concrete but later found this to be better as was quieter and had no problem getting to sleep. The room was reasonably clean just a few hairs lying on the floor but nothing else. Could have done with a mirror in the room, There was a TV, air con (bit noisy though) a sink and double bed, to be honest there was no room for anything else but if your staying here for the NY sights then your not going to bed spening a lot of time in the hotel. Shared bathroom was reasonably clean again just the hairs ng around the bath was the only offputting thing, large bathroom with good powerful shower, mirror , sink and toilet. Had no problem getting one at any time as there is 4 per floor and 10 rooms per floor. The reception was helpful and kind, there is also internet access for $1 for 10 minutes and a 'Coca-cola' machine. Summary - good basic but clean hotel (more like inn or motel) and I probably wouldn't stay here if I had lots of money but I dont,so it turned out to be an excellent choice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Confirmed the room in August and told $95 a night, next time we called to confirm it went up to 105 and $125 a night (we stayed 2 nights), so when we get there on the 10th, we are told $267.77, when we check out on the 12th, we paid $290.00. The price kept going up regardless of being told $95 a night back in August even with a CONFIRIMATION which we booked back on August 29th!. So we were charged $290.00 vs. the $206.15 originally quoted in August! Then, when we get there, there were NO ice machines. Hotel was clean and smelled fresh, Ill give them that, rooms were small, but hey, you go there to tour not to stay in the room, so that was fine. Biggest complaint? the price kept going up and no ice machines, plus elevator was VERY SMALL. If there are two of you and two bags, you wont fit and need to go one at a time, its very small. No alarm clock in room or coffee maker as indicated, public bathrooms were clean and we didnt have to wait long so that part was okay. Very convenient to all attractions but if I had my choice Id stay at the New Yorker again for almost the same price. We booked Americana to save but in the end they will sucker you in once you are there and the price sky-rockets anyhow, get the better hotel in that case, avoid this dive. Would not recommend.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ideal place for a night, but not in winter. We were not able to close two of the three windows, so when you're in New York the sounds of taxi never stops, so no soundproofing and we did not find the heat. The beds are comfortable, low cost ($ 105 / night), 2 beds, 5 minutes walk from Times Square. Very little space in the room, but minimum stock; bed, sink, television, telephone (wake-up call available). I recommend it if you want to stay a night or two at low cost. No lunch. We were able to get our room at 9:00 in the morning, early check-in. Would stay there again because of the hotel, everything is very accessible. _______________________ Endroit idéal pour une nuit, mais pas en hiver. Nous n'étions pas en mesure de fermer 2 des 3 fenêtres, donc, quand vous êtes à New York, les sons de taxi ne s'arrête jamais, donc pas d'insonorisations et nous n'avons pas trouver le chauffage. Les lits sont confortables, faible coût (105 $ / nuit), 2 lits, 5 minutes à pied de Times Square. Très peu de place dans la chambre, mais stock minimale ; lit, évier, télévision, téléphone (wake-up call disponible). Je vous le conseilles lorsque vous voulez séjourner une ou 2 nuits, à faible coûts. Pas de déjeuner. Nous avons pu avoir notre chambre dès 9h00 le matin, en early check-in. J'y retournerai volontier car de l'hôtel, tout est très accessible.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There are better hotels than this but not for the price. People have had a few minor complaints about this hotel but what do you expect for the price in New York. The Americana is in a fantastic location and I found the staff to be extremely helpful. Yes it is noisey and even though I am a light sleeper, I only needed the ear plugs twice as I was absolutely shattered after all the walking so slept like a log. We didn't have to book out until noon and we had a late flight back to the UK. We were able to store our luggage in a locked cupboard while we did our last bits of shopping. Great place and location if you just want to get your head down and spend the money you have saved on the luxuries such as the helicoptor flight which is well worth it. The bathrooms were always clean and yes sometimes left slightly messey by the person who had used it before but the cleaners can't be expected to clean the bathrooms after everytime they are used. We went across the road to the Blimpies Deli for breakfast at $2.70 plus tip. Many people have stated New York is expensive. It is if you go to the wrong places. I brought back $1400 and still had a great time squeezing in two helicopter flight tickets, a NY Yankees jacket, Empire State Building twice and many other attractions. Last thing, don't miss the Carneigie Deli 7th Ave, 54th St. - Awesome I will definitely use the Americana again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Americana recently during our first sighseeing trip to New York. We were after somewhere which was central yet didn't cost a fortune, and the Americana ticked both those boxes. The rooms are small, but are immaculately clean with comfy beds and washstands in every room. Although I was worried about sharing the bathroom facilities with other guests, I needn't have bothered, as I never had to wait for a shower or to use the loo, and once again they were lovely and clean. The only thing I could perhaps say is that our room was far too warm. When we asked the hotel staff if there was any way that they could turn down the heat they refused. However all the staff that we dealt with during our stay were polite and helpful. They even booked our shuttle bus back to the airport saving us the job. The airline lost my boyfriend's bag on our arrival in New York, but the staff at the Americana assisted us by giving us a ring when his luggage was eventually delivered. The location really cannot be beaten for the price, only 4 blocks from Times Square and a five minute walk to Fifth Avenue. Oh and the Bryant Deli over the road is fantastic! Not only can you have a hot sandwich or panini, but there is also a super salad bar which also serves hot pasta and noodles and it's open 24 hours a day. All in all the Americana has everything you need for a no frills trip to New York.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Honestly I wasnt expecting much from this hotel, I had read the reviews and it seemed to be good compared to the other hotels in our price range. Simple, clean, friendly staff etc is all you need for a good holiday and your not exactly going to be spending day and night in your room! Myself and a friend booked in for 7 nights in the Americanna Inn, on arrival it just looks like and apartment block. Inside its clean, simple and altogether all you need for a trip to the city. We where a bit dubious about the shared bathrooms, but with 10 rooms on each floor and 5 bathrooms we never had a problem with queing or them being dirty. Cleaners came into our rooms everyday and made our beds and did the floor etc, all very friendly. The staff on the desk are all lovely too and very helpful! The rooms themselves are big enough for 2, not huge but enough space with a sink, TV and wardrobe area, we had a/c in our room but I dont think they all do, ask if its warm as the rooms do get hot. If Im being picky, the only thing I would say was becuase our room was on the main road it was noisy during the night even though the windows are double glazed, but then you are in New York so its to be expected. The location is ideal, 2 blocks to the left is the Empire State Building and right next to 5th ave and Times Square. Also the deli just across the road (Bryant Market) is good if you want some cheap hot food. WOULD DEFINATLY STAY HERE AGAIN!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a single female traveller visiting NY, I reserved my room in the Americana Inn back in January 2005 for a stay in November 2005 for the marathon. I was horrifed after getting off an 8 hour flight from the UK to be told there had been a mix up and there was no room for me - not for that that night or the 4 others that I had reserved. It did not matter that I had confirmation details and a booking reference (in a printed email) that I had received directly from the hotel. The excuse I was given was that they use lots of companies to book rooms at the Inn - although I booked mine directly through the Americana Inn website. A guest who was checking out in reception told me I was one of fifteen to be turned away that day. I had extreme difficulty finding a room to stay in as it was the marathon weekend yet finally a kind concierge at the Crowne Plaza found me a room at a nearby hotel which was accommodating and felt safe a for single female traveller.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was pretty worried with it being a 1* hotel, but was encouraged by good reviews on Trip Advisor site. And I am really pleased that we chose Americana Inn. It is so hard to find a hotel in New York for less than £100 a night! I found that the only way is to go for rooms that are not ensuite, like those at Americana Inn. This can literally half the price - and considering that the bathroom was actually just next door to our room, and it was big, clean and always free then it is really worth it! The room had everything else that you'd expect in a swankier place - sink, mirror, TV, towels, drawers, cupboard, air-con, etc. So although the place looks pretty grotty on arrival, with a sparse lobby on second floor and lino rather than carpets, it has everything you need. And who's hanging around their hotel anyway when they're in New York!? I even think our room was a better size than more expensive places... oh, and there was a kitchen on our floor with fridge, microwave, etc. And the location was fab - just a couple of blocks from the Empire State Building, so in the middle of midtown Manhattan. A nice area and great to get around to everywhere else... I would definitely come back to Americana Inn - perfect for the bit-more-than-just-budget traveller. Oh, and by the way - shopping tip: Bloomingdales, Macy's etc. have 'visitors discounts' where you can get 11% off if you are foreign. Make sure you go to the visitors centre to pick up your card.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hi My boyfriend and I have just returned after three nights stay at the Americana. Having never been to New York before we decided that we would choose a very central location and didn't mind not having a bathroom in our room as it was only a short stay. On arriving at the americana our first impressions were that it was very clean but also you could tell it was budget. There is no fancy entrance hallway you walk in and take the lift up to the lobby on the first floor. (Only one lift so you might have to wait). The reception staff were friendly but not much conversation. After checking in we went to our room on the third floor 301. The bathroom was two doors down from our room so very convenient. Take flip flops for bathroom visits as the bathrooms are very clean the floor is tiled so if someone has taken a shower before you go in you might get wet feet. Our room was key card so felt secure and we were given two key cards. The room itself was tiny (we expected this) Double bed, chest of drawers and sink. Small wardrobe. Hardly any room for our two cases. The room was very clean but really noisey. Getting to sleep at night was hard with all the beeping cars. The garbage truck came every morning about 5am and felt like it was in the room with you. The room was a good temp but during the early hours it did get cold due to the lack of double glazing. I would recommend for a single night stay. Location is excellent and you can walk to all the main sights times square, rockefeller, macys & empire state building. Mac Dees is about 1 block away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 4 nights over Thanksgiving week. Keep in mind this is a budget hotel, but if that's what you're looking for, I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel!! It's everything that everyone has said: clean (I walked around the room in my socks and the bottoms were still white - you can't say that at many other more costly hotels!!), tiny but there was a pretty nice closet and dresser, the sink in the room was very handy, the beds were relatively comfortable, flat screen tv was nice, the men at the desk were always very courteous, we had a corner room that faced both 38th Street and 6th Ave - it was really, really loud but my daughter and I were easily able to sleep through it, there were teeny kitchen areas on each floor that I personally wouldn't use other than to make popcorn, the bathrooms were almost always clean except 1 time when I appeared that some inconsiderate other guest got really messy - not the hotels fault and it was cleaned very shortly after. I really can't say enough about the LOCATION!!! We were easily able to walk from Grand Central Station (about a 15 minute walk), it's 4 blocks from Macy's, 2 blocks to either the red subway line or orange subway line, approx. 4 blocks to Times Square. Myself and my 14-year-old daughter walked everywhere. I didn't like walking 38th street too much (we only walked on that street once when we arrived), but 6th Avenue was great. Also, across the street is a little deli that's open 24 hours. HOW CONVENIENT!! For the cost, I would definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again when we come back!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros: So perfect for what we were looking for! My friend and I spent a 3 day weekend and merely used the hotel to sleep and shower. Even though I had read all of the reviews I could find - and they all stated how clean this place was, I was still actually surprised. It was sooooo clean. And comfortable - with the help of our own air conditioner in the window. Even though the place was completely booked all weekend, I hardly ever saw anyone and it was quiet. The staff was always very nice and helpful. As was most of the people in New York... again, I was surprised. I can't wait to go back. There were a few street fairs and farmers market in random areas - some around Madison Ave. It was a nice little surprise for some great and healthy snacking and shopping. The location is perfect. You can't beat it. Everything & anything is there or easily accessible. Cons: If your room faces 6th Ave., it will be really loud. I specifically asked for a room facing 38th St. and it was fine. Ear plugs do help - as jack-hammering always seems to be happening in New York. One of the days, the water shut off 3 times for about a minute each time during my shower. A little weird and annoying, but it happened on just the one morning. The one liquor store in the area is probably more than 5 blocks away.. the Park Ave. Liquor Shop (42nd & Madison) . There is a huge selection and they were so nice and helpful; gave us samples, suggestions -- I was sad to hear they weren't open on Saturdays and Sundays from June to Sept. So if you're there during the summer, stock up on your booze during the week...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My girlfriend and I stayed in Americana Inn for 3 nights in July. We had read the reviews on Tripadvisor, so we were aware of the street noise, and the shared rest rooms in the hall before we arrived. We did not have too high expectations, but Americana Inn was a pleasant surprise - much better than hoped for. The room was spotlessly clean (newly painted, I think?), the bed was great, daily maid-service and fresh towels, a TV set (which we did not use), air-conditioning worked perfectly - all that we wanted. I found the staff to be very helpful - the safety box was free to use and they gave good advice as to directions etc. The location could not have been more central and the neighborhood seemed safe enough. Street noise, yes, especially on the 2nd floor where we stayed, but it was just cars going by continuously - it was more of a background noise and it does not disturb your sleep, but bring earplugs, just in case! Yes, you do have to share the (nice and clean) restrooms and showers with others, but we never experienced any waiting. We would have preferred our own restroom and shower, naturally, but that would have cost quite a lot extra (see e.g. the prices on the hotel Belvedere which we also considered) - and it really was not that big a deal to share. In other words, we found the hotel to be a good bargain - what we saved on the hotel price easily paid for all our meals, entrance fees and transportation during our stay in New York. We booked the room through the official website for Americana Inn New York, found via Google. We recommend it highly to anyone travelling on a budget!</p></li>

<li>We would have preferred our own restroom and shower, naturally, but that would have cost quite a lot extra (see e.g.</br></br></li>

<li>In other words, we found the hotel to be a <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">good</span> bargain - what we saved on the <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">hotel price</span> easily paid for all our meals, entrance fees and transportation during our stay in New York.</li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I must say I was a little concerned about a Hotel for this price in Mid Town Manhatten, it seems to good to be true. But Trust me when I say everything is on your doorstep. The Hotel staff are not rude like some people have stated, they have limited English, but try and help where possible. The rooms are small, but they are clean and tidy, and the shared Bathroom which was a concern for both me and my girlfriend was nothing to worry about, we never had to wait to use one, and when we had to it seemed not to have been used that day! We stayed at the Americana for 6 nights in November 2004, there was just the two of us, and we were only in the Hotel to clean up and sleep! So for this purpose it was a really good deal. Look around on the Net as you can get rooms for different rates at various sites, we booked through --------------------------------- and we had a double room for $65.00 a night! With the UK exchange rate with the Dollar so good at the time (and still is) what a bargin!!! The Location as I said is Great, Times Square, Macy's, The Empire State Building, and all the other Mid Town attractions are all steps away, 5 mins in any direction and your in the hussel and bussel of New York! If you want a good tip there is a fruit seller on West 38th Street (Strait outside the Hotels door) They put together Fresh Fruit Boquets, and they sell Fruit Salads that are divine for really cheap, check it out! I hope people take up the option of The Americana it was a fantastic place, a real New York feel, in the middle of one of the greatest places on Earth - Do it, you will not be disapointed!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A friend and I returned to the Americana Inn because it is so close to Times Square and it is one of the better priced places. Yes, bathrooms are shared, but there is one bathroom to every three rooms - it's either next door or just a step across the hall. We never once encountered the one next door occupied or needing to be cleaned, but there were more within 20 steps down the hall. Yes, the room has linoleum tile in the bedroom, but the room is clean. The blinds are a bit thrashed and didn't work in our room, so there was more light in there at night and early morning than we'd have liked. You have no control over the room temperature. You will need ear plugs to block out the street noise which continues all through the night. Yes, the room is small, but there is a sink and mirror in the room. There is a closet (but no hangers in ours), the pillow was a little too dense, and the bed is just ok. There was a collapsible luggage stand in the closet, a small bedstand with a phone, and a slim-line TV on the wall (we never even considered turning it on). We were there simply for a place to sleep that was conveniently close to the theater district. Did I mention that the place is clean? The idea of shared bathrooms made me nervous initially, but they were kept clean. The place looks and smells clean, and the staff is very friendly. There is no wi-fi in the rooms, but there is a computer with internet access in the lobby that is available for a fee. I managed to get wi-fi access in the lobby for my laptop. This place is no more than a 10-minute walk from Times Square. If you're on a budget, look into this place!</p></li>
