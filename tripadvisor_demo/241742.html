<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">With so many average hotels in Venice, this one is absolutely beautiful and cool. I know they have different rooms (some really nice and some of them small) but in general the atmosphere, the staff and the location are perfect!!The only average thing is breakfast.More of a 2 stars hotel...I totally recommend it!!</p></li>

The staff was very helpful, recommending a restaurant that turned out to be our favorite dinner spot. The hotel appeared to be newly redone, an interesting combination of the old and the new.

The so-called mezzanine rooms are incredibly noisy and a good night's rest is impossible. We were moved to another room on our third night, but this room, too, was noisy.While the hotel had other positive features, our stay was badly marred by this situation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has it all, great service, superb buffet breakfast (croissants are excellent), fantastic design and it couldnâ€™t be much better in terms of location. Itâ€™s next to Galleria dellâ€™ Accademia and only a 10 minute walk to Piazza San Marco. The rooms are beautifully decorated and the hotel is very chic. A real effort has been made in this regard which is very refreshing. When I next visit Venice, I will most definitely stay at Ca Pisani again.</p></li>

Wonderful small hotel easy to get to but out of the madness of St. Mark's. Academdia and Guggenheim very close by as are Vaporetto stops and many nice restaurants and cafes. The included breakfast was great and a bonus was a free cocktail party one night. The staff was very helpful in meeting our needs, I couldn't recommend it higher.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Ca Pisani hotel is absolutely gorgeous. The room was very stylish and spacious. The bathroom was very sleek. The staff was very friendly and very helpful and even gave us an upgrade. The Ca Pisani hotel is in a great location. It is very close to must-see places like St Marco place, Dogen Palace, La Venice Opera, but just far enough away to not be overwhelmed by tourists staying in hotels. A great stay for a great price! For a romantic weekend or a business trip.</p></li>

The people at the front desk were very helpful. They gave a lot of good recommendations for restaurants. The only negative (which to some people may not be a negative) is that it is not on a canal. Hotels on canals can be noisy. This hotel, however, is only about a minute walk from the Grand Canal. It is in a great location.

Breakfast was very good and the employees in the dining room were very friendly. Front desk staff was unfriendly. Not rude, just unfriendly and robotic. Since they are the first people I saw, it impacted my perception of the hotel. My several interactions with them, including checkout are what make this hotel 4 stars instead of 5.</p></li>

The staff were very helpful and friendly. The decor was great - lots of Art Deco - and the hotel was spotless. It certainly passes the Would I Stay there Again Test?

The rooms were very comfortable albeit designed for a business clientele. I'm sure the rooms were ultra modern about 10 years ago. In some ways this modernity just makes old Venice seem more alluring. We would definitely stay here again, especially as it is right next door to the Accademia.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The decorations are modern, we were received with courtesy our rooms were prepared on time. Rooms are very luxurious, big bathrooms with jacuzzi. Good bed and very clean, the only problem was a light over the TV that couldn't find were to turn it off and had to go to the front counter to know that if you push a small shelf below the TV it will turn off the light. Breakfast was excellent, strong cafe espresso, very friendly waiters preoccupied in giving the best service. This is my third visit to Venezia, and the first time in this hotel, will highly recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a wonderful base from which to see Venice. The art deco interior is cool and fun and the staff could not be more helpful. It is just 10 minutes walk from St Mark's Square, a stone's throw from L'Accademia and Zettare vaporetto stops, yet is on the quieter side of a very busy town. It has a simple but good restaurant and once again the service is truly excellent. The rooms are large, wonderfully furnished, and a great change from most other hotels around the world. Amazing bathrooms. If we go back to Venice we will stay there again. Nothing could be better.</p></li>

We were two women traveling together and when we checked in they asked if one queen was what we had requested. We told them no and they upgraded us to a loft apartment! We had a small living room and up some stairs we had two single beds in a loft bedroom. The accommodations were great! The hotel is a ten minute walk from St. Mark's Square and in a very quiet neighborhood. If you want more action or views, this is not the place to stay, but if you want a short walk to the action, this is a great hotel!</p></li>

Perfect location in Dorsoduro for anyone who wants to take advantage of all the art and music that Venice has to offer. Beautiful room, comfortable bed and wonderful use of space. Discovered that the problem with too much heat in the room came from the heated towel racks in the bathroom. After turning these off, all was well. Yes - mosquitos in November, but the weather was unseasonably warm all over, so windows had to be opened. All staff were courteous and friendly and very efficient. We will be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent hours and hours trying to find a good hotel in Venice that was not a tourist rip-off, damp, old and grossly over-priced. Reading through the Trip Advisor reviews, this proved very difficult. The Ca'Pisani was clean, modern, good size room, great value and a 2 min walk to the canal. Would highly recommend. A standout vs the tired and worn overall poor quality hotels in Venice. Only downside was lack of a restaurant / room service but a good continental breakfast is served in their coffee shop / bar and there are plenty of restaurants within a short walking distance.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel for a couple of nights in July. It was very easy to find and close to a Vaporetto stop. The hotel itself was stylish with very pleasant rooms and cool air-con which was appreciated as Venice is very hot in July. Great location for all the sights - St Marks is within walking distance and the Vaporetto stop is just round the corner. Breakfast was tasty and the bar was a nice place to hang out before going to dinner. The Art Deco look was a bit different to your average hotel and made the place seem even more stylish and special. Would highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

It was central yet not smack in the crowded area of St Mark's. Hotel room was actually decent sized for Italy and hot breakfast was a nice inclusion. Would highly recommend it for people who like modern furnishings in a convenient location in Venice. We stumbled upon a wonderful concert just across the bridge one night (Chiesa di San Vidal), which just added to our wonderful Venice experience.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights. We were extremely pleased with the choice. The hotel is located in a beautiful and special part of Venice, and very close to the Academia bridge. We found the design to be modern and tasteful. The staff was extremely friendly and gave us excellent recommendations. We stayed in a duplex room. The one point to mention is that the stairs are narrow and not easy to use if you wake up at night, so consider whether you really need a duplex before booking this room. We had a wonderful time and i highly recommend the hotel, we would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

The hotel is the first art deco hotel in Venice and just beautiful. The hotel is also in a perfect location...being just minutes away from San Marco square. Also, there are some great little restaurants and shops are all around. They offer the best breakfast in the mornings. Perfect location, friendly helpful staff, and beautiful hotel....

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our first stop in Italy, in August '06, was Venice- Ca' Pisani. We had a superior room on the top floor and loved it! The bed was wonderfully comfortable and I'm very picky. The bath was fabulous with a skylight over the shower/tub. Two comfy chairs rounded out the room. It was all we could ask for. The breakfast was excellent. I'm amazed at anyone who says otherwise! We also had a dinner in the restaurant which we enjoyed. We found the front desk service occasionally brusque, but no more so than in other Italian hotels. Location was stellar. I greatly look forward to my next stay at Ca' Pisani.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We liked everything about this hotel - its smart design, fabulous quiet location, easy to find, great helpful staff, and an amazing room. I was worried about space when sharing with my two nieces, but we had a room on two levels, where they had upstairs and I had downstairs, sharing an amazing large bathroom. I had never had great dining experiences in Venice, but both restaurants recommended by the hotel were excellent. Wonderful to be a short walk from everything but in the calm quiet of Dorsodouro, with the Guggenheim and Santa Maria della Salute so nearby. Excellent breakfast and Wifi everywhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiance took me to this hotel for a weekend break. The staff were really attentive, the room was cleaned twice a day, and it was a treat to come back in the evening and discover a box of chocolate truffles awaiting us. The shower was amazing, and the bed was very comfortable. Breakfast was included and was very tasty. The hotel also has a turkish steam room you can request the use of which was a nice way to relax. The hotel is in very close proximity to Le Academia and Peggy Guggenheim Collection, as well as being close to a good selection of local well priced restaurants. Would stay here again if we go back to Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Ca Pisani is one of the best small hotels I have experienced. I stayed a few nights in room 11 and loved it: it was quiet, cosy, well appointed and large, with a wonderful bathroom. Since I am very much interested in Art Deco, I was delighted to see all the furniture pieces in the hotel. The location is good: you can either walk to the centre or take the water bus in the nearby station. In the neighborhood you have the Gugenheim museum, the Accademia (Accademia ) and several interesting shops selling art. The staff was frindly and helpful. This is definitelly a hotel that I can endorse and where I would like to return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I spent six nights at the Ca' Pisani in October, 2010. Our stay, in a word, was fantastic. We stayed in a junior suite which had plenty of space and my wife loved the bathroom. The art deco furnishings were a really nice change from the usual surroundings. The location, very close to the Academia Bridge, was wonderful and made for lovely explorations of the Dorsoduro. Breakfast was more than we expected, with plentiful choices and a sophisticated atmosphere. The best feature of this hotel was the wonderful and attentive staff. They were very knowledgable and helpful at all times. They made our stay a wonderful experience.</p></li>

The high-quality interiors, customer service and ambiance combined to excel our expectations. Ca'Pisani was an oasis of style - art deco with a glamourous twist, filled with unique furniture finds and custom designs. The roof top terrace above Venice was a stunning place to relax and consider our next adventures through the city. We found the Dorsoduro area perfect for us, excellent art and music being within easy reach. We recommend the hotel and it's team very highly and shall certainly stay again when opportunity allows.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As Venice has so much to offer we wanted a hotel which was convenient, friendly, not stuffy but which in this City wouldn't cost the earth. The Ca'Pisani was great - and since then I've also arranged for my parents to stay there too and they were equally enchanted. It's got a great location, stylish and good-sized rooms and common areas. The restaurant and bar is small but very good quality - modern Venetian food and excellent breakfasts. The staff couldn't have been more helpful (including sourcing wellies to cope with unexpected (to us) flooding). It's small enough to feel personal but not so small that it doesn't have all the amanities and to a high standard.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I have been to Venice many times and decided to stay in an area we have not explored. The Ca' Pisani Hotel in the Dursoduro area is easily reached by water bus/taxi from the airport - just a few minutes walk from the Zattere stop. The hotel is close to the Accademia museum and bridge. The hotel isn't the usual musty Venetian style but rather art deco and modern in decor. The small restaurant downstairs was excellent for dinner and had more than an adequate breakfast. We were very pleased to find this small and pleasant hotel and would stay there again. We appreciate the reviewers comments on Trip Advisor's site.

Plenty of stoarge space for clothes, suitcases and other personal items. Bed very comfortable, with quality linens, pillows etc. Even great coathangers - and plenty of them! Great bathroom. And we even had a view!! Breakfast - range and quality of food very good. All staff delivered service with warmth and professionalism.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in mid October, we have not been to Venice before so I have nothing to compare to but we found it to be very well located. The decor is good the rooms are spacious and we had a standard room. My husband loved the blanket on the bed and has made me try and find one similar! Breakfast was varied and lots of it. We had a drink after dinner one night in the bar and where the only people in there and felt that the barman wanted to go home, its was only 9.30pm, however things do not seem to go into the night here, understandably as there is so much to do and see in the day. I must admit I didn't find the staff overly helpful, they where polite but no more. Overall a lovely stay in a beautiful place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were here for 3 nights at the end of March for our 25th Anniversary. The hotel was in a good location to walk everywhere. The proximity to the Vaporetto stop was also good. We had one of the rooms that had the Bedroom on top. It was very clean and comfortable for the stay. We missed our connection and did not arrive until 11 pm. The only thing that was tough is that all of the resturants were closed. We adapted with Apples and peanuts and a bottle of wine. The Resturant had a great selection for breakfast and were very friendly. The reception staff were helpful and made us reservations each night. All in all a wonderful stay! I would highly recommend this hotel due to the location and the staff that work there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a gem of a hotel! We stayed here 2 nights and this hotel was wonderful-silky linen sheets, modern, luxurious bathrooms and toiletries, a high-tech keyless entry system that let the staff know when you were in your room (and therefore you were never disturbed), free internet connection from the lobby, and delicious breakfasts served at tables outside...After tackling the crowds and sights of San Marco, Ca'Pisani was a welcome retreat. We had room 11 and it was so quiet! Even better for heavy packers, the water bus stop is very close. After seeing the ornate halls of the Doge Palace and the many churches of Venice, you will enjoy the clean lines and 1930s chrome and wood architecture of this lovely hotel. Stay here!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Numerous stays at Ca Pisani only serve to reinforce my highest recommendation for the hotel - a warm, welcoming, and stylish homebase for your Venice explorations. The front desk staff is impeccable and helpful with good insider knowledge and the rooms are wonderfully comfortable and well designed. Plus your room rate includes free wifi and breakfast - so all immediate needs are taken care of. The location by the Accademia, with easy access to the central part of Venice, but removed from the tourist hustle-bustle. The new Punta de la Dogana museum, plus Peggy Guggenheim are steps away, and the Zattere facing Guidecca provides ample space for strolling as well as numerous cafes and restaurants. In short, stay at Ca Pisani!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My two daughters (ages 10 and 11) and I stayed at Ca' Pisani for about 5 nights in June 2010. The staff were remarkably helpful by email as I was booking our trip (they even researched hotels in Ravenna for us!), greeted us by name upon our arrival, and recommended wonderful restaurants and destinations throughout our stay. In terms of aesthetics, the hotel successfully combines the "old bones" of the historic private home with very attractive contemporary art and design. Our rooms and bathroom were beautifully appointed -- though the "sunrise clock" was a little silly. The only downside was noise from the hall, though it didn't keep us awake.... Lastly, the location in Dorsodouro, just 1 minute from the Accademia, was perfect for our wanderings.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has a wonderful location down a quiet street but a short walk from Zatterre and Accademia vaporetto stops. The bedrooms and bathrooms look like they have been recently refurbished and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. We ate in the hotel's restaurant La Revista on our first night and had a very good meal. The only slight downside was the lack of hot water. We stayed in room 19 on the second floor for 3 nights and were without hot water on two occasions. Having said this, the staff were quick to sort out the problem each time, and our friends in a room on the floor below had no problems at all The staff were always keen to help, ringing the water taxi company several times on our behalf to sort out departure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my third trip to Venice and I'd been a little disappointed by arrogant service and substandard rooms. No longer! Ca' Pisani was superb. Our room was gorgeous - lots of lovely wooden features, unobtrusive and useful bits of modernity and a terrific view over the rooftops of Dorsoduro. The location of the hotel was great and they very kindly arranged a (private!) boat trip to the island of Murano for us. The staff were knowledgeable, helpful and polite. There were some lovely touches to make us feel welcome - like the way they prepared the room for bedtime when we were out in the evenings. We were made to feel quite special staying here. Venice might be quite an expensive city to visit, but this place was terrific value and we had a great time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I booked a room at this hotel for our two night stay in Venice during our honeymoon. It is located 5 minutes walking distance (if that) from the Accademia water bus stop, very convenient. The neighborhood this hotel is located in is really really nice and cute and unique. Plenty of good food is located five to ten minutes away down the narrow walkways of Venice. The staff were very helpful (specifically, they printed us a map of the exact location of one of our dinner locations - this is very helpful in Venice where roads and passages are not clearly labeled or understood by visitors) and friendly and nice. If you want to be away from all the tourists and enjoy a few nights sleeping in a quiet yet fun and energetic neighborhood, this is your place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spend 4 days in this hotel, and really is a good option in Venice. The famous hotels are really expensive, and this give you a great price (is also expensive, but is Venice, so....), for a design room. I had not been before in Venice so I think this is the best option for a novice. I suppose that in other visits to Venice y try to go to a hotel that introduces me something more in the venetian history. The hotel is designed like a modern one, then, when you have been captivated by the venetian atmposphere, it's is possible that you prefer a classic one. The worst of the hotel is the breakfast... very poor. The best: the hotel is in Dorsoduro, so you can go to a walk and discover the real Venice, where the authentic venetian people live. It's a very calm hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 3 days at this hotel. The hotel is well located in Venice and convenient for using the water taxis. We had room 31, a large superior double. The bed was a little hard but adequate and a good size. The room was a decent size with views over the roof tops. The bathroom was a little on the dark side and had an unpleasant smell in the corner near the toilet which we mentioned to reception on our departure. The electric switches controlling the lights and blinds in the room were confusing. Breakfast was good with fresh fruit, cold meats, eggs, cereals, tea coffee etc. The service was friendly and prompt. The staff on reception were very helpful. Overall, this hotel is good value for money and it's position in the city, whilst not on the main canal, is excellent.</p></li>

The staff were wonderful and made all sorts of special arrangements for us that I know took them a tremendous amount of time. They couldn't have been more gracious and helpful. And you do get a trendy room! Rooms are beautifully designed, although somewhat small, and the public areas are lovely. It is one of those hotels where it takes me a day to learn how to work the lights, but that's probably just me. The location is great, in a quiet section near the Accademia Bridge away from most of the tourist traffic. There's a small restaurant with a very nice breakfast (included) that serves only light meals. You can sit at a table outside and enjoy great people watching. I'd definitely recommend it.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have just come back from venice staying at the ca'pisani for 3 nights. I travelled with my daughter who was recovering from a spell in hospital. We were very impressed with the hotel when we arrived, cleanliness and amenities were great. I think it would have been better to stay on any other floor than the mezzanine as unless we has not walked up the stairs to the terrace we would not have seen the lovely art deco funiture on the other floorsThe largest fault we found was that on more than one occassion when we came back at night we could not get a nightcap in the hotel, one night at 10.20 pm we asked for a coffee and were told NO. such a shame not to be able to sit in the little lounge and have a drink before we went to our room! We did not find the concierge particul;ary friendly or helpful just perfunctory (usually) NO answers.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Service is top-notch. The staff is professional, not over-intrusive and both restaurants recommended were local eateries that serve wholesome food. The room size was big, nicely partitioned for luggage storage. We had one of the rooms on the top floor, and it was nice to have natural sunlight coming in from the rooftop, in the bathroom and also the luggage storage room. There was a kettle and free flow tea bags/ coffee on each floor, which is a nice touch; considering how rare drinking hot water is available in all the hotels we stayed throughout Italy. Breakfast is one of the most memorable part of the stay. The crossiants were crispy, cheese, bacon, ham were all fresh. Dining room at the basement was bright and spacious. We had a great experience staying here, and away from the main crowd from San Marco. Nice neighbourhood, great location!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It can be a little nerve wracking choosing a hotel in Venice as the rooms can be small and the hotels a little weary. Ca' Pisani is certainly not weary and anyone looking to find excellent accommodation, convenient location and attentive staff should give Ca'Pisani a try. Our room was generously proportioned and there was plenty storage. TV and air conditioning worked perfectly. Exceptionally clean and comfortable. Staff were attentive and helpful and always acknowledged us as we passed. The owner Marianna, introduced herself and assured us of her attention should we require it. Such a refreshing change to meet the approachable owner and be assured that she was firmly at the helm. Great attention to detail thank you for a quiet and tasteful hotel. Oh, breakfasts were excellent by the way. Only improvement might be to supply tea/coffee facilities in the room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Based on Tripadvisor reviews, I picked the Ca'Pisani for a three day break with my husband and 10 year old son. What an inspired choice: I earned lots of brownie points from hubby for having chosen it! We had a junior suite so our son slept in the lounge area which was separated from our bedroom by sliding doors. A TV on either side of the doors helped enormously! Gorgeous real linen sheets, comfortable bed, thirties' style decor with an extra dash of panache, big jacuzzi bath, an array of buttons to operate the shutters and windows - all made for an excellent stay. Staff very pleasant, breakfast very good. Loved the baskets of apples in the corridors; our son thought was it very naughty to pinch one when we came back in the afternoons! Location was excellent; no more than a minute or two from the Accademia vaporetto stop. Would stay here again: a luxurious but relaxed hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my third visit in three years to the Ca'Pisani. This hotel has everything going for it and is a wonderfully relaxing home away from home for visitors to Venice. While not cheap (we paid E369 for a deluxe room) prices include an excellent European/American breakfast complete with freshly brewed espresso, cappuccino and filtered coffee; meats and cheeses, cereals, eggs and bacon. The hotel is located on a street that is within a block of the Academmia Bridge where the Venice public water taxi makes frequent stops. The hotel' is a "10" on the interior design scale: its public spaces are filled with modern art that is beautifully juxtaposed against other textures such as natural brick, marble, glass, leather. The staff at the reception desk are uniformly friendly, well informed and eager to assist guests. We look forward to returning to this hotel many times in the future.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This small hotel is located in the relatively quiet Dosoduro section with easy access to 2 vaporetto stops: Zattere and Accademia. Our room, number 25, was small but comfortable with good air conditioning. We liked the modern (1930's) design but the period headboard squeaked and groaned loudly when anyone sat up in bed and the light for reading was not adequate in the area set aside for chairs. The staff was very friendly and helpful, getting us tickets to a nearby concert of music by Vivaldi in Chiesa San Vidal and restaurant reservations. The on-site restaurant La Revista offered a very nice breakfast buffet (the best we had in Europe) and the wine and cheese bar had a wonderful if limited selection of menu items. After a large lunch one day, in the evening we stopped in La Revista where I had a selection of 5 local cheeses that was superb. We would definitely stay at Ca' Pisani again on our next rip to Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A great location to get to from Accademia or Zattere, very easy to find. All the staff were very pleasant and helpful, our room was made up twice a day, the chocolate supply was great especially the Easter fish on our pillows. The design of the room kept the noise to a minimum, we were surprised to realise that there were 3 young children in the room next to us & we hadn't heard them at all. Interesting art books and a seating area on the 2nd floor were almost missed. Breakfast kept us going until the evening and changed slightly each day. There are some lovely bars & cafes around although we did find that places closed around 9pm. We enjoyed the food in the Taverna San Trovaso by the bridge (up from the gondola repair yard), and also the cheap Prosecco and cicheti at Al Bottegon Wine bar on the same side. The student area around Campo di Margherita was also a good place to people watch and enjoy cheap food & drink.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I say the Ca' Pisani is a small gem for three reasons: Giovanni di Stefani (the manager), the cleanliness of the entire hotel and the superb rooms. Mr. di Stefani gives a warm welcome, wonderful restaurant recommendations, precise directions and does it all without being overly familiar or "in your face": it was clear to us that our happiness was important to him; the place is impeccably clean: even the breakfast bar which, given their large variety of choices could easily become sloppy, was always appetizingly neat as were the rooms, the common areas and the elevators and lastly the rooms are a miracle of compressed luxury: beautiful appointments, jacuzzi tub, very comfortable beds and a phenomenal shower. I've stayed in much more expensive hotels in Italy but none better. We loved Ca' Pisani and can't wait to go there again. If you are arriving in Venice by plane and taking the boat go to either stop Zattere or Academia; the hotel is equidistant between the two.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I do not know where sydneyseasons stayed. It wasn't at the Ca'Pisani Hotel where we stayed for our honeymoon. The reception staff were multilingual, informative, and accommodating. There is free wifi, the breakfasts are plentiful (italian bacon, cheeses, cereals, fruits, yoghurts, dates, toasts and spreads, eggs, need I go on?), the rooms are art-deco with great room service and a turn-down service. The restaurant provides great food which is well priced, and the bar is sensibly priced for Venice. We loved the turkish bath on the third floor - perfect after a day's walking around Venice. Different cultures WILL do things slightly differently and the Venetian way is certainly not the Aussie way... I would heartily recommend this to anyone who wants to see Venice as it is just off the main tourist thoroughfare but only a few minutes walk from everything and the service is awesome!!!!! Tip - avoid the gondolas - Incredibly expensive, and guaranteed not to be rowed by an Italian!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">...not enough people know about it! Ca Pisani is situated in the art district and it is equidistant between Rialto and San Marco; in that respect it is superbly located since whether its restaurants or galleries or the market or the boutiques that you want- all is nearby. The hotel staff at Ca Pisani was knowledgable and efficient and always available to assist with any request or just generally to give recommendations when asked. The interior scheme is fairly daring and ambitious but appears to have been studiously thought out and the delivery is meticulous in detail. The result is a very practical but uniquely beautiful hotel. We stayed in a luxuriously comfortable room 31 (triplex) with a very Venetain view over the rooftops of the city. It was truly atmospheric and, having stayed at the Danielli and Grand Canal opposite Harrys Bar on my previous visits to Venice, I can wholeheartedly recommend Ca Pisani as the hotel to stay in when in Venice. PS. ladies- the ensuite whilpool tub is the real thing!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent hotel, great service, perfect location! Had spent hours and hours checking out hotels in Venice for a 2 night stay for a 40th Birthday treat. Eventually through lastminute.com, booked via their 'top secret' facility (you don't know where you will stay until you pay thus receiving a discount in price). Ca Pisani had been on my 'possible' list so was pleased when the confirmation came through. The staff have an excellent level of service and so friendly. The rooms are immaculate with all the trimmings you would expect (and want) from a top-end hotel. The breakfast is fresh and more than enough with the addition of fantastic coffee! The location was a definite plus plus point. Having travelled around the city, we were so pleased we were in the Dorsoduro district. the hotel is a moment from the main water bus stops which is a must for getting around and for taking in the city from the water. (tip - do buy a travel card which lets you hop on and off boats at your leisure). Do go to Ca Pisani - you'll love it!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Honeymoon at Ca' Pisani”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiance and I decided to get married in Venice. This romantic city was the first stop on our 10-day honeymoon. After an extensive Internet search we booked a 2-night stay at Ca' Pisani for the nights of November 11 and November 12, 2007. The hotel was well worth the cost. It's located a stone's throw from the Accademia bridge, close to the vaporetta and not that far of a walk from St. Mark's, the Rialto and the post office. Located in Dorsoduro, it's away from the swarms of tourists and loud crowds. The hotel is modern and well-decorated. Our room was warm, spotlessly clean and comfortable. Although we didn't eat dinner at the restaurant on the first floor, the breakfast was wonderful, with various meats, cheeses, eggs, cereals, juice and milk. It was a vital part of our morning. Additionally, we had a nice drink there. The mini-bar was fully stocked. A computer with Internet access was available and there was a small roof-top terrace. We loved our Venice wedding and our stay at Ca' Pisani. We'd love to return someday.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Although this review is over nine months late, I felt compelled to write. We arrived in Venice in the middle of the night due to a missed flight from Frankfurt. After finding our way to the Hotel Ca' Pasani, we were warmly welcomed. Our room exceeded our expectations. It was very large, by European standards. The huge bathroom, with whirlpool, was an unexpected bonus. They even provided liquid laundry detergent which I used in the bathtub in my make-shift washing machine. Of course there was a laundry line in the shower stall. The entire hotel was tastefully decorated. The morning breakfast, sitting outside on the avenue, was charming. It was a great place to sit and people watch. Besides the great location of the hotel, the best part was the staff. All spoke English and went out of their way to be helpful. I especially want to mention Miriam M. at the reception desk. She was kind and her English was great. I believe her mother was from England. We would not hesitate to return to this hotel and to recommend it to friends and family.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a GEM! Ca' Pisani well exceeded our expectations all around. The decor is very sleek, contemporary with funky 1920's details dotted around this exquisitely-restored palazzo. Our standard room was spacious and bright, with super comfortable beds & luxurious linen. The wholesome breakfast was something to look forward to in the morning; and the stunning roof terrace was a great place to chill out after a day amid the madding crowds around St. Mark's Sq. The staff were great and informative, with Franco in particular who stood out as highly-efficient, dynamic and professional. During our stay, he provided us with exceptional service and always with a smile. This has made a real difference to our stay. In one instance, we had left it late to book our airport transfer but he managed to sort it all out and even reconfirmed everything on his own initiative. Such attention to detail and conscientiousness are rarely seen these days. Well done, Franco- you have made our stay at Ca' Pisani a true delight and we are recommending your charming hotel to all our friends!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed again this year (last week), at the Ca'Pisani in Venice: this is a really outstanding place for various reasons. The extraordinary kindness of all the staff, from the front desk, to the chambermaids, they are are all smiling, very efficients, available, and with a good sense of humour! The rooms are large, very comfortable, with a beautiful "deco-design" furniture, and a great bathroom (jacuzzi...) with fine bathproducts. The breakfast is delicious, with various types of dihes, and everyday something new, but always the sympatic smile of the breakfast maid. The situation in Venice is outstanding: just behind the museum of "Accademia", very near from two vaporetto's stops: one one the grand canal, the other one on Zattere; and two minutes walking from the Accademia bridge, which allows two reach very easily any part of the city, and the must is that one can benefit of all these facilities living in a very quiet part of Venice, without the flow of the crowd. Ca' Pisani is an unforgettable place, where we certainly will return, and return again: "the place" in Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went to Venice for a week in June for the opening of the Biennale, and also before it got too hot. We had never been, so we didn't know much but found this hotel in the Wallpaper guide and cross-referenced with trip advisor. The location was really good because you are away from "the zoo" at San Marco, and in between the 2 vaporetto stops of Zattere and Academia , so it gives a lot of ease to move around. The room was really nice ( a suite) , if a bit dark. Our landing on the first floor to our room had great decor as well, with an art exhibit .Breakfast, which is included, is really good and the staff is excellent and cheerful. You can eat outside, and people watch. It's a quiet hotel, with polite guests and a very helpful staff. If it had a terrace to lounge on, it would be the best. There is a roof top, but it's for 2 , and when we were there the same couple staked out their territory everyday.The only suggestion I would make is to not use the hotel to book your water taxis to and from the airport, as it doesn't give you better service for the extra cost of about 40 Euros per ride. I 'd go back to this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ca' Pisani tries to be a little different and it works. We had four nights here and found the room welcoming and comfortable. They have really tried to make the place special. Modern items like TV, mini bar and safe are built into antique furnishings; towelling robes and slippers are free; and the shower had a rather sinister looking handheld device for "accurate rinsing :-)". All guests were invited to a cocktail party on our first night by the manager. We only ate breakfast in the hotel and it was excellent - squeeze your own orange juice and a wide selection of meat, cheese, fruit, yoghurt and some hot food. The staff could not have been more helpful. I forgot the combination for my suitcase and after trying manfully to break in, the concierge was about to use bolt cutters. Then I remembered! The hotel is perfectly located within 3-4 minutes walk of both Accademia Bridge and Zattere. Both of these have vaporetto (water bus) stops. Once we found how to use them (very easy) we spent most of the holiday on these brilliant examples of public transport. Single trips are expensive (6.50 Euros) but 24- or 36-hour passes are good value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from a wonderful weekend staying at the Ca' Pisani in Venice. Located just over the Acadamia Bridge on the south side of the Grand canal it's just far enough away from the tourist hourds but a short walk from most sttractions. We had a junior suite which was beautifully appointed, You could see that the owners had spent some money here as the finish was quality. I had a couple of small quibbles. One being there was no small table by the side of the arm chair in the small seating area so I had to put my drink on the floor. The other thing was the bed was a little too soft and the headboard squeeked every time I turned over. The bed, I presume an art deco original was a little too short for me or maybe it was that I prefer a bed with no board at the foot end, I found I couldn't stretch out. The bed linen was the best I'd ever seen in a hotel, beautiful. The breakfast was very good with everything I could expect and presented well. The staff were polite and helpful especially at the reception. I deliberately left some important sights out of my tour so that I have to come back again when I will be staying at the Ca' Pisani. Thank you</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Who would have thought that one could stay just behind the Accademia and be in a different world. You're literally in the heart of tourist Venice, but at the same time in the Venice of the Venetians. Sit outside for your breakfast and you will see the commuters from Giudecca walking from the Zattere ferry to the Accademia ferry stop with few tourists to be seen except those adventurous enough to travel to Giudecca. The rooms are eclectic and modernist, without being starkly modern, essentially they have a soul, and while there is sound from passing foot traffic this only adds to the Venetian experience. We found the staff friendly and helpful with excellent senses of humour, their demeanour was infectious and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We have stayed at a number of properties in Venice, and done our fair share of the full on tourist experience. This was easily our best stay, so close to all the tourist venues yet at the same time so much quieter and relaxing. You are equidistant from both the Zattere and Accademia ferries, so transport is not a problem, while this is an ideal location for investigating parts of Venice off the beaten tourist track.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed our fourth visit to the Caâ€™ Pisani, this time for three nights. A key advantage of this hotel is its excellent location on a (relatively) quiet street in eastern Dorsoduro, beside the Accademia and about 200 m from both the Canale Grande and Zattere, thus with excellent vaparetto links. The hotel is a late 20c conversion of a town house but differs from many similar Venetian ventures as the interior has been completely remodelled in contemporary â€˜designerâ€™ style and on the whole successfully. Some rooms are duplex suites with the bathroom and bedroom at different levels. Rooms and bathrooms are well furnished and are air-conditioned. Lighting is better that usual for Italy. Breakfast is an adequate but rather â€˜averageâ€™ buffet in the hotelâ€™s La Rivista restaurant, which also serves high quality and good value light meals throughout the day. All the staff we met were friendly and helpful and the hotel seems carefully managed. There is free WiFi and a free public computer. Recommended, especially to seasoned Venetian visitors not on a tight budget. Tip â€“ try the nearby Agli Alboretti restaurant for excellent risotto options, accompanied by high quality wines by the glass.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 4 nights in July 2011. The hotel was unique and very nice. It was also located in walking distance to pretty much anywhere we cared to go. The staff was responsive via email prior to the trip giving detailed directions on how to get there. We arrived late and were given some snacks as the restaurants were already closed. The room was awesome. Very spacious with lofted log ceilings. The design of the hotel was amazing (it IS a recognized Design Hotel). I loved all the nooks and crannies around the hotel where you could relax, look at art, read, etc. (too bad we never had time to do any of that!). There was even a rooftop area where you could enjoy the weather and call down for food and drinks (we never got to do that either). The on site restaurant was very nice. We had good food for lunch and breakfast was included with the stay. I enjoyed sitting outside to enjoy my wine. The concierge was exceptionally helpful. He organized a private city tour for my husband and I. She was fantastic - she was flexible, intelligent, funny, and knew just about everything in Venice. I loved Venice and I loved this hotel. It was not overly expensive. I would definitely stay here again with no hesitation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Ca' Pisani because it was within walking distance to the San Basilio terminal and we were leaving on a cruise the next day. We took the vaporetto to the Accadamie stop as directed but could not find the hotel at first, and I waited while my husband searched for it. This hotel is well situated for anyone trying to avoid the crowds in St. Mark's Square and it is close to the Peggy Guggenheim Museum. The walk to the pier takes about 10 minutes but triple that if you are dragging along luggage. It is a quick two stop trip by vaporetto and you can actually see your boat if you look along the canal. The hotel is small but very well appointed and very modern inside with all kinds of gadgets and gizmos to control things. Despite its size, the room was very comfortable and a quiet oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Venice. There is a place to relax on the roof overlooking Venice while enjoying a drink or just reading and wifi is available throughout the premises. The hotel is well priced for Venice and also seems to offer discounts on many online sights. All in all, a good choice for a short visit to Venice. A really nice breakfast buffet is offered in the restaurant downstairs and service is excellent.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I booked the Ca' Pisani through Expedia and were suprised to get a rate of $207 a night for a standard hotel room in August. The hotel is in Dorsoduro, right next to the Accademia and the Guggenheim. It was a terrific location for August when the San Marco square is overwhelmed with tourists. The Dorsoduro is a bit more quiet than the center and has more charm, but it's easy to get to San Marco - you simply cross the Accademia bridge and walk for 10-15 mins. The Ca' Pisani was everything I had hope for. It's a small design hotel with lots of charm. The standard room is small, but the bathroom was a decent size, which is often not the case with European design hotels. The pillows and bed were comfortable and the sheets were simple white cotton. The hotel staff was very nice and accomodating, helping us with restaurant reservations, and the usual silly questions. The complimentary breakfast offered anything from bacon and eggs to pastries, but it was the multiple cups of coffee with perfectly foamed milk that made it a delight. Especially, since we could enjoy them at a table outside on the street people watching. I highly recommend this hotel and will try to always stay in the Dorsoduro when I visit Venice in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel because it was the only hotel from the Design Hotel group in Venice, our room category must of one of most elaborate bathroom setups in the city, and the location sounded good. We are happy we did. There's a beautiful rooftop terrace full of chaise longue and potted herbs and we'd go up there at sunset and listen to the church bells. We were always up there alone, which has an uninterrupted view of the city on three sides and we had perfect weather. Tres romantic. We stayed in one of the hotel's duplex rooms, which came with complimentary non-alcoholic mini bar drinks, woo! Our room was fairly expensive, but there were lots of little perks and amenities at the hotel and the location was absolutely perfect for us to see all the Biennale shows. Very near the Academia Museum, Guggenheim and Dogana. Ca Pisani is totally recommendable. The only big Venice feature it's lacking is that it's not right on the canal and canal view rooms are pretty magical. I was in a friend's room on the canal on this trip and though I liked our hotel much better, their view was utterly romantic, beautiful and unique to Venice. Still, you spend plenty of time on the water in Venice and our view from our room was quiet and charming of the neighborhood outside.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I did plenty of research before booking our hotel for our 5 days in Venice and was not disappointment with our choice of the Ca'Pisani. It's a smaller hotel in a cute neighborhood away from the busy tourist area of San Marco square and the Rialto bridge, but within walking distance of everything. Plus it's a quick walk straight off the water taxi - which is important when you're carrying luggage. The rooms are decorated funky with an art deco style. It's also very quiet. There were plenty of other guests staying that week but we barely ever heard anyone. We also enjoyed the steam room up on the top floor and the rooftop patio every afternoon. There are no cars in Venice so all you heard were birds chirping. Before out trip I friended the hotel on Facebook and the manager, Marianna, immediately sent me a message asking for our dates. She was very helpful with any questions I had before we arrived so if you're going to stay there, I suggest you do the same. I would love to return to Venice again and would definitely stay at the Ca'Pisani again. And if you plan on taking a gondola ride, I recommend doing it at night. During the day the canals are end to end with tons of gondolas. When we did it at night, we were the only one on mostly every canal under a moonlit sky.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I spent 5 nights at Ca'Pisani. The hotel is in an ancient building, totally renovated, perfectly clean and decorated with pre-40's furniture and fine modern carpets; the ancient volumes have been preserved. Our junior suite was large enough, and absolutely quiet. There is no view, our windows opened on the wall of the adjacent building; this is not a disadvantage in the winter when the sun raises late and guarantees a total silence during night; you may sleep there with open windows. Moreover, a canal view is nice, but it comes with the noise and smell of water traffic, which is a pity in a city without cars. Very well equipped bathroom : bubble bath and separate shower; no trace of the flodings mentioned in another ecent review : closing properly the shower door protects you froma private acqua alta. The reception staff is very knowledegeable and helpful, and advises you well on restaurants and shopping. The place has a small restaurant, with reasonably good food and a good selection of wines. The only weak point is the breakfast : service is minimalist, no fresh fruit juice as a standard proposition and the scrambled eggs are kept on a heating device and are overcooked. As a whole, an excellent experience; I would certainly recommend the place to friends.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in the junior suite for 3 nights. The suite consisted of a king sized bed, separate lounge, bathroom and wardrobe cupboard, two TVs and a built in sound system. Room was very clean, quiet, far enough away from the canal not to get any noise from boats (which is a problem I had last time I stayed in Venice). Wasn't a fan of the bathroom - looked amazing, but the floor got very wet after showering, meaning if you wanted to go to the toilet you needed to put shoes on or get wet feet. Bathroom was well equipped - separate shower cubicle, jacuzzi. Although I didn't like the toiletries, they were manufactured by LUSH and smelt horrible!!!! Breakfast was reasonably good, not a vast selection but certainly enough, and all of very good quality. Probably better than you would expect from a hotel of this size. The location of the hotel is amazing. 10 minute walk to Saint Marks square, but in a slightly quieter area. La Rivista - the hotel's restaurant, is also amazing. Staff were friendly, hotel has got a good internet point (only 1 though) and a little roof terrass should you fancy a spot of sunbathing! Overall - a nice hotel. Would I stay here again .... not sure, probably unless I could find something better. The only reason I wouldn't stay is because of the bathroom, specifically the flooding!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for Christmas 2006. Hotel is easily accessible, being only 100metres from Zaterre on the water bus route from the airport. The immediate vicinity is quiet, but only a few minutes walk from Academia bridge, which gives one of the best views of Venice. Reception staff always extremely helpful, friendly and not overly formal. Helped book rail tickets and restaurants and couldn't do enough to help. We booked a superior room which overlooked the quiet street. The decor was as described on their website, contemporary with great attention to detail. The bathroom was nice, including jacuzzi bath, the only criticism of that is that it was pretty small, but very clean with all amenities. One of the best points of the room were the electronic shutters and blinds which could be operated from the bed and made the room completely blacked-out. The maid service was great and included a turn down service at night. Breakfast was served in La Rivista which is the hotel restaurant. Breakfast was nice - not the best buffet I have ever seen but perfectly sufficient and the restaurant is quite funky. Lovely roof terrace (bit cold in December but would be great in the summer!). In terms of location, it is pretty quiet and about a 15 minute walk to St Mark's Square, however we did find some nice local bars and restaurants which were much less touristy, cheaper and better quality than the tourist traps of St Mark's.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Interesting hotel, but some quirks that I trust have been worked out since our stay. Upon check in, we went with the bellhop to a room that had other guests staying in it already--it was an awkward situation. We went back down to the lobby and were reassigned another room, which was nice if not unremarkable. Later that day, we took some friends to see our room (they were staying next door at another hotel) and all 5 of us got stuck in the elevator for over an hour! After we were unceremoniously released from our prison, all we were offered was one beverage from the bar and a very terse apology. Mind you, this was in the middle of summer and it was disturbingly hot in there... We also didn't have a lot of time to spend in Venice and it took a solid chunk out of our stay there. Lastly, in our shower, the odd 'designer' soap dispenser that had no soap in it. We had to call to get it filled with some strange powder. Perhaps this too has changed since... Awkward moment when my wife had to wait in her bathrobe while staff came in to refill the dispenser... These quirks added up to an experience that was a bit strange and off-putting, but I wouldn't expect everybody to have the same experience--perhaps bad luck on our end. I just regret that they weren't as apologetic as I would have expected for the elevator mishap and didn't offer us anything besides a luke warm drink and apology. I don't know if it was worth spending the money that we spent, but it was an experience nonetheless.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having booked into 'disaster hotel' and found suite we'd expected not available we check on line for something else, found Ca Pisani and and went down to take a look. They handled us wandering in off the steet wanting to examine their rooms with great aplomb! A suite wasn't available on the first night so we had a largish room on the mezzanine floor, which was prefectly good and elegantly/modernly furnished, and checked into a suite the next day. The suite was a working/sitting area and an open sleeping area above. The see-through glass stairs to the bedroom were disconcerting at first, but we quickly got used to them. The only glitch was the room was very hot, so my wife went to reception who sent someone up, who told us the heating wasn't on as air wasn't blowing out of the grill. We said we knew it wasn't, the grill was simply hot. (The heating is centrally controlled, which makes sense in an old building with limited scope for air-conditioning). He then told to us contact either maintence or technical (can't remember) next time we had a query. The exchange left a bad taste. That said, we opened all three windows and cooled the upper room down that way; and the rest of the staff were fantastic, the hotel is very cleverly converted to combine an old building with modern touches, and the location is ideal. There's even Zaterre vaproetto stop at the end of the street, with a pick up point for taxis or the blue line to the airport. Love it, intend to go back to Venice and this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I know this hotel receives top reviews but let's be honest...this is a hotel for people absolutely on a budget. It is certainly not a high-end boutique hotel. If you are on a tight budget looking to save money then this place is fine but for you high-end travelers this place will disappoint. The location is absolutely perfect but the hotel is absolutely average. I'm still not quite sure why its called a "design hotel". I hate to offend the hotel but the design is quite poor and dated as the furniture is old and feels very used. It's in desperate need of renovation. I'm sure the italian gods of design would agree :-) . The rooms are tiny even for Venetian standards. You can hear every move your neighbor makes in the room next door: when he walks, when he showers, when he snores, when he turns on the TV, when he.... The premises look dirty but are actually clean so that's not an issue. The breakfast buffet is "ok" but absolutely what you would expect from this type of hotel. I wanted to fall in love with this place before i arrived as all the reviews were absolutely great. From the second i saw the cluttered front desk i knew it wasn't what i was looking for. If you are looking for an impressive design hotel then this is not the place for you. If you are backpacking thru Europe or simply on a tight budget and aren't too fussy about hotels then the Ca' Pisani should suffice simply becuz of the wonderful location. By the way, I would like to say the staff were very polite and friendly which was a nice touch.</p></li>

<li>I'm still not quite sure why its called a "design hotel".</br></br></li>
<li>I hate to offend the hotel but the design is quite poor and dated as the <span style="background-color:#557585">furniture</span> is <span style="background-color:#557585">old</span> and feels very used.</br></br></li>
<li>It's in desperate need of renovation.</br></br></li>
<li>I'm sure the italian gods of design would agree :-) .</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">rooms</span> are <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">tiny</span> even for Venetian standards.</br></br></li>
<li>You can hear every move your neighbor makes in the room next door: when he walks, when he showers, when he snores, when he turns on the TV, when he.... The <span style="background-color:#f58231">premises</span> look <span style="background-color:#f58231">dirty</span> but are actually clean so that's not an issue.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">breakfast buffet</span> is "<span style="background-color:#3cb44b">ok</span>" but absolutely what you would expect from this type of hotel.</br></br></li>
<li>I wanted to fall in love with this place before i arrived as all the reviews were absolutely great.</br></br></li>
<li>From the second i saw the cluttered front desk i knew it wasn't what i was looking for.</br></br></li>
<li>If you are looking for an <span style="background-color:#ffe119">impressive design hotel</span> then this is <span style="background-color:#ffe119">not</span> the place for you.</br></br></li>
<li>If you are backpacking thru Europe or simply on a tight budget and aren't too fussy about hotels then the Ca' Pisani should suffice simply becuz of the <span style="background-color:#e6194b">wonderful</span> <span style="background-color:#e6194b">location</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>By the way, I would like to say the <span style="background-color:#911eb4">staff</span> were <span style="background-color:#911eb4">very polite and friendly</span> which was a nice touch.</br></br></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was very excited to stay at this hotel after reading many reviews, and I agree with all of its strong points. The staff at the desk were excellent; they all seem to be willing to answer our questions, help us make dinner reservations, and find our way around. The location was perfect: both in regards to access from the water transportation and for walking to many excellent sights that were nearby. It was also blissfully quiet, a real asset on such a busy weekend. The breakfast was fine, and the bar a pleasant place for a before or after-dinner drink. Unfortunately, we didn't get the opportunity to eat dinner there. One thing that was very disappointing to me was that our room was overly warm, "stuffy" being the most apt description I can think of. The first night I called the desk to see how we could turn on the air conditioning, and I was told that it was something that was controlled centrally, not in our individual rooms. So we opened the windows wide, turned on the bathroom fan, and managed to be comfortable, except for battling a few mosquitos. On subsequent days we tried to keep the sun out during the afternoons so that we didn't return to such a warm room. The first day, the housekeeping staff opened them; the second, my husband didn't put the blinds down properly. Every day, trying to make the temperature in the room comfortable became our endeavor. In short, I didn't expect this to be an issue in a hotel of this standard. Coming home with mosquito bites is okay for a camping trip, not for a stay in a pricey hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel offers everything you need in order to enjoy a great stay in Venice. We had a junior suite adjoining a superior double room, as we were travelling with our two (almost) teenage children. The rooms , particularly the suite, were large, well appointed, modern, comfortable and clean. The lovely wide corridors of the hotel and the lovely roof terrace were fantastic. We had breakfast at the hotel which was exactly what you need and offered the full range, served by such friendly staff..faultless. The help from the main desk was exceptional. They offered to arrange whatever we wanted, but were not at all pushy. They arranged water taxis to and from the airport and fresh flowers for the room. Their recommendation for dinner on every occasion (three) were spot on and the restaurants were fantastic, and just the type we asked for with respect to quality of food, cost and ambience. The hotel is in a lovely location, far enough away from the main throng of tourists around St Marks, but close enough to walk there in 10 mins or take a vaperetto from the stop which is 2 mins from the hotel. The immediate surrounding area of the hotel is superb. I spent alot of time researching hotels in Venice, as I didnt want to stay in a cramped rickety hotel or one which you paid excessively for just because of its name. The hotel rooms do not overlook any canals so if you want that this is not available, but for us this was not the priortiy as we were out most of the day on the canals. I cant recommend this hotel highly enough, it is excellent.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Travelling to Venice often over the years, we have never really ventured out of a property off San Marco, but after reading the reviews, I just had to try it out. Ca Pisani is a gem of a hotel...right off the Academia, a skip and hop to everything, yet away from the madenning tourist haunts. I contacted the hotel late November as we were finalising our trip to Europe, and emailed Tommasso, and he immediately got back to us. As we were travelling with our nephew, we were looking for a triple - something quite unusual specially in the smallish rooms for Europe, and with a great rate, I bagged it. I was expecting a dorm type set up -- but I was pleasantly the surprised. The room was akin to a junior suite, with an anteroom for the sofa bed, a B/O television and high ceilings. Modern italian is best to describe the room....A sliding door separates the bedroom -- with a lounger and a armoire for the tv, fridge and the writing desk. The bathroom has a walk in dresser, and even had a jacuzzi tub and multi jet showers...amenities are by Lush. The breakfast room buffet, managed by Paolo, was simple spread, but the attentive service was just fanstastic, specially in a jaded town like Venice teeming with photog tourists. Arrangements for transfers -- they offer a meet and greet service at a small premium and restaurants are just perfect...one night, we came back late and wanted a bite, and they pointed us to Acqua Pazza -- one of my best meals in Venice to date. By and large, I have become a convert. Ca Pisani makes you feel at home....check them out.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The service at this hotel is outstanding! It started with the prompt replies during the reservation process, continued great service from the front desk staff, the restaurant staff and the management team through out our entire stay. We stayed in the junior suite, the room is very spacious. It is a boutique hotel and has all of the comforts one would expect. The bed linens and lighting in the room were both fantastic. A separate jacuzzi tub in the bathroom is a nice amenity after walking all around Venice. The location is perfect! The hotel is located directly behind the Accademia. It was so pleasant to stay away from the crowds of San Marco. There are many good restaurants within just a few minutes walking of the hotel. The cocktails at the Hotel's wine bar, La Rivista are very reasonably priced and the staff are so very nice. The tables outside are charming and a great place for people watching. We had a wonderful stay at Ca Pisani and would definitely stay there again. Tip: If you plan on taking the Vaporetti to the airport from the Zattere stop down the street, please note there is direct service, however that service does not start till about 9am. If you have an early morning flight, you will need take the Vaporetti from Accademia to San Marco and transer to the line for the airport. Restaurant Tip: La Bitta restaurant about 5 minutes walk from the hotel through lovely quiet streets. The restaurant does not serve fish but has outstanding food and service, we went there twice. Make sure to have the fresh mozzarella and the vegetable crepes...outstanding!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ca' Pisani is a very nice hotel. We stayed in a superior room, which was pleasant and spacious. The people at the desk are friendly and helpful (we wanted pizza in the room one night, so they pointed me to a good place that did take-away and then gave us plates and cutlery). The air conditioning was good the bed was fine and there were curtains and electric shades and electric Venetian blinds so the room was quite dark enough. There were lots of available electrical outlets, a rarity. Aside from breakfast (which was fine, though the servers seemed constantly overwhelmed, even when there were few people), there is no real food to be had in the hotel. Overall, I think everything is attractive, but sometimes overdesigned. There were probably 25 things that looked like light switches, but only about half of them were (several were for the electric window coverings). The door handles were beautiful, but the Do Not Disturb signs don't fit over them. The shower has 4 different controls for a total of 6 showerheads and a handheld sprayer. The desk was interesting-looking, but not functional. Nothing really bad, just minor annoyances. The location is terrific and a big part of the appeal. It's an easy walk to most of the sites and it's convenient to multiple water bus lines. It is also in a quiet, pleasant neighborhood, with very little tourist traffic and a great waterfront walk with restaurants and gelato places within a couple of blocks, and there's a nice supermarket about 10 minutes away. This is a major relief from the hoards of people in Venice during the summer.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the hotel for three nights in June. We are planning on coming back next year. The hotel is great, and I was surprised to read the post about the maintenance. We found the hotel to be in great shape with a very comfortable bed. In fact, the beds are my pet peeve with foreign hotels generally having only a mattress, no box springs, so they are as hard as a rock or if old, saggy. This hotel had neither. The hotel is modern in furnishings, but as long as you know this ahead of time, it's no surprise. The staff was very friendly and helped me with my Italian. The restaurant had the typical European breakfast. There was plenty to eat. We ate at the restaurant one night. The food was great, and the staff went out of their way to make the meal enjoyable. Cheese tray for dessert was awesome, with glasses of port. What a way to end the evening. The bathrooms are not the typical little European size. Large and well appointed. Both a bath and shower. Two tvs in the suite. Windows really open. It is in a great location with neighborhood restaurants all around. We walked all around and never felt unsafe. ATM very close. Vaporetto stop within a two minute walk. If I had to be a real nitpicker, the only complaint was I forgot my adapter plug to use my dual voltage hair curler, and called down to ask if there were any in the hotel, or if there was some place close by to buy one. Front desk promised to find out and call back, but no one did. Husband said I didn't need one, I looked great with my straight hair, so he earned brownie points. Other than this one issue, the stay was perfect.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband & I stayed at Ca'Pisani in May for 3 days to celebrate our 35th anniversary. We were very pleased with every aspect of our stay. Our room was very large-(I believe it was a junior suite) with the bathroom on the first level along with a sitting area and bedroom upstairs. Note for all that have trouble with stairs that though there are elevators to the rooms/suites ,there were stairs within some units so check before booking! The stairs were very unique-made of glass and artfully arranged. They were very interesting, a work or art really, but for me it was difficult, especially since the shower and bathroom were downstairs. Next time I will ask for a room without stairs-but most would enjoy the suite. That said-just for those with a handicap -(mine is invisable so they would not have known), I would definitly recommend this lovely hotel. I only wish we could have stayed longer. It was very convenient to everything we wanted to do, and yet set in a lovely quiet area that had a peaceful and safe ambience. The staff was very helpful with making arrangements for whatever we needed. We arranged through them a gondola ride-it was wonderful, and they made it very easy. (another note to my physically challenged friends though, be very careful while trying to exit the gondola!) There was a very nice breakfast buffet, and we also had a wonderful dinner at La Caravella. The resaurant was amazing-the food was perfection, and we really enjoyed the outstanding staff. I would highly recommend out this resaurant also. We had a lovely stay and would definetly like to return to Ca' Pisani. Venice was so beautiful that it overwhelmed me and made me cry at glance.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wow, what a beautiful boutique hotel. My wife and I booked our 2 night stay in a standard room over the Internet and were quite surprised at how nice it was. The room had a huge queen bed with that modern, minimalist styling everyone is doing these days. Some cool features about the room: roll up blinds, venetian blinds, radio, and lights all wired up and controlled by switches at your bedside, oh, and the bathroom had to be one of the largest I've ever been in - waterfall style shower, side jets AND a handheld spray wand. Marble/limestone tile all around - just amazing. In the reception area, there are one or two computers with free Internet access. Also, the map which the hotel gives out is far superior to any of the other free tourist maps. Just ask the front desk. A few navigational things - we actually got lost walking around looking for the hotel so I'd like to share a few pointers. You can actually access the hotel from two vaporetto stops. If you're travelling through the Grand Canal, you'll need to stop at the "Accademia" stop. Once you get off the vaporetto, you should be facing the Gallerie dell'Accedemia with the Accedemia bridge behind you. If you walk to the LEFT of the Galleire dell'Accedemia, and continue along the street, you'll eventually hit Ca' Pisani. Alternatively, you can also get off at the "Zattere" stop (which is on the outside of the island) and walk to the right a bit, and then up Rue Antonio Foscarini (I think this is the name of the street that Ca Pisani is on). Some other things - the hotel is in the Dorsodouro area that the hotel is in is nice and quiet, and within walking distance of all major sights (~15 mins walk to Piazza San Marco - just follow the signs). Highly recommended.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just returned from a trip to Italy this past week. What a wonderful country. Our first stop was Venice where we stayed at the Ca'Pisani hotel. The hotel is not in the main touristy areas (Dorsoduro area) however with a very short walk to the vaporetto and took less than 15 minutes to get to any of the main spots. After spending 2 days in Venice we were relieved at the end of the day to walk to our hotel that was on a quaint, quiet street. The hotel gave us a warm welcome and even gave us an upgrade to a different room that had an extra room with a couch and TV. The room was modern, bathroom smaller than normal (but nothing to complain about) and everything was very clean. We stayed in room #10 which was a short walk up the stairs (or elevator) and not on the street front. I was disappointed with the all inclusive breakfast however staying in two additional hotels afterwards, we learned this is the European way. The hotel offers free internet which was great, recovering from jet lag I would use computer early in the morning. Daniel, a front desk clerk was very helpful, offered me coffee and a crouisant one morning while I was working at computer. I am a very picky person and this hotel was excellent and couldn't be happier that it wasn't in the Rialto Market or San Marco areas. The hotel is on the same street where at the other end is the Zattere which is great for watching the sunset and having gelato. When you arrive in Venice take your own water taxi arranged at the airport, they will hopefully drop you off at the Accadamia Bridge (a vaporetto stop). When you get off, go around the to the left, walk up the street (1 block) and hotel is on your right. Very short walk and you will have all of your bags! Wondferful hotel, thank you for making our stay in Venice wonderful!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Ca' Pisani- wondeful stay - some comments on Venice”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 5 days at the Ca'Pisani with my teenage daughter. Love the hotel. Had a standard room- was small but adequate. Bathroom was amazing. Twice a day housekeeping a plus. Staff was lovely- very accommodating. Guys in the restaurant recommended great wines for me while using the computer in the lobby. As to Venice, thourougly enjoyed it. We had a 7 day Venice Card pass, but note that most people got on the water buses without paying. Enjoyed meals in Ai Gondolieri, Cipriani (very posh), and local tratterias- esp. one near the hotel called Zattere I think. Very low key. The gelato near the hotel on the boardwalk was great too. Enjoyed the Caffe Florian - had lunch there our last day- listening to the orchestra- wonderful. Also, we hit Harry's Bar twice- yes, the prices are very high but you know that before you order. After all, it's Harry's. And suggest order the Bellini No.1- it's a bigger version of the regular Bellini with vodka and only 1 euro more. Highly recommend the tour of the Jewish Ghetto, whatever your religion. Doge's Secret Tour was ok, though our guide was good. Had 4 tour books and maps, but got lost everywhere. If I went right, I should have gone left. Interestingly, my daughter had a great sense of direction in Venice. Found some of the shopkeepers rude, but ones in the highend stores- Gucci, Hogan and Chanel were great. Saved a huge amount on shoes in Gucci (If you go, ask for Elena). Also enjoyed finds in small out of the ways places, including two in Canareggio- one called Fantasy Glass had the best hand made jewelry at the best prices. Another, near the water boat stop for Murano (Fond. Nuevo?) run by a woman named Lizette was also a find. Also liked the paper shop near the Guggenheim museum- she had the best prices we found for paper goods. Murano is hokey and a tourist trap but still fun. And, of course I bought a scarf, too!</p></li>
