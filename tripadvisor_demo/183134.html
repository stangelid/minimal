<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good size rooms - got a discount rate. It is best if you don't require parking - we had someone drop us off and then it was very very easy for early morning flight. No need to worry about morning shuttle to terminal - just walked across the road.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel in the airport, short walk/train distance from terminals But strangely, can't hear the planes from the inside so had a very good night of sleep. Rooms are spacious and have a mini bar, useful for a very late check in. You can also print your boarding passes from the lobby. Can't comment on the price, used customer points and was in transfer so didn't use the parking. Easy and fast check in.</p></li>

Biggest advantage is that you walk right into the terminal. If you stay in Toronto for a longer period, consider another hotel, as a taxi downtown will cost about $ 50 one way. Stayed here for two nights during a stopover. When we returned home a week later, we had to kill 7 hours on this airport between flights, and could store our luggage at no charge.</p></li>

The staff were very kind and helpful and advised booking online to get a better rate.

Our room was very comfortable with good facilities and ideally located for the airport-it takes 10-15 mins to get there with no need for a taxi & a reasonable price. We were disappointed with the food in the restaurant and felt it should of been of a higher quality for a hotel of this standard and was not good value. With hindsight we should have eaten our evening meal at a food outlet at the airport. Nice bar though</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed here a number of times in the past, using the hotels reverse parking option-where you leave your car before your vacation and check in to the hotel afterwards for the night. This works well for us and is pretty reasonable and very convenient to the airport. Rooms are very clean, fairly spacious. The beds are great with soft linens and pillows. Bathrooms are small, but toiletries nice. Coffee maker is adequate. Get a room facing the parking lot for quiet. The monorail is very noisy at night 24 hours a day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place is not connected to terminal 1 or 2. You have to take a monorail to get to this hotel. The advantage is that you can bring you luggage trolley right into your hotel room. The place is very pricey if booked thru various websites. I was lucky I was able to book it thru Hotwire.com Got an amazing deal. The room and the washroom is neat and clean - just basic, no fancy frills that you would expect for the price you are paying. The only thing that I did not like was the room lighting including the corridors was not bright.</p></li>

The room was tastefully decorated (matters to my wife) and had a large comfy bed.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed here three times because of the convenience. On my recent trip it took 18 minutes and 12 seconds from the opening of the aircraft doors until I entered my room (yes I was lucky with Immigration and I did not check any bags). The rooms are clean, comfortable and well appointed. In terms of price it was similar to places such as the Hilton which can require a 15 minute wait for a bus. As long as the rates are reasonable I will never stay anywhere else at Pearson having previously stayed at the Hilton, Holiday Inn, Sandman and Marriott.</p></li>

My husband remarked that his meal of chicken wings were the best wings he had ever eaten (and he eats a lot of wings!). We were very pleased that we could not hear a single plane arrive or take off from our room. I would certainly stay here again and recommend for any Toronto layover.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here during a unexpected stopover in Toronto (missed connection). We were glad to find a good rate ($99CAD) at such a nice hotel. The beds are quite comfy. And after a long day of travel, it was wonderful to just hop on the monorail from one terminal to the next, and drive our luggage cart right up to the lobby. However, when we landed in Pearson no one of the restaurants were open, so we had to eat at the hotel bar. The food was good, but expensive IMO ($19 for a lb of wings, $9+ for a pint of beer). If we had other options, we would have taken them.</p></li>

We ate in the restaurant and although it is pricey we felt the meal and service were worth it. Definitely first class!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located in Terminal 3 (go to luggage pickup, head out through main exit, turn right immediately and follow overhead signs). Super convenient for a stop over. Staff friendly, beds comfortable. Needs a little TLC in rooms (paint touchups, carpet cleaning, etc) but otherwise fine for what you need it for. A bit dark and depressive....but again, you are just here to sleep right? Not the most quiet hotel, but I bring earplugs....and I recommend you do too. In hotel restaurant and room service are insanely expensive....airport restaurants are only a one minute walk away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed one night at the Sheraton Gateway after arriving on a late flight. Booked the room as a Starwood point redemption. There were a fair number of people checking in at 1am, but I only had to wait a few minutes, and things went smoothly. Room was small, but clean, comfortable, and quiet. I had a great sleep. I was coming from terminal one (Air Canada domestic), and it was a bit of a hike (and tram ride) to get there. It's more closely connected with terminal three. Had breakfast in the restaurant. Service was so-so, food was acceptable, but disproportionately pricey, typical of Sheraton restaurants.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I would like to mention that Flavia at the front desk is extremely friendly and approachable and ensure that my stay was as comfortable as it can be. The room is nicely layout and roomy for an airport hotel. The hotel steam room is one of the few at a hotel that actually works. The hotel restaurant have really good food and enjoy the Shrimp Pasta for dinner and Burger for lunch during most of my stay here. The Maple glazed chicken is also really good. This is a great airport hotel, however, they only offer free wifi in the lobby and in the club lounge. With that being the only negative, I would give this airport hotel a pass!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel the night before a 6 AM flight. The hotel itself is fine - room is small but comfortable and clean. The location is perfect and extremely convenient - definitely worth staying here if you have an early flight or long lay over. The only complaint I have is the price of food. We ate in the lobby bar - we had 2 drinks (1 glass of wine, 1 draft beer), 1 personal pizza and 1 club sandwich (that was made with processed turkey) and the bill was over $80 with tip. We would have been better off eating in the airport terminal or taking a cab somewhere else. We would definitely stay here again if we had an early flight.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had a one evening layover in Toronto and stayed at the Gateway Sheraton. It was conveniently located for travelers since you don't even have to leave the airport. The dining was closing when I arrived so I ordered room service - it was MUCH better than I expected (although at a premium price)! The front desk staff was very helpful in answering my questions, making sure that my stay as satisfactory, and overall very pleasant. Same for the staff in the bar section. I would definitely stay here again on a layover or perhaps use as a starting point to just visit around the downtown Toronto area since it seemed to be very convenient for that as well.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel because family members were traveling from different parts of the country to meet up and travel together. There were several aspects of this hotel that made it a tremendous meeting place. 1. The rooms were comfortable, clean and well maintained. We definitely felt this was a well managed hotel. 2. The spa facilities were extensive and open 24 hours. We enjoyed the steam room, hot tub, pool and sauna. There were lots of towels. 3. The restaurant and bar was expensive but the food was OK. 4. The train between terminals was wonderful. What a great way to get around. We were very happy with our experience and would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here one night as I had a very early flight in the morning and got a great rate ($99 on spg.com). The Sheraton is in a great location, attached to terminal 3 ... all you have to do is walk across the path, or take the short shuttle to terminal 1 in the morning (Unless you are waiting for a flight, not sure why you would choose this hotel.) Check in was easy, fast and friendly. The rooms are standard Sheraton rooms; nothing fancy and a little dated but good enough. My biggest concern was going to be the sound of the air planes taking off which I did not hear. I would consider staying here again, if the price is good, when flying out early in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location of this hotel can't be beat for it's proximity to both T1 and T3. Sure you have to take a train from T1, but it beats schlepping your bags up and down stairs onto shuttle buses to the adjacent hotels. Room service food is $$ and disappointing. Thinking you can't really screw up a hamburger, well it was cooked from frozen and was dry and not very good. Caesar salad was wilty and tasted like it was prepared earlier in the day and kept in the fridge. One other note, as a SPG Gold member, had asked for a late checkout of 1pm. With the DND sign on the door, had a call from the housekeeper across the hall at 1230 asking me when I was checking out. Not very professional!</p></li>

When we stay here we always book the club floor which includes access to the lounge on that floor with free buffet of H'orderves and non-alcholic bevies. It also includes breakfast in the morning as well. We also make sure we request a "terminal view" room so we can watch the different airplanes come and go. I guess we're just kids at heart. In the morning, you just throw on your shorts n sandles and off you go to the airpport on the tram. You dont even go outside. Perfect!...and in my opinion, it might be a bit high in price, but I cant see myself staying anywhere else prior to a getaway.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location on the Pearson Toronto Airport site is why you would stay at this hotel. If, like me, you arrive on a late flight one evening and depart on another flight the next day, this is the perfect place to stay, so long as you are not wanting to see anything of the city! The staff in the hotel were excellent - accomodating our every need. The hotel food (dinner in the bar and breakfast) was overpriced for what you get but as a captive market I would expect nothing else. The bedroom was exceptionally comfortable with 2 large beds and soft-as-a-cloud duvets and pillows. The bedroom and bathroom were spotlessly clean and far more welcoming than my home! I would definitely stay here again...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Did this hotel on a stopover in Toronto. If you are simply using the hotel as a means to an end (i.e. Late flight with early morning connection) then it certainly meets those needs well. It is right off Terminal 3 with very easy access to the other terminals. The rooms were clean and beds comfortable. They were only double beds and with 2 adults and 2 kids this was a bit tight. No hotels should have doubles anymore - queens and up only. Shower was good with excellent water pressure. However, the price was way too high for the value. At over $300 for the night I definitely paid for the convenience with no extra service, luxury, or quality of hotel. I paid about the same in New York for much more.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staying at an airport hotel is usually a stay brough-on by necessity, however I was absolutely delighted with the Sheraton Gateway Hotel at Pearson Airport. There was a slight issue when I arrived with the television in my room not working, but when I called to ask if it could be rectified, the hotel not only gladly obliged but had all my belonging moved for me, had my roomservice order re-dispatched to the new location and they even paid for it in apology. The service is attentive and goes above and beyond what's required. The staff are excellent. The rooms are well appointed and are what you'd expect from a Sheraton. Also, you can hardly tell you're at a busy airport, the sound-proofing is excellent.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Sheraton Gateway overnight due to a business meeting being held at the hotel. The room was very clean and spacious. It was also very quiet and obviously convenient for those flying in. I drove to the hotel and the parking was not well marked. You eventually go all the way to the top of the parking garage, but it wasn't obvious from the signage that you go on that far. The room was more expensive than others I have stayed at in the area, but obviously being attached to airport comes at a premium. However, the restaurant was very expensive. All entrees on the lunch menu were about $20 and up. Dinner started higher. Coffee - $5, glass of pop - $3.25. The food was good and service was fairly quick.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed at this hotel many times, and there is no better place to stay if you have an early flight out of Toronto the next morning (especially if you hate mornings and early flights like me). I returned the rental car in the same building, took the elevator and was in the lobby in two minutes. Their check-in system is very efficient, both the machines and at the counter. The hotel crew is always very courteous and professional. The lounge on the 8th floor is really good. In the morning all you have to do is get out of your room and go to your gate! Can't find anything more practical than that. The price is a bit higher than other hotels in the same category, but well worth it for the convenience. The rooms are well maintained and very comfortable.</p></li>

Fortunately we were on WestJet the next day so did not have to change terminals again. Room was spacious and very nice. My sister flew up from Boston and met us at the hotel. She was hungry so we went to the bar area around 11:00 pm which was still very busy. I was almost half asleep so I don't remember the food but service was good. The next day we took a taxi to downton and visited friends for a few hours before our return to the airport, hotel check out and our return to Florida. Would definitely stay here again for a short turn around. Price was higher but you are getting covenience and quality which is worth it to me.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed here probably at least a dozen times. It truly is a very convenient location to stay the night before flying out on such early departure times... It is especially good with kids because when you travel at such early hours, it is a major stress to wake them up, get them prepared to go to the airport to stand in line... We find that we don't even need to bring our winter clothes because you practically are inside the entire time. The beds are very comfortable. The pool room is nice. We don't use the exercise equipment there but looks well supplied. The restaurant is good and price is high but understandable. And incredibly, you don't hear the airplane noise. We stayed at the Marriott a few blocks away--and it was very noisy!. Would pick it again and again anytime.</p></li>

I was fortunate to stay on the club level which included free internet and a complimentary breakfeast - definately worth the upgrade as the club room was exceptional and the staff were super helpful. The rooms were very clean; and the beds were some of the best I have ever slept on at a hotel. The hotel restaraunt was nice and the food was good - but as others have mentioned previously, it is pretty expensive to dine.

The person who had confirmed that the frigde was reserved, was nowhere to be found. The cot was disgusting! Dirty, metal bars, no sheet...I find it very disturbing that they still have these! The first room we were assigned, had been smoked in and smelled awful. The second one was a bit better, with a nice view of the airport (only + for this hotel ). It was dated, small & dark...the air was unbreathable...The bathroom was small as well with a tub that was more yellow than white, chipped and with dark spots. Unacceptable for a 4 * hotel!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel on September with my parents in law. My parents in law arrived to Toronto on a late flight, and the location of the hotel was extremely convenient! They just got off the gate, then took the stairs, and the hotel was right there! We also had an early flight, so again, it was very convenient for us. As for the hotel itself, the front desk staff was very attentive, we were greeeted by the housekeeping lady once we got to our floor, and the rooms are great and spacious. I was worried about the noise of the planes at night, but guess what? We couldn't hear a thing, even though I am a light sleeper! So if you are not sure to stay here because it is right next to the ariport, you may want to change your mind! I had a great sleep and I loved the hotel and the service provided! I would certainly go back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed the night before our flight. My husband and I travelled with our two children ages 6 and 2. We had connecting rooms with my parents. Upon arrival I asked the woman at the front desk where I could find the luggage carts. She informed me they didn't have any at the hotel .....uh hello this is an airport hotel and you don't have any luggage carts??? Our room smelled of terrrible B.O. and the bathtub was filthy. The carpet had stains and the bottom sheet of the bed had some kind of stain on it. It was clear the bottom sheet had not been changed. I can't believe this is listed as a 4 star hotel. It is in desperate need of fresh paint and carpets and the bathrooms need a serious facelift. We had chosen this hotel because it was so close to the airport but next time we will stay at one further away and take a shuttle.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great room, great beds, great linens.Hotel gave us ideal room and met all our requirements.Of course we stayed here rather than risk snow and cold in January. For peace of mind .But there wasnt any snow! Porter will escort you or you can push your trolley from baggage carousel into your room and keep it.! So, cheaper in spring to stay off Airport I guess! Slighly difficult to find the way there (especially if jet lagged) in that you need to go up one floor from arrivals and first timers could use more signs outside of the secure area in the Airport.. Too many choices of elevators not all signed. We stayed 2 seperate nights 2 weeks apart and still had to think about the route on nite 2. The word Shuttle train is similar to word Shuttle (bus) which is at different location/area. Semantics plays a part here if you ask directions.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel is in the best location you can ask for if you are plannig to stay around the airport. No need to go outside to get to your flight. We had an early flight from Thunder Bay on a snowy morning so it was so nice to just walk next door without having to go outside. It was so nice of the hotel staff to check us in a 8:30am in the morning and not have us sitting or walking around until check in time at 3pm. We can not thank them enough for doing that. We must say the rooms are clean, big and very comfortable even with alot of luggage in the room with you. The bed is amazingly comfortable. You can even watch the planes come-in to land from your room window. The next morning was very easy to check out, took 5 mins. as we were in a hurry to beat all the people in line that were heading to St.lucia and going through the gates with west jet.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Sheraton Gateway is attached by an elevated walkway to Terminal 3 at the Toronto airport. It is very convenient for travellers who are transferring to another flight the next day as there is a shuttle train which stops right outside the hotel. You can go from Arrivals at Terminal 3, to the hotel, hen to the shuttle train and to Terminal 1 without going outside. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The room was comfortable and surprisingly quiet. All amenities were provided including fridge, coffee maker and hair dryer. There is a business centre with free internet and free wi-fi (for 60 minutes). The only downside was the atrocious prices in the coffee shop and restaurant. Fortunately there is a Swiss Chalet right across the walkway in Terminal 3 which, surprisingly, charges the same prices as the other Swiss Chalet restaurants (no airport 'markup'.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stay here on overnights at Toronto Pearson on a regular basis, when connections require it. Its very convenient and a lot better than off airport hotels nearby that even though they are close still take a lot more time without any benefits in comfort, although some are cheaper with the same amenities. I like the pool and gym, and the bar and cafe are fine but lack signature items. The rooms need substantial upgrading. They are fine for a one night stay but have too many wear and tear scars to warrant the prices charged. The Fairmont at Vancouver Airport might be the standard that should be aimed at. Reception is fine, but can take time to get thru. I dont believe I've ever stayed here when the elevator and escalator system is in full working order...another sign of poor Sheraton investment in a property they should consider a flagship marketing opportunity !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Admitting to being a regular in an airport hotel is sad but I have been a regular to the Sheraton Gateway this year. Work has taken me there but as a place to stay it is not bad. Close to airport - it is just a pain that you see it when you land from Europe but it takes you almost an hour to get there - not the Sheraton's fault - I blame GTAA and their "in-field terminal". It has the most comfortable hotel beds I have ever slept in. Food is pricey - but if you have a car there is a good selection of standard restaurants nearby - front desk staff will give directions. Minibar auto-charges if you lift something up - daft system especially if you are not a "native" and want to see the ingredients fo something before you consume it. Sheraton need to rethink this. Generally the staff are helpful - there are just a few sour faces that you learn to avoid if you are a regular !!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here before an early morning flight and took advantage of a park and stay deal. This became a huge advantage to have our car stored indoors after there had been a fair amount of snow during the week, and we didn't have to scrape or brush off when we got back. The check in experience was friendly and efficient. I was welcomed back as a SPG member and given a great room with a great view. The bed was super comfortable, as is the norm with the Sheraton chain. The best part for me was definitely the ease of walking out, taking the train to the terminal and having a nice and easy check in for my flight. I also loved that the concierge would store our winter coats and boots for us so they would be indoors and warm to get into upon our return. I could nitpick that I don't like having to pay for internet in the room in this day and age, but wifi was free and available in the lobby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent room and staff, and so convenient. But some shock when bill arrived under the door with $20 of charges for six 1-800 calls. I called the desk; a quiet manager reversed the charges quickly. I pointed out that there was no written notice about this charge on or near the phone or in the thin room-information brochure; he agreed, saying "it is Sheraton policy" to charge even for local calls. Some policy; even roach motels do not have such charges! Also, I later noticed the small print on the room fridge price list: items are immediately charged when something is removed from the fridge. I had moved a can from the fridge to the desktop to make space to keep some food cool. I wondered what that metal arm was doing attached to the inside of the fridge door! Again, the charge was removed by the manager. Very nice room, but whatch out for these unnecessary, trivial and somewhat insulting charging procedures!.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Sheraton Gateway hotel twice, one night each when transiting through Toronto Airport to Hong Kong. This hotel is directly connected to T3 via an enclosed walkway. You will need to take the train to go to T1. From T3, simply take follow the signs to the hotel from the departures level and take the escalator to the bridge to the hotel. Very convenient. If you're traveling with a lot of luggage, you can push your cart directly to the hotel and straight onto the elevator and into your room. This hotel was a welcome sight in between my flights to/from Asia. Request a room with a runway view to see planes landing/departing. My only complaint is that not all the rooms have free bottle water (which I don't understand). One night, I was in a room that didn't have water. The second time I stayed, there was complimentary water. The beds are extremely confortable and the hotel is very quiet for being within the airport.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Shearaton Gateway due to the close proximity to the airport since I had an early morning flight. The train linking the airport and the hotel was out of service, so a bus shuttled people back and forth, running every 7-10 minutes. This worked well, but was a rather long walk to the pickup point from the arrivals hall (but was very well signposted). The reception area is on the second floor, but the long, steep escalator was out of sevice, necessitating a walk up steep stairs with the bags or trying to find the elusive elevator. The room itself was clean and quiet (I couldn't hear any air traffic at all), but in need of some minor repairs, including exposed wiring due to a broken outlet cover (a real hazard for children). My room also had a strong smell of a floral air freshener (not sure what they were trying to cover up), which bothered my allergies. This hotel worked well for my purposes, but should be better maintained.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had an unplanned two night stay at the Sheraton Gateway Hotel in Toronto thanks to the Iceland Volcano. The location was excellent for us, as we needed to be close to the airport in order to get regular updates on our cancelled flight. However, the hotel was very tired, as my review titles suggests, our room looked clean on the surface but a closer look revealed fungus in the bar fridge (a lot of it too!), ripped and threadbare sheets and copious amounts of dust everywhere suggesting the room hadn't been cleaned properly for a very long time. The service was also below normal Sheraton standards. We regular stay at Sheraton Hotels worldwide and we're prepared for a certain amount of variation in standards but this Sheraton was well below the standards of any other we have ever stayed in. It doesn't deserve its four star rating and Sheraton really need to do something before this particular Sheraton Hotel gives the others a bad wrap. Avoid it at all costs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife, two year old and daughter were on our back to the US and booked a night at the hotel. Paid about $150 Canadian on expedia for the room. Tried to get an upgrade to a suite at the desk, was told there were no suites at the hotel period. Although on their website, they say there are. Curious. The room itself was ok, nothing spectacular. The best thing was that it overlooked the runway, which kept my daughter entertained for an hour. It was also surprisingly quiet. The food was ridiculously expensive (like all hotels.). Continental breakfast in the morning was $18.50 as I recall. We went to the airport terminal for our meals. Additionally there was a large fee for Internet access in the rooms, we went across to the terminal to use the free wifi there. If McDonalds can give u wifi for the price of a Big Mac, why can't a hotel????? Drives me nuts. By far the best thing about the hotel was the location, could not be beat. Otherwise, very average in my opinion.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you're looking for the most convenient location to stay at while traveling into or out of Toronto's Pearson International, the Sheraton Gateway is your top pick. This luxurious hotel is located directly adjacent to Pearson's Terminal 3, and is right next to the new sky-tram that connects to Terminal 1. The hotel is state-of-the-art, with a fabulous lobby, complete with complimentary computer stations for guests. Suites are beautifully appointed, and many face the runways. Despite this, there is virtually no noise from jets! This hotel is near many shops and restaurants located on the airport strip, but it hosts its own restaurant and bar. If you do need to park, though, be aware that the nightly rate is $29! I parked at Park-n-Fly and shuttled to and from the airport for less than 1/2 that price. The shuttle brings you right to the door of the hotel; pickup at the airport is every 20 minutes. A great value. I used priceline; bid on both a 4-star and 3 1/2 star, and received this hotel both times.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our second visit to the Sheraton within 9 months, having been impressed at our first visit when we were evacuated from Cuba due Hurricane and arrived at 2am. We stayed again when our daughter was unable to fly with us (passport expired) until the following day. The staff on the desk were very sympathetic and gave us the 'government rate' when I asked for their best price. Despite a false fire alarm during the night - we didn't have to evacuate due to an inroom 'tannoy' that kept us fully informed of the situation - we stayed again for a second night, the beds are so comfy, the view across the airport is great, absolutely no noise, and the bar has an excelent selection of Canadian and European beers. Restaurant also good, especially for breakfast. The hotel is not too far for visits downtown, 25/30 minutes, we used the limo service from the airport and the express bus service, if more than two then the limo works out great at around C$40 the bus C$9 each one way. Looking forward to staying here agian in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Sheraton Gateway Hotel in the Toronto Airport is a fantastic hotel! The service is outstanding and the people are great! The manager Bin is so accommodating. He is always looking for ways to make my stay more enjoyable. This kind of service has been lost in the industry today. However at the Sheraton Gateway it has been found. I would highly recommend this hotel for business travelers looking for a overnight stay. If is so convenient if you are flying out of either terminal because of the tram that runs right from the hotel. If you are travelling on personal business the hotel has great rates on weekends. You will not be disappointed by staying at this hotel. It has it all great people, great views, great food and great service. It is not often you see the same people month after month and year after year working at the same hotel. This is true of the Sheraton Gateway. The people remember who you are and welcome you back time and time again. In a world where there is so many choices of where to stay, this hotel stands above them all.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Sheraton Gateway overnight before an early flight. It was adequate, and the room was relatively comfortable, with a good king-sized bed. Watch out for the minibar: we moved everything around so we could put our own food in, and everything we touched, we got charged for! Would have been really expensive if we hadn't been paying attention. The room service was expensive and not particularly appetizing. We were too tired to go out, so it did the trick, but it wasn't a splurge we were glad to have made. The front desk service was chilly and unenthusiastic. Be aware that the only luggage carts they have available are the ones you pay to rent from the airport. Was extremely inconvenient when getting our luggage out of the car to go hunt down a cart, though there were loose ones we didn't have to pay for, abandoned amid the parking lot. You can't beat the convenience, though. The hotel is right in the airport terminal. We were able to return our rental car, take the elevator up to our hotel, and take the elevator down in the morning to get our flight.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great convenient place to stay when travelling through YYZ”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked here on a recent overnight back to Vancouver and had a great stay. I also stayed here one night when I was a kid, and you can tell it has been renovated since, although there are still some finishing touches that need to be done in the bathroom. I liked the Starbucks coffee and cup (which I assume was complimentary) on the desk, the great view of the runway, and the very comfy king-sized bed. My only complaint is to watch out if you are ordering room service: They added a $5 delivery fee, AND a mandatory 18% tip on top of the delivery fee. Who is that delivery fee going to if you also are tipping the staff, I don't know. At 1am after a long haul flight I was too tired to read the receipt and notice the included mandatory gratuity, so I ended up adding a second 15% tip for the delivery staff. $26 for a Caesar salad, but at least one of us walked away happy after that transaction. To his credit the fellow who delivered it was very friendly. Overall, definitely recommend this hotel to others, but perhaps the management can look into addressing the multiple mandatory delivery charges on their room service.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed here 2-3 times a year for at least 5 years. Location is superb, but I noticed that the last couple of times - July and August 2009, standards are slipping. I am Platinum with Starwood and they are very good about upgrading to Suite/Concierge Floor, but there have recently been significant cutbacks in the Concierge lounge. It may be closed for breakfast and evening snacks during the week (as well as weekends) and when that occurs, restaurant vouchers are NOT provided. Also Front Desk Staff appeared to be stressed out on both occasions. I complained to the staff aboutthe Concierge lounge and much to their credit they agreed with me and encouraged me to fill out a comment card (which I did and did not receive any follow up). I tend to spend a lot of time working out of the room - last week I stayed at the nearby Sheraton Resort and Conference Center (see separate review) which had better Customer Service and a great lounge. If you are arriving late and leaving early and don't expect/use Concierge Lounge, it is a good choice - otherwise you could do better in 1 of the many nearby alternatives if you don't mind shuttle/taxi.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here last year and it was soooo convienet we both said that day we will be back next year. We take a holiday every year and found this stop over hotel jem. I don't think we will ever change to another stop over hotel. We paid $109 - a great steal. Check in was a breeze and we rec'd our luggage in 5 mins. These beds are the best in the world I swear!!! I didn't want to leave for my flight. When we stayed there we went to T3 to eat dinner and grab something to quickly eat in the morning(our flight left at 6 so nothing was open at 3:30 am in the hotel. The gateway to T3 is the best - don't have to go out into the weather and is tempurature controlled. The "train" from termina; to terminal was under construction but am planning on seeing the other terminals this year TIP: DO NOT move anything in the mini-bar/fridge it is sensored!! If you pick up something and put it back down it automatically gets put on your bill. We had $50 extra on the bill at check out OOPS. We explained and it was taken off the bill ( we put our early morning b-fast in the fridge and shoved everything over) any other questions feel free to e-mail me at snackwells24@hotmail.com</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked through the Starwood website and got a reasonnable rate for our 1 overnight stay at Sheraton Gateway Toronto after a late night flight back from Cuba. We asked and got a late checkout (we arrived at the hotel at 3AM). The room was well appointed with all the amenities. Good comfy queen beds and hide-a-bed. We were very statisfied with the room. HOWEVER, please be warned about the excessive prices at the on-site restaurant (if you are not on a gov. or business trip). Juices or coffee will set you back $5 ea. For our family of 4 we had to pay $35 plus taxes and gratuities for 4 juice and 3 coffee. That is in adition of the $16 2-eggs breakfast or the $16 pancakes (which we knew was expensive and very good but agreed to pay). Total bill: $101 (taxes and gratuity incl.). Part of it our fault. The menu were on the table when we arrived but we did not have time to read it (small print anyone?) before the server asked us and our children if we wanted juice or coffee. Thinking it was included (as a buffet) we said sure. Welcome back to America.......Ever heard of a recession? Because of that, we'll stay at an another hotel off-site which we stayed before our vacation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We've stayed here several times. Sometimes we leave our luggage while we travel elsewhere, sometimes we have our pets, sometimes we do park 'n fly, last time we arrived at 1:00 am with 2 cats and 250 lbs. of "stuff". Regardless of the time of day or night, to walk enclosed the short distance from Terminal 3, or the easy monorail from Terminal 1, no place is as convenient as the Gateway. Slipping under the soft sheets in the perfectly furnished room at any time of the day or night is pure satisfaction. Stay on the Club Floor for easy access to nibbles or any of the other equally accessible floors and you won't be disappointed. The newly renovated lobby is refreshing. Despite several visits we've never had the time to indulge in the other available services, ie workout room, spa, swimming pool. We do however eat in the bar or dining room which is always pleasurable. The staff is extremely helpful and accommodating. At times we've needed to use a freezer. Never a problem. When we travel with lots of stuff due to our disappearance for 6 months there is always an eager assistant to assist us getting the luggage to the terminal, an easy walk. There is no better place at Pearson.</p></li>

I was in the hotel restaurant yesterday morning when prior to an important meeting a button fell off my jacket. I went to the front desk to ask for help, not knowing what they could, or would do. Flavia advised that there was no repair or sewing service, but then said she would reattach the button herself. She took my jacket attached the button and returned it to me in the restaurant in a few minutes. What an excellent example of how to treat clients. I am a demanding client with high expectations, which, Flavia more than met. She was efficient, helpful, and friendly. True professionalism is rare, so I feel it is incumbent on me to acknowledge Flavia for the excellent service she provided. Flavia represents the Sheraton Gateway Hotel very well.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Watch out for price scam. I booked this hotel for my two senior parents to stay the night before their flight in Dec and to have parking included for $119.00. I booked it in Sept and I clearly asked if this was the Hotel at Terminal three where you get up and walk across the street to the terminal. I booked the reservation by phone and asked their exact address and clearly asked for the Sheraton at Terminal Three.The Sheraton hotel staff where I booked the reservation confirmed that this was case and encouraged me to book it as prices go up to $300+ in the next couple of weeks. When my parents arrived they informed them that they did not have a reservation there and that they never have rooms less than $300.00. Indicated that they must be booked at their other hotel on Dixon Rd with the shuttle. So either Sheraton Staff are lying to customers on the phone upon booking or they are lying when you get there to get more money. The hotel did not honor the price and charged my parents over $235. The only convenience I wanted was to have my parents not be transported and waiting for shuttle buses in the cold. My parents noted that they were not the only ones with this problem during check in.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We always stay at the Sheraton Gateway due to its location within Toronto AIrport which is simply unbeatable. We travel with young children so we usually do a stopover on our ultra long haul journey to Vancouver. I first stayed at the hotel when it first opened and it was great then. Now it is suffering from a demoralised staff - due to recent staff cuts and a tired looking hotel. We recently stayed there arriving off a 14 hour flight to find that one of our 2 rooms was not ready at 5pm which is 2 hours after our posted check-in time. We were given complimentary access to the club lounge which happened to be closed on the weekend. On the positive note, I did refer the issues to Sheraton through their automated survey and the GM did get back to me promptly and in a very positive manner. I was very pleased with this and hope to see her on our next stop. I look forward to discussing further with her so that all the travelers can benefit from any changes. My recommendation is driven by its location which is unbeatable by far. I would not recommend anyone to fight with luggage to go to an offisite airport hotel especially in the harsh winter. One more note is that the bed is VERY comfortable -pf</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I didn't have any particular expectations for our stay in this hotel -- we chose it mostly for it's location inside the airport as we were flying in from New York and spending a night in Toronto on the way to Hong Kong. We wanted the convenience of being right at the airport so we could have a leisurely time before departing. But I must say that our stay was made the moment we checked in. I think the name of the woman who checked us in was Cora. She was friendly and efficient and really made us feel at home, taking time to find the best room for us in our category. My partner and Cora started chatting -- he had some questions about ground transport. Cora gave us excellent instructions on getting into the city using the bus and subway -- and saved us at least $70 Canadian by doing so. She really made us feel at home in the hotel. We had a very pleasant stay. Breakfast was good. And we found the service to be excellent overall. Just small touches -- like the housekeepers saying a cheery hello when you pass them in the hallway. I wrote to the GM, Joumana Ghandour to tell him about our experience. And we immediately heard back. So it seems the attention to customer service comes right from the top.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Indeed, location is the clear strong point of this hotel: conveniently situated inside Terminal 3 of the aiport, you can reach the hotel lobby after landing without exiting the airport building and comfortably rolling your bag all along. As commented by other reviewers, services can definitely be improved: the front desk staff could have been more smiling and more helpful when arranging for car rentals and visits to downtown Toronto (you would say they were making you a favor by checking you in! ;-). The upgraded room we booked (club level) was well worthy of a 4-star hotel, with lots of space, although the look of it feels a little bit classic, especially the toilets. Unfortunately, the club itself was under repair and therefore not accessible to clients (no mention of it during the booking). The breakfast buffet was nice - warning: only continental breakfast was available at the time of our visit, but quite a big choice of items. One last positive comment: the management team reacted very quickly to our negative feedback and they sent a nice apology note; we hope some or all of the above items have improved by the time we visit again! In summary, an inexpensive 4-star hotel ideally located for a short stop in the city.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We picked this hotel because of convenience of getting there right from airport. That really IS great. But the rather unfriendly person at reception did not charm us from the beginning. however, the room was much worse than that - a bit dingy and stuffy, with carpet and even walls in need of cleaning. The very poor lighting helped to hide these shortcommings, but in bathroom the old, tacky looking tub did not drain properly, resulting standfing in dirty water while taking shower. There was no robes to use after shower, and while there was a tiny coffee maker, there was no tea to brew in the room. Perhaps these problems would be ok in some cheaper hotels, but this one tries to look like a more posh option - which clearly - it is not. We just returned from a trip to so cvalled "third world" country - and had better accomodation, and much nicer service than that. not to say- free internet - while this hotel asks for $16.95 fee to use internet, even if you want to check a single email. In all - if it was in a different location it would NOT be worthy even 1/2 of its cost. We often stayed in toronto in some cheaper hotels near airport, offering free shuttle. and they all were better than this one. So, if you can spend extra 20 minutes to take shuttle - save money and have nicer service somewhere else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel with my wife on Saturday March 7th before my early 6AM flight to St. Lucia. It was also the night of the time change difference. I booked the hotel in advanced using my CAA discount for a total of $125 + TAXES. Check-in was a breeze and even easier to checkout at 3AM. I booked by wake up call which arrived on time. The room was a king room and also included a large chair with reading lamp & table, large desk with jacks for power & Internet access {for a fee}. There was also a small fridge and coffee & tea maker and large LCD television which also shows the departure times of the flights. The room was quite spacious and comfortable for both of us and had all the amenities I was expecting with a Sheraton hotel. The hotel has a bar, pool, fitness centre & restaurant but since we had an early flight we didn't use any of them. We walked over the Airport and ate at Swiss Chalet. The hotel is connected to Terminal 3 via a covered walkway next to the main lobby so there is no need to venture outdoors. From the same covered walkway you gain access to the rail-tram to take you to terminal 1. My room was on the parking lot side of the Airport and the hotel is quite in the evening & night with no airport noise. I will definitely stay this hotel again because of the easy access to the airport.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I flew in from New York for one night in preparation for a long 15 hour flight back to Hong Kong, then Singapore. It was easy to find the hotel (a brisk 7-10 mins walk and skytrain) from Terminal 1 where I first landed, although some small confusion from the signs from the skytrain to the hotel (which is located in Terminal 3). Check-in was ultra efficient - but I found the front desk devoid of smiles, even a clinical cold feeling. I wish I felt more welcome. Rooms were okay, but you need to pull the day and night curtains fully to insulate the noise from the traffic and equipment from my room on the 7th floor. After that, it was very quiet. As there was nowhere else to get food, I ate at the hotel lobby's Grill restaurant. I had the soup of the day, and a salad as entree to "detox" before the 20 plus hours flight back. While the soup was delicious, unfortunately, the chef had a very heavy hand in salt and seasoning. Same for my greek salad. On top of the very salty greek cheese, there was salty olives. Thankfully, the walnut bread was delicious, but I could feel my temple throbbing and my heart pounding from the sodium-high. Even in New York, the salt wasn't that big a problem for me. Ack! Generally, a fantastic choice (okay, its the only choice connected to terminal 3, but its a good choice) for an airport hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you need to stay "near" the airport, then it doesn't get any better than this. The hotel is attached to Terminal #1, with the airport train conveniently below you can get to the other terminals quickly. The restaurant closes at 10:30pm, but the bar has a decent menu, and you can order off of it till midnight, or 1am, can't quite recall. Food was fairly good, with nothing we could complain about. Ok, one thing we could complain about: Price! I think a burger, bowl of soup, and a beer, added up to $46, or something like that. That was for each of us. It was almost $100 for the two of us. Rooms were fairly typical business hotel rooms. In spite of being at the airport, you don't hear the airplane traffic much. They seem to have insulated the outer wall and windows well. Unfortunately, I can't say they applied the same amount of sound deadening to the between-room walls. I could hear most of the noise the next door family was making. Other than that, the room was fine. There were a few carpet stains, and a few other signs that the rooms could use a reno, but nothing too serious. The bathroom was the same condition. It was fine. I've stayed at this hotel a few times before, and the experience is usually the same. They do a good job, but nothing that ever strikes me as world class. You shouldn't experience any huge issues here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Sheraton for the second time at the end of January, while travelling through Toronto and on to warmer climates. Its worth it to get a good night's sleep although the rooms are pricey. My main comment is that we had both great service and horrible service from the staff. I booked through booking.com, clearly indicating 4 people needing to stay in a room with 2 beds, and I also mentioned that need in a comment to the hotel. When we checked in the surly young female clerk did not greet us with a smile, a friendly attitude, or even professional courtesy. She looked right at our family of 4 and said "we have you in a king size bed." When I told her we had requested 2 doubles, and pulled out the comfirmation email I had printed, she said they had no record of that request, but she could check to see what was available. There did happen to be a double room available, but she was still completely graceless. I was very surprised at her attitude, I wasn't being loud or unpleasant to her and there was no reason to treat me like that, especially at a hotel of this calibre. On the other hand, the bartender at the lounge was very attentive and friendly. We went in with our newly 19 year old daughter to have a drink before going to bed, and when he ID'd her and discovered it was her birthday, he delivered her drink on the house.</p></li>

<li>When I told her we had requested 2 doubles, and pulled out the comfirmation email I had printed, she said they had no record of that request, but she could check to see what was available.</br></br></li>
<li>There did happen to be a <span style="background-color:#aaffc3" title="p=0.997">double</span> <span style="background-color:#aaffc3" title="p=0.997">room</span> available, but she was still completely graceless.</br></br></li>
<li>I was very surprised at her attitude, I wasn't being loud or unpleasant to her and there was no reason to treat me like that, especially at a hotel of this calibre.</br></br></li>
<li>On the other hand, the bartender at the lounge was very attentive and friendly.</br></br></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed in the Sheraton Gateway on 3 occasions, most recently in February 2011 before a trip South. We live 3 hours away from Toronto, and it's cheaper for us to drive to Toronto, stay in the Sheraton Gateway, and park for the week than it is to get connecting flights for the 3 of us. It also relieves a lot of stress about weather, as we can travel the day before and the day after at our own pace. We have never had a bad experience. The staff have always been great during the check-in process. Being able to check bags (of winter gear) was a huge relief, as we were a bit worried about leaving things in our trunkless car. The rooms are not huge, but big enough. We've had them provide a crib when our son was younger and that always fit easily enough. We have used room service, and it's the most reliable room service we've experienced - the food is fresh, hot, and good. The restaurant was quite kid-friendly, and it's nice that you can just take your child out to move around in the lobby while you're waiting for food, especially after a 3-4 hour drive. We have not used the pool. I cannot stress enough how easy it is to get up in the morning, get ready, and walk over to the airport without going outside in -20 degree weather. It's very quiet, considering it's at the airport. In the universe of a 3 year old boy, having a room that overlooks the train is quite exciting! We will be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived in Toronto from Dominican Republic just before 11 pm and had just over 8 hours before our flight to take us home to Calgary. Instead of staying in the airport, we decided to get a room at this hotel and were pleasantly surprised. It is connected to Terminal 3 at Pearson International, so it was an easy two minute walk to the hotel via elevator or escalator. The rate was reasonable at $157 plus taxes and we were given a nicely appointed room on the 4th floor. The bed was extremely comfortable with fresh, new linens. Our room was clean and comfortable, although a little warmer than we prefer & we couldn't adjust the thermostat. The toilet also dripped but I just closed the door to the bathroom to resolve that annoying sound. We didn't hear anyone in the rooms on either side of us, but did hear people chatting in the hallways. A newer 27 inch LCD television gave us something to watch and had digital HD channels. Set the digital alarm & also used the hotel wake up call service (which was provided on time). We noticed a lounge with sports on the televisions and it also provided pub food (we did not go there though). A 24 hour pool & fitness area are just behind the front desk and that is where the drink machines were located. Small gift shop on site, it was closed when we checked in. The room supplied two "to go" coffee cups & coffee, which we made in the morning before we checked out at 6:00 am. Overall, a great stay, worth the money & very convenient (especially if you're flying through terminal 3).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've had the pleasure of staying at this hotel over 15-20 times, and most recent, the past 3 weekends in a row, and felt the need to share this. This hotel has always been a favourite place to stay. The staff are fantastic, attentive, and very welcoming. The decor is somewhat dated, but they are making efforts as of late to improve the hotel. They recently completed a renovation of the gym and are currently working on the Club Lounge. My stay typically is on the 8th floor, (the Club Floor), and has always been delightful. The beds are comfortable, and the rooms are always clean. Any special requests I've made have always been fulfilled, and taken care of with speed. Cora & Claudette (I may have her name wrong) have been absolutely fantastic to deal with at the Front Desk - my request for a Airfield View has always been accomodated. Being this close to the airfield, you'd expect a lot more noise, however the hotel is very quiet, and the triple-pane windows do prevent a lot of noise from entering the room. The only downsides to this hotel are the following: 1) Parking Cost - NOT a direct cost that goes to the hotel, as the Airport Authority controls the parking. However, it really is annoying to have to pay for parking. 2) The restaurant is very pricy -- this is to be expected in an airport hotel, however. 3) ANY hotel that charges for internet today is crazy. This should be as much a staple as a coffee machine or shower products. Other than that, my stay has ALWAYS been fantastic, and I'd recommend this hotel to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This our fourth stay. Because our travel time is over 10 hours to Toronto the last thing we want to do is rent a car and drive into the city late at night. To walk out of baggage claim and into the hotel keeps the stress way down. Normally I rate the service and conditions as excellent. This trip was a little disappointing in that there seemed to be a number of small issues that, for the price of a king suite on the Club floor, should not have existed First is that the Club Lounge was 'closed for renovations' although there was no signs posted on the room nor were we notified by management when we made our reservations for that floor. At check-in the staff at the front desk did provide a coupon for a buffet breakfast the next morning (breakfast was to be included for people on the Club floor anyway) but we missed out on the evening wine and food that would have been provided if the room was open. Room Maintenance: The bath tub stopper did not seal and you could not take a bath. Luckily we always carry our own stopper for such occasions. Should not have happened considering the cost of the room. Room amenities: Interestingly enough the mini bar did not have any fruit juices nor did the mini bar charge sheet indicate there should have been any. Some people like drinks other then alcohol. (As commented in other posts, it is a quick walk back into the airport and orange juice was available at one of the fast food shops). Although we had advised the management by email of our arrival plans and requirements, there was only one bathrobe in the room and we had to call for another.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Upon arriving in Toronto, I found it odd that the signs directing travellers to the Sheraton were ubiquitous on the departures floor and not arrivals. I waundered aimlessly on arrivals trying to find the entrance to the hotel. It was nearing midnight when I arrived at reception and to my dismay, all check-in agents were working at the main desk. The preferred guest check-in did not have a clerk present. There was no sign indicating to me or another business traveller that the counter was closed , so we stood there for some time. We finally gave up and stood in the queue with other travellers. Not a great start. However, main desk check-in was plesant, suite request was honored and a briefing of what services were available this late hour (including the 24 hrs gym). I elected to return to the airport after dropping off my belongings to get something to eat, as the room service menu offered heavy (burgers et al) or otherwise pricy items for midnight eating. The bed was comfortable though the duvet was too hot for me, the airport view was impressive and the higher floors did not have to deal with the new tram shuttling between terminals sliding by the window. The hotel is quiet compared to other airport hotels (showers, neighbours conversing and doors slamming in preparation for early morning flights). The bathroom was spotless and well maintained, though I choose to use my own amenties vs the Sheraton brand. I'd stay here again in the event of a late night arrival or early morning flight. Overall, it's a terrific airport hotel, other than the inattention to business check-in.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for 1 night with my wife the night before a flight. We chose to stay here because they had the airport parking deal (get a weeks free parking with 1 night stay), we thought it was convenient, and we hoped to be able to see the runway from the rooms. It was definitely convenient, we never had to go outside to get back and forth to the airport proper (it's connected via tunnel to Terminal 3), but tha was probably the best part about our stay. I was hoping that since the parking was at the airport, that I would be parking my car in one of the covered parking garages (since we were flying in December, and I didn't want to come back to find my car covered in snow). Unfortunately, the hotel parking is at the very top of the parking structure, leaving your car open to the elements. This wasn't a big deal though, since it would've been the same at most other hotels. One of the other reasons we decided to stay here was to get a view of the runway and the planes taking off and landing. We did have a 'runway' view room, but all you really see is the taxi area, with the landing strip off in the distance, and at night, you can't even see that. Overall, the hotel itself wasn't bad, it was up to Sheraton's usual standards (although most other Starwood brand hotels I've been to don't charge for printing in the business lounge), but for (significantly) less money, you can stay at the Westin Bristol Place a few blocks away, which I think is generally a nicer hotel, and you can actually see the planes in the air. I wouldn't recommend this hotel simply because you can get better for less, but there's nothing wrong with this hotel too.</p></li>

<li>Unfortunately, the hotel parking is at the very top of the parking structure, leaving your car open to the elements.</br></br></li>
<li>This wasn't a big deal though, since it would've been the same at most other hotels.</br></br></li>
<li>One of the other reasons we decided to stay here was to get a view of the runway and the planes taking off and landing.</br></br></li>
<li>We did have a 'runway' view room, but all you really see is the taxi area, with the landing strip off in the distance, and at night, you can't even see that.</br></br></li>
<li>Overall, the hotel itself wasn't bad, it was up to Sheraton's usual standards (although most other Starwood brand hotels I've been to don't charge for printing in the business lounge), but for (significantly) less money, you can stay at the Westin Bristol Place a few blocks away, which I think is generally a nicer hotel, and you can actually see the planes in the air.</br></br></li>
<li>I wouldn't recommend this hotel simply because you can get better for less, but there's nothing wrong with this hotel too.</br></br></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Clean, average facilities, conveniently attached to Pearson - poor customer service”</li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Checked in around 1am on a Sunday morning (middle of return flight from Cuba to Ottawa). Front desk staff was slow, and apparently unable to smile. Was eventually given a swipe key and room number. Unfortunately upon arriving at said room and opening the door it became apparent that the room was NOT vacant (nightlatch was on, so I only woke up the occupant(s) rather than barge into his room while he (they) were asleep). Trip back to the front desk where after explaining to the other clerk what happened I was given another room key. Club level, nice - was not told if it was an upgrade or simply the result of other floors being full. New room was very comfortable, clean, large flatscreen TV, nice leather club chair, desk and desk, etc... Looked recently redone. Facing parking garage with the odd horn/car alarm but managed to tune it out. Next morning I'm greeted by a "zero-balance" folio slipped under the door @ $70 too high. Charming - so much for rapid check-out. But A+ for consistency at the front desk where smiles are apparently not allowed. At least they managed to change the room charge to the rate confirmed throught the travel agency reservation (and quickly make sure the original folio was moved out of my reach). In short, it's convenient if you're short on time between flights, don't feel like facing snow just yet on your way back from somewhere warm, you wil probaby enjoy the room but double check everything on the way out. Keep your expectations low and you maybe be delighted. P.S. to give credit where credit is due, the housekeeping lady I met while leaving my room in the morning was very cheerful, friendly and polite, she could teach a thing or three to the front desk staff.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Excellent Location for long layovers”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had to find a hotel for 1 night due to an overnight layover. Since I didn't really care for location (other than it had to have an airport shuttle), I booked with Hotwire. For slightly over $50US, I got this hotel. For the good: You couldn't ask for a better location because is it connected directly to the airport. The rooms were fairly big, with modern furniture. I requested an airport runway view, and they were able to accommodate me. The rooms were fairly quiet, despite having planes land and takeoff. The lobby had a relaxing feel to it. The beds were fairly comfortable, but you could hear the springs. For the bad: I didn't like that I had to pay for the Internet from my room. There was no wireless connection, only a wired connection, at a fee per hour (and maybe per day). I think you can use the Internet for free in the lobby, but I wasn't interested in sitting with people. I had just come from a long flight and just wanted to be in comfortable clothes. I would think that if the hotel can put wired connection in EVERY room, they are obviously more interested in making money with it than putting less expensive wireless connection on every floor (unless it interferes with airport communication somehow; which then you would ask why there is one available in the lobby?). The rooms were clean, but I did notice dust where the carpet meets the walls, especially on top of the baseboards. Not a big deal for me, but might be important for some. I also noticed an odd odor coming from the bathroom. It reminded me a lot like the bathrooms in my local hospital. The smell might be coming from the water. I didn't use any of the hotel's amenities, so I can't comment on those. I had pizza delivered.</p></li>
