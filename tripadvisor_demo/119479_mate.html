<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place is so Hollywood. It really spoke to me. It was great to see how they took this old Cali-style motor-motel and created a hip, boutique lodge. The location was great, close to the Sunset strip and downtown. Not high on frills but big on style.</p></li>

The atmosphere is a little hoe-dunk but the hotel is clean and safe and like I said PERFECT location and that is what really matters. The staff is very professional and friendly and willing to answer any questions you may have. The wake-up call is a bit comical too....Cock-a-Doodle Doo this is your wake up call!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a conference downtown -- the Farmer's Daughter was so well priced and a great location. Just 20 mins from the convention center. and you're right across the street from The Grove and Farmer's Market. It's unbelievable to find a great hotel that's in walking distance to anything in LA. The rooms are comfy, with great beds and towels. The front desk folks are VERY helpful and nice. All in all, a wonderful stay. I would definitely stay there again!</p></li>

The rooms are clean, the staff is friendly, the hotel is located right across from the Farmer's Market and the Grove. Sunset Blvd and other great places to eat are close by. The staff was helpful and friendly. Never had difficulty parking, except it is a $17 fee per day for valet, which is the only option if you have a car. The overall price of the hotel is hard to beat in this area. Would definitely stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I stayed at the Farmer's Daughter last December for 10 nights. The hotel is in a great location, clean, funky and inviting. The staff were nothing but helpful; when we decided to extend our stay they advised us to book the additional 5 nights online as it would be cheaper. My only moan is the cost of valet parking but I acknowledge this is part of LA culture and it could be far higher. We will certainly stay at the Farmer's Daughter again.

No bar, lounge, decent restaurant, limited parking..would recommend staying closer to downtown in upscale hotel for this money!! No frequent flyer miles...nothing!!!

The location is stellar. It is right across the street from the Farmer's Market. For us this meant unlimited choices of wonderful ethnic food at great prices. It is also across the street from CBS and The Grove. We had a wonderful time. The staff was friendly, the valet parking very reasonable. The restaurant also served good coffee and food. We plan to stay here again when we visit California next year.</p></li>

If there is a criticism, it is that the bathrooms could be updated a wee bit, but they are very satisfactory and functional. Both food and service in the restaurant was very good and we particularly enjoyed eating on the patio.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Farmer's Daughter is a nice motel/hotel with a restaurant and valet parking. The rooms are a good size and very comfortable. The only negative thing about it was their paper thin walls. At first our room was right by the ice machine and vending machines. I asked to be moved to a more quiet room. They were very accommodating and moved us to the very end of the complex. The only problem was we could still hear the traffic on Fairfax plus we heard almost every word our next door neighbors said.

We stayed there to be near our daughter. We arrived mid morning after a tedious flight from China. Our rooms were not ready and under no circustances would the staff help us out. I have been the world over and never were staff as rude and unhelpful as this. The woman at the desk was robotic in repeating when check in time was. There were empty rooms but no go.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Farmer's Daughter on 4/21 and 4/22. I booked online and the room I got was exactly as described. The location is great - right across from the Farmers Market. The staff was courteous and helpful, valet was convenient and my breakfast at their restaurant (Tart) was delicious. If you like generic hotels with plush carpet, this is not the place for you. But if you want a good value, Farmer's Daughter is clean, conveniently located and imaginative. Loved the "rain" showerhead and the mini-fridge (you can shop at the Farmers Market and keep your food costs down!). Loved it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I personally loved the Farmer's Daughter Hotel. Amazingly helpful and friendly staff - even after having an issue with 2 hotel keys - they were quick to replace them and got us right into the room. The room was pretty large and clean, nice design without "down on the farm". Didn't really care for the view of the parking lot via the only window in the room, but we weren't staying here to gaze out the window. The location was perfect too - close to WeHo hot spots, and right across the street from the Grove shopping area and farmer's market (must visit!). I would certainly stay here again!</p></li>

As one could guess the place has a farm theme which could be tired but to me it's a winner. My favorite room was the "Don't tell" suite which comes with a wet bar and mirrored ceilings! The televisions in the hotel are small, the bathrooms are small and the pool is small. I guess it's all about the decor and the location right across from the farmers market and the Grovve that make this place worth it. On the F & B side I can say that the restaurant, "Tart" was nice for breakfast.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great place!!!!! We had an excellent stay at Farmers Daughter Hotel. The staff is wonderful and the service is unbeatable. You've got to try their quaint little restaurant called Tart, not only were there local people eating there but we were able to do some star gazing at the same time, it was great!! The rooms are like none other we've experienced in our travels. They have that awesome country theme that made us feel at home, from the comfortable beds to the flat screen tv's to the down home hospitality you definately get your money's worth. Don't miss this one when travelling to Los angeles!</p></li>

Easy and convenient to get to the Farmers Daughter is a perfect spot for traversing Los Angeles. The rooms are really clean and well done, nothing fancy but they are perfectly appoiinted. The restaurant downstairs is really good and well priced and the staff goes out of their way to accommodate you. Really great folks. They saved us a paper in the morning too. The additional charge for parking is fair and the car is always easily available. We actually like it better each time we visit!</p></li>

It also had some cool blue lighting around the ceiling area, a mirror on the ceiling and headboard and a nice little wet bar and fridge. The room was very clean and the location couldnt be better for us with east access to the Farmer's Market, West Hollywood and many other LA attractions.

I chose it for convenience as I was attending a taping of the Late Late Show and the CBS studio is directly across the street. The Farmers Market is in walking distance as well - so nice to ditch the car. Valet costs were somewhere between 18 and 20 a night (I think it was 18). No choice to park yourself but that fee isn't bad for LA from what I have seen. Clean, roomy accommodations with comfortable bed.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at Farmer's Daughter because of the location and proximity to our daughter who lives nearby. We were well pleased with the location, and proximity to the Farmer's Market, which is a jewel to be experienced in L.A. Hotel was clean, simple, well managed. The location was awesome. Nothing fancy, but adequate. The attached restaurant had excellent breakfast, in fact, the food was better than at "Toast", out daughter's favorite breakfast place. The draperies need to be thicker, to block out the "city lights"... our room faced a giant billboard that was very bright. Otherwise, we were well pleased with this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staff were very helpful and the location of the hotel right across the road from the Farmer's Market is unbeatable. Great Public Transport connections (yes, Public Transport in LA - $1.25 for a bus ride is brilliant!), and any number of attractions within easy walking distance (LACMA, Peterson Museum). Great shopping if you are that way inclined - Melrose, Beverley Centre, Rodeo - all easily accessible. Staff were brilliant and the rooms are quaint and very well serviced. The restaurant attached would be the only area for improvement, but not too sure if this associated anyway...This will be my place to stay in LA!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Let me start off saying that they did a great job refurbishing this motel. Funky design ideas inside and out. Borderline affordable, with great service. Stayed in the "No Tell" room - for it's funky and kinky, yes, kinky too! design. Wheat field murals on the wall and mirror on the ceiling over the bed, eh! The location is just as fantastic close to the Farmers market (a must see, must try!) and the Grove. The CBS studios are right across - this little extra together with all else will give you the absolute Hollywood feel :) The most fun hotel I've ever stayed at. If I ever go back to LA I wouldn't stay anywhere else!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a great find! The Farmers Daughter was recommended to us by a friend (an LA local), and being so close to the Farmers Market and The Grove and not far from W Hollywood we thought we'd stay the night there. We were pleasantly surprised by the wonderful service at the front desk and by the large size and funky decor of the rooms. Even though it has a slight 'motel' look to it, it is really more like a hotel. I can also recommend the Thai restaurant just a block down the road, if you don't feel like venturing too far away from the hotel - amazing food and well priced. All in all, love this hotel and would definitely stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I truly enjoyed my stay at the Farmer's Daughter! The hotel was cute and quaint. My room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel staff was incredibly friendly and they had Chocolate Chip cookies ready for you to grab on your way to your room! The owners of this renovated hotel have thought of every detail. The location across from The Grove can't be beat if you are in town for business, to visit the CBS studios or to do a little shopping. Tart, the restaurant that is attached to the hotel is very yummy and has a great offering of both small bites, dinner options and of course my favorite...the wine list! Stay here, you won't regret it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Myself and my husband stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. We liked how clean it was. It did not have that awful smell like carpeted hotel rooms. We were a little leary about staying here, as we heard the area was not the best. We found it to be great, we loved being right across the street from CBS (as we went to TPIR) we also loved the farmers market we had breakfast there two mornings it was fine, and i loved The Grove it was so pretty and decorated nice for Easter. The staff were fine, not the friendliest i've ever encountered but we didn't have any problems so there really was no need for us to have any contact with them. We would definitely go back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros: Loved being across the street from the Farmers Market, near museums and good restaurants, at a central starting point for anywhere else you need to go. Good to have car on site if you need to access it. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Loved having breakfast at Tart in the morning--good food and a space you'd go out of your way to get to, but it's right downstairs. Cons: While we liked the funky decor, the rooms were a bit austere and somewhat dark. We didn't hear noise from other rooms, but we definitely heard noise from the hallway--the bare, open spaces really echo. These wouldn't prevent us from returning but it did prevent me giving it a 5-star rating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are going to LA to shop and to eat at the best restaurants---this is the place for you. It is very close to some of the trendiest spots in LA. The motel decor is rustic yet modern ---I thought it was very hip. The rooms were super clean---the shower was awesome and the soaps and lotions were great. In our experience, the people who work there were super nicer and really helpful. Truth is---as far as price goes---we paid $129 a night---it was really a steal for LA. I've stayed in many places in LA (chain hotels included) that were not nearly as cute and clean and centrally located and I paid quite a bit more. For this price and location---I'd go back in a snap.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a nice little hotel at a good location, although it seems a little beaten up from outside, butI guess that's the look they want to give. It's a completely different story inside, the rooms are huge, beds are comfortable and most important is the friendly staff. They were very nice and accommodating to all our requests and questions, even the manager was very helpful. The hotel is located within 10 minutes of driving distance to Hollywood Walk of Fame and Beverly Hills, the parking costs $18 but I think that's the best option in LA. The breakfast is good and reasonably priced. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for it's quality as it gives you your dollar's worth.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was in LA for 6 days on business and chose the FD because of location and price. The price I ended up paying was over 20% higher than that on the email reservation confirmation I had received. On checking in I had signed (without reading properly after an 18 hours transatlantic journey) an agreement to pay a higher rate than quoted. I feel this was an incredibly devious and underhand tactic by the hotel and all guests signing in should be aware of this, I was not the only one that had been conned in this way. The hotel itself is quite basic, rooms have basic furnishing, no drawers. The pool is more like a plunge pool, and the bar and restaurant are not open on a Sunday evening.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was a little pricey even for April but I loved the fact that we could walk to Farmers' Market and American Girl Place. I stayed here with my 4 yr. old daughter. We ate breakfast here instead of taking the bus to some famous pancake place. I was sure glad we did the chocolate chip pancakes, smoked applewood bacon, cheesy grits and fresh squeezed orange juice were delectable! The staff let me keep my car on their lot for the day eve though we had to check out by 11 am. I will say that their website makes their hotel look much nicer than it really is. I can't really complain though. We had a clean room. a pool to swim in, great food and it was walking distance to our destination.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The basic theme of the hotel is a farm and the rooms are supposed to be barn themed with cute curtains etc. The truth of the matter is that the rooms are basic, poorly furnished with basic wooden chairs and a very uncomfortable bed. The general room cleanliness is average but I did notice some left over hairs on the bathroom floor! The rooms are equipped with an LCD flatscreen TV and basic cable, wireless or wired Internet, a coffee machine, small fridge and an iron. That's about it, the bathroom is very basic and the shower is of the old fixed head type so pretty unremarkable. In general this is an obvious attempt to charge boutique hotel rates for nothing more than basic motel standards.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We searched and searched among the cheaper places to stay in the LA / Santa Monica area and finally chose the Farmers Daughter - we were SO pleased when we got there. The staff were really friendly, the hotel looked like something straight out of a design magazine and our room was spacious, well equipped and very clean. Within walking distance are many shops, the Grove outdoor mall (which includes a nice cinema) and the Farmers Market, where you can get the best fresh food around. Within 10 minutes in the car, you can easily be in Beverly Hills / Hollywood tourist areas. Universal Studios are about 20 minutes away by car. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend this hotel.</p></li>

This charming hotel is in the perfect location making travel to West Hollywood and Beverly Hills easily accesible. The decor is cute, but most importantly this hotel is trendy, new, fresh and modern. There's no need to withstand the snootiness of "upscale" hotels when the Farmer's Daughter has every ammenity you could ask for without the attitude. Making the location even more ideal, right across the street is the Grove and Farmer's Market loaded with shopping and restaurants. Museums are in walking distance. The staff is helpful in making recommendations, and you receive a map upon check-in. I will not stay anywhere else when in LA!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a good location if you want to be close to CBS studios. Farmers Market is across the street. And I guess it is in a central location to other area attractions. However, it should be a lot nicer for the price, you shouldn't have to pay that much for location. It should have been half the cost. The hotel clerks did hold our bags while we toured the city, due to the fact that we knew we didn't want to stay there again. The worst part was the awful advice we were given from hotel staff. They advised us to go to Venice Beach next and stay there, that was ghetto for us. But that is another review. If you are willing to pay $250, then find something on sunset or pay a little more for something nicer.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Farmer's Daughter is a motel in a good location. The service we received was rude. We prepaid a month in advance for adjoining rooms so that our young kids could sleep in one room and the grownups could sleep next door with a door joining the two rooms. We called the morning we arrived to ask about the rooms and were assured all would be ready when we arrived. When we arrived they told us they no longer had adjoining rooms. They were not apologetic, would not show us what rooms they did have available, would not help us to find another hotel, and were generally condescending and rude. We have travelled frequently in the US and abroad for the last 15 years and this is the worst hotel staff experience we have ever had.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in this hotel with my 3 daughters (aged 16, 13 & 9) at the end of a 3 week trip to the US. I found the staff very helpful, rooms really clean and exactly as described on the website. The location is excellent (right across the road from the Farmers Market and The Grove shopping centre), although the traffic was a little loud at night so next time I would ask for a room further away from Fairfax Ave. My girls really enjoyed the complimentary homemade lemonade and cookies in the foyer. The hotel has a trendy, laid back vibe thats fits in perfectly with the location. I will definatley be coming back again and would reccomend it to family and friends. so much more enjoyable than the larger "chain" hotels in the area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First note: PARKING IS NO LONGER FREE. They charge $7.70 a day to park, and you have to hand your car over to a greasy valet every time you arrive. Positives: The hotel is quaint and located well, across the street from the Farmer's Market and Grove entertainment/shopping center, as well as two miles from either Hollywood or Beverly Hills. Right across from The Price is Right if you want to do that. High-speed Internet access, DVD player, coffee maker and fridge. Hot showers with good water pressure. Decent price. Negatives: Rooms are small. Bathroom is tiny. TV is so small that you won't want to watch DVDs on it. Wood floors are dirty and cold. Walls are thin. A few ants in bathroom. The parking fee and required valet. It is definitely a glorified motel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Love this place, have been staying there for years and its both comfortable (have had the best nights sleep there - as the beds are firm and very clean) un pretencious and relaxed but the service of a 5 star place. There is only one downside....if you have a room near the smoking area, you do get the smell a little bit (but not really an issue). The restaurant is great, wondeful breakfast and you have the benefit of a fridge in your room to by things locally to snack on. Staff really friendly, good location with loads of places to visit in the surrounding area and above all the only place I have found, that you can label 'value for money' - they do great deals including valet and breakky online and no hidden cost. A def 100% return for me. - oh and there is free wi-fi!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">While our stay here was very good due to an excellent location and warm, attentive staff, the hotel has started a new policy that I found annoying. Valet parking is now the only option for your car ($7.70 charge). I was not expecting this as I found no information on the web regarding a parking fee nor was I told of this policy when I spoke to them prior to making a reservation. I had to unload my car in the driveway, hand my keys over to the valet, haul my suitcase and miscellaneous items across the courtyard only to later find my car parked in front of my room and me without a key for access. I was told that the valet parking is required by the city of Los Angeles as they are in the process of opening a restaurant. Other than this inconvenience, our stay here was very comfortable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I stayed at this hotel last January , and we were very pleased with it. It is not a luxury hotel, but it is very clean, modern and cute. The room was a nice size, and well-maintained. We had breakfast at their restaurant once, and it was very good. There is even a small pool for the warm days! But the best thing about this hotel is its location: it is right in front of the Farmers Market/The Grove shopping complex. You can find a wide variety of food, for every pocket and taste, and The Grove shopping area is very pleasant and upscale. For our family, it was perfect. Our 8-year-old daughter loved it! The only downside is that they charge you US$ 17.00 for valet service (daily), but this is LA...If you are looking for charm and location, you won't regret it - this a sure bet.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Farmer's Daughter for a week. I chose this motel/hotel for the location...close to all the places I had to get to. The rooms were very cosy and homey...loved the feeling. But I had serious problems with the noise the flushing toilets made, especially when the room above you is flushing at 3 in the morning. The toilets are the industrial type you'd find in an office building or commercial industrial site. My first night was interrupted by the arguing in the next room over along with the flushing noise. Would I stay again? I don't know. Money spent here was the same as if I were paying a three star hotel but paying for a motel atmosphere. Pluses....room had refrigarator, safe, and wood floors. But needs to provide free internet connections, not pay the 9.95 a day for the service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at The Farmer's Daughter for four nights while visiting our son who is completing a senior year internship in L.A. What a pleasant surprise! Besides having a great location (just across the street from the Farmer's Market and The Grove), the hotel has a wonderful rustic theme that welcomes you the moment you walk in the door. Decorated in "barnyard chic", the rooms have simulated barn plank floors, sink faucets that recreate farm pumps, distressed wood furniture, and whimsical barnyard wallpaper and decorations. The room was clean, the staff was helpful and the price is so reasonable. Once the on-site restaurant is finished by the end of the year, the Farmer's Daughter will have everything for a comprehensive hotel experience. We look forward to returning the next time we are in Los Angeles.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed February 25-27, 2007 and paid $136. This hotel has a great theme: gigham, denim, the country life. The rooms were clean and comfortable. I was amazed at the space in the room, very generous and the beds were reasonably comfortable. The four cup coffee maker helped during our TPIR sleep over. The staff was friendly and helpful, especially Ted, because he gave us some pointers in an entertaining way. They only offer valet, but it's L.A. and you have to pay to park anywhere. The location can't be beat next to TPIR and the Farmer's Market and a short drive to Hollywood. Tart served a well portioned and reasonably priced breakfast. On TPIR taping days, they offer a breakfast sandwich and beverage for $6. They are designed to go with you while you wait in line. If I'm ever in that part of L.A. again, then I will definitely be back.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Wife and I spent 3 nights in magnificent LA in late May this year. The Farmers Daughter is absolutely perfect for any stay in LA. For a small fee, we were able to park and retreive our car at anytime, the blokes running the Valet were always friendly. The room is a classic in its styling, and very comfortable. The front desk staff were always really friendly. Jonah was a real help with our luggage, storing it for us on our last day, as we had a late night flight home to Sydney. He also dug my new Fender Tele Deluxe that I'd just bought up on Sunset so, good onya Jonah. Its in a great spot, the Daughter, close to Hollywood, Sunset, Melrose and the Farmers Market has heaps of shops. And we also discovered the legendary Canters Deli up the street. We loved it there for breakfast each morning. All I can say is - DO IT AT THE DAUGHTER!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I choose this hotel for it's location, and it really was fabulous - just across the road from the brilliant Farmer's Market and a comfortable walk to Melrose Ave's great shops. The hotel itself was also nice - I loved the farm-kitch decor; my roon was clean, comfortable and large (even tho I booked a single!); I had no problems with noise (I was there mid-week in April tho - there might be more noise on warm weekend nights); there was free internet in the lobby, I was charged fairly for my phone calls (I think this is the only hotel I stayed at in the US which didn't charge me for making toll-free calls), and the staff were friendly and efficient (I didn't ask them for anything difficult or unsual tho). I paid 196AUD/night (including tax) thru Expedia, I think that is fair, but I haven't stayed at any other LA hotels so I can't say whether this hotel is good value for LA.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We really liked this hotel. Its and older motel that has been converted to a more funky and cool hotel and it works. The staff are superb, from the mandatory valet parking (18+taxes a day) guys to the reception and the other staff everyone was friendly and helpful, but what really makes this hotel is the location. Being across the road from the Farmers market is a boon and you can eat here for breakfast and dinner with no problem for great value for money. The rooms are not massive and the elevator is small when using the bell hops cart, but the place is clean and the beds are comfy. The only downside was the other guests on a sat night who seem to think that talking loudly on their phones at 2am in the hall was not a problem, but thats not the hotel's fault. All in all a nice hotel in an expensive city that actually looks and feels nice to be in as well as being different.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Read the positive review in the weekend Australian and as we were not going to have a car this time, we wanted to be somewhere we could walk around easily and in LA that is asking something. This quirky hotel (still laid out like a motel) has been fixed up in quaint farmers style (and is opposite the famous Farmers Markets). The bed is very comfortable - the bathroom fine, the air conditioning works well (though a little loud) and the view of the Hollywood sign was fabulous. The wireless internet is free and the bar has a happy hour worth attending. The rates are reasonable (what is unreasonable are the taxes in LA which are plus, plus and plus). Easy to walk around in the area,close to the LACMA and the tar pits and to Melrose and the quirky shops and the buses are frequent as well if you get tired. Loads of great food in the area, at the Farmers market and close by (eg Canters Deli).</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is heavy on kitsch but light on clean. There was no soap in the room (which still had leftover open toiletries from the last guest), and when we asked for some, housekeeping told me they didn't have any. The soap finally appeared about three hours later. But housekeeping didn't appear at all the next day, so the towels, bed, and trash were never removed or replaced. A call to the front desk got us an apology, but no clean towels. There were other annoyances to the room as well: no drawers to put your clothes, so we were forced to live out of our suitcase (ok for me, but not my wife), and the only way to turn on the bedside lights was to go to a switch at the front door. The hotel's location is great for anyone not wanting to drive all the time. It's across from the Farmer's Market and the Grove shopping district, so you can easily eat and see a movie without getting into your car.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Farmer's Daughter for the weekend a few weeks ago in one of their lowest priced rooms. It was very nice. The hotel has a cute theme going on and the location could not be more convenient! We walked over to the Farmer's Market and Grove several times for food and drinks and it was so easy - it made me want to move in! The one drawback was that we had some serious traffic noise in the early morning, and we were on the alley side of the hotel. But that allowed me to get up early and stroll the Grove before the stores opened. By the way, we ate at Loteria Grill at the Farmer's Market for lunch and it was fantastic! Also, check out the Whole Foods across Third - it is one of the most amazing grocery stores I have ever seen. They even have a breakfast bar with eggs, cereal, fruit and the like! They have a million kinds of prepared foods that would make a great picnic or to go meal. Have fun at he Farmer's Daughter and enjoy LA!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife had our honeymoon in the US and stayed in Las Vegas (Venetian and Bellagio), Hawaii (Outrigger on the Beach) and LA where we stayed at the Farmers Daughter. It may sound a little strange, but this was our favorite hotel. It was friendly, comfortable and in a great location. Of course the hotel didnt have the luxuries the other hotels we stayed in had, however we picked this hotel as it was recommended by a friend. what made the hotel good for us were little things such as: - we didnt have to take an elevator to our room - it took only one minute to get from the room to the street - the free internet (after paying $15/30mins in vegas) - the personal service that only comes wth a smaller hotel - the choice of restaurants within 500m of the hotel, not sure how many there are but there would be 10+ - great locaton The hotel wasnt overly romantic for our honeymoon, but if you are after a comfortable place to stay I recommend this hotel</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I (late 20's, early 30's) totally enjoyed our stay at The Farmer's Daughter! This hotel is not your normal high rise, it only has 3 stories and it's definitely far away from the hotel chain standard. It's quaint decor is shabby chic and if you're looking for luxury, you won't find it here, however if you're looking for a FANTASTIC location, AWESOME service, and ADORABLE style then The Farmer's Daughter will be just as perfect for you as it was for us! The staff is super helpful with printing maps, making reservations...etc and will be more than able to answer any of your traveling questions! The rooms were fairly quiet and we enjoyed the renovated motel to hotel. I will most certainly stay here again and recommend this to anyone who is a Price Is Right hopeful or looking to lots of shopping/eating at The Grove! My husband and I were able to do everything on our list from this great location and we look forward to our next stay here!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I liked the Farmers Daughter... Nicely designed reception with young, helpful staff and lots of quirky, colourful touches. Tart restaurant is very nice (although service could be a bit erratic) - great place to start the day with breakfast. Pool is small but big enough for a quick dip and really nicely presented. Our room was pretty spacious (deluxe king) with nice touches like cool magazines and restaurant guides, and great toiletries. Not luxurious, but nicely decorated and again slightly quirky and fun. Bathroom is a pretty unreconstructed motel bathroom but it's clean and functional. Location was good - opposite the Grove mall and Farmers Market food mall, and only c.15 mins drive to Hollywood and c.30mins drive to Santa Monica. I thought price was pretty reasonable (best if you can get a deal with parking and breakfast included). You might be disappointed if you're looking for somewhere uber swanky and bling, but if you want somewhere friendly and stylish, I'd give it a go.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This used to be my favorite hotel in LA. So off-beat, so well located, so friendly. So it's really a tarted-up motel, so what? It's still great. That was my attitude. You have to wonder where they went wrong. We tried to check in on a Sunday night. I know, that's when the least capable manager is on duty but this one takes the cake. Icily "polite" she still managed to convey in no uncertain terms that my wife's request for an extra bed was not only not going to be met, it amounted to an insult to everyone in the hotel, and it showed how unbelievably stupid we were to even request it. It was unnerving. Things did get better when the day-shift crew came in and the usual shiny, happy attitude returned, but by then the damage was done. By then the once charming hotel was exposed as an over-priced, over-hyped motel on Fairfax. At least "Tart" the attached restaurant is as good as ever. Isn't it terrible what a single person with a bad attitude can do to your reputation? Avoid if possible.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room was very cute and quite clean. Great location. Having to pay a valet to park your car around the back is a little cheeky, but I suppose nessecary because the hotel and restaurant parking are shared and the restaurant gets quite busy. Also, having to pay for internet is a bit crap as well as most places include this free. The big problem with this place was that the one day of my trip I could sleep in, I well... couldn't. We stayed in the back on the ground level and from very early in the morning there was the constant honking of car horns. At first I couldn't figure out what it was, but I realised the valet was too lazy to identify the car to collect in a way other than pushing the button to lock the car and seeing which one honks. He did this all morning from quite early, he didn't stop after I called the front desk to complain, and he didn't stop when I confronted him. That was one of the worst stays I've had, especially from a place that I had expected to be fabulous. I would never stay here again, nor would I recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My first stay last year was great, the rooms where clean and the staff was very friendly. My girlfriend and I returned again this year looking forward to another great stay, but this time around many things changed for the worst. An unexpected addition was the valet parking, which was ok but many times where not present to greet us, on one occasion I ended up parking the car myself. During our first night the front desk was somewhat clueless about the area, for ex. he did not know the name of the restaurants or movie theater across the street and was not very outgoing on trying to find out. The second day was worse, the bed was not made and toilet was leaking, and after complaining to the front desk, their only response was "the cleaning staff is gone", that's it no apology, and when I asked for one, it was given to me with a really nasty attitude. After complaining to the management about these problems, they where kind enough to discount our stay. I do like the Farmer's Daughter, but unless that unpleasant staff goes, I'm not sure that I will return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband, young son and I stayed here for two nights. I chose the hotel based on a friend's recommendation of the attached restaurant (Tart) and the close location to the Farmer's Market and Grove shopping center. I left feeling stunned by all of the glowing reviews I read about this motel before our trip. The farm theme is a good one, and they could have done something much better with it - the rooms are basic motel rooms. Our room was on the second floor overlooking the parking lot. It had a couple quirky paintings of farm animals on the walls, but other than that there were no special touches to the decor. There is no room service, even though they have a nice restaurant right downstairs (if there is room service, they don't have any information on how to access it from the room). The staff was nothing special, and they didn't even bother to ask how our stay was when we checked out. They charge $4 per hour for WiFi, which is just ridiculous. We will not stay here again - though the location was great, it was way overpriced for such a basic motel room.</p></li>

I agree with previous postings about the location being excellent, (I couldn't agree more), as well as the noise levels from the street and slamming doors being something I could do without. (But what do you do?) My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights and by the first night we were ready to leave. We received an extremely disturbing phone call from within the motel, (caller unknown), and felt like we were in the 'wrong place.' It could have been a freak phone call, or it could be that "Farmer's Daughter" is a code name for something I wasn't aware of when i made the reservations. All I can say is that for the next two nights I slept with one eye open! After the phone call incident it seemed like everything felt weird, and took on a different vibe. It could be that we overreacted, but I wasn't as comfortable in the hotel after that. I hope my experience was just a fluke and that if you stay here in the future you feel more comfortable than I did.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent one night at Farmer's Daughter before going to the Price is Right the next day. We booked last minute and were stuck with rack rates. A little high but well worth the convenience. The hotel is located on Fairfax, across the street from the Farmer's Market. Check in was very easy and quick. Our room was on the second floor of the building across the parking lot. The room was well appointed with 2 queen beds, large flatscreen tv, DVD player, iPod clock radio. The convenience of peeking out our room to see if others were lining up yet for TPIR was, well, priceless. This allowed us to throw our clothes on at 5am, run across the street to get our passes, then return to the hotel to shower and change. We checked out at 8:30am, but left our car with valet parking for the day. We didn't eat at Tart, but opted for breakfast at the Farmer's Market. The only criticism or suggestions I could give to the hotel would be to offer free Wi-Fi rather than ethernet Internet for $9.95/day and the plumbing was a bit loud in our building (could hear when any one flushed). Yes, I would stay at again, or recommend Farmer's Daughter to a friend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just returned from a two night stay at the Farmer's Daughter and had a wonderful experience there. If you're traveling to L.A. for a chance to be on The Price is Right, this is an excellent choice -- their location directly across the street from the CBS studios makes your long wait in line much better. They'll even rent you a chair so you don't have to sit on the pavement while you wait in line! Don't miss Ted's free nightly Price is Right seminar at 10:20 PM -- full of good info and tips! The rooms were VERY clean (and I'm picky about that!), they offer free high-speed internet access (if you forget your ethernet cable, you can check one out for free at the front desk), and free DVD rentals (for your in-room DVD player). The beds were comfortable, and the water pressure was great. Nice minty bath products from Lather too! The L.A. Farmer's Market a block down the road offers a ton of inexpensive food choices, and you're within walking distance of Canter's famous deli. Book through their website rather than over the phone for an additional discount. We will definitely stay here again the next time we visit L.A.!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's easy to see why Farmer's Daughter received awards for their design. They turned a 1950s budget motel into something fun and funky. Color, gingham, and farm implements meet a European sensibility. Especially fun juxtaposed to the hipness of LA. Great location, helpful service, with small, clean rooms. The great decor makes you overlook the motel-ness of the rooms. All centered on a couple of levels around an active courtyard. But all the sounds from the courtyard below came up right through the door to my room 24/7. Even on the second level you plainly hear kids shrieking in the pool, the cleaning staff, and other guests through the day. At night you hear the partying. The air conditioner drowned out most noise so I could sleep. One night at 2 a.m. I woke to hear the soul music from the lobby below as if it was playing in my room. My travel companion two doors down was awakened two nights straight by the cleaning crew working and vacuuming outside his room at 3 a.m.! I don't recommend the overpriced upscale restaurant next to the hotel. I don't mind paying more for a nice meal, but neither the portions nor preparation lived up to the menu cost.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What has been done here is amazing. I have no idea what this place used to look like, but I imagine it was like every other run down motel that most people wouldn't be caught dead in. They took it and made it something truly special. The rooms are charming farmer kitch, but clean and modern. I do not typically use the tv in a room, and true to form I never turned this one on. But it's a very nice flat panel with a DVD player, meaning that if I had time I could watch a movie on it rather than on my laptop. The staff was wonderful to me, although my interaction was limited. The location across the street from the farmer's market & the grove is awesome. For breakfast I walked across the street and purchased some amazing fresh fruit and a fresh pastry. Great way to start the day. It's not perfect though. I am sensitive to noise, and the air conditioner is loud, even when on fan only. The fridge bothered me for a while but I got used to it. These are common problems to most motel type properties so this wouldn't scare me away at all, you just need to be aware of it. This is not the ritz carlton, but it's a delightful little hotel and I would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel in downtown LA! could not have asked for a better experience to say the least. I stayed here with my brother who lives in LA and we had a grand time. If you are looking for a 5 star experience.... look elsewhere. This was a great hotel that was more than hokey. It made me feel like I was staying at my gradma's place in northern MN, or my mom's in rural Maine. A GREAT oasis in a sea of pompousness. The food at Tart was out of this world! I pre-purchased the dinner as part of the package... I highly recommend to say the least. The other great feature was the valet parking. When in LA one often has to contend with off site valet parking where they are not responsible for damage done to a car. The fact is that they spirit your car off to gosh knows were. At the Daughter, they have on site valet parking... unheard of in LA...... It was also right next to the Farmer's Market.... that in itself was a great deal of fun! Just a great stay with great people... very personable and kind. If you are looking for the Ritz Carlton experience this is not it, nor does it even attempt to be... If you are looking to really relax and find an oasis of hokey downtown cool.... this is it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was in LA with my sister for an event at the Kodak Theatre, and the farmers daughter is fairly close, plus its located directly across from the Grove which is one of our favorite Malls. With that said, location is great, but that's the only thing that it has going for it. First, we arrive a half an hour before check in, and were told there werent any rooms available until later that day. The person at the front desk was COMPLETELY rude. We had to change our clothes in a bathroom next to the pool, which was awful, and leave our bags with the front desk. We arrived back to the hotel at 10pm only to have to wait for the guy at the front to figure out how to work the system. We were given our key, and it didnt work, I went back down and had to wait even longer for him to get it right. There was no apology(by now it was almost 11pm). There was some sort of construction going on, and it was VERY loud until midnight. In the morning when I checked out, I asked the front desk(after waiting in line for a very long time, if there was a comment card I could fill out. He said "no,those are in the guest rooms". Seriously? Do not stay here, its very overpriced and service is abolutely awful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am a return guest at Farmer's Daughter and love it there. Meets all my needs; location, hygene, internet, staff, rooms, TV, fascilities all 10/10 for me. Sadly for some strange reason when I arrived there had been a 'cancellation' on my booking....not by me!!! There was a record on the computer that a member of staff had cancelled my booking.....so, whilst they could accommodate me for my 1st & second night, they had to find me an alternative for one night and re-book me for the next 7.....not much fun! The manager, Peter, was helpful but the staff member on the desk at my arrival was useless: not much of an apology just a casual announcement that I'd have to find somewhere else to stay on Friday night. She then said she would look for somewhere for me, but forgot or was distracted so when I saw Peter the next day, he was a surprised as me that it wasn't done and had to make plans himself. Booked and paid for my one night stay in a local motel......nowhere near as nice as Farmers Daughter but a solution none the less. All in all, it was inconvenient and annoying but walk in rates were applied as a 'good will' gesture and the rest of my stay went smoothly and I will return again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If the purpose of your trip is to visit the Price is Right - this is the hotel you need to stay at hands down, no questions asked. It is the only hotel that this directly across from where the line forms. In addition, the hotel itself is very clean, comfortable, and well worth the price. I was worried b/c it is a renovated motel style place, but it was one of the nicest rooms I have stayed in at that price range ever! Anyway, back to TPIR. Ted, who works at the hotel, gives a seminar on TPIR every night the night before there is a taping. The hotel is so convienient to the line for the multiple trips to and from the bathroom/taking shifts in line. Just know that the hotel does not allow you to take pillows/blankets from the room out to the line (so bring a sleeping bag). We were just there and filmed the Million Dollar Primetime Spectacular on Mon Apr 16th at 2:30PM. We got in line at 10AM on Sun Apr 15th. We were numbers 48 and 49 in line (you have to be in the first 300 to get in the show). Everyone who made it in to the audience spent the night on the street, so do yourself a favor and book this hotel. Ted has a picture of every winner who has stayed at the Farmer's Daughter - and trust me it is a large collection.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were looking for something different to stay at in Los Angeles. Something fun and not too Hilton-ish. We came across the Farmer's Daughter Hotel on [--]. Did a web search and found their web site. We were very impressed by the web site and thought the hotel would be a great change from the chain hotels and the ultra expensive trendy hotels. The location of the the Farmer's Daughter is great...right across the street from the Farmer's Market and the Grove, and centrally located to most everything. However, don't let the chic facade of the outer walls fool you. Once you pass the lobby and head up to your room that's when the fun begins. You open the door and you are met with laminate wood-style floors and cheap quality furniture. The bedding and draps look like something you find at a second hand store. The cable television did not work for the two nights we were there. We felt like we were staying at a cheap motel...although the room was nearly $200 a night! I guess the best way to describe our experience was "oh...huh! Won't be staying there again!" The funny thing about the hotel is, it really epitomizes Hollywood...all glamorous and cool on the outside but inside it's just plan and ordinary trying to look impressive.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I absolutely adored this hotel. The farm theme is beautifully executed (it's more hip than country) and is carried throughout the entire property, ensuring lots of delightful little surprises in the hotel's decor and amenities. Our first-floor pet room with double beds was spacious, CLEAN, nicely decorated, and above all, comfortable. We had lots of stuff, but the tables, shelf space and curtained closet kept our room looking tidy. I thought the ultra firm beds would be a problem, but not one of the four of us complained about them. Besides, the sheets were crisp and white, and the blankets fluffy, which made for a good night's sleep. The courtyard is aesthetically pleasing and a great place to eat your takeout or relax in the morning with a magazine and cup of tea or coffee from the lobby. Every morning, I'd stroll across the street to the charming indoor market and outdoor shopping center while my traveling companions slept past noon. They'd call me when they were ready to hit the sights, and I'd be back at the hotel in five minutes! The free movies, high-end toileries, friendly service, great rates and endless supply of thick towels and hot water all were icing on the cake. I'll never search for another L.A. hotel again!</p></li>

I booked a 2 night stay with hotels.com (3/21/06-3/23/06). I called back on 3/18/06 to add another night and move our check out date to 3/24/06. I DO have written confirmation from hotels to show I requested and PAID for a 3 night stay 3/21-3/24/06. On Thur 3/23/06 the hotel staff moved our things out of the room (and the room safe that had all of our valuables). The claim they never got the information from hotels.com adding the extra day and they were booked for the night. They did NOT help us find another hotel in LA, they did not show that they were sorry, in fact the manager was mad that she had to take a taxi back to the hotel to unlock the room that they had stored all our belongings in. It was HORRIBLE. It was spring break and several hotels were booked. We drove around for over 3 hours (and we do not know the LA area) before we found a hotel around 12:30 am that had a room (and it was not a good place to stay, I doubt that we slept for more than 1 hour). I had booked a bus tour on Fri 3/24/06 and was due to be picked up from The Farmers Daughter at 8:20 am. Since we were not there we were still billed ($188) as a no-show. I WOULD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For concept and style, I give them three stars. But for service, I give them NO stars. I visited with my dog. As I checked in, I was told that I would not be welcomed back with him and that the person that made my reservation would be fired. (Apparently they have a 30 pound limit and the reservationist forgot to tell me this.) The owner/manager made me immediately feel uncomfortable (told me "someone would be fired for this") and sorry for any poor soul who had the misfortune to work for him. The lobby was nice and the new restaurant is wonderful. But the rooms screamed: crusty MOTEL! The mattresses were squeaky and thin. There was chewed gum and hair in my flower pot. Then to top it off my bathtub backed up with the waste water from the room above me every morning when someone took a shower up there. (Check out my photo above.) I reported it every day and it was never fixed. Utterly repulsive. I admit the location is great, the restaurant is tasty, and most of the staff is very helpful and friendly. One night won't kill you but lower your expectations before you get there. I was stuck there for several gruelling days on business, but luckily my next stop was Loews Santa Monica. Nothing like the beach and excellent hospitality - the perfect antidote to a week of stressful, shabby accomodations.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have been staying at the Farmer's Daughter for several years now and love it. The rates are reasonable and the location is great. It's in the middle of LA and right across the street from the fabulous Farmer's Market and the Grove. The rooms are spacious and clean. They have free internet access and great bathroom amenities. We haven't visited since they opened their restaurant, TART, but I'm excited to try it. How many other "motels" have on-site restaurants? It IS annoying to pay for valet parking when for most rooms you have to walk through the parking lot anyway but I understand why they have to have it. The lot has fewer spaces than rooms and valet parkers can park cars closer together to save room. Also, they needed to have valet parking in order to get the liquor license for the restaurant. Also, in order to get into the parking lot, you have to go through a gate which closes off the rooms to the street. The valet parkers have some sort of remote that opens and closes the gate. Having the gate there makes me feel safer. We've stayed in the No Tell Room which has a king size bed, a wet bar and a mirror on ceiling. I liked it but found it was a little dark. We've also stayed in their regular rooms. On our next visit, we will stay in a suite because we need more room with our baby daughter.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We've just returned from a two nights stay at the Farmer's Daughter hotel. Our stay was truly exceptional in just about every aspect. First, the location - between West Hollywood and the Fairfax district was hard to beat. Second, the small but inviting lobby sets the correct tone. The staff was very welcoming. There was lemonade and cookies for the taking. My wife had called a few days before our arrival to ask if there would be a crib available and the very helpful young man on the other end squared things away immediately. We arrived to find a crib in our room, set up with linens and bumper. The decor throughout the hotel is in keeping with a "Farmer's Daughter" who presumably makes her way to the big city while holding on to her rural roots. To that end our immaculately clean room contained a denim bedspread (changed each day), wood-plank flooring (no carpet, which we liked as it felt cleaner), a country-style desk -- and also a mini-fridge, a flat-screen tv, a dvd player... truly perfect. The bed and bedding were very comfortable. We enjoyed our stay very much. The one and only thing that was less than perfect was the attached restaurant- "Tart." Everything about "Tart" was great, except the food. A re-tooling of the kitchen is necessary. Bottom Line: We will stay at Farmer's Daughter again and will recommend it to friends without hesitation!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As observed by other reviewers, this facility appears to be a motel converted to a hotel by closing public access to what used to be a parking lot and is now used for valet parking. My friends and I occupied two rooms on the first floor, both of which face the parking lot. One of our party was flying in from another state, and I picked her up at LAX and returned to the hotel at approximately midnight. When we arrived there were a group of what I presume were hotel guests in the parking lot, apparently enjoying one another's company. Their enjoyment (along with yelling and loud laughter) escalated until I finally called the front desk at 1:15 AM to ask them to call a halt to the party. Though I believe their response was prompt since the noise stopped within a minute of my call, it frankly should not have been necessary for me to call in the first place. The desk clerk could undoubtedly hear the noise, both because of the volume and the proximity of the party to the registration desk. I can only conclude that no action was taken before because it never occurred to management that guests might want to sleep during pre-dawn hours. I chose this facility only because of the location. I expected little and was still disappointed. Almost any motel or hotel should be able to deliver a place to get a decent night's rest. That didn't occur the night I stayed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was lovely, the reception was really nice, across a courtyard with a restaurant terrace as well as a pool in a small shady corner though. Had a room on 1st floor and was lovely and spacious, nice vanity area outside the bathroom which was very useful, tiny bathroom with a shower cubicle and loo. We had a view of the 'Hollywood' sign from the door of our room!! Bed was comfy however I am a light sleeper and if there is any noise or light have trouble getting to sleep!! The road was quite a main road running outside the hotel and the noise seemed to continue all night with trucks and cars and buses, which did keep me awake, but my husband had no problems with it at all!! I had earplugs with me and put these in and that helped me get some sleep on and off. We walked across the road to the Farmers Market for dinners and breakfast - loads of choice and we found the brunch at Monsieur Marcel in the 'Real' Farmers Market fabulous, so we went back there in the evening for dinner and had Cheese Fondue - delicious!! We picked up the Hop-on Hop-off sightseeing bus from the Farmers market and did a tour of LA for the rest of the day. All in all the hotel is in a fab location and the room was lovely, bathroom a bit tiny, but adequate - only downside for me was road noise! They do have valet parking which was quite expensive, but all over LA, parking is expensive!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the reviews, we were expecting a pleasant if quirky small hotel. How wrong could we be! There were three problems, two of them major. The first was that the air conditioning was so noisy (and basic) that it woke us up every time it turned itself on (which was frequently). The second was that there was something in the room, which may have been mildew or some residue from cleaning products or the air conditioning system which caused a strong allergic reaction in my wife. The third was that when we complained the following morning, the hotel was totally unhelpful and devious and our attempts to speak to the management were frustrated at every turn. All we got was a message saying that there was no problem with our checking out and that we would get a refund for the nights we had not used followed by a later message saying that we would not get a refund but that we should arrange a charge back through the credit card company. When we tried to arrange this, the hotel responded by lying, saying among other things that we had not made the problem known to the front desk and that, had we done so they would have sorted everything out to our satisfaction, and then relying on the fact that we had made the reservation over the internet on a non-refundable basis and making it clear that they were going to keep our money. BEWARE THIS HOTEL! Beware also non-refundable deposits in general.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Where oh where do I begin? On Friday my two daughters,granddaughter,her grandmother and I(her other grandmther arrived in LA to celebrate my granddaughter's 8th birthday. Her other grandmother made reservations at this hotel. in Janurary. We checked in about 2. Lady at the desk said it was fine to come back later. At 8:30 after a wonderful time at the Grove Shopping Center mainly The American Girl Store we went to the Farmer's Daughter only to be told they had 2 rooms for us with a king bed in each.We made reservations for two double beds and a rollaway bed. She said all the rollway beds were taken but she could give us a blow up bed (what ever that is) We asked to speak to the manager and the woman at the desk said he had gone for the evening and it was way too late to call. It was onlt 8:30. Woman behind the desk said she would call other hotels in an attempt to find us rooms. She never identified herself. when she made the phone calls. In the mean time,my daughter was able to find us other accomodations.The only reason we wanted to stay there was its closeness to the Grove. I guess you could say it was a blessing in disguise as the hotel we stayed at was FABULOUS and because the clerk felt sorry for us he gave us an amazing rate. He said he had been in LA for awhile and had never heard of theFarmer's Daughter.So please think twice, three times before you make reservations here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel after reading about it on a website made by the city of Los Angeles and before reading these reviews or else I'd definitely have considered other places for me (a 27 year old woman) and my 16 year old sister to stay at. I just wasn't worth the price ( $203 plus $14 and tip for the mandatory but definitely not necessary valet ). The place looks like an apartment complex from the 70's and I'm pretty sure the building is that old. The pool is tiny and only open till 7pm ! Smoking is allowed on the balconies and right in front of guest windows in the "barn" building which could be annoying. The grounds and room were clean and the service good (especially by Jean) but the lightbulb was out on the desk ( although replaced promply !) and we had to hold the i-pod at a certain angle for it to work in the dock on the alarm/radio ( that's cool that it was there though !). Other cool features were the shower head ( although there's no fan in the small bathroom) and faucet and a fold out map of L.A. attached to the keycard. The bed, sheets and towels were suprisingly of very good quality ! There are a few outdated dvds to rent at the front desk (for free !) and a lot to do around the hotel so the location is pretty convienient . We also took bus 14 from beverly and fairfax to downtown and back. If you like Thai food, Chao Krung is an amazing restaurant to try (111 n. Fairfax). So over all I was satisfied with my stay , it's just the price should be lower for what you get.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The sole purpose of our trip to L.A. was to see The Price Is Right and this Hotel was THE PLACE TO STAY! We stayed for a total of 3 nights, and found out this little hotel has big personality. Staff was SO HELPFUL and the location couldn't have been better. Even had a special briefing for those planning on attending the taping of the show the next day, offered every night. Rooms were impressive and extremely clean, however the bed we had was firm. The espn was a huge plus for fiance. We were in a smoking room and there was no trace of stinky stale smoke. Pool area was small, but most vacationers staying in L.A. had other things to do besides swim..... Free movie rental from movie library at the desk was great to unwind to. About 20 minutes away is santa monica beach (depending on traffic), a must if you've got time to spend; parking lots available for about $7.00 not even a block away. Ferris wheel and other rides about a 10 minute walk from parking, great running around the beach. Shopping at the farmers market was okay, and plenty of places to grab a bite to eat, would say the mexican place was great. Walk of fame about 10 minutes away, went on a Tuesday am and didn't have to deal with "traffic on the stars" at all. Shops opened about 10am and were still opened at 11 when we went through at night. Also close to the dodger stadium. We were about 15 - 20 minutes away from the stadium and the aquarium of the pacific. The aquarium was fun and marina offered 45 minute tours for $20.00. Would go back again!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When my husband told me the name of the hotel he had booked for me and my daughter, I thought he was joking. I come from the midwest where this could have been a scene out of "Hee Haw". My daughter informed me that this was going to be a hip LA boutique hotel (to which I replied "with farm implements? Really?"). But the FD totally exceeded my expectations. The pictures don't do it justice. Our room was very clean and while the atmosphere was farm kitch, it was really well done. Original art of farm animals and vegetables, galvanized bucket waste bins, rope rugs and bluejean bedspreads? Again, done very well for the shell of a room they had to work with. The "wood" floors were different, but you really have to have a good cleaning staff to keep them this dust free. The bathroom was immaculate and had cool lemongrass toiletries. I would definitely stay here again. There was a bit of noise since we were on a busy street, but didn't keep us up. The lobby complete with two very cute parakeets looks out on one of the most interesting succulent cactus gardens I have seen. Warmed by heaters, the perfect place to gather for a drink.

<li><b>Title:</b> “Decent stay at The Daughter”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just got back from a quick trip to LA for a family wedding. After much searching for a location near the events we were attending, we decided on Farmers Daughter ... mainly due to the fact that it was a much better price than most of the hotels in LA and it didn't look like a roach motel. For the price, it is a great find. It's a cute, boutique-y hotel. The rooms are clean and very cute (the pictures online don't really do it justice). We booked our room via the hotel's web site directly. From the reviews online and the owners blog, it looks like that is probably the best way to book this hotel. We didn't have any problems and got the lowest price I could find by going direct. Many people seemed to have issues with the parking, but honestly ... EVERYWHERE in LA is valet parking. It's part of the culture there, and probably much more practical for the hotel. It was the cheapest valet parking anywhere around. Not much to really complain about there. And, the valet guys were great. The only downside is that check in was a 4 pm and we arrived very early. Luckily, we had somewhere to go, but some of the other guests were put out. Most places have an earlier check in or will let you check in sooner. We even let them know when we booked that we were arriving early and would appreciate getting checked in early and they still wouldn't let us in earlier than 3 pm. Another minor annoyance was that although it was a non-smoking room, the room smelled terribly of stale smoke. We adapted after a while (and the air is so disgusting in LA that you can't breath anyway so after the first day, I couldn't smell anything). All in all, for the price .. you can't beat it.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Fun Hotel Right Across the Street from Farmer's Market”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If the idea of staying across the street from the Los Angeles Farmer's Market (an LA landmark that's a permanent farmer's market as well as a touristy shopping center of sorts) as well as the cool and much newer outdoor mall The Grove is something that sounds great, then Farmer's Daughter is the place to stay. Located directly across the street from the Farmer's Market, it's an old-school motel that's been remodeled in a kitschy, yet fun country style, with a touch of the newer, hip stainless steel touches of a more modern hotel. We stayed in one of their suites, which was a pretty large common room which had a futon of sorts in it that was comfortable for our four year-old to sleep on as well as a small kitchenette with refrigerator, sink, two burners and pots and pans to boot (strangely, though, no microwave). The bathroom was nice and clean with a cool rain shower head. The bedroom was pretty small with a very comfortable king bed (that I think had one of the memory foam mattress topper on it). We had a great night's sleep. Both rooms had large flat screen TVs and the one in the common room also had a DVD player that we used and looked great. Just outside of our room (#200) there was a cool open air patio area with some nice outdoor furniture and a coffee table. It's a nice place to relax at the end of the day. They have valet parking that they charge for (I think it was $11 a day) but it's very convenient. and it's easy getting in and out. Attached to the hotel is a restaurant called Tart. where we had a great breakfast (I have a separate review of that). The Farmer's Daughter hotel is a great place to stay in the Fairfax district by Farmer's Market with lots to do nearby. We'd definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Farmer's Daughter for one day in January 2006 and I was overall unimpressed when I took everything into account. The hotel itself is a nice modern looking building with well equipped bedrooms but it almost is a motel. For almost $200 per night for a standard room, I expected more. The location is good if you are planning on going to CBS Television City because it is located right across the street. Also, the Farmer's Market and an outdoor mall are right across the street. There aren't a lot of things to do within walking distance so I don't suggest you stay for an extended period of time. I would choose another hotel away from this part of LA. LA is beautiful, but this hotel just didn't justify the price and the mandatory $12 per day VALET parking. They insist that they park your car for you even though it's like having someone park your car for you in your own driveway. The complex is small and the parking spots are mostly right outside your front door! The parking is just a money grab and they'll charge your an additional $12 if you keep your vehicle parked while you're at CBS for a taping of a show. The valet parking boys were useless and couldn't speak english. The bedrooms were newly renovated and charming but they lacked a warmness due to the hard floors and extensive use of denim in decorating. The beds were comfortable and clean but the television looks like it was Zenith's original model and looks out of place. The bathroom is tight a dingy and looks like it was taken out of a $19 per night motel. There are few other services available at this hotel and would suggest that it should only be a 1.5 star rating. Overall, I was very disappointed for what I got for my money and do not recommend this hotel.</p></li>
