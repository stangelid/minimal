<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's in a great location, right on Clarke Quay, which is a pretty up-market area. It was pretty pricey for what you got (which isn't much). It was generally clean. Bit of a musky smell to the hotel. All of Singapore is pricey compared to the rest of Asia so your not really going to get any bargains. It was all you need for a place to sleep & shower.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is truly terrible. Bad start as they made us wait until 1 pm before we could book into our rooms (arrived at 6 am from our o/n flight). The rooms are the smallest I have ever seen and the bathroom was so small I had to go out into the entrance way to dry myself so I did not bruise my elbows! Breafast lacks any semblance of variety or quality! Only redeeming feature is its location which is fabulous right on the river. Not recommended though!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for a few nights in July 2011 and found the hotel was perfectly acceptable without being much more. Everything was clean and pleasant and the bed comfortable. The area is quite nice and is quiet and the room had a good view over the river and towards the city centre. We thoroughly enjoyed Singapore and would recommend this place if you can get it for a good rate. At its most expensive you could find something a fair bit better I would imagine.</p></li>

A little renovation to the rooms should be done, the rooms are clean, the staff is friendly, the interenet connection on room is good and the location is really central (10 min. to China-Town, 15 min. to Orchard Road). The breakfast is a little expensive for what's it, but not 200 meters away is a Delifrance with good coffee and cheap breakfast.

Nice views from riverside rooms. Price was average by Singapore standards. Only downside was poorly designed bathroom that could not be cleaned well. Shower and everything gets wet. Stayed with my girlfriend who was not too concerned about cleanliness of bathroom. Staff were very helpful. I can recommend this hotel to singles and young couples on a budget.</p></li>

The location is great being located near the Singapore river. the rooms are very small, as are the pillows. The breakfast buffet was below average. There was no hot water kettle or coffee in the room. The staff almost make up for the negatives by being very helpful. There is a pool upstairs with a dry water slide but equipped with a nice little waterfall. If you just need a place to sleep, it will do.</p></li>

Otherwise the room was clean. Breakfast was included in our stay. It had a wide variety of options. The other reviews have said it correctly that the location is great but the hotel is bit worn out. It needs revamp. About 10 min from Clarke Quay MRT and the action/party.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Terrible experience at the Robertson Quay Hotel. I made the booking online, it seemed like good value but boy was I wrong! On arrival the staff were rude, they failed to inform me on booking that there was planned works in the building and as it worked it was on the same floor that I was assigned a room. The room was dirty, the wallpaper was peeled off the wall and the bathroom (if you can call it that) was very dated. I had to leave after the first night stay with the noise from building works and everything else, I found it was not worth staying any longer.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staff is rude & irresponsible. No Bellboy. Only 6 staff members in hotel. Breakfast is very monotonous of scramble and hard boiled eggs, boiled sausages, fruit juice and bananas. Only one cook (one old lady) to make breakfast for 400 guests. Room is too small and furnishing is terrible. But all & all Hotel has an excellent location if you are a night person just a walking distance from Clark Quay.Getting around is quite accessible with the Clark Quay MRT Station just across the river. In my 20 days visit of Thailand, Malaysia & Singapore only this hotel is terrible.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location! Close enough to Clarke Quay but without the noise. I was bunking with my mum but instead of giving us 2 single beds they gave us a double. Not so bad but the room itself was a weird shape and very small compared to what I was used to. Price wise wasn't worth the size of the room but because of its location it made the price a bit fairer. Room was old but once again we were there to see sites and weren't spenidng much time in the room so we could get over the fact that it was small and old. Had wireless internet which was a HUGE bonus for me. Would stay again!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our room was very small with the basics: a queen-size bed and a TV. The unscreened shower room (no bathrub) has a small sink with a pre-filled liquid soap dispenser, and a toilet. It is still a decent hotel, but I wouldn't give it a 3 star, and I think it might be more suited for backpackers, or anyone who isn't picky. One interesting thing to note is that you need to leave your room cardkey in a slot by the door in your room to turn on the lights. Of course, when you leave the room, you need to take your cardkey with you and it turns the lights in the room off automatically.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The best thing about this hotel is its location. If you like going out at night then the riverside bars and joints are just a few meters away.... walking distance from this hotel. People walk in Singapore and when I say walk i mean really walk and walk.... :-) Orchard road is just 3-4 Singapore blocks away. Breakfast is practically the same every morning. The pool is small. The rooms are tiny..... Singapore standard rooms I guess. But the big plus is..... from our 10th floor room we had a great view of the famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the big pool of the neighboring hotel.</p></li>

We had to get the bed changed before we would even contemplate sleeping in it. The towels were threadbare and useless. The shower room had so much mould on it, it was quite disgusting. There were notes posted in the lifts apologising for refurbishment. We did not see any sign of refurbishment. A stick of dynamite might help, then they could start. If we had not pre-paid we would have looked elsewhere. The only plus point is that it is in a perfect location.</p></li>

The room was not up to standard because of mould on the ceiling an inadequate bathroom facilities.

Having arrived in from a long haul flight we were eager to shower before seeing the city but found a complete shortage of towels and a tiny bathroom to be somewhat off putting. Did however limit our time in the hotel to the bare minimum as we had an early flight the next morning. Proximity to Clark Quay with its extensive nightlife is a big plus. Wouldnt be my first choice on a return visit and think people can do better for a few bucks more.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiancee and I really enjoyed our stay at the Robertson Quay Hotel. Located by the Singapore River, the hotel is very near a wide range of restaurants and shops. It is also within easy commuting distance of the City Centre and Orchard districts. Our room was quite a good size, well big enough for the 2 of us anyway, it was clean and well maintained, with a daily maid service. Our only disappointment was the bathroom which was a little on the small side, although having said that, the shower itself was easily big enough for us. Overall we enjoyed our stay, and would recommed this as a good quality mid-range hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Check in was quick. Request for late C/O till 2pm was unapproved. Unless $75 was charged. 1st room was accorded. Room was small and cramp. Bed sheet was stained. Very dusty. Toilet light was not working. 2nd room accorded, air-con was not working at all. 3rd room accorded and it was okay. Breakfast was a bad experience. Old chinese lady at the counter was very very rude and persisted on not serving ice water at all even if we mentioned that it was okay to charge. Insisted that bfast was over and will never serve anything to us. No service recovery was done and no apologies extended. We had a good stay despite the hotel's poor standard.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Okay i travel very often and stay in every hotel but this one was horrible! You could barley fit 3 people in the room the bathroom were just big enough to slaughter a pig and there were bugs even on the 6th floor. The pool was very very small and not well maintained. Now there were two very fond memories at this hotel. One was leaving and the second was knowing never to come back again. Look at the V hotel it charges less and is so much better! Their pool was worth millions each room had a king sized bed all granite and marble finishes! There was room for even 7 huge suitcases! So this is my warning to those who dare to look at this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel service was awesome. When i first walked in, cordial staffs greeted me politely and i was quickly checked in to my room; which was great at such a cheap price. It was cosy and clean. Definitely much better than expected at such a price. The location of the hotel was also splendid. With many shopping centres and other places of interest in the vivinity. Also, Clarke Quay is brimming with a vibrant nightlife which greatly appealed to me and my friends staying there. Many offices and business buildings were also nearby so staying here on a business trip also wouldnt be a bad idea.. Overall the hotel is an excellent bargain for its price and location.</p></li>

There were 2 seperate bookings (3 rooms) as our friends from Ottawa joined us for the occassion. Although we both reviewed the hotel web site let this be a lesson not to believe all you see in pictures. The hotel is tired beyond believe and the rooms so small that you can not both move around at the same time. The hotel staff need basic training in customer service and a wake up call on who is paying their salary. The photos should say it all. Give this one a miss. Thankfully we paid the penalty charges and moved around the corner to the Novotel and received great treatment and superb rooms.</p></li>

Robertson quay hotel's rate fitted in our budget (Singapore's hotel r expensive!) The room was very small and the bathroom was even smaller (it's more like the size of a public disabled toilet with shower head - there's no shower curtains or anything like that). There's no decor in the room and it looks relatively old. The only advantage of the hotel is its location - it's very close to Clark quay and all the bar/ pub/ club area, so if you r a bit of a party goer and just need somewhere to crash, then this will be the place for you!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic weekend in a cute hotel...the size is small, the shape of the room quite irregular & unique. The location is Fantastic since we had a good view of the Singapore river and part of the Singapore skyline. Our room was clean, however, i believe they need to repair the toilet. The breakfast was A okay - more than continental really...quite good and filling...however I ate the same breakfast menu for two mornings. They should learn to change their breakfast menu daily. As for the reception desk, they are all okay and helpful and accommodating. Although it would be good if they add a smile on their faces whenever they greet their hotel guests!! Fantastic Location though very very near the Party Crowd at Clarke Quay.</p></li>

However, the description and pictures were totally misleading. The room was tiny and dirty (sheets stained etc) and the shower looked like something from a hostel. Although the hotel boasted a pool and a gym, the pool was filthy and the slide into the pool would do serious damage if used and the gym was outside with faulty filthy equipment. To add to this, the hotel was not cheap (similar to the price of Studio M). My room was noisy (at the side of a noisy bar and the entrance open to the breakfast area, the noise and smell of eggs started early)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the hotel for 12 nights in September. I chose this hotel for the location and price (£29 per night for 2) The rooms were old and tired but bearable. THe rooms had a tv with 1 english channel and a fridge which came in handy! There was no wardrobe or reasonable hanging space for clothes - just a shelf! The bathroom was 'different'. It was a small triangular shape. The shower had no curtain so the entire bathroom flooded, dont bother putting things on shelfs as they just slide off! The pool area was nice but could get busy at times. The location is perfect, right on clarke quay, minutes from restauraunts and the MTR which gets you everywere. All in all for the price it was good value although i personally wouldnt stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a crappy hotel! Cant say good or bad service, because I didnt get any!! For a 3/4 star hotel, the room does not have room service. Im a vegetarian, and nothing was there in the buffet. When I asked if they could serve anything, the girl replies no, and walks off!! I am not that big, and if I could not fit in the bathroom, I really doubt anyone can. We had no space to keep our luggage, so it was all on the floor, in this super super tiny, half a room. The paid wi fi kept loosing signal. Old hotel which definitely needs a renovation. I wish I had taken some photos so everyone could see what I mean. Check out time was 12 PM, and I got 4 calls between 11:45 and 12:15, so finally frustated we just changed the hotel in one night, ruined otherwise a perfect trip for us!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staying here with friends turned out to be an awesome idea despite te negative reviews i read here... True, the rooms may be slightly smaller than 4 or 5 star hotels but it is cosy and has all the necessary amenities provided. This is made even more acceptible by the price per night. I mean you have got to find this a bargain. The location is in the vicinity of the city with a vibrant night life which was a bonus i wasnt expecting. Office buildings and the business district is literally a stone's throw away so staying here on a business trip is definitely not a bad idea. Staff were cordial and extremely polite and helpful. I'd say this place is very reasonable indeed. Normally you get what you pay for, but in this case i definitely got much more. WIll seriously come again next year !!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel because it looked very nice on the internet, the pictures are very deceiving! The room was extremely small, dirty, cleaners refused to clean the room. We had to pay for an extra night because we checked in at 10am but we were told that there's no cleaning service on the day! so why we had to pay an extra FULL PRICE but no cleaning service. Towels not clean, stained.... ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. Staff are not very helpful or considerate. My husband was not well and had the "do not disturb" sign out for a couple of days, and again and again, he got disturbed. So my opinion is, NOT recommended. We travelled around the world for holiday and business, have been staying in different hotels/motels/apartments and this one is absolutely the WORST we have stayed. so DO NOT STAY THERE!</p></li>

Arrived at hotel at 8.30 am and were told we couldnt check in till afternoon. we'd just come off a 13hr flight so we just collapsed on a sofa in reception and after a while the staff took pity on us and let us check in. The rooms are v small, in particular the bathrooms but we didnt really spend much time in them. Didnt use the pool as weather wasnt really the best. The hotel is located right in the heart of the entertainment district and there are lots of shops and bars, including hooters!, within a 5 minute walk, also close to train links. Good base for a few days stay although there was a distinct lack of english people in the hotel and area in general. Breakfast was basic but edible.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were rather disppointed with our stay at Hotel Robertson and Singapore overall. I was under the assumption that Singapore Hotels were of a 'higher' star rating than those in Europe! Boy, was I wrong. Nothing like the website. The price paid is not worth it, even for a budget hotel and the location is not very convenient. Our room was tiny, the bathroom even tinier, dirty and the decor horrible. We decided to stop in Singapore via Perth from our trip around Europe to relax, hence why we booked a hotel with a pool. This pool looked huge on the website, but when we got up there, boy was it a big let down. It was so small, nothing like the website. The only positive was the breakfast, which was decent enough for the price we paid (for the room). Very disappointing, I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed at this Hotel in early January for the last 3 years and have always had a pleasant stay. The rooms are not large and the bathrooms are small but everything is always spotlessly clean. Staff are friendly and always extremely helpful. The location on the banks of the Singapore River near Clarke Quay is simply the best (and I have stayed in several hotels in Singapore); there is a great outdoors restaurant where you can sit and watch the passing parade in the evening. Walking distance to the sights and sounds of Chinatown; near the Clarke Quay MRT giving you access to the whole of SIngapore and of course you can walk to Clarke Quay with its abundant restaurants and Boat Quay a short walk from there. The Hotel also has a pool where you can sit and enjoy the sun and fresh air. A bargain in bustling Singapore.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's easy to go over the top with a review like this when you're dissapointed, but seriously - I can objectively say that this is the worst hotel I've ever stopped in. Ever. Tatty, miserable, tiny, dirty room, with threadbare towels and consistenly dirty threadbare bed linen. Rubbish breakfast offering, the highlight of which must be watching the 'chef' open a tin of baked beans and pouring them straight in to a serving tray. I understand there are different eating/serving customs around the world (and as I travel a lot - I've seen many), but I've never known anyone serve cold baked beans at breakfast before!!! Internet (WiFi or wired @ 5SGD/24 hours) has a pittyful speed (approx 0.04Mb/s) - so next to useless. Location is good at the Robertson Quay, but that's the hotels' only saving grace. Seriously, go somwhere else!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is one of the cheaper hotels in Singapore, but the location is great, close to eateries, Theatre across road, taxis outside, walking distance to Clarke Quay, which is full of bars restaurants entertainment so vibrant, walking distance to MRT, with direct line to catch the monorail to Universal Studios. The staff are so helpful and friendly, nothing is a problem to them, yes, it is in need of a refurb, but how much time do you spend in hotel, breakfast was okay and no complaints from my children who are well travelled and used to higher star hotels. If you want better facilities then pay for it in a fancy hotel it you want value for money stay here, no it does not have bugs, we were surprised at how clean it was, agree bathrooms are very dated and small but after the initial shock we found it working well and spotless.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a terrible place. We only stayed there because due to the F1 Grand Prix there was a shortage of other accommodation. The rooms are the size of a stamp, the bathroom is literally smaller than a cubicle. You wouldn't even swing a cat in the whole room. There is no room for anything. The bed is hard, tiny. The whole set-up is below budget accommodation, hostels have better and cleaner facilities. Location is not bad, but that is the only thing going for this hole. Breakfast is a stodgy affair, unappealing in the extreme. My only advice is to avoid this place. A word to management: there is room for improvement in the quality of rooms and everything else. As the location is acceptable (not the best, but at least competitive), it is a mystery why you would continue offering this quality in a city of luxury at affordable prices.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Firstly this is a BUDGET hotel . No frills . You get what you pay for. If you want fancy you have to pay for it. We enjoyed our stay here .Sure the bedroom is small and the bathroom .But guess what were far too busy and used our room precisely for what it is designed for and that was to sleep ,shower and have breakfast. The shower is awesome , great water pressure . We always slept well .Breakfast is adequate ..scrambled, omellete , Baked beans , Sausage , fried rice and fruit , toast .Juice , tea , coffee. Staff are friendly and helpful, the breakfast lady does an awesome job . The location is perfect ..loved the Turkish restaurant with happy hour across the road. The 7/11 shop where you can buy cheap beer etc also in that direction . Awesome view from the window . Nothing to complain about really . Showers have a mould problem and thats about it</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">2 nights in what I thought was a 3 star hotel. I suggest you do not go by pictures in website or brochures, rather shabby and worn out hotel in desperate need of a clean, modernisation and general revamp. Great rates offered considering it has ok size outside pool but no excuse for general dirty state. Bed was small but compfy but we were not completely relaxed due to linen having worn out discoloured old look/feel plus the headboard was really obviously dirty. Bathroom was disgusting and tiny, they could at least attempt to get rid of the black mould from tiles and shower curtain. Breakfast below average, would rather they quote room only rates and charge for breakfast, they'd soon have to improve it ! Location was good, in front of quiet, prity river location, short walk to some nice bars, cafe's and restaurants. Would not recommend, would suggest pay bit extra.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When we go to Singapore we want a clean room, hot water, a decent bed and breakfast, be it Western or Asian. We've been privileged to try various hotels in Singapore as our trips are always leisure and business combined. We've experienced excellent and disastrous 5* hotels and various budget hotels too. The Robertsons Quay tops some of the 4* and 5* hotels. The abovementioned date was our 9th stay at the Robertsons Quay. We like the fact that it's at the end of a Cul-de-Sac and the river view. It's quiet. The lobby and dinning room areas are small and so are the rooms and the shower, but it outshines all other budget hotels. The beds are good, breakfast is more than enough and the hotel is clean. The swimming pool area is beautiful. The staff are not over friendly, but that you see throughout Singapore. They are very helpful. For a budget stay, the Robertsons Quay is a winner.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had orginally booked three days at this hotel (Feb 2006) however checked out after the first day. Had booked two rooms as was travelling with family of 3 children (11,8, and 4). The rooms were small (similar in size to on site University or college accomadation) fairly tidy but were in need of re-decoration. There were black marks by the air conditioning vents. The bathroom was basicaly a shower and a toilet, mismatching colours. Also has cigarette smoke blowing through the air condioning vents at night. Windows looked dirty and needed cleaning. There was a kettle in each room. One of the rooms had ants crawling over the kettle. This is a room on the 5th floor.There is a pool suitable for infants on the 3rd floor. Would not recommend this hotel. Which is unfortunate as with a bit of paint work and maintenance it could be a nice hotel even though the rooms are small. Ideal for couples and back packers.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've unfortunately stayed at this building twice. The 1st time was because I was still a student and was finding a cheap place with a good location to stay. After that, I reminded myself time and again not to ever come back to this place. However, in January 09 . . my company was trying to cut cost and booked me in this dingy place. I could only endured 1 night and woke up the next morning with a sore neck and a will to get out of that place as fast as I could. I'll try to state some points below: The Average: - The location. It is about 10-15 mins walk to Clark Quay. The BAD: - EVERYTHING ELSE. - The room was extremely small - The bed was extremely hard - The sink is directly infront of the toilet bowl. Imagine the challenge ;) - The carpets were stained and smelly - The staff is extremely unfriendly - Breakfast was stale I'll NEVER return to this place and would not be soo cruel to recommend this sh*thole to anyone else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had to stay here for 5 days for a conference and would never come back. We had a tiny dingy little room that reeked like cigarettes. The shower was tiny and dark. The pool was small but had a great view. I actually laughed out lound when I went into the "gym." It was a closet with two old tred mills. The "jacuzzi" was a dirty tub of water in the locker room. I wouldn't put my tow in it. We had to pay $5 a day for the internet, but it never worked. You couldn't just sign up for the week either... we each had to come down every day and sign papers for the internet. Crazy. The thing is, if we were saving money, I would understand, but we paid $90 a night and that was a cheap conference rate! After the conference, I moved into the Scarlett Hotel and paid the same amount, but it was SUCH a difference. I highly reccomend the Scarlett. It was so cozy, clean, and great atmosphere. I honestly didn't even like Singapore until I moved into the Scarlett.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location of the hotel is really phenomenal for the price of the room, but that was all I found phenomenal. Of course, I expected the great price (for Singapore) would come with trade-offs. The trade offs are lack of personality. The rooms are functional but not spacious. The bed could use some sort of bedspread. I felt like I was staying in a hospital. Actually, I was visiting a friend IN the hospital, and his room had more charm. The staff was friendly enough and breakfast, which is included, is adequate with both Western & Asian fare. The Internet was not great. If you're going to make someone pay for Internet, it should be fast and reliable. I regularly use Skype, but the connection was too intermittent and I was unable to have a conversation without the call dropping every few minutes. Overall, if you're on a budget and want a great location, this is definitely one to consider. If you want a memorable experience on your vacation, better spend a bit more and stay elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was there with my family (husband and parents) for holidays 4 days. The location is excellent since we had a good view of the Singapore River and part of the Singapore skyline. You can walk to a lot of places. Short walk to some nice bars, cafes and restaurants. For transportation not need to be worry, very easy to get taxi or walk to MRT (only 10-15 min from Hotel). Front desk was very ordinary. As for the reception desk it would be good if they add a smile on their faces whenever they greet or get greet from their hotel guests!! The room is very small, clean and basic. We had a connection room with good view of the Singapore River. We liked it. There was a TV, a telephone, and internet access. Bathroom was small and only had showered. Hot water works very well but be careful sometimes becomes too hot. Breakfast below average, always same menu everyday, they'd soon have to improve it ! Overall we were happy with our stay at Robertson Quay Hotel as a budget choice. We will re-visit someday. Sherly</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">booked with Asia rooms.com this hotel was booked for 1 night for an overnight stay before flying out of singapore. I chose the hotel as it was central for what we wanted and it was close to restaurants and bars. The hotel itself is nice and clean. Our room was very small. It felt like a caravan, but to be fair we had travelled for 2 days on a coach from Thailand before arriving there so it felt very luxurious!! The bathroom was tiny and had a small shower cubical. We were on the 8th floor with a good view of the river - we had double glazed dirty windows so we couldn't see much!! The hotel has a lovely bar at the side of it which is in a beach theme and we had afew cocktails outside on the river and it got pretty busy around 9pm with people walking home from work. You will be amazed by how many western people live in Singapore!!! I would recommend this hotel to people on a budget who are looking for basic accomodation in an easy location. I would also recommend a visit to Sentosa - where the gorgeous luxury hotels are!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booking through its own website or a hotel booking website yields about the same rate, though the hotel website is cheaper by a dollar+. Room is clean, small, but come with large windows facing towards the Singapore River view and the pool below. Adequate amenities like soap dispenser, hair dryer, 21" LCD TV, electric kettle with tea and coffee sachets. Wired internet chargeable. Small bathroom stall, but hot water is working fine! AT SGD 130++, it comes with basic breakfast, good for stuffing yourself with buns, toast, coffee and some congee before hitting the road. Aircon in room is cold, no matter how you control the termostat, but solved the problem by switching it off! Good location, though not near to any train station, but walking distance to Clarke Quay oposite for pubs abd restaurant, plus shopping at Liang Court. Good for families, couples, or travellers on a budget. Not exactly very cheap for back packers, but it is clean, and staff are efficient. Free parking for those who drive, great feature as parking in the city is very expensive!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'm puzzled by the negative reviews here about this hotel since my stay was fantastic. The rooms are small but definitely not too small. We stayed in a double and it was fine for two persons with plenty of space for our clothes and stuff. The bathroom was great and everything seemed to be brand new, including the flat screen TV. Breakfast every morning, they keep putting out more until 10:00 and it was never crowded. The pool area on the third floor also very clean and nice place to relax with an outdoor gym as well. Staff was very helpful and service minded. The only bad thing is that they don't provide free internet service. Wifi costs $5,90 a day and is only available in the lobby. The best thing about the hotel is the location. You can easily get to the nightlife at Clarke Quay, shopping at Orchard Road or Chinatown and the fantastic views at Marina Bay. All within short reach. We walked to and from the hotel to all of these places without problem. All in all, it's a great hotel with good value for money. If they would set up a wifi-connection available in the whole hotel it would be perfect.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Oh man, i enjoyed my stay there! Front desk guys just gave me a nice smile upon arriving. It was 2nd stay there. I was kinda disappointed that my room is not ready even after 3 pm. But the front desk personnel sorta told me that they are going to be ready in 10 minutes or so. Connection for internet in the room is not so well good... You need to be a rocket scientist to finger out how to solve the configurations. Well i know i am not!. Overall stay was good. I was lost for directions and Front desk seems to know about the way really well!.. Experience huh! I was there recently for the Buddhist convention. I was pleased happy to know one of the front desk personal who has a smiley face. He is a cool chap.. friendly and courteous.. He helped me out when i had trouble with the internet, a chatty guy i must add!. I think he is the only one that understood my accent!. Sadly i forgotten his name which i ask him twice. Bad memory! Anyway Keep up with a good job! A good asset to the management! I would love to visit singapore again.. a nice and warm country..Hopefully to stay and Robertson Quay hotel again!.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked the hotel through one of the online travel agents. I found the rate was quite high compare to the quality of the hotel. The hotel was really small. Room was quite old, but the room size was ok to accommodate 2 adults and 1 child 5 years old. Bathroom was really small, I hardly find space to put my bathroom amenities. Hot water was on and off. Sometimes it became too hot even though i have adjusted it. Room facilities were rather old, small out fashioned TV, no cable TV channels for children. Only 1 small restaurant available, open only for breakfast. Breakfast was also very standard with asian and american breakfast menu. During breakfast, i had to come as early as possible to make sure i got the table. The queue was quite annoying. I just couldn't enjoy my breakfast while people were standing waiting and looking at others who were sitting. Hotel location was just 10 minutes away to Universal Studio by taxi. At the opposite of the hotel is the walking site where you can find many kind of restaurants. This is what we enjoyed during our family holiday in Singapore. Overall about the hotel and the area was acceptable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Robertson Quay Hotel is a gem in the rough. Unless your idea of a hotel room is somewhere you can sit in an easy chair or sofa while you put your feet up on the coffee table, This place is the place to stay. You couldn't pick a better location in Singapore. It is right on the esplanade along the Singapore River and only a 5 minute walk from the MTR station. It is half the price of other hotels in the same area, and with good reason ... the rooms are very small and basic. Think stateroom, not hotel room. The guy I was traveling with was a fellow retired naval officer. Both of us remarked how much the room reminded us of our staterooms on Navy ships. They had everything you needed and nothing extra. The room was small, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was "compact" but held all the necessities. (don't think free shower caps and hand lotion ... I mean toilet, sink, and shower) There was a TV, a telephone, and internet access. What else do you need? The room comes with included breakfast and only costs $90, a bargain in this area of Singapore. Throw in an extremely helpful staff, and I don't think you could do much better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Upon arrival I immediately knew something was just not right with this 'hotel'. The staff on front desk were unhelpful and unfriendly. There are 5 or 6 stairs to get to the lift and of course - no help with your luggage so I DEFINITELY wouldn't recommend this place for anyone eldery or with prams. The worst thing about this hotel - the bathrooms. The smallest bathrooms I've ever seen (and I've stayed in tiny-hoteled-London!). I didn't wash my hair for the week I stayed there because there was simply not enough room! The worst part though was that they were disgusting - moldy, mildewed and water damaged. The sheets on the bed had stains and was in general just a stuffy, uncomfortable room. The location is fine - but I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone. I've stayed in backpackers that have been 10 times better then this horrible place - it should be shut down. One more thing - I had been looking forward to a week of great breakfasts... And just let me say, MacDonalds breakfasts ended up being a tasty treat after the revolting, shoddy breakfast offered. A giant serve of baked beans with toast and horrible coffee is not a breakfast!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Where do you start with such a disgusting excuse for a hotel?? After a flight from the UK with 3 kids, we were hoping to get an early check in and to the staff's credit, they allowed us to use the pool while our rooms were being made up. The pool was dated, but the kids appreciated the slide. It went quickly downhill from there. After checking into the rooms, we new we were in trouble when the electricity wasn't working, and the air con was on the fritz (not ideal in 35 degrees and 95% humidity!!!) We had 2 towels between 5 of us, and that was the extent of the "added extras". The mould in the bathroom was thick, and everywhere. The beds were the equivalent of what you may find in the Changi prison, excpet you wouldn't expect the same stains and rips at the jail. We booked in for 2 adults and 3 kids but were presented with 4 beds, when I queried this the reception rushed up a straw mat in a sheet for my youngest - we didn't expect to be "away in a manger" in Singapore............. Originally booked in for 3 nights, we took the cost of the first night on the chin and were staying at the Novotel within 2 hours of checking in. Avoid this hotel at all costs, it's not worth your relationship!!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had been to many hotels in singapore and this is by far the worst hotel i had seen. Writing a review is difficult as it is so terrible that I just don't know where to begin. First I would not call this a hotel, it is not even a motel it is just a rented room. I made a mistake of booking it for 7 days and pre paid it. If I had not pre paid the room charges I would have move after first day. Ok back to the room. It got nothing. There are just 2 towels and a soap dispenser. NOTHING else not even toothbrush. You would have expect such are basic for any hotel. There are not even any slippers in the room and when I ask the front desk, they answer me in a manner that they do not even bother to look at you when answering you. The room is so small that I would not even call it a room and they only have a 14" TV set which was so out dated. And no bottle water provided too. Honestly this is a first time that I had seen a hotel not providing all this. I had been to 2 stars hotel which is even much better than them Room is dirty and overall it is simply terrible. Even Hotel 81 is much better than them. If you ever want to visit singapore, please do yourself a favor and never go to Robertson Quay Hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good value for Singapore & great location, with pre-bookable connecting rooms!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The best thing about this hotel is the location and the fact that you can pre-book connecting rooms without waiting until you get there to see if they have allocated you one (I have very rarely come across any other hotels that do this!). The rate is currently $117 for double room or $234 for set of connecting rooms on their website. This is great value for Singapore. The rooms are fairly small (similar size to Traders) as are the bathrooms, but clean enough for a 3 star hotel, it doesnt pretend to be 5 star. We had 3 adults and 2 kids in 2 rooms.Ours also had a fridge, safe, tv hairdryer, internet etc. Its a 5 minute walk to Clarke Quay, with lots of pubs, clubs and restaurants, great for a daytime or evening stroll. They have even developed Robertson Quay itself into a mini Clarke Quay with bars and restaurants on your doorstep. The hotel also has its own bar with deck chairs next to the river and a daily happy hour. Breakfast was basic compared to big hotels, but had coffee, tea, juice, cereals, sausages, beans and eggs, plenty for us and tasted good. Has a small pool with slide going in it, adequate for kids and adults to cool off in. Good value for Singapore and much cheaper than getting 2 rooms in a bigger 4 or 5 star hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Disappointing stay”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for one night over the weekend with my girlfriend. It was really disappointing, as both of us has always wanted to check out this hotel. Considering the price of $160 SGD per night, it is considered affordable and the location of the hotel is great. However, once the check in the disappointments start. The room is really small with no much walking space. Next, if you think the room is small wait till you see the toilet! Toilets look really old, and are very small as well. Television is small as well. If you read my other reviews, I am quite a TV junkie. Therefore small television does not score points with me. Breakfast is not impressive, very basic toast, spreads, hard boiled eggs, sausages, baked beans. Very disappointing overall, especially for the price that I am paying for I know that there are better hotels in Singapore at cheaper rates or similar prices. Despite all these negative points, why I gave a 2/5 rating then? The only spark is the location. The hotel is located just opposite Clark Quay and walking distances to many fanciful restaurants in the vicinity. The hotel is perfect for couples who wish to go away for a romantic weekend, but do not have the budget to pay for the other nearby hotels in the same location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">well, i booked a hotel room thinking that since it was at boat quay (a rather happening and upmarket area in Singapore), i couldnt go wrong. i had intended to spring a surprise birthday and hen's night party for a very good friend. boy, was i utterly embarrassed at the state of the hotel. it was absolutely quiet even at 9ish. making it seemed like a haunted hotel. and the interior was really in need of refurbishing. the moment i stepped in, the hotel gave me a dodgy and creepy feeling. after all the hyped and excitement preparing for the party for weeks, the hotel really brought the entire anticipation down two thousand notches. i just hope my friend didnt think she had cheapskate friends. the toilet was another sorry sight. my home's toilet is in a better condition and it's not even 3 star to begin with. i gotta thank my mom for her hardwork keeping the home spick and spack. there was no curtain. and it was VERY tiny. i think even toilets in work dormitories are in better conditions. and mind you, i paid S$150+ after taxes for this mess. the money could have been better spent. oh one last thing, breakfast was just baked beans, boiled sausages, porridge, cereal and some other forgettable spread. really, please book this hotel only if you have no other option.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 3 nights. We chose it because of it's location close to Clark Quay and the hotel being on the river edge. And because it's probably the cheapest hotel in the area. From previous reviews we wen't expecting much and it pretty much lived up to others reviews. The hotel is showing it's age and needs renovation. Not that it was dirty, just run down. OK for us I suppose because we just wanted a basic hotel in that area ---- and we got it. The rooms are of the size you would expect and nowhere to put / hang your clothes except on the window ledge. The bathroom is tiny and you can't swing a cat. There is no exhaust fan in there -- it's outside the door. Not much use when you want to use the toilet. The sheets were changed daily which was a surprise. The hotel style is circular built in the atrium model. Thus it's very noisy as noise echoes throughout , especially will people slamming doors. Also there are no smoking floors which really are useless because smoke can enter the open atrium and filter everywhere. Breakfast is VERY basic and the choices do not alter from day to day. Would we stay there again ? Maybe, only after investigating all other hotel options ( which are very expensive in Singapore ) Could I recommend others to stay there --- probably not. Shop around and do your homework.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">stayed for one night in Dec 2011 and man, was i disappointed. I had thought it would be a four-star hotel given its location and name, but it ended up giving me the impression that it was just a 2-and-a-half-star hotel. we stayed in the deluxe room (twin-sharing at room 703). Room was clean but it was very small. Had a great view of the pool but quickly realised that the pool actually belonged to the posh hotel next door. the bathroom had a standing-room only shower area, a toilet bowl and a sink that looked like mine back in the 1980s. the ceramic tiles of the bathroom area are exactly those you find in public toilets at coffeeshops in Singapore (those that are old, smelly and disgusting, cos i think some coffeeshops have better tiles now). i had some bruises on my knees after showering, cos i kept hitting the faucet when i had to soap my feet. super disappointed with robertson quay hotel's 'pool', it is actually a round circular pond which contained murky water. the common areas had carpets but these were old and mouldy. the 'continental breakfast' was a joke, cos they only served toast, baked beans, chicken frankfurts, juice, milk and cereals. there was no omelette or fried vermicelli, but i guess it was all snapped up by the time we went down at 10am. won't go back again. for the price i paid ($150 per night), i expected more.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Photos on hotel's website are deceiving. The rooms are really small, you can just walk around the bed. The toilet and shower combined is tiny. No shower barrier or curtains, so when you shower, everything gets wet! No furniture apart from the bed as there's no room. The air conditioning temperature was set really high. It only allows you to set it at low, medium or high. I found the low setting, too cold and had to ask for a couple of extra blankets at night. We stayed for 8 nights over Xmas as it was reasonably priced and central. Every other hotel near by were more expensive, so we stuck to where we were. Breakfast is EXACTLY the same every morning. Really boring . When it gets really really busy, they can't cope. They run out of plates, cups, cutlery, food... they hand wash everything, so hence the wait. They also run out of tables and chairs at peak time. Breakfast area very dark. The only good thing is they provide a couple of newspapers very morning. The swimming pool is small. The fitness centre is outdoors but covered, so you could get really hot when doing your workout. The only good thing is that its so central to the city. Access to MRT is approx 10 minutes walk. It's also close to Clarke Quay. Staff are OK, but you need to ask for everything. They need to learn to smile and be more hospitable. The hotel itself is run down and in need of a good uplift.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights on business. Its quite reasonably priced by Singapore standards. But as the saying goes "you get what you pay for". Its obviously quite an old hotel with dated and not so clean decor and furnishings. But the big eye opener is the size of the rooms. The room was easily the smallest hotel room I have ever seen. If you have a couple suitcases you have to put them on the window ledge or continually step over them moving around the room. No chance of having a queen or king sized bed in the room because they wouldn't fit in the room. After the initial shock of the size of the room I decided to check the bathroom. I've seen cupboards that are bigger! To say they are tiny is a gross understatement. If you are on the large size, I didn't say fat, but read it how ever you like, you will have difficulty especially in the shower, where its tough to turn around without hitting the sides or the door. We only had breakfasts at the hotel, it was included in the tarif so why not. It wasn't too bad, but not real good either. Not much variety of foods and very little western food. We didn't try them for other meals as there are lots of restaurants within a few minutes walk that offer great variety. And Clarke Quay is only 10 minutes walk along the river. All things considered, I wouldn't stay hear again as there are much better hotels at similar tarifs.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">March 2010 Reception staff v friendly and check in was hassle free. Our flight arrived very early so we got to the hotel about 11.00 but couldn’t check in early unless we paid a fee (that seemed quite a lot) but we were able to leave our bags there no problem and go off sightseeing and check in later. We had a room on the top floor, overlooking the river & city and though this was ace for the price. The room was VERY small, but knew this before we went from other reviews, and it was fine as there is a massive window ledge you can put your suitcases on. Our twin room had 2 small single beds, but they had a reasonable gap between them so you don’t feel too intimate with your friend. Bathroom is a wet room style, never had any hot water through and the shower and the bathroom was a bit tired (cracked tiles etc). However, it was all v clean, both bathroom and shower. Room has aircon, safe, TV & hairdryer. Location is great is you don’t mind a bit of walking – you can pretty much get everywhere or at least walk to an MRT station to travel further afield. Breakfast was ok, bread/toast, rice, egg, sausage, coffee and orange ‘juice’ (more like squash). Breakfast got quite busy between 9 and 10 though, with long queues for food and waits for a table. The pool is several storeys high, and has superb views. I think its unheated as the water was quite cold despite it being very warm weather.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights, earlier this month and found it to be quite adequate for the price we paid. We were out all day sightseeing, and found the location of this hotel to be very good - walking distance to Clarke Quay MRT, Boat Quay and Chinatown. The pool although small also, was wonderful to dip into at the end of the day. The rooms are very small ( and apparently all the same size). We had requested an upper floor for the view over the river, but had been allocated a room on the 2nd floor because that floor had been renovated, and I must say we were grateful to be there. It was a huge improvement on what I have seen of the other rooms. The bathroom was tiny, but nicely tiled, toilet very close to the wall and sliding door, so a bit difficult actually to place yourself on it!!!! I think a very large person would have a bit of trouble. Towels were indeed old, small and thin. Sheets clean and crisp. New Samsung television on the bench in the room. Breakfast was adequate, same each day, juice, choice of eggs, cereal, toast, sausage and baked beans and fried rice. Staff at reception were efficient and helpful. One thing to point out is that there is an Italian Restaurant below the hotel, which got quite busy at night, and we did hear the noise from there, although it didn't go late.We also had quite a nice view over the river from the room, even though only on the 2nd floor. All up I would probably stay there again, for a night or two.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed for three nights in room 1009 at Robertson Quay Hotel during one of those weeks when Singapore hotels raise their rates S$50 a night because of high demand. Singapore hotels are getting terribly expensive, making many of us in Jakarta look to taking discount airline flights to Bangkok for medical and other visits. The Robertson Quay hotel room and bathroom are very basic, very small, but adequate and clean. You can't expect amenities such as Kleenex tissue. Water from the shower splashes on the bathroom floor. Plan to be in bare feet when using the toilet or sink, and then you wipe and dry your feet when you leave the bathroom. There are a small writing desk and a stool in the room. The hotel is in an excellent location a block from bus lines on Clemenceau Road that whisk you to Orchard Boulevard/Road and a 10 minute walk from the Clarke Quay MRT station. There are numerous restaurants in the area and a Cold Storage supermarket in UE center a block away. There is construction next door, so ask for a room facing the river. I think that within a few years, the hotel will be replaced with luxury flats or another hotel that is higher than 10 floors. The buffet breakfast is basic, but it includes cereal and milk, boiled, scrambled, fried eggs, and two kinds of bread with butter and jam. The TV had HBO, which was most welcome. We didn’t check into Internet rates. The reception staff are busy but helpful and friendly. The view from room 1009 was very pleasant (see photos).</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for three nights on a twin room. The guys the reception were very helpful and friendly. We came in around 11am and they politely informed us that check-in is strictly at 2pm, but they already checked us in right away, we just can't go up our room. So we decided to explore the area till the time we can go up. Left our luggage at the lobby, literally, they're just sitting there at the lobby entrance with the rest of the luggage from other guests, in plain sight, no locked chain or whatever. But hey, it's Singapore, one of the safest places on earth. The room was not that large, but the AC was good, the bed was comfy, we asked for two extra pillows and they gave us four. The view was nice. If you can, ask for a room with the view of the pool and the river. The thing I didn't like with the room is the bathroom. I think our two-door ref at home is bigger than the shower area. I'm 6'2 and I can hardly move when taking a shower, that's the only downside. Hot water is working perfectly. Yeah, bathroom is really really small. Breakfast is included and it's the same everyday...eggs, sausage, cereal, beans, bread, juice, coffee, milk...that's it. But the location of this hotel is fantastic! The hotel is surrounded by bars and restos, just a few strides from the hotel by the river. It's 10 minutes walk to Clark Quay, and it's really safe walking home at 2am. The bus stop is near the hotel, so that's a plus too. Orchard Road is only two or three stops away -- bus no. 64. And the area, Riverside Quay is mostly frequented by Caucasians, so is Clark Quay. We paid SGD20 or so for cab fare from the airport to the hotel. And it's about the same when we left.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel has a great location - I will give it that! However, when we first arrived, the staff were not very helpful at all. My cousin had an injured foot, and had to hop up the stairs from the reception to the lift. This left me to carry the 6 bags. The 2 men at reception just sat there and stared at us. Didn't offer to help me even move the bag to the lifts. The rooms are very tiny. We were in a room with 2 single beds - they were actually too long for the area they were in, and intruded into the passage way in the room. The bed linen smelled, had several stains, holes, and cigarette burns. There was no place to put your bags (except between the beds). Which made it impossible to move about the room. The safe did not work (probably because the whole front panel had been ripped off it), the TV did not work. There was no shower curtain which led to everything in the tiny bathroom getting wet (towels, toilet paper etc etc) I paid for the wireless internet in the room, only to discover it would not actually pick up a signal in the room. I could only get a signal when I was in the hallway. Breakfast was OK. Not very much variety though. I used my credit card to pay for this hotel, it was the only time on this trip that I used my credit card. After my return to Australia, I was very shocked to find out that my credit card had been skimmed, and used to purchase multiple airlines tickets with airasia, and numerous other internet purchases. As I currently am unable to prove without a doubt that this was done by Robertson Quay Hotel staff, as the fraud is still under investigation by the authorities, I would highly recommend paying with cash if you do choose to stay there.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “My home in Singapore”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had selected Robertson Quay Hotel by chance for my first time in Singapore years ago. Since then I've always returned because I find what I need in this pricey city with its hot climate: location, pool, comfortable bed and quite affordable price. It's very true that the hotel deadly needs a renovation. Rooms are tiny but again, the bed is comfortable, and we can enjoy large views of the skyline and green space. TV programs aren't bad. I've seen tinier rooms in Hong Kong. What is special is the bathroom. It is the smallest I've ever seen. First time visitors, be ready to that. Yet there is still a WC, a sink and a shower with a curtain. The swimming pool is at the 4th floor if I remember. Yes this is small but you can have it just for yourself most of the time. Use the heavy waterfall to massage your back! If your room is nearby you can walk directly to/from the pool. Very cool, isn't it? The reception is, well, not the warmest in the world. Nothing to complain about, though. The buffet breakfast is the same every morning but you'll be full before leaving the hotel. The dining room is pretty pleasant and bright. It is also possible to eat outside. The location is the big plus of the hotel, just near Clarke Quay and in front of the river. Numerous restaurants and bars are nearby. This is where people go to chill out night time and during the week-end. No need to take taxi or MRT after dinner, just a 5 min walk. Clarke Quay MRT is nearby. You can even walk until the Merlion through Boat Quay. If you like food courts, the Maxwell Food Centre in Chinatown (with its famous Tian Tian Chicken Rice) is at 5 min by taxi. I wish there was free wifi Internet in the hotel, but this is Singapore, nothing is free ...</p></li>
