Near the Rialto Bridge and an easy vapporeto station. Lots of resturants in the area and on the main drag, so lots of foot traffic. BUT, its about 100 yards for all of that so its quite, but still easy to get to. Highly recommended.</p></li>

It was pretty easy to reach from the airport. I would recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I enjoyed this hotel. It was charming, clean, and in a lovely area away from St. Mark's, but just a 10 minute walk from the action. The staff was courteous and helpful and the decor and amenities were better than expected. We were treated to a slice of local Venice life and impromptu music and singing at the Campo SS. Apostoli.

The breakfast was generous and included eggs and bacon. The location in the Cannaregio area was out of the touristy area, but an easy walk to the main sights, and we only got lost once. We ate dinner at a nearby restaurant the Veeia Cavana. This was the best meal we had on our trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Giorgione for two night in the middle of April. Hotel was clean and conveniently located. Service was very good and the breakfast was exceptional. This is definitely a hotel that I would stay at again. The only issue was that, although it was hot, the A/C was not turned on yet, so we needed to sleep with our windows open.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Once you find this hotel, you'll be very pleased. The lobby features a beautiful Murano chandelier, along with a parlor where tea is served every afternoon. The rooms are quaint and clean, and we enjoyed a window with a flower box overlooking a quiet street. Complimentary breakfasts were wonderful. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the Rialto Bridge and San Marcos Square. There were plenty of shops, bakeries and restaurants nearby. The staff was warm and professional.</p></li>

The room we had was a little small but well equipped. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a treat. Venice is very expensive but the staff can recommend good value eating places. Our favourite was Casa Mia which was very close to the hotel: food was excellent and reasonably priced. It is off the tourist routes and used by the locals.

A beautiful courtyard in the center which is great place to enjoy the ample breakfast the hotel provides. Our room was a good size, especially for Venice, with good A/C and water, which is not always a given in Italy. Great locale, close to the Rialto bridge, but on a queit side street.

The hotel is just as good as its website suggests. Our room was one of the cheaper ones, but had all that we would have wanted. Breakfast in the courtyard was wonderful, and there are plenty of places to sit and relax. Very close to the centre of Venice, and easy to get to from Marco Polo airport. Would definitely come back - but next time would like a roof-terraced room!</p></li>

There is a lovely garden room where you can have tea and cookies in the afternoon and rest after a day of sightseeing. The breakfast is simple but plentiful. If you follow the directions the hotel gives it is very easy to find the hotel. It is away from the crowds but within walking distance to every attraction. If you come to Venice the object is to walk, you can't get lost and it is easy to get around. We would stay there again if we came back.</p></li>

Very central location - near to St. Marks Square, Rialto Bridge and boats to the islands. Water taxi dropped us one minute walk from hotel. Safe and hair dryer in room.

Room, lounge, dining area very well maintained and spotlessly clean. Good choice of food at breakfast. I understand the manager and his family actually own the hotel and think that showed through.

The hotel was as described in a quiet area but we found venice quite a quiet place after 11.00pm anyway. The staff were very friendly and the hotel was beautiful inside. It was lovely to sit by the decorative pool, enjoying a drink whilst listening to relaxing operatic music which played gently in the background. Finding our way around was a little tricky at first but people are very willing to point you in the right direction. I would definitely return to this hotel.</p></li>

During the check-in the staff was professional, they were quick (anyway, I missed some small personal something) and then we have been shown our room: a beautiful room with authentic furniture. Flat TV, mini bar, convenient bathroom - all was perfect. Breakfast was just OK - good for one or two days, but if you stayed longer it could be boring. The hotel was easy-to-find, really just 80 m walks from Piazza SS.Apostoli - a very good location to discover Venezia by foot and vaporetto.</p></li>

Our bed was in a loft which gave our room an airy, spacious feel. The neighborhood is quiet but close to the Rialto area and a glorious walk to most tourist attractions in Venice.

Facilities were equal to our first Italian hotel, a Four Star. You will not regret staying at this hotel. Venice itself is expensive but this hotel gives mid week discounts on Expedia of $25 a day.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel was quite old world but clean and efficient with interesting decoration. Our room was quiet and overlooked a courtyard. We got our internet to work in the room, although they said it was only meant to work in the lobby. Staff was friendly and helpful. Easy walking distance to ferry wharf. Breakfast was good. Our room service hot water for tea tasted fishy, but I think this may be a Venice problem rahter than the fault of the hotel. I did not particularly like Venice, as it was an overcrowded tourist trap with high prices, but I would stay at this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was found easily from the website directions from the airport via water bus. The staff were attentive yet only when you needed help. The classic room was quite small but very comfortable. The receptionist was quite expert in helping us with advice as to how to get round Venice.. The hotel was in a quiet district of Venice with excellent food just around the corner for the evening out. Breakfast was ok but nothing out of the ordinary. The al-fresco breakfast in the the courtyard was delightful. A strong positive - recommended by our travel agent as a good thing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I just returned from our trip to Italy and our first stop was Venice. The Hotel Giorgione was fabulous! The place itself was very charming and clean and the staff was extremely polite and helpful. They served a delicious breakfast every morning, which was just what we needed to get us started on our busy day of sightseeing. We enjoyed relaxing in the courtyard with a cocktail in the afternoon before heading out for the evening. Very close to everything, especially the Rialto Bridge. I would highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay here on our next trip to Venice!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent 3 nights in September. Highlights: beautiful lobby; very helpful and friendly staff; great breakfast (with a few hot dishes); beautiful outdoor courtyard for meals and drinks; reasonable rates; free WiFi. Pool table and bar in lobby. Downside: rooms are small; hotel is about a 10-15 minute walk from nearest vaporetta station, and directions given by the hotel were so vague as to useless in the challenging streets of Venice. This was a problem when we arrived late and with luggage. Location is quiet, as it is 1-2 blocks off the nearest square. About a 10-15 minute walk to St. Mark's square.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here on a trip to Venice, and we were really happy with our choice. The hotel is affordable and in a great location - easy to walk to the train station as well as to all of the great sights and water taxi stops. The staff is amazing - the front desk attendant must have spoken at least 4 languages, which was really impressive and useful. There are great, free breakfasts each morning and an afternoon tea each day. I loved the room, too - ours had an awesome exposed wood beam ceiling. It was beautiful! If you're headed to Venice and want to stay somewhere great, this is your place!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">At my first time in Venice, I booked this hotel for me and my mother. It was really nice, the best during our stay, we liked the decoration of the room, but it is not that new (what could be a bad point for other travelers, although we liked this). The hotel is well located, but like all hotels in Venice: it's hard to find and from out outside doesn't look good. Once you get inside it's amazing and beautiful, we loved the "patio" inside, with the sculpture, and the breakfast was really nice. I just don't say it was excellent, because there are hotels that can be better with the same price (which is not cheap... but this is Venice!).</p></li>

I asked for that rate and they told me that the rate was changed five minutes after we checked in.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in a standard double room (one bed) for four nights in August at 110 Euro a night inlcuding tax, services and buffet breakfast. I booked throught the hotel's web site. The room was small but comfortable. The shower was a bit cramped, but I think we had one of the smaller rooms. The breakfast was good with a nice selection of breads, cereals, cold meats and cheeses, and fruit. We enjoyed eating in the courtyard next to the fountain. The staff at the reception desk was always pleasant and helpful and everyone spoke English. We ate dinner at the restaurant that goes by the same name as the hotel just a few feet from the hotel and had good meals.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is one of the best spots for visiting Venice! You are a ten minute walk to St. Marks, a five minute walk to the Rialto Bridge, and a 10 minute walk to the vaporetto station to the outer islands. It is also convenient because it's not on a major or crowded vaporetto stop, the Ca d'oro. The rooms are quiet and comfortable. The bathrooms could be a little cleaner for a four star hotel, but they were fine. The price is a little high, but that's how it is in Venice. Everything is a little high. The buffet breakfast was delicious with hot items and a wide assortment of other good eats. Overall it's a good hotel, and if you are visiting Venice, you should try and find a place in Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Can we give this hotel 6 stars out of 5 ? Everything was perfect from check in to check out. The staff could not have been any nicer or more professional. Our standard room was more like a junior suite with a good sized sitting area downstairs and a bedroom upstairs. Breakfast offered a huge array of choices catering to every possible taste. The common areas are gorgeous where you can enjoy compimentary afternoon tea. And what a joy it was to come back to the room after a long day of sightseeing and find a complimentary bottle of prosecco waiting for us on ice! Check in and out was quick and efficient and done with a smile. All this for a very reasonable price. We cannot imagine a better value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">good middle class hotel in venice. central, good area to explore. close to Canale Grande and to restaurants. 20 minutes walk to Piazza San Marco: the right distance for staying out of the heavy tourist hassle; north of it there is a quiet and interesting area. but not very authentic inside the hotel. clean, small rooms, thin walls. staff rather cool in the beginning, but friendly and helpful if you make a little effort too. internet in the lobby. breakfast ok, but not really italian style either. international clients from everywhere. not far from vaporetto station, which is good get there the first time and to get around while stying in Venice. I can recommend it - if your neighbours let you sleep.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Giorgione for a few days while we were in Venice. The location is not bad and the rooms are comfortable. The bathrooms were not great but they weren't filthy. The staff was also just ok, they weren't very enthusiastic about fulfilling requests but they didn't complain either. We got a great rate with the breakfast buffet included which made our stay here palatable. Buffet had a large selection of hot and cold foods and served in large room with adjoining terrace with a nice fountain. If you can get this place at a steal then it might be worth it since Venice can get very expensive. I recommend this place ONLY if you can get a good rate.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We started our trip to Italia at this hotel. It was a great location. One of the front desk staff was quite helpful and one was not! The rooms were adequate size and nicely decorated. The bathroom also was fine. We did have transport to/from the airport arranged in advance by water taxi and that was worth the extra money since it was just my daughter and myself traveling. Venice can be a little confusing on first arrival so this was a nice luxury. People were very friendly all throughout and we allowed ourselves to get lost a bit which was very easy! We loved the quaintness and quiet of Burano (the lace making island) more than the busy, tourism of Murano (for glass). It was a lovely couple nights' stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall, we were very happy with our stay at Hotel Giorgione. It was reasonably priced compared to some of the other hotels we looked at in Venice. However, be aware that the hotel has a wide range of rooms. if you pay more, the more upgraded rooms are much nicer. I stayed in a standard room for single use and it was clean but sparse and small. The bed wasn't very comfortable, but I've found that to be true for a lot of older hotels in Europe. My parents had the next higher level room and it was a good size and very elegant. The breakfast was good, the lobby and the patio are gorgeous. The hotel is less than a five minute walk from the Ca D'Oro vaporetto stop and an easy 10 minute walk away from St. Mark's square.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed only one night, so perhaps not enough time to really judge. My impressions are these. It was rather like an old dowager of a hotel whose best days are behind it. The staff was variable. Some quite gracious, some not so much. The restaurant was mediocre at best, but we only ate there for breakfast. The location was good, particularly for leaving for the airport as it was an easy walk - even with luggage to the airport boat. The room was very clean as was the bathroom. Our room had a loft for a bedroom and we both had to climb a very step stairway to get up and down. Dangerous for an old-timer like me. Especially in the middle of the night. All things considered it was far too expensive for the overall quality.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was my 5th visit to Venice and by far my favorite Hotel in Venice to date. The room was comfortable and roomy with a large bathroom w/tub. Breakfast was absolutely wonderful with a lot of choices. Eggs, ham, fruit, cereal, rolls were delicious. I can go on and on about it. I loved the lounge and 2:00 o'clock tea or coffee with cookies. Free WiFi was also a plus. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We only had reservations for 3 nights. They were able to get the 4th night for us at the same rate.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 3 nights in October - the Hotel is definitely a sanctuary from the hustle & bustle of Venice. Yes, the room was small, but it was spotlessly clean, and the staff were very friendly, much friendlier than in Florence - the front desk staff even taught me how to ask for my room number in Italiano. They also directed us to the public boat to get to Murano, rather than pushing any service they might have been getting commission from - which surprised me after Florence. Breakfast was fine, great range of cheeses, meats and breads, great coffee and very friendly service, especially when I ordered a cappucino, rather than Cafe Americain...and since when is fruit salad a breakfast food anyway? When in Europe, eat European!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My fiancee and I stayed here the day after I proposed to her on a cruise. We loved this place. It's in a great location and is small and quiet. They have lemonade and tea during the day if you want to grab a drink -- in the summer a quick drink like this is priceless. The rooms are a bit old fashioned if you will. Not how I would decorate them but not major complaints. The bed was a bit stiff. Other than that we loved it. The hotel staff was aware we were checking out very early (430am) to catch the first water taxi to the airport and was there with food bags waiting for us. They also helped us book a reservation at a nearby restaurant that threw in free champagne for us (I assume courtesy of the hotel). Absolutely recommend!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found it really was a fantastic find. The location was perfect, being 5 min from the rialto bridge and close to lots of bars, restaurants and gondalas. The breakfast was varied by italian standards, with eggs, hot meats as well as the usual continental options. The hotel is decorated beautifully and we loved sitting out in the courtyard sipping the house bellinis they were gorgeous. The rooms were a good size and very clean if there was to be one small grumble it would be that there are no ironing facilities and when we asked for an iron were told that "these buildings are wooden, it would be a hazard" which confused us as there was no ban on hair straighteners ?? All in all a lovely hotel</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ignore the last review. Clearly they had a bad experience and havent actually stayed in every hotel in Europe which they seem to suggest. Yes it is expensive. Thats the only reason it didnt get a 5 from me. As I understand it Venetian hotels are generally expensive - its a supply and demand thing. The public areas are excellent, the staff very helpful, our room was great. It was our first wedding anniversary and they had put a bottle of prosecco in there, nice touch. The room decor looked traditional venetian, as far as I could tell. Breakfast was above average, in a nice room. Location was excellent. 5 minute walk to the Rialto and 10 minutes to St Marks, yet in a quiet "off the beaten track street." Would stay here again and would recommend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in Hotel Girogione for 3 nights as part of a two week Honeymoon in Italy and couldn't have hoped for a better place to stay. We had a water taxi in from Marco Polo aiport which took 20 mins got off it and walked for 2 mins to the hotel. The hotel is decorated really well and the staff are so friendly and can speak many languages. It is 5 mins from Rialto bridge and 20 mins from St Marks squares so is ideal for exploring. It is lovely and quiet at night and the rooms are well air-conditioned. Breakfast as with all the hotel we stayed at in Italy is a continental style buffet and has plenty of variation and everything is fresh. I would have no problem recommending this hotel to anyone and it is very well priced too. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Chose this hotel after reviewing guide books and this web site and was not disappointed. Hotel was excellent in every respect. The service and staff were superb. Location is ideal in what is a small city. Breakfast buffet was more than adequate and the public areas were very comfortable and beautifully decorated. We would certainly return to this hotel if we go back to Venice. We found the city of Venice to be a unique destination, very different from any other. The traffic free streets and canals providing routes around the city take you back in time. The absence of traffic lets you hear the birds and the church bells right in the city centre. Once you get away from St Mark's square, the streets, museums and churches were very quiet at the beginning of April.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Giorgione two years ago, and like its location in the Cannaregio. The staff was still helpful, the breakfast area still lovely, the location still good, though for people who aren't big walkers, the 20-minute walk to San Marco might be an issue. I love the Cannaregio and the lovely little pasticerria down the street. Our room this time, however, was much smaller than previously. It did have a nice view over the courtyard, though. I find the hotel easy to locate, and I have a very bad sense of direction. Also, for any runners, the hotel is a good location for that, as it's easy to run down the Strada Nuova (just down the street from the hotel) and parallel streets without getting lost. We will probably still here again on our next visit to Venice.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel was booked for us by Railbookers and was easy to reach from the station. It is a very attractive building in a quiet but interesting part of this magnificent city. Our welcome was warm and friendly and having requested a quiet room we were given one opening straight on to the large inner courtyard/garden. The bedroom was decorated in a traditional style to suit the building, with pretty glass light fittings, and the bathroom was large with a wet shower area (no bath). We were aware of occasional brief noises during the night, possibly from the plumbing, but nothing that really disturbed our sleep. We ate breakfast in the courtyard, which has a fountain (turned on at 8.45am) and beautiful jasmine plants. A pretty good choice of food although limited fresh fruit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has character. Its charming and full of antiques and glass chandeliers. The staff was very friendly and they were the only hotel to acknowledge our honeymoon by giving us a complimentary bottle of champagne and a Murano glass heart. Our room was small but very cute. The breakfast was substantial and a nice addition. They had toast, pastries, fruit, cheese, etc. The location was good for us because it was right near the boat to go to the airport and was about a 15-20 minute walk from the train station, but we made it with our luggage. The only complaint we really had was that the shower had no door or curtain and the shower head sprayed alot so water went everywhere! Im sure it was more inconvenient for the staff than for us :) I definitely recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Giorgione is a bit difficult to find but this could be said of a lot of things in Venice. Likewise, it is massively overpriced but, again, this is also true of all of Venice. It's a cute hotel with lovely courtyard to enjoy throughout the day. Breakfast is very nicely done and the wait staff work very, very hard to accomodate everyone's requests. In general, the staff is very courteous and helpful. The beds are pretty "firm" (hard), even by the standards of European hotels. The hotel is pretty easy to get around in and there are a number of restaurants nearby. The A/C is somewhat questionable, but this is true of many hotels in Italy and Europe. I'm not sure I would say the hotel is a "good value" but it's a great home base for get around in one of the world's most beautiful cities.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I were a bit wary about staying at the Giorgione becuase of the mixed reviews on Tripadvisor, but the price was right (can't give an exact price because the stay was part of a complicated 3-country package) and some of the reviews made the hotel sound just OK. As it turned out, the hotel was much better than OK. Our room was good sized, especially for a European hotel, clean and comfortable. The hotel has a nice area for drinks and tea in a courtyard and offers a good (not great) breakfast, which was included in the price. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is about a 15 minute charming walk from St. Mark's and its hordes of tourists (hordes!!). We liked the location very much -- much more of a hometown Venice feel than a touristy environment. We highly recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 3 nights and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is a short (5-10min.) water bus ride from the train station. It is located just off of the square where the bus stops. It is about 150 yards from the nearest canal so if you want to stay directly on the canal you shouldn't stay here. The lobby is very nicely decorated with several little rooms to sit in and relax. They have a small bar area and offer free afternoon tea in one of the rooms off the garden. Also included was a nice breakfast which had several hot menu items as well as the usual continental stuff. There are 3 good restaurants within a 1-2 minutes walk and the main walkway is just a few steps down the way. I would definitely suggest staying here to anyone as it is very clean, convenient, and moderately priced considering how nice it is.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Out of all the hotels that we stayed in within Italy, this was by far our favorite. It has an old fashioned feeling with a grand staircase. No floor is the same. They have a large lounge area and even a pool table (which we used since it rained the entire time we were there). The breakfast was wonderful, and the HUGE venetian chandelier in the courtyard is amazing. Eat breakfast outside under the chandelier and watch the birds hop around. The rooms have venetian chandeliers and comfy beds. Small room compared to US standards, but still cozy. There are chairs for reading and watching tv. The only wierd thing is when you take a shower, half of the bathroom floor gets wet......don't let this discourage you from staying though. It is rather comical. Wonderful location, central to everything. We can't wait to return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My daughter and I stayed at this hotel Oct. 12 and 13. This hotel is elegant and unique and we loved it. The location is great and it was in a quiet area. I would not stay in the San Marco area as it is always noisy and full of people and we spoke to some other American tourists who had issues sleeping at night due to noise in that district. We had a room on the courtyard and it had a king bed - the largest room and bath we had in Italy. The staff was wonderful and the breakfast was fabulous. I travel frequenly and would recommend this hotel because it was just a wonderful place to stay. It took us 5 minutes to walk to the Rialto Bridge and maybe 10 minutes to San Marco and some of the best cafes and restaurants are a few steps from the hotel. I hope tp return to Venice and would stay again at this charming hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I lost my wife in January and needed a place I had never been before to look back and forward at the same time. There is no place better to reflect than Venice in my book. This hotel provided a place for me to do that. Agood start with the typical Italian breakfast that my wife treasured on other Italian visits: delicious brewed ice tea (with ice) and biscuits in the aftrnoon to break the 5 o'clock heat. Little things like that: beautiful tile and shiny bright fixtures in the bathroom. Great places to sit and reflect inside and outside, off the beaten track just the right amount, still close to everything. I am into authentic, and that is what I found. Room keys I had never seen the likes of before, pool table, a small bar staffed all evening, things like that made me feel I was getting a good taste of big history.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for two nights in November. The staff were all really lovely and very helpful. Unlike the other reviews, our room was on the small side. We had twin beds but there was no gap between them and not much room to walk around them but that's the luck of the draw. The room and bathroom were both clean but our room did not get made up on the second day while we were out. We also had issues with heating but luckily for us it was cold. The hotel is in a great location and we were able to walk from the train station, about 20 minutes lugging big suitcases. The hotel booked a water taxi for our trip to the airport at the end of our trip. The breakfast was quite ordinary. There is no wifi available at this hotel, the only internet is a laptop set up in a realy small phone booth next to reception. Overall a good stay and would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here 3 nights during our honeymoon and couldn't have asked for a nicer place. The rooms were clean and spacious. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful in providing directions and recommending/making reservations for restaurants. There is complimentary tea in the afternoons and during the evenings they have a nice quiet courtyard to sit in with your drinks from the bar. The area that the hotel is in is quiet in the evenings but still has several dining options close by. The 2 nearest vaparetto stops are about a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel which can get you to any part of Venice or to the other islands depending on which stop you go to. If you take a water taxi then it can let you off at a different canal stop which is only about a 2 minute walk to get to the hotel. We will definitely be staying here the next time we are in Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived around 9PM and were greeted by an extremely friendly face. We were shown to our rooms by a man that could not speak a word of English and we could not speak a word of Italian. However, we somehow communicated and were shown to our two Junior Suites. Since we expected our rooms to be smaller in Europe, we were not disappointed. We actually loved our room, 219, since it had two small bathrooms and was larger than our other junior suite in which our children stayed. Each day we were greeted with a smile and Bongiorno. We felt that the location was wonderful since it was off the beaten track and was within walking distance of everything, St Marks, Rialto Bridge, shops, restaurants, etc. We loved the quiet location after the many tourist that we encountered in all of the other locations. It was a breath of fresh air in a city that had so many summer tourists!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've always wanted to go Venice and my lovely fiancÃ© have arranged a trip to Venice on my birthday in January. He booked the hotel because my daughter has a similar name and the reviews were very good. The position of hotel is great as we stayed away from the hustle of central Venice and took a pleasure in a lovely stroll from St Marks square every night. The room was fabulous, beautiful venetian blue decor with a little sitting room and a sun terrace which we enjoyed even in winter. The breakfast was great and dinner was arranged with sister restaurant next door which was mouth watering even for my fiancÃ© who is very fussy where meals are concerned. Lastly, the staff was very friendly and always smiling and very polite. We have absolutely loved the three days in Venice and we loved the hotel so much that we are considering going back and get married there. Absolutely fantastic.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Giorgione for 4 nights last week. The rooms were clean and comfortable and nicely decorated. The bed linen and towels were changed every day. The breakfast was good with a good selection of hot and cold dishes, although the breakfast room staff were a bit dour. The reception staff were very friendly and helpful. There was tea, coffee and biscuits served in the lounge every afternoon which was nice to come back to after being out all day. The hotel's location was excellent. It was in a quiet area with only a short walk to Rialto and St Marks Square, and very convenient for the vaporetto stops both at Fondamente Nuove and Ca'D'Oro. There was a nice courtyard which would be good to sit in and have breakfast in in summer time. The hotel also had a well-stocked bar. There were some very reasonably priced restaurants nearby. I would not hesitate to return to this hotel if I was in Venice again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A friend and I stayed at the Wonderful Hotel Giorgione in Venice during our 3-stop tour of Italy 2 years ago. It was just perfect! The hotel is absolutly BEAUTIFUL and located in a great spot - not too close to the tourist attractions, but not too far that you have a long walk to see the sites. Its also close to the water taxi stop so you do not have a far walk with your luggage. The entire time we were in Venice it was raining but we didnt mind walking around with the large umbrellas the hotel provided for us. When we first arrived, my luggage didnt arrive with me. The hotel was kind enough to call the Airline and arrange for its delivery - which happened to come the night before I was to depart. The hotel serves a nice breakfast in their courtyard. And the rooms were spacious and pretty! There are several lounges in the lobby as well as internet access. I would definalty reccommend staying here if you are in Venice!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “What a great hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a great find this is. (Ignore the review of 18 August). We had 2 rooms on the very top floor with private little terraces amongst the roof tops ! All rooms in Italian hotels are small, so if you are an American looking for size rather than quality then this is not for you. Every one of the staff that we encountered had a cheery smile and went out of their way to help. Free PC in the lobby with snooker table and small bar with a delightful Indian barman. Breakfast in the courtyard next to the water feature and fountain in the sun was as romantic as it can get. Everywhere in Venice is hard to find the first time that you try so dont be put off....great location a minute or two from the Rialto bridge and a slow picturesque 10-15 minute amble to St Marks square. All you rock-an-rollers out there be warned...everyone in Venice is asleep by 10pm !..unlike France or Spain when people dont even think about going out until 10pm and midnight is not an unusual time to sit down for dinner....even with kids! A superb hotel in one of the most magical cities on earth...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Getting to this hotel is a bit of a puzzle, but get off at the Ca d'Oro, turn right at the end of the alley, follow the street until you reach the second big street, make a hard left and the hotel is right in front of you. The rooms are small by American standards, but well appointed, and the bath is excellent. Great breakfast room with a courtyard, and there is a lounge and a bar. Breakfast is good and there are even scrambled eggs and English bacon. The wait staff will gladly brew you a capucchino if you ask. The restaurant next door is popular with the locals and the waiters are a joy. The neighborhood is wonderful for wandering with lots of dark alleys and small canals. I won't waste your time with suggestions for Venice, get lost, enjoy, explore. Venice is a banquet of the unexpected. One honest word, however, there is at times the smell of raw sewage about the place. The staff is always running about spritzing the place and the rooms come with plug-in air freshners. But...in the morning, you are awakened by the bells of the nearby convent school, and the songs of children as they walk to class. Thoroughly charming.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice "Old World" Hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Giorgione in September 2011. Our room was on the first floor opening onto the inner courtyard. Overall impression of the hotel was very good. The room was clean but very small compared to US hotels. There is a safe in the room as well as hair dryers in the bathroom, but no shower curtain, not a big problem for us since we didn't have to clean it. They had free WI-FI in the lobby and bar. The hotel location is good with a grocery store & convenience store just around the corner and many restaurants nearby. You can walk to all the attractions. The Rialto Bridge is a short walk, and there is a water bus stop close by. We bought a 3 day water bus pass at the train station which I'd highly recommend since you'll be riding the water bus a lot. The hotel staff were very helpful with directions and recommendations, a must in the old city of Venice. The American breakfast was very good, however the bacon was very undercooked, almost raw. The breakfast room and the courtyard were great. One thing we found in all the Italian hotels on this trip â€“ the mattresses are uncomfortable. That being said, I would recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">the location of the hotel is fantastic. Only two stops with a Vaporetto from the airport, 5 minutes from the Rialto bridge, but a street away from the route where the masses of tourists walk. Right around the corner is a very cute wine bar, above all local go there. Breakfast can be taken in the inner courtyard, very romantic with vines, candles, a small fountain, sparrow flying in the courtyard as pidgeon on St Marc Square. If you prefer to sit inside, tables are set in white linnen and chair covers. Breakfast is served as buffet, including eggs and something like saussage or bacon. For Italy, the variety is great as usually they only drink cappuchino and eat a few cakes / cookies. The bar is open until 12 at night. The barman is fantastic and very nice and flexible. Reception is very nice, a bit stiff. :) The room are very clean, furnitured with antique furniture. For Venice, rather big as space is something that you will not find in Venice. I can only recommend the hotel. The only thing I noticed that in the mornings you hear kids playing, there must be a school or a kindergarden right behind it. Previous reviews mentioned it too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Girorgione after friends recommended it, and we weren't disappointed. Rick Steves call the hotel "garish", which I just don't get. It's close to the Rialto but isn't right on one of the main thoroughfares. The staff was extremely helpful, and the rooms were charming. We loved the painted furniture and especially the Murano glass chandelier. The breakfast was genorous and served in a bueatiful dining room, and if the weather had been just a tad warmer, we'd have been able to enjoy it in the lovely courtyard. One nice bonus is that they have a computer with free internet access right off the lobby, allowing us to check in on our email without having to find and pay for an internet cafe. The one drawback to our room was that it was over the hotel's restaurant, so there was some noise in the evenings. It looked like there were only a few rooms that would have this problem, so if you plan on turning in early, be sure and ask for a room that isn't over the restaurant. Speaking of the restaurant, we tried it but wouldn't recommend it. It's overpriced, the Trattoria da Beppi just around the corner had better food at better prices.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is 5 minutes from a Vaporetta (water bus) stop on the Grand Canal, with plenty of shops, bars and restaurants nearby. It is also within easy walking distance (5-10 minutes) of the Rialto area and St Mark's Square. The reception area and lounge is very grand with several Murano glass chandeliers, comfortable chairs and free WiFi. The reception staff (Italian) were extremely friendly and spoke good English and French (possibly other languages). Breakfast was lovely: plentiful with hot, cold, savoury and sweet items to suit all tastes. In the afternoon free tea and coffee is served in the lounge, and if you fancy a cake with it, there are bakeries less than 3 minutes away selling delicious cakes and biscuits. Our room was comfortable with sufficient drawer and wardrobe space, free safe and adjustable heating. The bathroom had both bath and shower and decent smellies. The sheets and towels were changed every day. My only small complaint is that our room was too warm, but we opened the shutters to cool things down. Our view was of the internal garden area where I believe they serve breakfast in the summer. It looked very nice. When I return to Venice this hotel will be top of my list.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice breakfast, friendly staff and good location spoiled by my final bill where we discovered several drinks that we had not consumed from the frigobar being charged. Pointed to the staff who offered refund after we had already paid as the drinks where charged as a total and not described as it should be. We got a quite good room just above of the reception facing the street which was a bit noise sometimes. The room had nice decoration spoiled by watermarks under the windows and the flush from one of the toilets that when pressed would splash water from the toilet on the floor. However the room had two toilets and showers... the TV had a maximum sound volume which was a bit too little for my ears....Now funnily enough the bill situation happened after we have been in a situation where i saw one Italian guy buying one paint and paying 20 euros and when i asked the "artist" how much he was charging for the pictures he told me that the prices where by size and the same size that the Italian guy paid 20 he asked me for 30 euros... heard some more from other people while there in Venice about being charged different amount for the same things... so watch out for the ripping-offs.... good luck and have a nice time...</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">To be fair, this is not the sort of accomodation we prefer (too many rooms, more like a real hotel than a quaint inn) but we traveled to Venice at the last minute and felt lucky to get the reservation. When I called, I was quoted a "special" last minute rate of 140 euros per night and given a confirmation number. We are seasoned travelers, but when we checked in I failed to verify the rate and on checkout, we were charged 180 euros per night. The desk clerk was very arrogant and told me it was impossible to get a room there for 140 euros and that I had misunderstood the price. He picked up the desk phone and was going to call someone to set me straight, but I just smiled and told him that was OK, no big deal. Since I had no printed confirmation, I thanked him and mentally calculated the price of that lesson learned. I was absolutely quoted 140 euros a night and the desk clerk most certainly had been through that drill before. Besides the rate problem, I felt this hotel was overpriced and more fluff than stuff. Our room was miniscule. The refrigerator was not working, the air was turned off, which shouldn't have mattered, but the mosquitos were bad and it was a very hot room. They had one computer for the internet and it was not working. I could not recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Giorgione is a Venezia jewel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'll definitely stay at the Giorgione if I get to Venice again! It was easy to find from the Vaporetto (Ca D'Oro stop), even though we arrived on a rainy night. It was convenient walking distance to most anything (San Marco, Rialto, Vaporetto stops, etc). The hotel staff had superb customer service, especially Andrea our night desk clerk. He's fluent in 5 languages, so no worries. The breakfasts are wonderful, with a variety of choices of hot and cold items, including chocolate croissants that are delightful. There was plenty of fresh fruit, so there's something for all appetites. The hotel rooms have mini-refrigerators and there are a couple of small groceries nearby. Restaurants in Venice are pricey, often including charges just to sit. We bought cold cuts, breads, fruit, soft drinks and snacks so we could have modest meals...and save for a splurge dinner. There's a courtyard with tables/chairs, plus a large sitting area near the lobby, with clusters of couches/chairs/coffee tables so you can relax at the hotel outside the rooms. Our room was a little small...it is Europe...but with excellent amenities and extremely clean. Newspapers in multiple languages are provided in the downstairs seating area, and one common area computer is available for 30 minutes at a time. Tell Andrea we said hello!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place was an absolute delight! From the moment we came dragging our luggage toward the front door (after having scrambled on and off of a water bus on a hot day) the front desk staff was ready to serve. A uniformed bellman came outside to help me with my enormous suitcase! When we stepped inside, we knew we were in for a real treat. This hotel was decorated beautifully in rich reds and golds and greens. There is a very generous sitting area near the lobby as well as an absolutely beautiful sitting/eating area out back. There are glass chandeliers everywhere and an air of elegance wherever you look. My room was small, but lovely, and the bathroom was large, by European standards. They served iced tea and cookies every afternoon near the outdoor fountain, and the breakfast in the morning was fabulous! There were hot and cold selections, and the variety was really generous. Again, uniformed employees kept things replenished. We enjoyed our meal outdoors, but we also had the option of eating in the dining area indoors. There is a full-service bar near the lobby, too, so it was easy to have a nice glass of wine before heading out to dinner. The front desk was very helpful with maps and suggestions, too. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. It was definitely the nicest accommodation of our entire two-week trip!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Hotel Giorgione in July this year with a girl friend, I agree with the previous review, the address given on the website we booked through [--] was confusing and we ended up getting of the water bus at Rialto bridge, walking over the bridge (with 13 pound suitcases) only to find it was on the other side!! And it was HOT. For reference, Ca d'Oro is closer. We stayed in a twin bedroom on the second floor (265 if memory serves), it was small but well appointed with plenty of storage space. There is free air-con in the room which was nice on an evening. Rialto Bridge only 2 mins away and St Marks Square in walking distance, the receptionist said it was a 20 min walk but we found a short cut of only 8 or so mins (although I can't remember it now!). The staff were very courteous and helpful, the latest we got back was 1am and there was a night receptionist for entry and keys. Breakfast was a typical Continental affair but plentiful. Afternoon tea (served by the decorative pool from 2-5) was a lovely touch and just what we needed after a hot day of sightseeing. The location was great, I'm glad we didn't stay in St Marks Square as it was way cheaper and we explored more of the city. We went for a friends wedding (which was beautiful), if you are going for the same reason the Town Hall is just by Rialto Bridge and to the left. Would definately stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My 83 year old mother has dreamed of going to Venice. Having been before, I knew that a good hotel would be essential to her enjoying this beautiful city. Boy, did we luck out when we found the Giorgione! The hotel is exactly what you dream of-- all the charms of old world Venice with the comforts of current day-- air conditioning, technology, and best of all- a FANTASTIC STAFF! These people go all the way to ensure guests have a great stay. Our room was fantastic-- located right off of a beautiful courtyard with a fountain, flowers, and little birds-- the perfect place to enjoy breakfast or relax in after a day of sightseeing. The hotel is very quiet- we didn't hear a sound at night. The breakfast room is beautiful-- and the selection of food is wonderful. The hotel is located off of a wonderful square where there are restaurants, trees, and benches to sit and enjoy the atmosphere. It was the perfect balance of access to the waterbus, and tourist sights while also being out of the crowds. There are some great places nearby to get meals, gelato, and a glass of wine. Around the corner is a coop grocery store. The direct waterbus to murano and burano was just a few blocks behind the hotel-- saving a lot of time. We really felt like we were able to experience the "true venice" while staying at the Giorgione. Having stayed in other hotels in venice, i HIGHLY recommend the Giorgione.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Venice hotel rates seem to fluctuate a lot, and I've found that a good way to track down a deal is to look at sites like kayak and sidestep and see who is offering a good deal for the nights you need. That's how I found the Giorgione. Kayak led me to gtahotels, which had the Giorgione for only $150/night. After checking the reviews on tripadvisor, I could tell this was a quality, well-located property -- and the price was much better than I could find for comparable hotels -- so I booked it. It was a good choice. Rick Steves calls the hotel "garish," and that is one of the few times I've seen Steves be completely off-base. It is a VERY nicely decorated Venitian hotel, with plenty of the glass that Venice is famous for. The courtyard and all the public rooms look very spiffy. I found the reception staff to be warm and helpful. And breakfast was much better than what you normally get in Italy, with plenty of meats, cheeses, fruit, bread, etc. -- and even bacon and eggs. I think rooms are very variable at this property, but most seem to be of at least 4-star quality. We had a charming room in the courtyard, with Venitian glass windows and antique furnishings. Very attractive. For the price paid, we really couldn't have asked for more. The location is outstanding: not hard to find, and right in the middle of things without being TOO crowded and touristy. If you can get a good deal here like we did, book it!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Hotel!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for 7 nights on our Honeymoon. This charming hotel is a great representation of Venice and its spirit. It is located in a quiet area with great shops (many of the products sold in this area are the same as the ones sold downtown but are much LESS expensive) and restaurants and is within walking distance of every attraction. Our room was a junior suite with a private patio. The room is bigger than average for the area and it was cleaned every day. The staff was also helpful and polite. The breakfast was excellent and make sure to try the jelly croissants! There is seating inside or outside (there is also a nice seating area outside on a second level overlooking a decoration pool). There is iced tea and cookies served in the afternoon. The bar serves many drinks and a pool table is nearby. The lobby has a large seating area perfect for taking pictures. Internet access is also available. Make sure to see theatre, opera and definitely go on a Gondola ride (it is best at night as the canals are quiet). A guide book and a map will make your stay enjoyable as it will be easy to locate attractions. We used â€œTop 10 de Veniseâ€� which detailed all the main attractions spread over a 7 day stay. Dining in Venice is an experience all by itself. The flavors and the quality of the food will enchant you in all the areas of this great city! Pastas are simply delightful. We will definitely return to this hotel the next time we visit Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Hotel Giorgione from 8/29 to 9/1. I was a little worried about finding the hotel in the narrow windy streets of Venice, but it was very easy to find. You can see the hotel from the piazza at Campo di S.S. Apostoli if you look to your left after you reach the piazza from the Caâ€™dâ€™Oro stop. One of the pictures Iâ€™ve attached is this view. We reserved a standard double room for 100 euro a night on their website, but they must have upgraded us because we ended up with a junior loft room. The room was huge, very nice, and was always clean. The carpeting was a little old and could be replaced. The bathroom was very large with a bathtub and double sinks. It is the largest bathroom Iâ€™ve seen in all the three and four star hotels Iâ€™ve stayed in Europe. The one downside to the bathroom is that it could take up to 10 minutes to get any warm water in the shower. The cost of breakfast was included in the cost of the room so we had it everyday. The breakfast was one of the worst we had during our two weeks in Italy. The assortment of food was good, but the â€œhotâ€� food was lukewarm or cold, and the coffee (American drip-brewed) was also lukewarm or cold. The morning we checked out we had breakfast the minute they opened and the coffee and food were finally hot. The other mornings we would typically get down there 30-60 minutes after they opened. The hotel staff was very nice and friendly, and while we donâ€™t expect everyone to speak English, their English was very good. We would stay here again on a return trip to Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After doing a little research, my friend gave me a list of hotels that she thought would be nice for our trip to Venice, one of which was the Hotel Giorgione. The reviews on Expedia were excellent, so I thought it was a good pick. I was wrong! Not only is the hotel quite far from the Piazza San Marco (I was aware of this as I had stayed in the Canareggio the last time I was in Venice) it was not terribly easy to find with the bad directions the Venetians gave us. Five minutes away! Close! No, it was more like at least 20 more minutes away and not close! The front desk staff was fairly helpful. One woman was extremely kind and helpful, the other was disinterested. The internet (one computer in the lobby) was very fast and free, which was a plus, but be prepared to wait a while if someone else is using it. The breakfast I found to be very yummy (fluffy eggs and bacon cooked just right - not burnt!) but lacking in fresh orange juice - sorry, only canned pineapple juice here! I would not go back again due to the location (it was a major ordeal to lug all of our stuff all around the city) but have to say the reviews were partially right, the staff can be nice, the breakfast was good enough, and the place is quaint. But be prepared for TINY rooms (the bathroom was bigger than the sleeping area) and a hotel that is more like a B&B, not even a 3 1/2 or 4 star. The pictures make the courtyard look larger and nicer than it is. It was sort of cute, but it was definitely in need of some renovation to make it look like it did in the pictures. One thing that saved the whole place was the bathroom had recently been redone and was very clean.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed for three nights at the end of March 2006, having booked through Expedia for c.60GBP per night. We were extremely happy with the hotel and have no complaints at all. We found the staff to be welcoming, helpful and efficient - we were shown around the hotel and to our room by a polite young lady. Extra pillows arrived only minutes after requesting them. Breakfast was included in the deal and was very nice; all the usual fruit, cereals, croissants etc as well as come nice hot food (bacon and egg) too. Only one minor disappointment - you have to pay extra for fruit juice. Never mind, the breakfast room is done out beautifully and the food was of a high standard. The reception, lounge and breakfast rooms are all very pleasant. The billiards table is free, as is the internet access. There's a nice lounge where complimentary tea, coffee and biscuits are available in the afternoon. There's a small courtyard too. Our room, although quite small, was fine for a short break; the bed was a little hard but everything was clean, and the wardrobe contained a safe which was free to use. The location of the hotel is great; two minutes walk from the Ca d'oro vaporetto station on the grand canal. It's maybe 10 or 15 mins walk to Piazza San Marco. The hotel is tucked away up a side street where it's nice and quiet. There are plenty of restaurants close by. To be honest, Venice is so small that nowhere is *too* far away... I can't fault it for the money. Sure, there are fancier hotels in Venice, but you pay through the nose for them. The Giorgione is clean, safe, well-positioned and offers good value for money. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from a six night stay in Venice and our stay at the Giorgione Hotel was a tremendous pleasure! I had stayed here in May 2001, and so when the search began for a second visit to Venice, I kept my previous stay here in mind, but I did want to search other options. When I weighed location and price, I decided to go with my gut and reserved our stay at a tried and true hotel. What an excellent decision!! Il Giorgione has remained absolutely pristine, gracious and a gem in a delightful little piazza close to everything you'd want. It is located right off Strada Nuova, a very bustling main thoroughfare and yet in the Campo SS Apostoli you are enveloped in everyday Venetian life, with a true neighborhood feeling. Easy to find (CÃ¡ D'oro Vaporetto stop), 15 minute walk to Piazza San Marco, 5 minutes to Rialto, and yet quiet enough at night to relax and stroll in peace. The room was immaculate, spacious and flooded with light from windows facing a small canal and a flower laden side street. The front desk was staffed with really pleasant, professional people who always had time for questions and good recommendations. (There is a wonderful,repeat wonderful, restaurant just down the street and around a corner called La Vechia Cava.) Breakfast served either in the courtyard by a lovely fountain or inside in a very pretty room, was really nice with the typical buffet spread, yet each morning there were one or two selections that were different.The lobby is very prettily decorated in high Venetian fashion with alot of comfortable seating affording a pleasant spot to wind down and have a drink, coffee, etc. I highly recommend this hotel, would not hesitate to return as I consider it to have enhanced my visit to this magnificent city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Giorgione was a mixed bag. On the one hand, the location was great, enabling easy walks to the Rialto Bridge and San Marco Square. A cozy wine bar is literally right next door as well, and down a small street is a lovely square where vendors set up shop and some of the few trees in Venice proper can be found. It only took us one full day to familiarize ourselves with the city and our immediate surroundings, and we soon felt right at home in the quaint, romantic town. The lobby areas in the hotel are well-kept (but beware the pics they display on their website - all our photoshopped and the colors are no where near as vibrant) and the daily breakfast was varied and delicious. The staff are extremely helpful and accommodating as well. I know the last point first hand as our initial room was an oversized closet. We literally had to climb over our suitcases to reach the bathroom. There were also stains on the walls and a few on the sheets. The next day I stopped by the front desk to voice my concerns and was pleased with a phone call later in the day from the manager offering us an upgrade. We immediately accepted and what a difference it made. The second room was over twice the size, spotless and altogether charming. Moral of the story: if you choose the Giorgione, be sure to book a suite. We were also treated to a complimentary bottle of champagne upon our arrival (it was our honeymoon) and thoroughly enjoyed the terrace just a flight down from our room and the lovely courtyard. All in all I would recommend the Hotel Giorgione to those looking for a Venetian hotel that's a few notches above average (but not exceptional) in a great location that won't knock your socks off but won't let you down either.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at the Giorgione Hotel for 3 nights in early July. We found it to be a great hotel, and would definitely stay there again if we returned to Venice. The spacious, traditionally decorated hotel is located in a great area â€“ itâ€™s only about 20 minutes (at a leisurely pace) by foot to St. Markâ€™s Square, but youâ€™d never know because you lose track of time when passing by many great shops, restaurants and other attraction while on your way there. While it is located in a fairly busy area, the hotel is just off a main square, so there is no noise or bustling crowds at night. For Europe, our hotel room would be considered fairly large. It was tastefully decorated, clean, with air conditioning (very important for Veniceâ€™s humidity!) TV, and lots of closet/desk space. The bathroom was large, even for North American standards with a bathtub that included a shower with great water pressure. The buffet breakfast was great (have it in the outside courtyard) with your standard continental choices, as well as eggs, bacon and sliced meats. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We inquired about taking the train to Verona for a day trip, and the desk clerk even printed us a schedule, and gave us tips as to which station was the closest. TIP: If arriving by the water taxi from the airport, the taxi may not stop at the Ca dâ€™Oro stop (it stops at Rialto). If this is the case, please pay the 6.50 Euros to then take the Vaporetto (water bus) the one extra stop to the Ca dâ€™Oro stop! Venice is a city with many, many mini foot bridges, all with steps. If you get off with your luggage at Ca dâ€™Oro, itâ€™s a short, flat distance to the hotel. While Rialto stop is close distance-wise, youâ€™ll be dragging your luggage up and down the steps of many foot bridges on the way to the hotel. Buy your tickets for all at the airport. A wonderful hotel!</p></li>
