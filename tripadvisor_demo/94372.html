Parking situation is also horrible....not very many spots and in a very sketchy lot. Location is the only thing this place has going for it...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Took a chance on an old hotel due to its proximity to Fenway Park. Was pleasantly surprised....very pleased with the cleanliness of the room and courteous staff. While the furnishings were not plush, they were adequate. A super value and the 2-3 minute walk to the ballpark was very convenient.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had never been to Boston before and really didn't know where to stay. We took a shot in the dark with the Buckminister. To say the least we were very pleased with the selection. The front desk staff was great! We were greeted with a warm smile (nice to weary travelers) and even given an upgrade to a two bedroom suite. I believe that the attendants name was Gary. We walked to Fenway Park. Great location and good price!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Price was very reasonable. Location was at Kenmore Square and many things were in walking distance.

The layout of the breakfast was awkward which led to very slow moving lines although the breakfast eating area was very adequate.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This old hotel has been updated and has excellent and accommodating staff. The furnishings are old and rooms and suites oddly shaped, which adds a sort of quirky personality. Not for those who want pristine accommodations but clean and friendly. Good wi-fi. Beds can sometimes be overly firm, but the staff will switch out rooms if they have them. Crowded during baseball season since it's just across a small bridge from Fenway Park.</p></li>

However, when we came to check out, they charged us more than we were quoted on the phone.

I even forgot my camera and they had it shipped out to me that same day!! As for the price you can't get hotels for this cheap anywhere else unless they are trashy. The Buckminster is NOT! It is old but its charming. I love it and will use it every time!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from our 3 day trip to Boston over the 4th of July. We loved the Buckminster and would without a doubt stay there again. Of course, it didn't hurt that my son and his family had the green monster as their view and my oldest grandson opened the window listened to the crowd as he watch the game on TV our first night. It was close to restaurants, the subway, the Charles River, everything we wanted. The staff was absolutely great and the rooms while old, were very clean and we had plenty of hot water for showers. Thanks!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Buckminster Hotel has undergone extensive renovations recently and they have done a great job maintaining the historic character of the hotel while at the same time providing all the modern amenities you expect when traveling. It is only a 1 minute walk to Boston's public transportation system and just a short drive to all of Boston's tourist attractions. The hotel is across the street from Fenway Park and would be a great place to stay if you are going to see a Red Sox game. Plenty of shopping and restaurants within walking distance.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had a dulux queen room. It was all I needed. Modern bathroom, cable tv, window (with a view of a brick wall, but didn't matter as I only slept there an didn't need a view). It was clean, well maintained. Building was a bit dated but I believe they are refurbishing. The location is fantastic. Right near Kenmore station so its easy to get around. Only issue was the price of the room - it was very small so it seemed a bit much to pay as much as I did, but I guess I was really paying for the location which really makes up for it. I'd stay here again for sure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were looking for an accessable place to stay while close to Fenway... This place can't be beat! Price moderate $109 a night is good for the location. Room is clean and bath is decent. Not much to look at but great for tired people who don't freak out about everything. We had no trouble getting from the Logan airport to the hotel via the Metro. Get a $2 "Charlie" card to travel one way... nice! Then we took the Freedom Trail which is alot of walking but worth it. Once you are tired and a bit cold stop into the Au Bon Pain, where you can get a hot meal for cheap.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall the hotel was not bad. True, there are planks that you have to walk across, but they are renovating, what do you expect? The room we had was not exactly sparkling, but it was clean, and it didn't smell like grease or vomit. I had an incredible view of the city and a view of the Park from the bedroom. The staff was very very helpful and nice. If you want a four star hotel, go stay at the Marriott and pay 289 dollars a night. I used the room just for sleeping and had a wonderful stay, and the price was very reasonable especially for being so close to the Park and the excitement.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Worst hotel ever, unless you are looking for a crack house. Construction has been ongoing for years and I don't think the bedsheets had been cleaned since the construction began. Jumping in the Boston Harbor would have provided cleaner and warmer water than the showers here. Tip for travellers: though the nightly rate is cheap, I would not stay here again even if I was offered a free night's stay. STAY AWAY FROM THE BUCKMINSTER! A fitting quote from another trip advisor review was: "I thought a homeless person was going to jump out of the closet and kill my family while we were sleeping".</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here because it was pet friendly, in Boston, in an area I really enjoy. The room was just an embarrassment. It was really awful. They charge a 75$ deep cleaning fee for pets- I don't think this hotel has been deep cleaned since the 1980s. That being said- there were some advantages- 1. free overnight parking on Beacon street after meters go off at 6am as long as you move by 8pm which works perfect for someone driving to work in the city 2. great sushi restaurant conjoined to hotel 3. right near fenway park!! lots of bars around the area also I really don't think I would stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Buckminster has had it's entire lobby remodeled and is much improved. Rooms were clean and acceptable. Bathroom was small, but I haven't found a hotel room with an acceptable size bathroom yet (especially shower). Room was PLENTY big enough. We had a great experience at the Buckminster. Staff was very friendly to us. If you're looking for a Ritz Carlton room, it's not here, but it's not as bad as other reviews make it out to be. Some people just are never happy. We stayed at the Buckminster over Patriot's Day weekend and was an ideal spot for staying after a Sox game, or taking in the Marathon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I read other reviews before booking my stay, some were negative but I booked it anyway. This hotel could not have been better, we have stayed at the Howard Johnson most of my visits in the past. The Buckminster puts them to shame I will stay at this hotel at all my visits from now on. The rooms were very nice. The elevator is a bit small but that was not a problem. If you go to a hotel for the size of the evevator then stay home. The staff was very professional and seamed as they really cared about my stay. The rooms were clean and well stocked. We could see the green monster from my room. I think for my experience this hotel was under charging for our visit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nothing really to say about the Buckminster. It was fine. Yes the furniture is old and chipped, but it is very clean and reasonably well maintained. The walls are thin, but if you are just using this as a place to sleep while you tour the city, there is nothing that wrong with it. The temperature control (or lack there of) is the only major drawback; our room was warmer than we like it, but not uncomfortable. The breakfast is what you would expect: fruit, cereal, toast etc. Nothing warm (eggs, waffles etc.). The location is fantastic. This is not a luxury hotel by any stretch, but it is a clean, safe reasonably priced hotel two and a half minutes from Fenway Park.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The staff at this hotel is Outstanding in customer service and friendliness. The hotel itself is a very old property, with all the quaintness and charm of a historic building. The room was fairly basic, no frills, but good sized. Nice refrigerator and microwave for convenience, but no coffee maker. Only one electrical outlet besides one in the bathroom, so charging personal electronics was a challenge. The bed was super comfortable. This is a great location, just a few steps away from the Kenmore station, Boston University and Fenway Park. What the rooms lacked, the staff more than made up for. I can overlook a few minor items, as long as I'm treated well. Thank you!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I wanted to take my British fiance to see my old college-town during Easter. I was happy to see the Buckminster in good shape offering excellent value for its handy location right in Kenmore Square. It is a well-maintained older boutique hotel with an interesting layout winding around a curving building. The associated Japanese restaurant has always offered excellent breakfast (included I believe) and the dinner sushi, etc. is good as well. We ventured out all over Boston with the Buckminster as our base. Cabs are easy to find, subway is right there, we easily walked to Newbury Street and onwards to the Common/Boston Public Gardens, Chinatown, Fanieul Hall, North End, etc.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We read the reviews on Trip Advisor and reluctantly decided to stay at the Buckminster anyway. The Buckminster is an older hotel that is less than a 5 minute walk to Fenway Park and to a T-Stop. We could see Fenway Park from our window. We were pleasantly surprised with the hotel. We stayed in a one-bedroom, two room suite that had a king sized bed. Although the bathroom was a bit tiny, the suite was spacious and clean. The continental breakfast had cold cereal, bagels, assorted pastries and doughnuts, coffee and juice. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful. The Buckminster is not a five-star hotel, but we enjoyed our stay there and will book a room there again in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location, the free continental breakfast was such a bonus and included toast, cereals, fruit and pastries. A taxi is about $15 to great into the centre of Boston / Long Warf. Uno's Grill is a great place to eat, good value for money and a large choice. There is a 7 eleven down the road and the hop on hop off trolley picks up at Fenway park which is virtually next door. The staff are extremely helpful and the business centre has good internet access for a fee. There is onsite laundry at total cost for a large load including drying and powder is $5 (quarters needed). This is a hidden gem with large rooms, including microwave and fridge, however there are no tea and coffee facilities in the room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is going to become my new home away from home! Stayed here for four nights in early July (including July 4th). Check in was easy, got a double room on the 6th floor. So close to Fenway Park (major plus for a huge Red Sox fan) that I felt I could throw a baseball onto the Green Monster from my room!! There's a Uno Chicago Grill in the same building, plus more restaurants close (or, for those who prefer fast food, a McDonald's over the road and Popeye's next door), and an awesome burger joint called uBurger just a three minute walk away. Kenmore T station is right there as well. Room was exactly what I needed - comfy bed with a good shower (and good toiletries as well). Looking forward to going back!!!</p></li>

The desk folks were amazingly polite, smart, and helpful. Great location to BU and to Fenway. Best deal on sushi right in the hotel. They are working on some remodeling which made a few hallways dusty, but that did not encroach into the rooms. Plus, it'll be even better when they are done. I saw another person had an issue mere days before I was there. Quite frankly, I think that person is crazy. I stayed 12 nights and when I return to Boston, I'll stay there without hesitation. Bring an ethernet cable for free internet. (That's a secret)</p></li>

It's central (i.e. walking distance) to our guest boathouse, shops, downtown, food and Fenway (although it was after post-season). It met all of our needs (4 women and 2 spouses, all in our mid to late 30s). Would I be happy if this was my honeymoon hotel? No. For a college reunion weekend and/or visiting local colleges, hitting up a Sox game, or otherwise paying for it on my own dime, it was great.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location to Fenway, other than that, there is nothing to look forward to here. We stayed one night. Arrived at 4:30 and dropped off our bags to head to Fenway. Upon our return at 12:30AM we got a good look at what we were in for.... Construction aside, Our room was filthy: the carpet, the furniture, the doors Our bathroom had hair and a half used container of shampoo on the floor Our fridge had some leftovers in it There was also a room key left from the previous visitors. When I notified the desk of this upon check out they responded "Oh really? Ok I will let housekeeping know." No apology, no offer of any sort of discount.Wwe were just happy to be getting out of there! I hope the construction makes some big improvements!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My check-in was past midnight yet I was greeted with a smile, they seemed all prepared and keys were made available immediately. I felt welcomed after 22 hours of traveling. The room was spotlessly clean. Next morning the front desk and all staff were gracious guiding me to my destination. Surprisingly I had booked through an overseas call. The General Manager Mr. Jonathan E. Colter is a thorough gentleman. He guides his staff to proficiency. My observation about the Hotel Staff was that they are courteous and extremely accommodating to each ones needs. Having traveled widely I would say this stay was one of the most enthralling and relaxing of all experiences. The breakfast is the best start for the day. I highly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I were in Boston for only 1 night and didn't want to spend an arm and a leg for a less than 24 hour visit. We were flying out of Boston and basically needed a place to sleep. This hotel was the only place close to $200 in a reasonable area. We should have gone with the Westin at close to $400. It was a big room with fireplace and a huge bathroom and that's about where the compliments end. It was so tired looking and could be such a beautiful room. The furniture was pretty damaged and worse off than I could find at a garage sale. The comforter and blanket on the bed disgusted me. The front desk staff was friendly, the complimentary breakfast basic (but appreciated) and the location not bad. I wouldn't suggest this hotel to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I know that it is one of the oldest hotels in Boston so understand that it is not brand spanking sparkly. The lobby is very attractive but the bedrooms could do with a lick of paint and new carpets and sad that pipes run across ceiling. The front desk staff were all very charming and helpful so absolutely no criticism there. The complimentary breakfast was fine but the waste involved in using paper/plastic disposable plates and cutlery strikes me as very wasteful and unnecessary. For baseball lovers it must be heaven as it overlooks Fenway Park. Very conveniently located for Boston sightseeing but make sure you get off at the correct subway stop, we got off at the wrong one and had a long walk. Incidentally their public transport system is excellent.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room was smaller than most hotels we have stayed in whilst in the USA (and dearer) However our research had shown when we booked the hotel months ago that there really was nothing else available that suited our criteria. The room itself was clean, quiet and comfortable. The hotel itself is easily accessible from public transport (the T) and trolley bus tours of the city, stop at Fenway Park, which is only a few hundred metres behind the hotel. Free continental breakfast was more than adequate especially compared to a few of the chain motels we have used. The night we arrived, they were having trouble with their internet, having installed a new system that day. You now only get 60 minutes free for the day and it will cost you $3 an hour or $10 a day after that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for one night to watch a game at Fenway Park. Its location is the best and closest to the park. It served the purpose of proximity, cleanliness, and comfort. It was not deluxe by any stretch of the imagination, but the front desk staff was so helpful and courteous which helped to make up for few of the missing amenities . There was no coffee pot in the room with complementary coffee for the morning. I like that as a feature in a hotel room. I don't want to go down 6 floors with no make up and straight out of bed just to get a morning cup of coffee. The Fenway park view from my room was awesome though and it was neat to open up the window and hear the sights, sounds and smells of the pregame festivities. I would definitely stay again if going to a game.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you want to have a place to drop your things right next to Fenway, it's perfect. If you want to sleep, it's awful. The king bed we had in our room would have been more comfortable to sleep on if it had a top layer of wood to soften it. SOOOOO uncomfortable & hard. When we got to the room it was very hot and stuffy so I asked them to turn the air on, once it was on - it wouldn't go off! It turned into an icebox. The control in the room had no control over the temp! The overall cleanliness of the room was poor. I wouldn't walk barefoot in there. The 2 TV's in our room were the old box style and very small, and our room was an upgrade! I can only imagine what the original room was like! The inside of this hotel desperatley needs updating. Definately NOT worth the price they charge.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had no problems with the staff or cleanliness of the room. The proximity to BU is amazing--I did not have to take the T to get to my daughter's dorm which was nice. However, one thing I had an issue with is that they advertise that there is free wireless for internet. It is free for one hour a day. After that, it is $10 a day. I am kind of surprised I didn't see that on any of the reviews here. And that $10 a day is for the basic internet, to get faster is $20 a day. Other than that, I had no other issues. Oh, and the 'business center' -- unless you are using the computer to print your boarding pass, there is a charge for that as well. I have found another place to stay at that does include wireless and is just better for me (only I do have to take the T to get to BU), but I can live with that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Listen to other reviews with caution. I stayed there for 3 nights, and it was the worst 3 nights of my life. First night the fire alarm went off at 3am, false alarm. Second night same alarm, again false alarm. And when I left the hotel they charged both my credit cards with the full amount of the stay. And it is true it is under construction. So it smells, and looks like a construction site. "Complementary" breakfast was the worst I have ever had, burned coffee, and greasy eggs, with burned bacon. Honestly if you like to pay alot and sleep at a construction site the Buckminster is for you. Yes location is great, but any location on a subway line is great in Boston. Public transport is clean, safe, and cheap as hell, take advantage of it! I suggest to any traveler, stay anywhere but the Buckminster.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is directly opposite Boston University. It claims to be "restored to its prior grandeur". I was looking for a nice, inexpensive hotel for my family to attend a seminar at Boston U. I assumed since it was across the street that it would be nice. $150.00 for the night. The parking for the hotel was below street level and there were burned out cars, trash and very unsecured parking. That should have been my first indication of what we would find. The lobby was ok. Old, but ok. The upstairs was horrible. The rooms looked like old dorm rooms from the 1970s. They had a small kitechenette in each room. The furnishings were old, the linens were old, the walls were cracked and dirty. The place was just awful. We stayed and slept and got right out. Please do not stay- I cant imagine anyone being comfortable there.</p></li>

Many restaurants, fast foods,bars, banks in the surroundings.Barnes&Noble crossing the street.Fenway park and a mall with cinemas,restaurants, and several stores at walking distance.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am a devoted fan of TripAdvisor, and I decided to head to Boston last weekend to watch the Superbowl. After looking on tripadvisor, i settled on the Hotel Buckminster, and boy was i glad i did. This hotel is in a perfect location near Fenway Park. It is a bit out of the way from the more touristy areas, but the Kenmore Square Green line subway is next door, and easy access to all of Boston. We arrived and met a very nice fellow named Scott, and while check-in was at 3, he allowed us to go up to our room at 1. The room was small, but clean, and very comfortable with a Queen bed. It was a cute hotel setup, since the building is sort of like a horseshoe shape. I wasn't aware, but the famous architect Mr. White (of McKim, Mead, White fame) designed this! Anyhow, the hotel was clean, the staff wonderful, and for an inexpensive place which is next to Fenway, i highly recommend it!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This historic hotel was perfectly acceptable. It reminded me of various affordable European hotels I have stayed in. No, it's not brand new. But it has a lot of character. They don't make them like this anymore. Two foot thick exterior walls, high ceilings, and big, double paned windows. It was clean, and uninfested, unlike what others have written. Really, I have no idea what they saw or even if they were in the same hotel. The staff were all very helpful and courteous. It was close to everything we needed including restaurants, shopping, the subway, various universities, even Fenway Park. I have no complaints. We had wireless internet available in our room, the a/c was plenty cold, the water was plenty hot, there was a microwave and a fridge, and we even were able to upgrade to a larger set of rooms for a minimal charge, so there were two TVs. I would stay there again. Affordable with old world charm.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at The Buckminster five times when I was in grad school in Boston. The first couple of times were okay, but the last three stays were awful. "The Bucky's" location in Kenmore Square is super convenient to Fenway (across the street) and to the subway stop. It's relatively cheap and the rooms are okay. The hotel staff is courteous but refused to upgrade me... no perks for frequent stays. I asked for a quiet room and they gave me the noisiest room in the hotel (facing Fenway Park) with night game lights, noisy Boston Red Sox fans, seriously loud street noise and the commuter rail. If you stay there ask for a room that does not face Fenway! The air conditioning was on the fritz during two summer stays. Rooms are hot and stuffy, and with all the noise you can't really open the windows. Winter stays were more pleasant. This hotel is good for students and Red Sox Fans, not good for families, the eldery.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 3 nights. Boston hotels are notoriously expensive and this was the best deal we could find (on Expedia). The room was unexciting initially but clean and comfortable and spacious for a hotel which seemed to be a labyrinth of corridors. The staff on reception were very helpful and friendly and the complementary continental breakfast was very good (kept fully restocked and fresh). The hotel is next to Fenway park (Boston Red Sox home ground) with plenty of bars and restaurants nearby (within walking distance). It's also close to a T stop (the underground) and bus stops so easy to get into the main tourist areas. It's also easy walking distance to most places in the guidebooks. As a rough guideline - you can walk to Copley Square in ~15 minutes, ~25 minutes walk to Boston Public Gardens and the Freedom Trail and in ~25-30 minutes to the Aquarium and Quincy Market. And it's a nice walk! p.s. do a Duck Tour!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I took this hotel for my first 2 days, as the one I wanted was not available, and it was a good surprise. Their website looks like old and they are underrated in here. They are a cross-street to the red line (best subway line in boston) , with lots of restaurants very close to it (from mcdonalds to very nice pizza and steak house places) ..there are some bars and nightlife too, since it is very close to the Boston University Campus. In fact, many guests of this hotel are young and polite, looking for good prices and a nice stay. Staff is really nice and the room is comfy, very good bed and a good shower too. Everything is clean and do not smell bad (I though it would be since it has an old appearance on the website). It is cheaper than most of the other places and a good option for who is willing to save money and time with transportation. They have 1 hour free wifi, and them u have to pay (only thing I disliked about it).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I traveled to Boston for a consult at the Children's Hospital and decided to make the trip more fun for my 9yo son. What drew me to the Buckminster was the price (on-line deal of $88) and that it was so close to the T. Parts do appear to be in various phases of renovation. This did not take away from the "Old Boston" charm. The room was more than adequate, the breakfast was very good, and most importantly the the customer service was superior. The clerk even called our room about 15 minutes after we go there to see how my son liked the view. Our room looked right out onto the Green Monster. As a mom traveling with a young child, I felt very safe there. They went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. My only complaint is that the room was very warm and we could not control the temp. We opened the window for a little while and it was fine. The clerk said I could have just called and they would have lowered it from there. Next time!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I highly recommend this hotel, especially for travelers who want to stay downtown for a reasonable price. The service staff was consistently stellar-recommended restaurants, gave directions and held our baggage until check-in time. Other reviews have mentioned that the amenities/furnishings are not up to date, and that's correct. However, it's nothing serious. The beds were super-comfortable and the kitchenette and bathroom were clean. We loved our Fenway view and there was great atmosphere on game nights. The hotel is close to transportation and restaurants. One tip--it seems as though the air conditioning must be turned on by the front desk staff in order for the room thermostat to work. We called down to the front desk on the two occassions when the AC didn't seem to be working and they had it back working within 5 minutes. Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend the Buckminster. The staff alone is reason enough to book, but the hotel also has great charm.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was taking my son to a Red Sox game and wanted to find a hotel close to Fenway Park. I reserved a room at the Buckminster and was glad I did. It is virtually a 30 second walk to the park. Being so close to Fenway and the atmosphere that surrounds it was priceless. The hotel is older than Fenway, but has lots of character. We received a free upgrade at check-in to a room that had partial view of the park. Sure, the roomâ€™s furnishings and color scheme were a bit outdated. But, it was clean, comfortable and most of all, affordable. Our rate was $139, included a continental breakfast and discounted parking at only $18 a night (the garage was charging $40 to non hotel guests). We had a partial view of the park from our room, but some of the rooms had better views. What we enjoyed the most about this hotel was the staff at the front desk, they were genuinely friendly, welcoming and very helpful, and that contributed to a great trip! I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A historic hotel in the middle of Kenmore Square around the corner from Fenway & many restaurants!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is an old, but clean & comfortable hotel. It's easy to find. There's a T station right down the street (which is how we traveled), but plenty of parking nearby if you choose to drive. Fenway is a walk around the corner. We hit Boston Beer Works for dinner, always delicious! We have stayed here before in one of the smallest rooms, which is fine if you're heading to a Sox game and aren't planning to spend hours in the room. This time we had a 2 bedroom apartment with a living room, small refrigerator & microwave. Great if you have 4 or more people! The hotel has an interesting history. Babe Ruth was a frequent guest & it is said that the World Series scandal involving Shoeless Joe Jackson was set up at Buckminster! Expect some noise such as sirens in the middle of the night...you are sleeping on a main intersection in the middle of Boston, but it's bearable. And if you have a room like we did, it's worth a little noise to be able to peek out the window & be staring directly at the iconic Citgo sign!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 2 nights at the end of Sept/beginning of Oct at the Buckminster Hotel in Boston. First the good: the price was right-- $99-138 per night and it includes a free breakfast at the restaurant next door. You get to pick from 4 different selections on the menu. The location is EXCELLENT!! You are literally feet from Fenway park and the Kenmore T stop so you can go almost anywhere in the city cheaply. The staff was also extremely courteous. Now the bad: it's a little rundown/dirty. The lobby/hallways are very dirty/dusty. Granted, the hotel is undergoing a major renovation, but there are years worth of grime on the floors. However, I felt like the things that really needed to be clean like sheets, towels, shower, etc. were clean-- so a little dirt on the floor was not that big of a deal. There was certainly less dirt in the room than in the hallways. Hopefully once the renovation is complete they will maintain the hotel with less dirt, but I'd stay there again anyway. For that price you can't beat it!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was so paranoid to stay at the Buckminster Hotel after reading the reviews on this site, but I needed a room for three nights and it was very cheap for Boston so I had no choice. The hotel was fine, our room was clean, the staff was nice, and the location was amazing. The people working at the front desk were not rude at all as I had expected after reading these reviews, but rather very helpful and friendly. In fact they were easy to joke around with and gave me great directions to local attractions. My only kind of complaint would be that the bed was uncomfortable, but I am used to sleeping on a really comfy bed, so I'm just picky. We stayed in 520 and the room was clean, I did not see any bugs, or mice like some of the reviews say. The bathroom seemed newly renovated. I'm not going to lie, the Buckminster isn't the Ritz Carlton, but it's not bad at all. If you are expecting a four star, marbled bathroom style hotel, go somewhere else. If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel room, then the Buckminster Hotel is fine for you.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A friend of mine was visiting from Florida and he wanted to catch a Sox game while in town. Getting tickets was easier than finding a hotel room in the city. Eventually, after much searching, I called the Buckminster and found a room with two beds for $179, which was about a hundred bucks cheaper than anything else I could find. The hotel was right around the corner from Fenway Park and our room had a view of the park. The Sox lost that night, but we had a great time at the game and after the game at some of the many bars around the hotel. We both thought the hotel was fine. Nothing out of this world, but affordable, clean and the hotel employees were nice enough. I wish I had known about this place years ago, cause I've been spending $400 a night whenever I stay in Boston. If you are going to see the Sox or looking for a less expensive hotel in the city, I would suggest trying this place out if you just need a decent room without all the thrills. The room came with a free continental breakfast the next morning, which was a added bonus.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Recently my son and husband planned a sports weekend in Boston. It was very difficult to find any accommodation that was reasonably priced yet accessible to everything. I searched the other trip advisor sites and found this one. This hotel had mixed reviews. I was getting desperate and when I booked there was only a few rooms left. They ended up with the two bedroom. When they got to Boston they found it very close to the subway and were very happy. The two bedroom looked over towards Fenway park. It was clean and had many conveniences. They were not in the room much. They found that the breakfast was adequate and a good way to start the day. They also enjoyed several of the restaurants close by. This is definitely not the Ritz but the two of them had no complaints. I think you have to ask yourself what you want out of a hotel. If it is ambience and the pampered feeling then this is not the place. If you want something reasonable, close to the subway, clean and roomy (especially the 2 bedroom) then you might want to consider this property.</p></li>

The front desk staff was great and vary professional. I only had two problems with my stay here. The parking is in a building next to the hotel and is not run by the hotel; it is run by a company called LAZ. We were not told about this at the time of booking. When we showed up to park the LAZ guys asked us for our keys to park our car for us because its a red sox game day and we cant self park here and that they had to do it. Kind of threw us off a bit, we didnâ€™t really trust giving some strange guy our car keys. All went well with them though they are vary professional and kind. The hotel is located in a vary busy part of town. Get there early if there is a sox game or else you will be circling around the hotel waiting for the game crowd to leave. The room we stayed in is great if your looking for just a bed to sleep in. It was nothing special. The rate was a little high for what we got but id pay it again just for its location to Fenway.</p></li>

My second day , I came to the hotel at night went straight to my room found "Do not disturb" sign on the door and my key would not work ...... oh yeah , they moved me to another room and I was not told I would move to another room so to pack my stuff so they could move it . They moved my stuff for me to another room leaving , my computer cables , some documents that I had left on the table, phone charger and a few other items .I tried to retrive items but employees at the desk could care less, very rude and extremely poor customer service. I have sooo much more to say BUT to summarise please do not stay at this hotel if you want to enjoy boston.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First the good things. *Location. Location. Location. *Beautiful exterior & lobby *Friendly & helpful staff *Did I mention location? Not so good. *Not clean - need to keep shoes or socks on in the room. Yuck. Time for new flooring. *No A/C - at all. It was hot. We had to open windows which made it loud because of 24 hour traffic and there are no screens so bugs came in. *The rooms haven't been updated in at least 15 years - linens or furniture. *Many technical problems. One TV needed repairs to work at all. One didn't get lower channels at all. Hall lights in our suite didn't work. Some of the wall plugs didn't work so finding a place to charge a cell phone was a challenge. Lastly, if you make a reservation here, get a person's name & a confirmation #. Make sure they email it to you and bring the email with you. They lost our reservation and they were full. I had to bully my way into them giving us a room. Luckily I had the name of the girl who made the reservation and my non-working confirmation #. Best place to stay for a Red Sox game - only 1 block away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My Husband and I stayed at this hotel with another couple. We booked a suite with two bedrooms, one room was supposed to have two double beds and the other a queen, but when we got there we noticed that a queen and a double were in one room and a double in the other. we also noticed some papers under the bed. When we called the front desk they said that they would be more than happy to switch them and the filthy sheets that were on all of the beds. After the beds were moved we checked them out and realized that the paper was still under the bed only to later find out that they were used sanitary napkins. When we called the desk to tell them how disgusted we were and they basically said it was our problem not theirs. We were then told that we could get a full refund in the morning when we checked out which was also untrue. They have given me a number to call to try to claim a refund, which i do not see happening. one number i will be calling is the board of health because nobody should pay money to sleep in that filth, the streets would have been cleaner and probably friendlier.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel in October 2011. It is in a great location, near a selection of bars and restaurants, the student district, and has good transport links to the harbour side of Boston. We walked from this hotel down to the harbour, it was a beautiful walk through lovely parks and gave us a chance to look at the architecture of the houses and buildings, took us about 30 mins leisurely. The hotel had a car park which we had booked but it was a little tiny for the size of US cars. The hotel was clean and tidy, nice lobby area, continental breakfast was basic but I loved the fruit in the US, and they had plenty of it at this breakfast. We were a bit amazed that we had a microwave but no tea or coffee making facilities. Our room was basic and old but it added to the experience of Boston. It was clean which was the main thing, big bathroom too. The hotel was one of the cheapest in Boston, however, we found Boston hotels very expensive compared to places like New York. We went to Salem, it was half an hours drive and a fun experience. Boston was beautiful and the Buckminster is a good clean hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I need to preface this by saying 95% of the time we go to B and B's so I think I have been spoiled when it comes to enjoying hotels. I didn't feel any old world charm! We only stayed one night so didn't have time to interact with people too much but the staff was very nice- helpful and accommodating. The continental breakfast was good and the women attending to the food were nice also. No problems with the staff. But the room sorta skeeved me out. Everything is well worn out- rug-dirty brown around the edges- crusty tiles in bathroom- the bed was what you would see at your grandma's way outdated house and color schemes and patterns were just all wrong.. unpleasant to look at- creamsicle walls with dark (dingy?) maroon checked rug with all wrong colors on the bedspread and dimly lit room (so you can't see the imperfections?).... just couldn't get into it. (Note pictures). I do like that they use the 'green' soap and shampoos. Loved the soap! to not waste the middle- don't have one! we most likely won't go back. I would only recommend this to people who want to go to Fenway Park.. since it is practically next door.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel and then read some not so great reviews and almost cancelled, I'm glad we didn't. My husband and I stayed for one night to spend a day in Boston and go to the Red Sox game that night. We arrived about 11 (it was a Friday) and were able to check in right away. They gave us a voucher to park for $18 overnight at a garage right next door, we just had to be out by noon the next day. This was a great deal since it costs $30 just park for a game. We had a king bed room on the 4th floor overlooking Fenway Park. The room was a decent size. There was the bed, 2 nightstands, a desk and an armoire with the TV and a few drawers. There were 2 small closets with full length mirrors on the armoire, as well. There was also another VERY small closet in the room. The bathroom was SMALL, but clean and fine for a short stay. There was a continental breakfast offered but we didn't make it down on time. This is an old building and it shows, but we didn't see any dirt or bugs or anything. You can't beat the location or the price for Boston. Would we stay here a week? Probably not. Would we go back for a night or 2, absolutely.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located steps from the Kenmore T stop and across the street from Fenway Park, you're definitely paying for location at this hotel. There are tons of restaurants and bars in easy walking distance. Rooms were clean and comfortable, but very small and awkwardly shaped. Ours also had no overhead lighting. Also, the hotel was absolutely freezing. We stayed in August and the temperature in our room was set to 68, which is a little ridiculous. What a waste of resources! We checked in and that is what the thermostat was set to- we turned it off and it was still cool all evening and then the next day the housekeepers had turned the AC back to 68 while we were out! Rather self defeating for a hotel that has signs about conserving water towels and has 'eco-friendly' shampoo and bar soap. Hotel staff was knowledgeable, professional, and friendly and held our bags for us for the day after we had checked out. They lend out umbrellas as well- a nice service considering Boston's, shall we say, capricious weather. There is also a complimentary continental breakfast, which we didn't take advantage of so I can't comment on. Was a pleasant experience, but not sure if I would stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were visiting Boston for one night -- attending a Red Sox game - prior to spending our vacation on Cape Cod. Prior to booking our stay, we inquired about parking and was told parking was available at a garage next store. We booked our stay at the Buckmister as we thought a garage would be more secure than a surface lot. Our car was broken into and items taken sometime during the night. Both the garage and hotel disclaim any responsibility. The parking garages policy of closing one hour after the game basically means the employees go home at such time NOT that the lot is secured. In fact no gates are closed, security cameras are facing backwards -- it does not appear that the garage takes reasonable care in protecting the overnight cars. The hotel claims that they simply reimburse the garage for the discount being given hotel guests and the hotel is not involved in the operation of the garage -- fair enough -- but it is very misleading for the hotel to represent that parking is nearby - when they know the parking is not secure overnight. They are a hotel -- they know the cars are going to be there overnight! I would not recommend anyone stay at the Buckmister if they are traveling with a car.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Buckminster in 2004 (I know it's been a while, but I was just thinking about the trip today) and we were not all that impressed. The hotel is promoted as being Victorian and full of antiques... and the pictures online are decently nice. However, we just found it was just plain old. I suppose Victorian is just a nice way of saying old. Yes, true, Boston is an old city ...with a tremendous amount of charm. I actually loved Boston. However, for the price you pay at Buckminster, old hard beds with musty smelling sheets and a stand alone sink with NO counter space at all in the bathroom leaves something to be desired. I do have to say that the breakfast at the teeny little restaurant (and I do mean teeny) downstairs was actually quite tasty. To their credit, they were renovating the lobby at the time, but still that seem to have no bearing on the old hard beds and must sheets. However, our next trip to Boston was exactly one year later in 2005, and we stayed at the Radisson which is just across the river...and loved it. It is a far better deal with comfy beds, clean, non-musty accommodations and a japanese steakhouse, lounge/bar to boot. It is just across the river from the Buckminster, about a 5 minute cab ride, in the Boston University area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Following a Saga tour of New England, I decided to stay on and spend some time in Boston. I found this hotel on a website and booked it from the reviews. The hotel has been recently refurbished and is situated just a few minutes walk from the subway. Very friendly and professional reception staff. My initial room was a bit small and I asked if there was a larger one and they changed it with no fuss and then rang afterwards to see whether I was happy with it.Being an older hotel the rooms may vary in size and are over several floors served by two lifts. Some rooms face onto the street, the inner ones, one of which I had, overlook a large rectangular inner courtyard which acts as a light well. There is no problem with this. . Continental Breakfast was included served in the adjoining Japanese restaurant. This was fine! Being a Brit, tea making facilities would have been preferable to the included fridge and microwave, but heating up pizzas or other prepared meals is an easy option and ideal for many guests There is a very good Indian restaurant left out of the hotel and down a couple of blocks on the same side as the hotel An early morning call and the booking of a taxi was also happily arranged for me I would definitely stay there again. Very good service, value and location</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Went 1st week in August to see the Red Sox play Cleveland and New York. The hotelâ€™s location make it very convenient for baseball fans. A couple minute walk to Fenway. That also makes it not so nice if you are not going to the game. Excepting the proximity to Fenway, this is an older, decent hotel. My room was very large with high ceilings and very tall windows. I was ok with the furnishings â€“ nothing special. The couch was not real comfy, TVâ€™s (2) were small with fuzzy reception and not many channels, carpets worn, window shutters worked but brokenâ€¦. Wi-Fi did not work in my room. I went to the front desk and they immediately gave me a cable, and did not charge for the internet. Parking is next door, $28 per day. DO NOT try to get to your car late at night. I had to drive to the airport @ 1:30 one morning for a family emergency. My car was in the lower level. There was no attendant. There were rats everywhere! I saw 10 â€“ 20 good sized rats. They didnâ€™t run & hide either. I had a small light on my key chain, so I could see them too well. Breakfast was disappointing, cold, blah limited section, nothing better than mediocre. The front desk and house keeping were better than the rest of the hotel. Stay if youâ€™re going to a game â€“ it is so close! But not otherwise.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is located at one of the busiest traffic intersections in all of Boston. The car horns, sirens and other street noises keep you awake all night long mainly because the rooms have no curtains. There are only broken wood shutters that do nothing to keep street noises out. The heat is inefficient and our rooms were freezing. The young woman at the front desk was rude, obnoxious and discourteous. The rate for this particular weekend was (with taxes) $225 per night. I have stayed in other chain hotels at a quarter of the price that were cleaner, had larger rooms and I certainly didnt have to put up with rude employees. In the interest of being fair, I will say that the newly renovated lobby is gorgeous, but the rooms are filthy and the furniture is ancient and broken. The bedrooms are so small that you have to wiggle next to the bed to get into them. The TV screen had so much scum on it, that I initally thought the reception was blurred. If you decide to stay at this hotel, make sure you bring plenty of windex and ajax, so you can scrub the bathroom before you use it. Also, dont forget the room spray to help with the awful odor. I have traveled extensively through the US and Europe and I can honestly tell you that I have never seen a hotel as dirty as this one was and have never seen a room in such disrepair.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is with out a doubt the worst hotel I have ever stayed it. I booked it after a recomendation from a friend's sibling who said it was great and you couldn't beat the price. I was disgusted with it as soon as we got to our room, it was small and dingy looking. I tried to attribute it to the fact that it is an old building and that I'm used to very clean things. I wanted to leave and find a new hotel but every place we called was booked solid. I should have gone with my instinct because after hesitantly climbing into the dirty bed that night we we're woke up to the sounds of a COCKROACH early in the morning, that had crawled into a plastic bag of cleaning supplies we had bought which was on the floor. I immediately ran out of the room and down to the front desk where the clerk proceeded to yell at me and told me they had no such problem. He refused to let me speak to a manager or give me any money off of my stay. He sent someone up to the room to find the roach, which we watched run under the bed before I left the room, but because he didn't see it they told me I was lying. Needless to say, as my boyfriend was packing our bags, he found a 'roach motel' hidden in between the television stand and a dresser. The staff here was so rude and unhelpful I advise anyone thinking of staying here not to. The prices are cheap but it's not worth it.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Buckminster for 3 days. The main purpose of our trip was a Red Sox game so the location could not be beat. When we checked in, I was pleasantly surprised at how friendly the front desk staff were. If you are looking for a hotel with straight lines and no character, then stay somewhere else. I LOVED the fact that the hallways were quirky and that the hotel had so much character! The room was a little on the small side but for just my hubby and I, it was fine. The bathroom was large, well lit and the shower was great. The bed was also super comfy. We had a newer flat screen TV in our room (room 314) Our room overlooked Fenway. We requested this and so while it was a little loud on game nights, it was well worth it and we expected it :) The front desk staff was amazing, always had great tips on where to eat and how to get anywhere in the city. They held our bags for us the day we checked out since our flight wasn't until 6pm. That was a nice feature. We didn't rent a car so parking wasn't an issue for us, but my advice is do not rent a car!! The T will get you anywhere you want to go, and you can get a 7 day unlimited ride pass for $15.00. It's a much better deal! The Buckminster is right off the Green line and easily accessible from the airport. If we make it back to Boston, we will definitely stay at the Buckminster!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Budget hotel with great value, very cozy”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Buckminster is more of a budget hotel than a luxury or high end. However, that doesn't mean the accomodations are sub par at all. Upon arriving I found the lobby to be tasteful and welcoming. Front desk staff were very courteous and accomodating. My room was on the third floor. It was a bit small, but having stayed in a lot of hotels in Boston and New York City, this is pretty typical for older hotels (this one dates from the late 1800s). The room, including bathroom, the bed, carpeting and furniture were clean. It was a little warm for my taste, and an older-style thermostat on the wall didn't really help much. Luckily the windows open, so I opened it a crack and the fall/winter air cooled it down to my satisfaction. Pros: -Location, right on subway line, close to fenway, back bay -Price: very inexpensive compared to other larger chain hotels -Everything was clean and housekeeping staff were friendly and thorough -Comfortable bed -Ipod docking station -Refrigerator and microwave! -Laundry facility -Continental breakfast Cons: -Older style TV -Small room -A little outdated decor -Thin towels, not many toiletry accomodations -Hard to adjust temperature All in all, I paid under $100 a night, which is a steal, even for the slow winter season. I found that the pros of this budget hotel much outweigh the handful of cons, and for the location, price, and cozyness, I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying a casual weekend.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I tentatively booked a 4 night stay at this hotel. I loved the location, as we were going to Red Sox games. I loved the UNHEARD of style of 2 bedrooms and a living room for $200 in Boston. I liked the idea of the free breakfasts, the fridges in the rooms, the kitchens on the floors. I liked it all. THEN, i read some of the reviews on the site. That scared me like crazy. But after going ahead with the booking, we gave it a shot. I walked in, and the staff was incredibly friendly. Very helpful. The way to the room was pretty messy....mostly due to rennovations, but it was hardly 'disgusting' or even an issue. The rooms are very large and clean. There is a lot of wear on the walls and everything....but it's over a hundred years old!!! It was not unappealing and all the furniture was fine. Very comfy beds too. It's not a 5-star hotel, and it doesn't pretend to be. But it IS clean, it offers so many things that you won't find in Boston (especially for that price), the location is awesome, and if you're travelling with more than 2 people, it's absolutely perfect. Especially if you're going to Sox games. I highly recommend it, and would be more than happy to stay there on my next visit. It would be a shame if you were to not stay there because of some negative reviews you see on here. Clearly they were more concerned with feeling like they were at the Ritz Carlton than they were about having a clean, convenient, and very nice room. But you'll be missing out if you choose not to stay here.</p></li>

<li>That scared me like crazy.</br></br></li>
<li>But after going ahead with the booking, we gave it a shot.</br></br></li>
<li>I walked in, and the <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1">staff</span> was <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1">incredibly friendly</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>Very helpful.</br></br></li>
<li>The way to the <span style="background-color:#aaffc3">room</span> was <span style="background-color:#aaffc3">pretty messy</span>....mostly due to rennovations, but it was hardly 'disgusting' or even an issue.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#4363d8">rooms</span> are <span style="background-color:#4363d8">very large and clean</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>There is a lot of wear on the walls and everything....but it's over a hundred years old!!!</br></br></li>
<li>It was not unappealing and all the <span style="background-color:#aaffc3">furniture</span> was <span style="background-color:#aaffc3">fine</span>.</br></br></li>
<li><span style="background-color:#3cb44b">Very comfy</span> <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">beds</span> too.</br></br></li>
<li>It's not a 5-star hotel, and it doesn't pretend to be.</br></br></li>
<li>But it IS clean, it offers so many things that you won't find in Boston (especially for that price), the <span style="background-color:#008080">location</span> is <span style="background-color:#008080">awesome</span>, and if you're travelling with more than 2 people, it's absolutely perfect.</br></br></li>
<li>Especially if you're going to Sox games.</br></br></li>
<li>I highly recommend it, and would be more than happy to stay there on my next visit.</br></br></li>
<li>It would be a shame if you were to not stay there because of some negative reviews you see on here.</br></br></li>
<li>Clearly they were more concerned with feeling like they were at the Ritz Carlton than they were about having a <span style="background-color:#4363d8">clean</span>, convenient, and very nice <span style="background-color:#4363d8">room</span>.</li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When all other hotels and B&B's had failed me, the Buckminster came to my rescue and not only had availability but also came in cheaper than anyone else - although still not what I'd call cheap but then you'll find Boston is very pricey. As I was in Boston just to look around all I really wanted was somewhere just to put my head down for the night, I wasn't looking for luxury because I didn't plan on spending anything but essential sleeping time there. And it did just that - nothing fancy but not worthy of the bad reports I've seen on Trip Advisor.The hotel is brilliantly located - Fenway Park is a few hundred yards away, there's restaurants all over the place and access to the subway is just down the road (Top tip: taxi from the airport cost me a rip off $35 but I got a 7 day pass on the T for $15 which gave me unlimited travel around Boston and I used that to get back to the airport from Buckminster - and that was surprisingly no hassle). If you choose to walk around the city like I did most of the time you'll find the harbour is about an hour away, which sounds a lot but it's well worth it if you want to get a real feel for the city. The only problem I'd have with the Buckminster is the breakfast in the restaurant next door, which was quite basic and managed by two Japanese ladies who couldn't understand a word of what I was saying. Apart from that, everything was fine - oh, and I should point out that I thought the staff were really helpful and quite conversational. I would definitely recommend to friends.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a great location, a short walk from a T stop, accross the street from Boston University and a very short walk from Fenway Park. From the outside, it looks great. But then you get inside and realize that the lobby meets expectations, but the hallways and rooms look old and need to be redone. I think our room was clean, but the rugs were so old and the wall so much in need of paint that I am not sure. The lighting was so poor that it was hard to read. We booked at the last minute and they did not have a double room available. So we were booked into a 2 bedroom suite at the double rate. Both rooms had refrigerators and bar sinks. One room had a microwave. The counters by both sinks were cracked and needed to be redone. One room had a broken TV. We reported this, but it was not fixed while we were there. Both TV's were old, analogue 17 inch models. The furniture was old fashioned, which fit the age of the hotel. It looked 40+ years old. The bathroom was well lit and clean. The tile was white and I did not notice any that was chipped. But there was a lack of towel racks. We used one of the extra closets to hang the towels! When in the bathroom, one could hear people in other bathrooms as if they were in our room. That did not happen with the rest of the suite. The breakfast was marginal. Cereal, bad bagels, tiny muffins. The TV in the restaurant was a flat screen, but it was located so only 2 or the 12 or so tables could see it. Location trumped everything with this hotel, but it needs a facelift badly.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Buckminster Hotel - It's a room, and that's about it.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from visiting Boston - truly a wonderful city, especially in the fall. I booked my room through one of the online travel sites - the one that tells you where you're staying after you pay. My wife and I landed our room at the Buckminster Hotel. Pros - Location is excellent. Right next to Fenway Park and Kenmore Train Station. Lot's of great nightlife, safe place in the city, and good places to eat. I have to say that booking through a travel site, I was able to get a room here for $63.00 a night. That's a HUGE value in a good part of Boston. The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly. Cons - Our room was about 12'x14' - I'm not exaggerating. The worst part is we did not have control of our thermostat. I called the front desk and told him I wanted to turn the air on - he told me they can turn it on from the outside of the room. Sure enough, 10 minutes later our air was working, however our thermostat still didn't work. After several hours of the air on full blast and the room becoming ice cold, I had to call the front desk and tell them to turm my air off. They made no apologies at all for this inconvenience and acted like this was acceptable. My wife was keeping me calm reminding me that all we needed was a bed and a shower and this place did provide that much. We had a great time in Boston and look forward going back in the spring. I will recommend this hotel with the understanding that if you need a bed and a shower and don't want to spend $250.00 and up per night for a room in Boston, then this place works.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived in Boston at check in time and found the Front Desk staff to be friendly, helpful and welcoming. We drove in, so we also needed to park our car somewhere, when I booked online both of their websites stated that parking was $20 however when we paid for the parking they charged us $28. It was conveniently located in the parking garage directly behind the hotel which was very convenient and we also paid an additional $11 to stay passed noon in the garage till 6pm which we didn't mind for the next day. Our room was huge! we had a bedroom and then a separate bathroom which was in our room entrance but across a hall, it was like a small apartment. There was a nice tv, and microwave in the room too. Our bed was surprisingly comfy, sometimes in budget hotels the beds are less than to be desired but we slept great. You can tell the building is old but it is very clean & comfortable. After arriving in our room the front desk even called up to our room to make sure we had everything we needed and our room was acceptable. Breakfast as others have stated is very basic, coffee, tea, juice, milk, cereal, bagels, mixed pastries but these days alot of hotels are not giving a free breakfast so we thought it was just perfect for the money we paid to stay. The location of this hotel was perfect for us, one block away from Fenway park, 20 minute walk to the mall, and to get to Fenuil Hall and the harbor Front the subway is a 2 minute walk to the T line which will take you everywhere! We love Boston and we now love this hotel and will be staying there again for sure!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The only reason I really gave this hotel three stars is for the location. my husband and I are Red Sox Nation Citizens and we were going to use our 'free' (relatively speaking...they come with the cost of membership) tickets to go see a game there last week with friends. Fifteen years ago my husband fondly remembered staying at the Buckminster, so for that reason, we ended up there. Of course I did my homework, and researched it on here. Generally we stay at Marriotts or high-end boutique properties, so I was a little leery about his selection of the Buckminster. Reviews were pretty varied, but I will echo the sentiment that this hotel needs serious updating. The elevators are small and old, the rooms (while large in size) were also old. The paint was an unflattering peach color which clashed with the purple floral bed covers and the green (i think) carpets. We sprung for a two bedroom suite and in our main room there were two bay style windows that overlooked Fenway. Great view, but when we opened the window to get some fresh air in, we were pretty shocked to discover that one of them was missing a screen. Being on the fifth floor in a room most likely used by families I thought this was unsafe and unacceptable. The bathroom was clean, although the fixtures appeared to be a bit outdated. All in all, I would not return to this hotel. Bed linens are pretty important to me, and I really like the all white duvet, triple sheet-ed look of some of the other main chain hotels or boutiques. The front desk staff, namely a gentleman named Whitney were stellar though. They deserve to be working somewhere that is a bit higher caliber. The breakfast in the morning was a nice touch as well, something that many american travelers aren't used to seeing offered complimentary.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Thrilled about the two bedroom suite on the 6th floor”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I booked one room for the two of us for two nights via Hotwire at an unbelievable low price, but then we ended up needing two double or queen sized beds because we had an extra person wanting to stay with us one of those nights. We called one day ahead and the staff was most accommodating and when we arrived we saw that we had been upgraded to a two room suite on the sixth floor at the same low price as just one room. We found both of the rooms clean and spacious and nicely furnished, one with a queen and one with a double bed, TV and fridge in both rooms. The breakfast was held in the Japanese restaurant on the ground floor and offered many choices i.e. cereal, oatmeal, muffins, bread/bagels, jams, cream cheese, peanut butter, coffee, and large selection of teas, baked items, and at least 4 different kinds of fruit. The staff was very friendly. The hotel is over 100 years old but still has charm and character, and it is literally across the street from Fenway Park and close to many amenities. We couldn't have been happier with our two nights at the hotel, it was a real treat!! We found free parking from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. closeby, there is also paid parking across the street or in the nearby parking garage which can vary in price, but we were gone most of the day and had to feed parking meters in another part of the city from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Anywhere in Boston you have to pay for parking, it is the worst city for traffic congestion, one way streets, metered parking with lots of restrictions, and the city employs lots of people to keep an eye on those meters and give out tickets if any meter expires by even a second. Someone from out of town was ticketed while trying to find a quarter to feed the meter before it expired, but unfortunately came a few seconds too late.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Bedbugs!! Rodents!! Prostitutes! Health Risks! Rude Management”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Be affraid ...very affraid! This is quite possibly the worst hotel in America! From the extremely unprofessional, rude front desk management to the applauling room conditions and price...this hotel should be shut down!! My family stayed there while dropping our daughter off to BU. During our stay we encountered the following: Filth Everywhere on most every surface. There was even blood on our youngest daughter's sheets. We left when we realized that it was our daughters blood from being bitten from bed bugs found scattered on the bed and pillow cases. An extreme rodent /pest control problem. Rats in our room. Bugs in the kitchen, covering the cooking surfaces. Sewage water dripping down the wall from a saturated cieling onto the kitchen counter top. An overflowing 3 foot high trash can! (At the time of our premature departure 3 days.later .the trash had yet to be emptied) A loud heating sytem that blew room temp. dust particals that smelled of cheap perfume. This scent is also pumped throughout the entire floor. We went to make the well dressed asian man who claimed to be the manager aware of these troubles, only to find apathy. Not only did he not care in the slightest he invited us to "do whatever it is you have to do...and go!! My kids almost flipped out when they heard the young man raising his voice to their grandmother. We were charged $220+ for each night of horror. I cannot believe that a hotel can operate like this in contemporary America. Meanwhile we are bracing ourselves for what will most likely prove to be an ugly legal battle as we will be taking this sham of a hotel to court ..just after we collect more information from others who may have had similiar encounters at this seedy place. Word to the wise..you're better off paying a little bit more up front then absorbing the healthcare expenses and emotional damage from staying at this flop house.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very Satisfying Stay”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Buckminster is located in Kenmore Square in Boston which is near Fenway Park. The hotel location is good for anyone attending a ball game or concert at the stadium but may be bad if you want quite during these times. The hotel is located about a block from the T green lines B,C, and D station in Kenmore Square as well as a local bus terminal for the T. Also, I saw many Taxis hanging out in Kenmore Square. There are many restaurants and two convenience stores within Kenmore Square. The location isnâ€™t very close to many of the tourist and historic sites. The hotel is an older hotel but has been upgraded. I was very pleased with the quality of the accommodations as well as the staff. I stayed in an economy room which contained a full sized bed, regular sized bathroom with tub/shower, refrigerator/microwave, safe, desk, and wardrobe. Other than the bed only being a full sized bed, I would not have considered this an economy room and I have stayed in smaller rooms in New York City. Everything in the room was in working order and clean, however, there were some small areas of wear but I knew I wasnâ€™t paying for a perfect room. The staff at this hotel was awesome. Unless they were busy, they always greeted me upon my arrivals and departures every day I was there and were always eager to assist with whatever I needed. The maid staff always did a good job at cleaning my room. The hotel also offers loaner umbrellas at no charge when it rained. The continental breakfast was good and adequate. There are no hot entrees but there was more than just toast. They had apple or orange juice, 4 cereal choices, bagels, toast, mini muffins, Danish, coffee, milk (both whole and 2%), tea, and probably some more then I am forgetting. It was great to get breakfast to start your day. I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and I felt it was a good value compared to other options in Boston.</p></li>
