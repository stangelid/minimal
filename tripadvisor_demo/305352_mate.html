The roof terrace was lovely with views over the Grand Canal. You could cross the canal by gondola right outside the hotel for just 50 cents. We would highly recommend this hotel, we booked 3 superior rooms but would definitely say 304 was the best with its small balcony and side view of the canal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent the final 2 nights of our honeymoon in Venice at the Foscari Palace and we could not have been happier. The room was huge when compared to our hotels in London and Paris (both of which we were pleased with). The location was wonderful, right on the canal. If you stay here make sure to enjoy the roof top deck. Both nights we enjoyed the sunset and the view of the canal from the deck. Would love to stay here again if back in Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here with my husband and two teens. We booked two rooms for two nights. The hotel is beautiful, new and very clean. The beds were very comfortable. Breakfast was abundant and good. The staff was very friendly for the most part. It is a comfortable walking distance to the major sites with the advantage of being in more of a residential area. It was fun to see the locals walking their dogs and babies instead of seeing tourists all the time. I strongly recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A great hotel with good location, very helpful staff. We were upgraded to a suite. I lost my adapter for my camera charger and the front desk lady tried to find one for me. She recommended places for us to dine and helped us reserve dinner for us. The suite was grand and view from our living room was breath taking. Totally venetian. I scored alot of cookie points with my wife for booking that place. ;-). Finally, they have good breakfast. Dont miss it. Also dont miss the rooftop terrace. Panaromic.!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'm amazed by the negative reviews from the Ohio couple who stayed during the same period as we did. We found the hotel superb - clean, cool (important in temperatures of 32 degrees celsius!), comfortable and very conveniently situated. The staff were attentive, friendly and knowledgeable arranging meals in local restaurants and booking water taxis. A word of advice for visitors from North America - it is considered rude in Europe to steal food from the breakfast buffet for later consumption! We would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

We can not wait to go back--yes you are a 15 minute walk from St. Marks, but you came to walk the streets of Venice- so hop to it ! Grocery store a few minutes from hotel- stock up on cheap water, wine, cheese and go up to the rooftop at night and have your own party - Best out of 7 Hotels we stayed at in Italy- even edged out the Grand Hotel Continental in Sienna.....and that is a 5 star- start packing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I took my husband to the Foscari July 1-4. We stayed in the Foscari suite. I wish I had a camera to get a picture of his face when he saw the size of our rooms (I emphasize the plural). We basically had the first floor of the hotel and could have had a party for 40 people in our rooms. The hotel is in a great location - near everything, but away from the masses. The staff were very helpful and gave us great dinner recommendations. The rooftop bar was splendid, with great views of the city. All in all, a fabulous experience and I would definitely go back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Foscari Palace for three days in early May. This was our second visit to Venice, but our first at the Foscari Palace. Our stay could not have been nicer. The view from our room (room 101) was unforgettable, as was the room itself - opulent and clean! We were pleasantly surprised by the breakfast - a full buffet with fresh fruit, pastries, cold cuts and hot dishes. The location of the hotel is very convenient. If we are ever lucky enough to visit Venice again, we would certainly stay here. It was worth the splurge and a great way to start our trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family of five (parents plus three teens) stayed here over New Years. We had two adjoining rooms, an outrageously ornate and fabulous double room overlooking the Grand Canal, and a large double with a roll away added. The ceilings in these rooms must have been 12 feet tall. The decor really added to our overall venetian experience. The staff is very helpful with restaurant reservations and directions. The breakfast was delicious and varied; definately worth getting up for. The location is conveniently close to all the major site - just a brief walk away. It's a wonderful small hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A nice looking hotel in a good location, but looks are not everything. Room was clean and breakfast was fine. After that we don't have much good to say. Bed was very hard. The air conditioning did not work the first night of our stay. There was a new clerk (first day on the job) at the front desk on our second day who had obviously received no training and knew very little about the hotel. We left a note at the front desk for our friend also staying in the hotel who never received the message. Upon check out the front desk clerk did not even ask us how our stay was or say thank you or good bye.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was an amazing find which we booked based on reviews read on TripAdvisor and Expedia's websites. We were not disapointed. The hotel was very clean, the staff very helpful and friendly, and the complimentary breakfast was a real bonus in this city where often times food is dissapointing and overpriced. The only complaint we had was the comfort of the beds, which we found to be a bit hard and the pillows, which were quite flat and hard as well. We would still recommend this hotel without reservation due to its other wonderful amenities and the location, 5 minute walk to Rialto bridge and 10-15 minute stroll to Piazza San Marco.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights, June 10-13. The location was perfect, on the Grand Canal, right next to the vaporetto stop and the traghetto. The Rialto Market was directly across the street and can be reached by traghetto in a minute. The hotel was beautiful and clean. The room was adequate size with a nice bathroom and bed. The shower is a little complicated to work, but also has a tub and worked fine. The service was excellent, everyone went out of their way to help us and answer all our questions. The breakfast was nice and the rooftop terrace was amazing! Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located one street from vaporetto Ca d'Oro. 10 minute walk to train station in one direction or Rialto Bridge in other direction. The hotel was clean and personnel friendly. Staff has long internet cord for free use in room. Breakfast was ample and very good. Room was small while bathroom was very large. no problem- we weren't there much. A/C was fine and room was quiet at night. The roof veranda is nice for pictures but we were out late at night so didn't have an opportunity to use. Summer in Venice is expensive so room was about $250 US/180 EUR but that's to be expected. I'd stay on return if the price were competitive with other quality hotels.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Foscari Palace on November 2-6, 2005 and have only glowing reviews of our stay. Our room was newly redone, sparkling, with modern amenities such as a flat screen tv, ultra-modern bath, quiet & with a view of the Grand Canal. The staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast included bacon and eggs and much more. Two evenings they sponsored a "Cocktail party" - one with live music - with champagne and food. The hotel had a roof patio with spectacular views. The location was pleasantly away from the most crowded areas but a short walk to everything. We have absolutely no complaints. It was much better than we expected and a great value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Have just returned from two days in Venice staying at the Foscari Palace. Lovely room but rather dismayed that we had to pay for coffee in our room. This has never been included in a mini bar before. On our first evening I mentioned to the concierge that lights over the washbasin didn't work ,and that bulbs and wires were visible where a circular mirror should be. The lights were sorted the next day but the mirror never materialised. I mentioned it again to the same concierge but got no apology - I was disappointed. The waiting staff were pleasant. I love Venice and have stayed in appartments and hotels but I don't have any intention of going back to the Foscari Palace.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here in a double (Room 103), while my other friends stayed in Rooms 104 & 102. All are classed as the same type of double, for the same price. Rooms 103 & 104 were considerably larger than 102, however. 102 is cramped for a couple to stay in (but fine for 1 person). Room 103 is also better than 104 because it has a bathtub w/jacuzzi-type jet thingies in it, as well as a shower w/various body jets on the wall, & a nice, new-looking Plexiglas shower screen; whereas 104 only has a plain shower stall (no tub) w/a flimsy plastic shower curtain. 102 also only has a plain shower stall. Other than these points, I agree with the positive comments numerous others have posted.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you are looking for a great hotel in Venice- this is it. We arrived to the hotel via water taxi, right up to the hotels front. Which as we saw is not the luxury that all travelers have staying at other hotels that are not on the canal, some of the hotels can be quite a walk - especially with luggage-from where you can be dropped off. Our room was very comfortable, bathrooms were very clean and the front desk was very helpful. The included breakfast is wonderful; eggs, meats, cheeses, cereals, and pastries ( what i would give to have a nutella crossant! Delicious-) The location is key for all tourist attractions, dining, or just to sit on the roof top and enjoy the sounds of Venice!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Most of what has been said already applies to our stay at the Foscari Palace. Our room was very nice, the front desk people were very helpful and professional, the location is good for getting around the city, and there were nice restaurants nearby. If I return to Venice I would stay there again. Because of an early flight out of Venice (6:50 am) we had to hire a water taxi (110 euro, ouch!) but it pulled up to the platform on the Focari's Grand Canal entrance and we were at the airport in about 25 minutes. Avoid this option if you can. The cost was about $160 just to get to the airport. Take a later flight if possible, since the vaporetto and the airport bus (I think) don't run at 5 am.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We based our decision to stay at Foscari Palace on it's location, right by the Ca D'oro vaporetto stop, and because of all the great comments I read on Trip Advisor. We were more than satisfied....large room, flat screen wall panel TV, stylish furnishings, hearty breakfast, accommodating staff. But you should be aware of two things: renovation of buildings on either side of Foscari Palace is going on; to get a Grand Canal front view you can't book through Venere as we did. They are a boutique hotel, part of the Giannetti Group, with a very limited number of rooms that front the Grand Canal, so if you want that view, you better book directly. I would recommend this hotel without hesitation.</p></li>

Not for the first time, I consulted Trip Advisor and booked on the basis of reviews found on this site. Once again, I wasnâ€™t disappointed by the selection. As pointed out in previous reviews, it is a VERY good hotel. The rooms are well appointed, the location good (on the main canal, just a few hundred yards from the Rialto Bridge) and the staff very attentive. On the evening we were there, the hotel laid on a champagne reception for the guests. On a related note, for those who like taking guided tours, I would also recommend Fernando Viotto (---). We took us on a three hour introductory tour that was very informative and very entertaining.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Foscari Palace for 3 nights in April 2008. Took the water taxi from the airport directly to front door of hotel. The hotel is beautiful and located right on the Grand Canal. We booked the suite it was well worth the money. The room was huge, largest I've stayed in in Europe. Soaring ceilings, marble floors, huge bathroom, flatscreen tv, the room was really beyond what I was expecting. It also had two small balconies which overlook the Grand Canal. There is nothing more amazing than standing on the balcony at night looking out over the Grand Canal......like something from a movie Breakfast is included at has a large amount of food and fresh fruit. Would definitely stay at this hotel again</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Foscari Palace for 3 nights in a standard room. It really was a fantastic place. Our room was very nice, the bathroom very nice. The front desk staff was very helpful in terms of helping us plan an excursion to the islands of Morano, Burano, and Torcello through American Express, and helping us find many locations on maps of Venice. The breakfast was awesome. However, best of all was the ROOF TOP DECK!!!! It didn't seem that this was all that advertised at the hotel, but it is available to all, and absolutely a beautiful place to sit and look out over the Grand Canal and the city roof tops while sipping wine in the evening, and even late at night under a full moon! Have a great time! We certainly did!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First I need to start by saying our room was magnificent! The service was impeccable and their arraignments were flawless. We only spent one night in this hotel and I regrete that. We should have stayed two to three more. Our room was upgraded to a room fit for royalty. The people in Venice were wonderful. I recommend you have the hotel arrange a private water taxi take you to the hotel...at 75 euro it is a little expensive but they take you directly to the hotel and you donâ€™t have to wait in a line for the water bus. I could go on and on about the fresh flowers, the breakfast...etc but I won't. The staff is wonderful as is the hotel itself. You can not go wrong staying here. My family will be back and we will stay here!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband surprised me with a trip to Venice for my 40th birthday and we stayed at the Foscari Palace for 3 nights. Fantastic first impressions,very professional and clean. Our room had a balcony with table and chairs although it was very cold outside we still tried it out. What impressed me the most was the cleanliness of the hotel,especially our room. The maid came into the room after we'd left for the day then again to lay mats at our bedside and to clean the wonderful bathroom after we went out for the evening. The location was great-right on the Grand Canal-the breakfast was lovely.Overall I couldn't fault a thing. There is only one thing-I'm going back to Venice with my sisters but couldn't get a room here because it was booked up.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is one of the best we have ever stayed in. I cannot rate it highly enough. We stayed for almost a week. The quality of the building and the friendliness of the staff and its beautiful location made my wife's 50th birthday something I hope she and I will never forget. Our room was immaculate, with an ideal outlook onto the Grand Canal. The staff were friendly and helpful in every way. The cocktail party and free concert on the Thursday evening of our stay was a lovely touch. "Divna" one of the receptionists was a gem, frequently offering help and advice with politeness and humour. I requested a room with a canal view via email and the room we received was perfect from every aspect. We will be returning! Please do not change a thing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a lovely small hotel, well-located on the Grand Canal. We stayed for 3 nights in early November. Our room was very clean, quiet, and well-furnished, though I wouldn't bother to pay up for the junior suite next time--we didn't make much use of the sitting area and it was too cold for the little terrace. The breakfast was very good, with plenty of variety offered, and the front desk staff were polite and helpful. One of them recommended a wonderful osteria right in the neighborhood--Osteria Enoteca Giorgio. Ristorante Da Gianni right down the street was also very good, though crowded. The hotel's complimentary Bellinis and hors d-oevres accompanied by harp music made for a festive start to our Saturday night. All in all a delightful stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was a very good choice after alot of help from reviews on this site. Newley refurbished 3 years ago and still in good shape. Staff were very nice and helpfull. When you fly into Venice airport take a walk over to the waterbus situated just outside on the left. It works out to be about Â£6.00 each to get to Venice by boat. Well worth it as you have some lovely views. Do not take speed boat unless you don't mind paying 90 euros ! The Gondolas were expensive 80 euros for about 40 mins but has to be done to enjoy the smell ! If you stay at this hotel there is a restaurant just outside on the right which does good food but you have to wait atleast 30 mins just to pay ! Apart from that a lovely place to visit and made better by a good hotel.</p></li>

She is an absolute jewel! She gave me the names of tour companies, restaurants, etc., and answered every question I had. We booked a deluxe double overlooking the Grand Canal and were given Room 201. Fabulous room with a fabulous view! Also, the bathroom was quite large with everything anyone could possibly need. The breakfast served in the breakfast room was far more than I expected. It was quite a spread! Lots of fresh fruit, breads, meats/cheeses, pastries, juices, etc. We are already planning to return to Europe in 2008 and plan to spend 3-4 days in Venice. I will be booking a room at Foscari Palace as soon as possible.</p></li>

The hotel was one of the best we have ever stayed in. All the staff were so helpful and courteous and couldn't do enough to make our stay memorable. The room was superbly furnished with an en-suite jacuzzi and there was a large basket of fresh fruit on our arrival. Breakfast was a feast of fresh fruits, eggs, ham, pastries, cheeses fruit juices which meant you only needed something small midday which you could eat on the hoof! On departure, a box packed with drinks, biscuits and crackers was left for us. It's these little touches that you remember. A highly recommended hotel; if we return to Venice(which was spectacular) we will certainly stay at the Foscari again. A+++++</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">IÂ´ll make it short: a great place to stay, located perfectly, friendly staff (we got an upgrade for some reason, so we had the perfect view on the Canale Grande..) Fast and cheap connection with airport Marco Polo, if you donÂ´t mind walking 10 minutes, (only 2 bridges to cross...), take the Alilaguna blue line to Fondamenta Nove, aprox. 30 min. For those, who donÂ´t care about money: the watertaxi-ride is worth the experience, arriving at Foscaris special water-entrance makes you feel like Super-VIP...(90Euro....;o(..). Big Supermarket, if you turn left on Strada Nova, on the right side (BILLA). DonÂ´t miss the roof terrace, a phantastic view and a great place to relax after a sightseeing day! Watch the photos of all the other users - I canÂ´t add anything new...Enjoy!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel having read the Tripadvisor recommendations and were glad we did. Great location, right next to the Vaporetto station and Gondola crossing and a few feet from shops, restaurants and osterias. Staff were friendly and helpful, the classic double room was spacious, had a luxurious feel and was well equipped with everything you'd expect from a 4" hotel. The buffet breakfast served in a small dining room was extensive and really set you up for the day - everything from smoked salmon, scrambled eggs to custard filled croissants! My other half went back for seconds and third helpings every day! If you go in warmer months there is a fantastic roof terrace and bar on top of the hotel which overlooks the Grand Canal. Perfect for chilling after a days sightseeing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 5 nights in Gonzaga suite in April. Positive side: - fantastic location. 2 min to fish market cross the canal, and 5 min to Realto by using traget. - reasonable locanta, restaurants and supermarket are nearby. - very spacy and comfortable room for 3 person. - facing Canal grande but reasonable price. Negative side: - drowsy reception staff having poor knowledge. - take much time to be helped since only one staff in reception desk. - poorly maintained facility - chair leg was broken, drawer knob was lost - no wifi but cable connection for internet. - uncleaned balcony. cigarette butt were remained. - no tea pot in the room. They should add kitchinet facility in the room when they do renovation since they do not have restaurant and famous market is in front of the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this site after reading the great reviews and we aswell were left extremely pleased with our stay at Foscari palace. Although we only stayed for 1 night in Venice, we didn't really geta chance to enjoy the hotel facilities fully, however the room was fantastic, very spacious, clean and tidy with modern facilities. we have never seen a shower/bath with so many different options and modern settings (jets, hoses and bubbles from all angles!). This hotel cost us 259 Euro for 1 night, a little expensive, but after staying here.. well worth it. The hotel is located about a 10 minute walk to the Rialto bridge and 15-20min walk to St Marks Square, which are easy to find from the hotel. Best of all the Water Taxi drops you off right outside the front door, right on the grand canal!!!.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our room was small and our window opened out onto an alley that ran to the Canal (which we could not see from our room). The internet did not work, staff were a bit aloof--almost suspicious, not too fluent in English. They gave us a very good recommendation for restaurant though--Algiubagio, along the Fondamenta Nuove, near the Jesuit church. That restaurant had the most delicious food we've had in this Italian trip. Breakfast was very good, the Filipino staff were friendly but almost shy, therefore, did not initiate any help, like offer more coffee, etc. The room had all the amenities, which was a plus--bits of chocolate, toothbrush, nice soaps, etc. The plush robes helped as it was very cold during our stay there. Venice is lovely no matter what, so it's a good thing the hotel did not matter too much.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Foscari Palace with my husband for three nights at the end of March. We booked a superior room which was a good size with a large sofa. The bathroom was large with a jacussi style bath and shower. There was an extensive choice of hot and cold food at breakfast, and the bacon was well enough done for our northern european tastes! All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. We found the hotel to be ideally situiated for sightseeing either on foot or by Vaparetto. I think it is the small touches that made our stay special, for example a drinks reception on the Saturday night of our stay and also the "Ciao" box, we were left on our last night, containing juice, water and biscuits for our journey home, . A lovely hotel in a good location that I would not hesitate to reccomend to friends and family.</p></li>

This has changed and I can definitely say that we will come back here. The rooms were great, the price was right, the staff was friendly and the location was.....what can I say....right on Canal Grande!!!! What views. We stayed in the classic double room and it was perfect. The beds were really comfortable and the air conditioning was perfect after a hot day in Venice. I had read that people had problems with the high tech shower....it's not high tech and easy to use. For those who might read this, just turn the tap on the left side of the shower all the way to the right and the different sprays will come on.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is on the Grand canal and opposite to the Venice fish market which in itself is worth taking time to visit. The breakfast room is crammed with excellent foods - some of the best we have had.Beds are comfortable and the management shows it cares for guests comfort. We enjoyed the close proximity to the gondolas landing stage at this spot on the canal and found nearby restaurants the sort we went to EVERY night.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a short stay at the Foscari Palace. The hotel was perfect in every way. We stayed in the Foscari Suite which was about the size of most houses in Lancashire! The staff were great and friendly and the breakfast was glorious. We arrived by water taxi - surely there is no better way to arrive from the airport! - and it just got better every day. The location is great. Far enough away from the centre to have it's own charm and yet within easy walking distance of everything. We just walked out of the door, crossed over the Canal to the fish market and just spent our time getting lost. Other days we went and explored the Ghetto area. We also found three wonderful restaurants, the best being the Alla Madonna just the other side of the Rialto bridge. The Antiche Carampane was another great find! All in all a great time was had by us both.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in the Gonzaga Suite, Room 209 for 2 nights Great sized room with 2 small balconies overlooking the Grand Canal Could have spent the whole day gazing at the wonderful scene below. It was interesting how the crowds on vaporetto No. 1 kept waving at us and taking pictures as if we were celebrities. Lovely modern room - huge bed plus huge marble bath room. Hotel does not have own restaurant but who cares with so much choice outside. However, the breakfast room is very small and the choice was a bit restricted. The saturday evening free champagne reception with harpist made up for it - but get there early to bag a seat. Ridiculously expensive but worth every penny. Overdid it with a farcically expensive water taxi at Euro 95 from the airport, but soon got the hang of dirt cheap vaporetto 1 service every 10 mins from Ca D'Oro stage one block from Foscari Loved it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The rooms in Foscari Palace were spacious and very clean. Nice linen and pillows. Staff helpful, all spoke English. Only the shower was poor. It was like a Dr Who tube suspended over the bath with all sorts of dials and handles. Not a good experience, it was almost impossible to wash my hair (couldnt get any elbow room once i had inserted myself into the tube(shower). Toilet seat was broken. Bidet plug was broken so it could not be emptied. Location on San Sophia Square was great, gondola and water taxi rank outside on the Grand Canal. Lots of cafes and small shops. Definately a good area. Also I cant understand why the Doorman who helps with clients luggage, just stood back and watched us get our own luggage from the water taxi and lug it to the front door - then he helped (and expected a tip). Foscari - please employ a doorman who is strong enough to help with the luggage.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from spending our first wedding anniversary at the Foscari Palace and couldn't have been more pleased! We spent a lot of time narrowing our choices in an effort to enjoy Venice (and our anniversary) as much as possible. Foscari Palace did not disappoint. We booked directly through the hotel website and were in one of two rooms with a private balcony overlooking the street and grand canal. The room was clean and spacious, the staff friendly and helpful, and the location ideal. As other reviewers have stated, there is a vaporetto station 2 min away that you can use to get to San Marco Square or you can walk the beautiful 15 minute walk, if you prefer. The hotel is plenty close to the action, but also far enough away to get away from the crowds a bit (and even in October, the crowds were outrageous!). Regardless, Venice was magical and this hotel was worth every penny!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Foscari Palace for three days and nights in early March, 08 and loved it. The hotel is right on the Grand Canal in the Cannareggio district, a short walk to the Rialto Bridge and shopping, restaurants, etc. Of the five hotels in Italy that we visited on this trip, this was our favorite. Their breakfast was very good, even by American standards...eggs, bacon and anything else you wanted were freshly made and delicious. Our room didn't face the canal, but we could still see the water from our window. It was beautifully furnished, clean and roomy. The king bed was very comfortable. The lobby and public rooms were first class. Some of the desk staff were a little self-absorbed, but that didn't bother us. They spoke passable English and sent up an electrical current converter right away when ours didn't work. Spacious bath with plenty of storage and closet space. We will return!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was just staying for 2 days so wanted somewhere reasonably nice, central, and economical. The location is idea...about 2 minutes walk from the nearest water bus stop, just round the corner...and no steps! Its just off a fairly main drag of shops and bars etc, meaning you can easily find the hotel late at night, but not at all noisy. St Marks square is about 25-20 minute walk...ideal distance. The hotel itself was pretty clean and tidy, room was large enough...bit chintzy for me, but I guess much of Venice would be! All rooms have a spa bath, but sadly mine did not work. Apparentley the controls "had got wet" at some point, so was faulty. They didnt join my amusement at having this problem on a BATH! Room was pretty dark...but I guess thats a venice problem when all but one wall is very likely to face a small path, and then the neighbouring building! Overall, i recommend this hotel highly.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife, seven year old son and myself stayed at the Foscari Place the last week in February. We stayed a total of four nights. We booked the Gonzaga Suite and it was well worth the extra money. The room itself is stunning. The view is what we all dream of when we think of Venice. The room was very large and had a seperate area with the bathroom off of it. There is a whirlpool tub and a shower. We used the tub almost everyday. (It does work, you just have to give it time.) We found the staff to be very helpful. They always greeted my son by first name. The breakfast was very good. The location is excellent, not far from St. Marks. We would often go to the Rialto Market across the canal. The staff helped us with restaurant recomendations, tours and boat trips. This was our favorite hotel on our trip and you will not be disappointed. Go up to the roof top, the view is great and we had it all to ourselves.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We went to Venice to celebrate my partners birthday, we were greeted with sparkling wine and some very tasty bite size snacks. We had seen some reviews saying that the airconditioning was not turn on until summer, this turned out not to be the case. The staff were very helpful, although we had a bad experience with one of the resturants recommended who appeared to be not very welcoming to UK Afro Carribean customers. However we fed this back to the hotel and they seemed genuinely dissapointed on our behalf. A word to the wise, before you go on the gondalar (next to the hotel) ensure you discuss the duration of the ride as we were told by a delagate that it would be a standard 40 minutes, however it actually turned out to be nearer 20. I have been to Rome and the people are far more welcoming than the Venicians. But everyone wants to go the Venice at least once!! If you do decide to go, we recommend this Hotel!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was really important for me to choose the right hotel and place in Venice as I was planning a romantic get away with my partner and i think that foscari palace was certainly the right choice. The hotel is very comfortable and the location is unbeatable. It is located In the middle of the Venice with easy access to everything. The rooms were spacious and clean with nice breakfast. We also took benefit from the complementary ride to murano island where the famous glass factories are located, though I have to say that the factory that we were taken to was the most expensive factory and we ended up paying triple of the normal price for the stuff we bought which was really disappointing. When we discussed the matter with the reception of the hotel, they didn't really seem to be bothered with the matter!!! So i would highly suggest that you be Cautious with your murano trip. Other than this fact, the hotel is highly recommended...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">In April we made reservations for our three night stay in Venice. Fortunately we read some Trip Advisor reviews on hotels in Venice and changed our reservation to the Foscari Palace. We could not have asked for a better hotel. It was a very nice hotel away from the tourist area of St. Markâ€™s Square. The staff were very helpful and courteous. There was a great variety of food in the breakfast buffet. Certainly something for everyone. On one of our evenings there was a charming reception with music off the lobby area. If you have several people and/or many bags, I would suggest you take a water taxi from the train station. Not many people knew where the hotel was and we had a difficult time finding it. We also had six people, several bags, and a stroller which was a challenge with the various bridges we had to navigate to get to the hotel. Had we researched the boats better I am sure we would have had an easier time finding it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently stayed in the Foscari Palace for one night during my 10 day trip to Italy in May. This hotel experience was one of the best I have ever had- I wish that I could have stayed for longer than one night. The location was excellent- right on the canal- and my room had a large balcony with a view of the canal. The Foscari Palace is located right near the D'Oro watertaxi stop- and was very convenient to shopping and restaurants. The hotel also has a rooftop patio where drinks were served- also with a breathtaking view. The room itself was small but had all the ammenities that one needed including a flat panel T.V., massaging jets in the tub and shower, robes, and a very comfortable bed. The service was unbeatable- the staff was very attentive and helpful yet not intrusive. The hotel also kept my luggage for the day while I was sighseeing. I am looking forward to going back to Venice- and especially to stay at the Foscari Palace.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at the Foscari palace for one night in October after completing a cruise. We arrived earlier than expected (as our boat arrived at 6 am). The staff allowed us to get into our room as it had just been cleaned. We booked the canal view smaller suite, but the hotel upgraded us to the grand suite for no reason. Very nice of them. Room was so large that we harly used any of it. Beds were average, but the bathrooms were big and clean. Staff was helpful in getting us oriented. Breakfast was offered, but it was expensive. There are several bakeries nearby. The hotel is in a good location with easty access both accross the grand canal and to the Vaporetto stand a block away. Walking to St Marcs was easy and enjoyable. We needed to catch the water taxi to the airport the next moring, which was an easy 10-15 min walk through the city with our bags to the north side, where you can get the taxi to the airport. Would certainly stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for our silver wedding anniversary. A great location, quiet yet close to everywhere either on foot or by vaporetto ( ca' d'oror stop is a few yards from hotel). The hotel is great, very comfortable, excellent service (room cleaned twice a day) and unlike some reviewers we found the staff helpful and friendly. Where it lets itself down is with the crazy notion of providing a tea \ coffee maker in the room but charging for the tea and coffee. I suspect like us most guests buy supplies from the supermarket and just use the machine anyway, so as an attempt to raise revenue it's somewhat futile. It's only a small detail but does give the impression that the hotel is a bit mean spirited, which isn't in fact the case. On our first night there was an excellent cocktail party for guests with unlimited free food and drink. It is still a great hotel and we would happily stay there again and recommend to anyone who wanted affordable luxury in a fantastic location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband, daughter and I just returned from three weeks in Italy, and the Foscari Palace was the perfect ending to a wonderful trip. It is a beautiful hotel, and the location and service could not be better. We booked the Foscari Suite as a grand finale to our trip, and it was huge, with an amazing view of the canal. The marble bath was great - and spotlessly clean. My husband couldn't stop commenting on the very nice bed linens! We were travelling with our 6-year-old daughter, and the staff of the hotel could not have been more friendly or welcoming to us - especially to her! She felt like a princess! The desk staff gave us a fantastic restaurant recommendation - Algiubagio, within walking distance of the hotel. The hotel's location one block from a vaporetto stop, and directly at a traghetto stop was perfect. It was a nice walk to Piazza San Marco, not too long (15-20 minutes with a 6-year old), and not too close to the tourist madness. We loved the Foscari Palace, and would definitely stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Foscari Palace is one of the nicest hotels we have ever stayed in. It is located on the Grand Canal just around the corner from the public water taxi line and gondolas are just outside your door. You are about half way between the train station and St. Mark's Square. We jumped aboard a public water taxi at the train station and arrived in about 15 minutes. We walked about 3 minutes around a building to the hotel. We had been upgraded to a suite, which was absolutely fabulous. The room was huge, with sofa, chairs, dining table, king and twin bedding, two large windows, desk, and huge storage furnishings. The bathroom was great with a jacuzzi shower/tub combination. You even had music piped into the room and bathroom. Everything was spotless. The breakfast was one of the best ever - cannot think of anything not available to us. Venice is very expensive, but we felt we received a great room for a reasonable price. This is the place to stay in Venice if you want a beautiful room in an excellent location away from the "crowds".</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Comfy and well-located, excellent value in January”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My double room was spacious and modern, not much of an antique or palace "feel" but quite comfortable by North American standards. Bathtub fixtures are something out of Star Wars, but I was able to get clean. The price -- under $100 U.S. dollars -- was definitely a bargain for Venice. Hotel values are outstanding in January in this usually-pricey town. The room had a view on the square; by craning my neck I could see the Grand Canal and the Rialto fish market opposite. There are nice canal views from the lobby/sitting area, and a roof terrace with great views. Hotel location is excellent, in real-people Canareggio rather than the tourists-only San Marco neighborhood. Breakfast was copious; I wish, however, that the coffee had come from the kitchen rather than from the machine. I have read some critiques on this site of the personnel, but everyone in my experience was efficient and courteous. I requested a late checkout (noon rather than 11 AM) but was refused; not really the sort of treatment you expect in a "palace." Nonetheless, a good place to stay in Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I thought i would leave a review as this site really helped me pick this hotel for a surprise for my boyfriends 21st Birthday! This hotel is amazing the reception staff were amazing. Very helpful and very friendly.Helped us with the Water Buses and gave us a free map! Very close to Rialto Bridge and just 10-15 minutes from St Marks Square. And even has a Mcdonalds and burger king close!! The room was amazing! Massive bed and a massive TV!! Lovely Bathroom with bath robes!! If i went to Venice again i would definately come back here as it is a lovely hotel. There are Gondolas right outside the hotel, expesive but they were the same price everywhere 80 euros! But well worth it as we got a excellent view of the Rialto Bridge (grand canal) and went down some of the side streets! I loved it here in Venice very beautiful, peaceful and it doesnt smell!! Well when we went it didnt smell at all! The catherdral on St Marks Square was my favorite day. There were loads of piegeons! We went into the catherdral where you can look out onto the square, great view. Enjoy your stay!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We read the reviews and booked the hotel Direct. If it's available when you book, choose Room 209 The gonzaga Suite. It has a full Grand Canal frontage and is STUNNING. - it is definitely worth the Cost - remember in Venice, you will be paying a fortune for almost everything. i would return to this hotel in a heartbeat - but i would only choose this room, not because the rest of the hotel is not superb (it definitely is) - but if you only go once, you must do it properly and the views from your windows are the views that you always dreamed of from your trip to Venice. Hotel staff are very efficient, polite and friendly. facilities are superb, position is excellent, 20 mins walk to St Marks Square, 10 mins to Rialto Bridge, 1min from Vaporetto waterbus stop at Ca d' oro. The Gondolas at s.sofia are 20 metres away. You can stand on the Hotel jetty having a champagne cocktail and even dip your toe in the water if you wanted. This is a four star hotel and there are "better" hotels available, but at a crippling cost. Stay here, choose room 209 - thank me later - you'll love it</p></li>

The bathroom was marble and had a jacuzzi shower combination which was fab and a built in radio in the bathroom. The whole hotel was spotless and the bedroom was turned down at night and the shutters closed. We received a complimentary bowl of fruit and two bottles of water on arrival and on our last day a packed lunch. The breakfast was brillant lots of variety between fruit, breads, cold meat, cheese and cooked foods. The whole hotel was spotlessly clean. The staff were friendly and efficient. It was a short walk fromt he hotel to all the attractions in venice and if you dont feel like walking there is a public transport boat stop one block away. We really enjoyed our stay we found it to be reasonablely priced.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just back from a 4 day trip to Venice and, thanks to the previous reviewers of this hotel, we just had to book it. Thanks guys - it really is all you said and more! Brekkies were great, the complimentry cocktail session on saturday night was very warming and welcome after a long day spent shopping and sightseeing. A very talented harpist and gorgeous champagne cocktails and savouries to munch -excellent!. Great room with fab bathroom. The rooftop balcony was beautiful and saw some very eventful winedrinking sessions at sundown! (ignore the 'balcony closed' sign!) The local area is very cool, and nice to return to after the day tripper madness of St Marks Square - which is stunning but gets very busy. Some very good non-touristy restaurants nearby - ask Divna at reception for recomendations. Good supermarket round the corner with the most amazing nosh - meats, olives, huge chunks of parmesan reggiano for buttons and blue cheeses that aren't for the fainthearted! The Foscari Palace is a super hotel to stay in, and really helped make a great visit to a great city even more enjoyable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I have just returned from our first trip to Venice. What an amazing city and what a gem the foscari Palace is. Venice is VERY expensive in european terms but this small hotel represents such good value for money. If you like small and classy with six star service this hotel is for you. The staff were very helpful and friendly, our room was lovely, well furnished with everything needed including complimentary fruit and water. Breakfast is comprehensive offering everything from fresh fruit and rolls to full cooked We will be going back to Venice and staying at the Foscari Palace. Just a note for first timers to Venice - quality of restaurants is very mixed and not governed by price. Do a bit of research if you want to eat well for a sensible price. PS I have read the recent poor review - yes the building opposite is covered in and undergoing work but is across the square and definitely not within touching distance or even very close. Our room faced this but the shutters and glazing were very efffective and no noise could be heard in the room. If you want a canal view then pay for it!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed in this hotel from 9th to 13th March 2012 and loved it from start to finish. As in a previous review, we also had room 306 and it was great. Only small problem was that the mechanism for the sink plug was not working so it had to be moved manually. Had a small issue with a temporary lack of wifi connection but this was fixed more or less immediately on query. The location of this hotel, by a Gondola station on the Grand Canal, just along from the Rialto bridge was amazing and couldnt be faulted. The breakfast was varied with cereals, fresh fruit and fruit salad, yoghurt, cheeses, meats, cakes, rolls and croissants, hot food (sausages, bacon and scrambled eggs) coffee and various teas, and juice. Venice itself could not have been better at 18 degrees C throughout our stay, and returning home to Scotland with an unexpected sunburn! Walking distance to all the main sights such as San Marco, Rialto, and lagoon trips to the outer islands such as Burano (gorgeous island) and Murano. This hotel is ideal for a city break and again, the deal offered through Venere.com was exceptional.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for three nights and cannot think of a more delightful location to be in Venice. The accomodation was excellent and the whole bulding was well presented. It seemed to encapsulate the feeling of a grander age yet offered the comfort and convenience of a modern hotel. We particularly enjoyed the hotel's roof terrace which overlooks the Grand Canal. Early in the morning you can get a birds eye view of the canal being used by the Venitians to service the hotels and other commercial interests and it is an incredible hive of activity. Later in the day the you can watch the canal give itself over to the visitors when the gondolas, water taxis and water buses are the main canal users. Many of the famous Venitian sights are within comfortable walking distance of the Foscari Palace and there is a Traghetto (a gondola converted to carry passengers cheaply across the canal), situated right outside the hotel's main entrance so you can visit other places of interest without having to use one of the Grand Canal bridges, the Rialto being the nearest. This hotel was definitely part of the Venice experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I made online reservation of this hotel under one condition- we would like to have a room with Canal view. I clearly stated it in my booking comments. On arrival we were given room WITH NO VIEW. We expressed our displease to the receptionist and because no upgrade was available my husband decided to look for another hotel nearby. After this the receptionist ( can't remember his name) who also took our passport, called his boss saying that he has got a problem... But he is keeping our passports and if we refuse to pay for at least one night he is going to call police !!!!! Obviously he didn't realize that I understand Italian... Further with very nice smile and saying how uncomfortable this situation for him is he informed us that he cannot give us our passports until we pay!!!!! It is direct request of his boss and there is nothing to discuss... It was about 9 p.m and high season... so we didn't have a lot of options but stay in this " excellent service" hotel.. If you don't want to have spoiled first impression of Venice and it's people ( because it was our first visit to Venice) FIND ANOTHER HOTEL!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from 3 weeks in Italy of which our last 5 nights were spent at the Foscari. All I can say is "wow"! From the minute we rode up in the water taxi and were met at the door, everyone at the hotel exhibited tremendous hospitality. Upon entering, we were greeted with a fresh glass of juice, shown immediately to our room, where a bowl of fresh fruit was awaiting. What a great welcome. Our positive experiences just continued. Our room was luxurious....large (3 club chairs, king bed, desk, flat screen TV), comfortable bathroom with a European "crazy" shower...a view of the canal (leaning out the window). Breakfasts were, as other reviewers have indicated, excellent...certainly something for even the pickiest of eaters. The desk staff was accomodating in all ways: recommendations of places to eat, reservations, directions, and in general, friendly and appropriate. I would highly recommend this hotel. Not being close by St. Mark's is not a problem, it's an easy walk and you avoid a lot of the crowds. Lots of good restaurants and shops close by. Vaporetto stop Ca' D'or right around the corner for added convenience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from the Foscari Palace and I can not say enough about this "boutique" hotel. If your travel agent cant book it, do yourself a favor and book it on-line: you will love it. The hotel is in a great location on the Grand Canal, with a dock so water taxis can unload and you dont have to drag your luggage. Next to the hotel is a gondola station for private rides and the ones that ferry you across the canal. Around the corner is the vaporetta stop. The hotel had fresh flowers and a bowl of fruit waiting for us in the room. The rooms are absolutely beautiful as well as clean & spacious, with wonderful beds( husband has a bad back) and soft linens. Plasma TV's, safe, club chairs, windows with balconies and beautiful marble bathrooms. In addition there is a rooftop terrace ffor late afternoon drinks and a great view of the canal. One evening we came in around 6pm to find a combo and champagne in the lobby. The staff is wonderful, I emailed them to alert them of an early arrival, they accomodated us, made all our dinner reservations, had a "care package" for our departure with water, juice, fruit and cookies. I would return there in a heartbeat.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from Venice where we stayed at The Foscari Palace hotel in the Gonzaga suite for threee nights. It exceeded all of our expectations - that's what I call a room with a view. We wanted somewhere special to celebrate our 25th Wedding anniversary and we certainly found it. We took the private water-taxi from the airport directly to the hotel which cost 95 Euros, worth every cent. After a very swift check-in, we were shown to our room where I was actually short for words - that's a first!! It was fabulous and the view was picture postcard perfect. Standing on the balcony overlooking the Grand Canal watching the waterbuses and gondolas go by was one of the highlights of our trip. The roof terrace was a very nice place to enjoy an after dinner drink or two. Venice is a very easy city to explore, either by foot (take VERY comfortable shoes)or by the very efficient waterbus service. We found the restaurants to be of a high standard and prices about the same as London. On our anniversary night we drank Billini's at Harry's Bar, followed by dinner at at The Terrace restaurant at The Monaco hotel. It was a holiday I will never, ever forget.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Beautiful Hotel in Fantastic Location”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed our stay at the Foscari Palace. The hotel is very nicely decorated and clean. The fruit basket provided upon arrival was wonderful. We splurged on the canal-front suite on the second floor and are very glad we did. It is a huge, amazing room with unbeatable views of the canal, gondolas, and the vaporettos going back and forth all day. Our friends stayed in the other canal-view room on the second floor. It is much smaller but still nice. We enjoyed the rooftop terrace, although we were scolded for taking our own food (they don't serve food, just drinks). It was not like there were people waiting for a table (even though there are only 4) and I don't understand why the hotel wouldn't be happy to have their guests enjoy a picnic on the terrace (or at the very least note the prohibition). My only other complaint is that the breakfast room is inadequate. The food is good but it is very cramped and one (out of 2) mornings we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. The staff is helpful but quite formal. It is easy enough to walk to St. Mark's Square and other attractions, once you get your bearings. Overall, we were pleased with our selection of the Foscari Palace.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked the Foscari Palace expecting an exceptional Hotel. Having just returned and reflected on the overall stay, I still rate it as one of the most pleasurable stays that I have had in the last 30 years. OK so the staff did not prostrate themselves at your feet but they were helpful and polite. The breakfasts were very good, bearing in mind this is a small Hotel. Our room 101 was simply stunning and the view over the Grand Canal was worth the money alone. Yes some things like the jaccuzzi didn't work and the phone ringing at 2am were a bit of a pain. But sitting on the roof terrace drinking coffee for 2 euros made up for it. The staff seemed to think that if you asked for a recommendation for a light lunch that meant paying 50 euros each minimum. They did happily book tables and make other arrangements. I for one will be back there as soon as I can. Oh do go to the Trattoria de Modonna in the Calle de Madonna. It was the best value food of such quality that it felt like robbery paying the bill. Also I recognise that there may be a lack of cherubs in the US but to hear " geez look at those flying babies" in the Doges Palace does not bode well for American foreign policy,</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Venice Hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I have just come back from a 3 night stay at the Foscari Palace and it was excellent. We were only supposed to be there for two nights, but due to London shutting down for a day because of the snow, had to extend our stay by an extra night. The location is perfect, really easy to find from the bus station, just walk over the new bridge and keep going the same direction until you see the hotel. It's located to the east of the city, not far from the Rialto and right next to the Ca D'oro museum and Vaporetto stop, so you can get to most places really quickly and once you've got your bearings getting around the city is easy. The staff were lovely, really helpful. Our room was right at the top so we have a good view and a little balcony. It was a large room for Venice and had everything you need - shower takes a bit of working out though as it is very complicated and a little cramped. This is the second time we have been to Venice and can highly recommend the hotel. There is a lovely restaurant just round the corner on the Strada Nova that is our favourite for great value and food. If you want a more exclusive but wonderful meal try the Olivio Nero (Black Olive) very pricey but utterly memorable.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the hotel the week of Thanksgiving (US). Everything about this hotel exceeded our expectations. Hotel was very clean, staff was very friendly, and provided advice on dining, etc. The location is perfect, right in the middle of Venice. We took the water taxi from Marco Polo to the hotel doorstep, which was very expensive, but worth the unique experience. Within the first day we got very comfortable with the waterbus system, and so we took the express bus back to Marco Polo at the end of the trip, its a couple of Euro. This hotel was literally one block from the Waterbus stop, and so there was nowhere we needed/wanted to go in Venice that was too far of a walk or at all uncomfortable. A great value for Venice. We were shocked by the friendliness of the city, which was very clean, extreamly safe, and gave a sort of small town feel. We got lost one day, and walked to the end of the city, and didn't realize we had been walking for long at all. Definately take the trip to Murano and Burano, but do it yourself on the waterbus. Glass making was very cool, but only buy what you want. Make sure you have a plan to get it home, shipping is very expensive, and glass is breakable (one carryon only allowed).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Date of stay: 19 August 2006 Reviewer: Tripadvisor Member, Grantham, Lincs, UK We enjoyed a wonderful stay for four nights celebrating our 30th anniversary, We were in room 101 overlooking the canal, well worth the extra money! Divna and Madaleena were charming and informative. It was easy to book our stay conversing with Divna by Email and we also arranged to have a water taxi from the airport to the hotel. Bit pricey at 120 euros but what an experience! However coming home we found it quite easy to take our cases to Fondamente Nove, 5 minutes walk through the back streets, and hop on boat to airport for 6 euros each. We would certainly arrive this way next time now we know where the hotel is. We were surprised that tea and coffee was not complimentary in the room, never come across this before (tea bag costing 1.40 euros) - take your own! On the whole hotel was just perfect. Breakfast room was lovely with plenty of choice. Sitting on the roof enjoying a cocktail in the evening looking out over the rooftops of Venice was an unforgettable experience! Our room was sumptuously furnished and beds were very comfortable. We did not notice any noise from the work going on next door and this should certainly not put anyone off staying here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had booked another hotel for our stay, but the bathrooms were so small you'd hardly fit, so we walked over to check out this hotel on the recommendation of a neighbor who had stayed there same time last year, and loved it. We immediately booked it for the one night we would be staying after the cruise. The hotel was beautiful, the rooms spacious, very clean, with a flat screen tv. The bathrooms were huge even by American standards, with marble floor to ceiling, and jetted tub and bidet. All the extra goodiies, such as toothpast, toothbrush, shaving kit, etc., included. At nights, not only was the bed turned down, but a small pieece of cloth (a sort of small, thin carpet) was placed next toe bed, so that your bare feet wouldn't touch the floor. In addition there were robes and slippers. The eating room, where we had breakfast had white tablecloths, white cloth napkins, real silverware, beautidul monogrammed plates, bowls, cups and glasses. The breakfast was very diverse, with beautiful serving pieces, and included all types of pastries, cold cereals, milk, juices, eggs, bacon, tarts, sausages, oatmeal, teas and coffee. Overall, this hotel is a delight in the perfect location nearthe Grand canal, and within waking distace to everything.</p></li>

The hotel arranged a private water taxi to collect us at the airport and take us straight to the hotel; it was rather special way to arrive. We had booked a twin deluxe room and were rather disappointed to find it was on the side of the hotel which has work ongoing next door. After speaking to reception, they were more than happy to change our room. The next afternoon on our return to the hotel we were given a HUGE room with great views over the Grand Canal. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly. Every night someone turned the beds down tidied the rooms and left the lights on for our return such a nice a touch. The choice for breakfast was more than you could want, full English, hams, cheeses, cereal, fruit and I am sure other things I have forgotten to mention. Again the staff here were more than helpful at all times. I would recommend a trip to the islands of Murano and Burano where the houses are painted the most wonderful colours. The cheapest way to do this a buy a waterbus pass, for three days it was 25 euro each and you can get on and off when you want.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visited the foscari palace for 3 nights (21st-24th January). Having read the wonderful reviews I was slighty apprehensive that it would not meet my high expectations but am pleased to report that it did! As other reviewers have commented the location is brilliant - not at all hard to locate when you arrive weary from your journey. We were greated by a friendly receptionist who promptly checked us in, depite arriving early and had our bags whisked up to our room in no time. The room was well decorated and had character. The whole hotel was spotlessly clean and lovingly kept by the hotel staff. We were in room 306 and had a side view of the canel. The bed was huge and comforatable and we were impressed with the jets in the bath and shower - which we did get working eventually! Breakfast was very nice with a good selections of cereals, cold meats, bread rolls, croissants, fruits, tea, coffee and juices and even very nice looking cake! There was also a selection of hot food - sausages, bacon eggs e.t.c.. all the food was fresh and very tasty and provided a good start to the day. We paid Â£216 for 3 nights bed and breakfast for a superior double room which we believed to be well worth the money and if we ever return to venice we would only stay at the Foscari Palace.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sorry, I am writing a late review, I stayed Nov 3-5 2009 prior to a Mediterrean cruise. First of all Venice has to be one of the world's greatest cities. The Foscari only complements that cities greatness. It is ideally located on a major walk thourgh fare and right on the Grand Canal. Venice should be and in some cases can only be walked. The lobby is grand. The hotel desk clerk was brisk and almost cold when checking-in. I think it was the language gap as English was not her first language. Once we got to the room I was impressed, the bedroom was separate from the sitting area. The bed was comfortable and very clean. We had a room that had an inner court view which was a view of the wall of the next building. I could have upgraded to a room with a canal view, but decided to keep the savings as we were only in the room at night. The hotel overall including the stairwells are charming with all the history from the Duke's prior palace. They did not have a work-out room ,which I expected from a boutique property. Breakfast was an ample European buffet with meats, chesse, fruits and breads. Both days they were late in their set-up as we are early risers and that staff seemed irrated. The hotel is right next door to vaporetto stop and a ferry to the island across the Canal.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Foscari Palace is a charming hotel at a superb location for a couple on honeymoon, like we were. The friendly receptionist, Divna, had a surprise for us: we got our room upgraded to a room with a direct view on the Grand Canal. This view exceeded our expectations. We enjoyed to open our (two) windows to watch the early morning traffic! The room and bathroom were spacious and clean and the bath even had a whirlpool! The hotel has no restaurant for lunch or dinner, but around the corner are several bars, restaurants and a supermarket. For the addicted ones: Mc Donalds is whithin half a minute walking distance. The roof terrace of Foscari is a wonderful place to enjoy lunch with tramezzini you can buy in the bars everywhere. The view from there is splendid. Although the breakfast waiters do their best, we found the breakfast a little disappointing. Instead of heavy chocolat and other pies, money could be better spent on a larger choice of famous Italian meat and cheese (no Vache qui rit please!) and fresh orange juice. And do NOT try to take anything from the buffet: you are treated like a shoplifter! The day we left, we got a Ciao packet with cookies, delicious juices and mineral water. That was a nice surprise. Our overall conclusion: The Foscari Palace is a little gem in Venice!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My expectations were extremely high after reading the reviews on this site and I was especially impressed that the management took the time to respond to any negative reviews. I stayed at the Foscari with my wife and 10 yr old daughter for one night, taking a day out of our two-week seaside holiday at another of the groupâ€™s hotels on Lido di Jesolo. The hotel is fantastic and in a great location and we had wonderful views over the Grand Canal. So why the disappointment, firstly I have to agree with several other reviewers that the staff can be quite abrupt and this especially surprised me as the warmth of the staff at the Jesolo hotel could not have been better. Secondly there is building work being carried out on both sides of this hotel and from a superficial look this is not likely to end sometime soon despite management assurances, work also commences before 9 in the morning so beware. Thirdly although there is a nice touch of complementary fruit and warm bottled water in the room, having to pay extra for the coffee and biscuits sticks in your throat a bit. Breakfast was no more than satisfactory, especially when compared to the Jesolo although I appreciate that there are restricted facilities to prepare this. Hi to the couple from NJ we met queuing outside San Marco. Overall, do stay at this hotel it is great, but the management need to take some action to make it the stay all that it could be.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 3 nights for a birthday celebration and would thoroughly recommend this hotel. The location is great - 1 minute from a water bus stop, or a short walk from the Rialto bridge and St Mark's Square. We booked a superior double room which was well equipped with flat screen satellite tv, very comfortable twin beds and a small terrace with table and chairs with a sideways view of the Grand Canal. The bathroom had a multi-spray shower and a jacuzzi bath (this didn't work - I reported it so hopefully it will be fixed for the next guests)- the towels were changed twice a day if used and there were bathrobes as well. Like other reviewers I found the system of paying for tea and coffee taken in your room slightly strange. Also there were two small bottles of water in our room on arrival, but these were a one-off and weren't replaced. However I don't want to quibble over small things as overall it was a very good experience and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. The breakfast buffet was wonderful and all the staff were extremely helpful. We were invited to a 'manager's cocktail party' on the Saturday night with canapes, cocktails and sparkling wine - all complimentary. Venice is lovely in December (we were lucky with the weather but I realise that's not always the case)there were none of the long queues I'd read about - we just walked straight into the Basilica. We had a very special weekend and the hotel was definitely a part of that.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “One of The Best Hotels We've Ever Stayed In!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I have traveled all over the world and pretty extensively around Europe. And we can honestly say here that this is one of the finest hotels we've even had the pleasure of staying in. The location on the Grand Canal is superb, with the vaporetto stop one block away. It is a 10 to 15 minute walk to St. Mark's Square, if one were to even want to walk straight there and not enjoy all the sights and shops along the way. The hotel staff was amazing from the minute we checked in until the morning of our check out. Absolute attention to detail is everywhere: the rooms are beautiful, with every moderm convenience, including flat-screen televisions, towel warmers and robes. They do a lovely turndown service in the evening. The bartender during our stay was excellent, remembering our drink orders from the evening before and bringing us snacks with our cocktails. The Saturday evening cocktail party is so lovely, with beautiful snacks and complimentary drinks and a harp player in period dress in the lobby area. It feels like one is in someone's sumptuous livingroom. The breakfast was amazingly diverse and fresh. The entire hotel is absolutely spotless and perfection itself. We simply can not recommmend this hotel enough! You will have a lovely stay! In our opinion this should be a five-star property. And we do not make such statements lightly. The staff here is very proud of their beautiful hotel and so attentive to their guests. We absolutely loved it!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Arrived at hotel with friends to find that our two Superior Rooms had diminshed to one room with a conference room annexe containing two small camp beds. The hotel was fully booked and they were obviously hoping that a booking for 2 rooms, for 4 people, in one name, was for a family who would be thrilled at the prospect of a suite for a slightly lower rate than 2 Superior rooms. Unfortunatley as 2 couples who had booked for a romantic weekend this was less than satisfactory. To be told it was our own fault for booking through a hotel agency website rather than direct with the hotel did not help the situation. Beware anyone who books other than direct with the hotel - we are not the first not to have our booking honoured. After an extremely uncomfortable night on camp beds only suitable for children they did agree to reduce the rate to that of one room and allocated us a second room. Unfortunately it rained that night and it is now apparently an 'Act of God' if the roof leaks in Venice - an acceptable excuse perhaps if the water levels in the canals rise but less so to cover poor maintenance - there was evidence in the room of previous damp patches. On the plus side the hotel is in an excellent location and the breakfasts are generous but they charge for the coffee in the rooms (not normally the case in a 4 star hotel) and the staff could unbend a little and be less condescending to the guests, who after all are their bread and butter. Nice hotel, great location but we would not return.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Foscari Palace was lovely in Venice. The hotel was beautiful with white steps, wrought iron gates and railings. Just beautiful. The room was very clean and the bed was lovely. It was close enough to a bus station that transportation was easy but far enough away you didnt hear the noise from it. There were working shutters on the windows and the room was blue and gold with a desk a chair an armoire and a flat screen TV. However the room was very small. And here I dont mean European small, the room did not allow two of us to pass the bed at the same time and there no places to open a suitcase except on the bed. This was disappointing especially since there was a large armoire in the room that I thought would hold the suitcases. But due to the way the drawers were set up in the armoire you couldnt use it to hold the suitcases. We ended up hauling the suitcases to the top of the armoire to store them which others had done before as there was carpet on the top. But when you had to get into a suitcase you had to haul it down and put it on the bed. The last night there it rained and since we were on the top of the third floor the rain was very loud above us. It may as well have been a tin roof. I think this could have been avoided if you stay away from a couple of rooms on the third floor. All in all the hotel was pleasant. The entire hotel was furnished lovely. The brunch in the morning was awesome. They had a lovely cocktail hour. And Luigi at the front desk was everything you wanted. Helpful and attentive. Thank you Luigi.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I have just returned from a wonderful week at the Palace. All of the positive reviews about this hotel are accurate. The breakfast really is excellent. The bacon was just right every morning - I've never tasted better outside the UK. No other meals are served during the day but in the late afternoon complementary aperitifs and biscuits were available. One evening there was a Cocktail Party with music from a young harpist and excellent refreshments - no charge. The whole hotel was spotless and all the staff always did their best to make our stay memorable. A good example of this hotel's attention to detail took place on a sunny afternoon on the roof terrace. We had moved from the upper terrace (amazing views along the Grand Canal) to the cooler lower terrace after other guests left the area. The waiter was there in seconds to clear and clean the table and replace the table cloth he also apologised for the delay! Every evening the window shutters were closed, towels changed, for the second time that day, the bed would be turned down and fresh covers placed over the rugs at each side of the bed. This really is how all hotels should run! The location was excellent allowing easy access to the Traghetto over to the Rialto market and the Ca' d' Oro Waterbus stop was only 2 mins away. Do pay the extra for a superior room it is nearly twice the size of a standard room and it only cost us about 10% more. We have stayed in other hotels in Venice but when in a few year's time we return to this wonderful city it will be to the Foscari Palace.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Gonzaga Suite, even better than last year”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One year after from our first stay at Foscari Palace, we returned there and stayed 01 - 04 December. Things were as great as last year. The same staff (good sign), couteous and helpful. A girl at the reception even playful (in a good way) with me because she remembered me. She was the one who gave me very detailed services last year. We splurged and took Gonzaga Suite on the 2nd floor. We were very happy last year with our 2nd floor corner room with frontal G.Canal view but this Gonzaga room next to it was still much better. Much larger, two high windows facing the G.Canal and the fishmarket. Besides two large beds, there were two sitting areas, one with sofas and another with a table and chairs. On the table of the latter, there was always a vase of fresh flowers. Roof top terrace I appreciated so much last year was not as good this time because of a construction work next door but being happy in our room, we were not too sorry about it. Bathroom clean and with shower cabin and a jacuzzi tub, slippers and bathrobe, all good. The rate was â‚¬711 (â‚¬237 per night) for three nights. Obviously this is the low season price + they give 10 % discount from 3 nights stay. This was much more than we pay for private travels usually (we would have been happy with a superior double, â‚¬160 per night)but from the Venice standard, I think we got more than we paid. Thank heavens this hotel remains 4*. Hope they will keep their rates next year. I will post photos but they will mainly be the views from our room. I took the photos of the room but they don't show the niceness/spaciousness of the room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for four nights to celebrate my wife's birthday. Both of us had a wonderful time at the Foscari Palace and in Venice. The staff could not do enough for us and were at all times curteous and attentive without being too intrusive. The breakfasts were very good with a good selection of cooked food (for us British) , but also a good selection of fresh fruit, cereals and cold meats for our more continental cousins. The hotel was within easy walking of some excellent restaurants. Out of the Hotel to the end of the street and right, takes you to the Strada Nova where you will find Trattoria Da Gianni - it looks just like you would expect an Italian restaurant to look and the food is very good and reasonably priced. However, our favourite place was south on the Strada Nova, turn left at the end and first left into a narrow alley called 'C d Oca'. There you will find Trattoria Casa Mia, which looks a little basic but is in fact used by local Venecians, which simply adds to the charm and character of the restaurant. The food is absolutely fabulous, as is the local wine and to top it off, it is very reasonably priced. We had tried other restaurants closer to the more touristy parts of Venice but the rule seemed to be that the closer you got to Piazza San Marco, the worse the food got and the the higher the prices got. Overall, the Foscari Palace is perfectly placed for transport around Venice; for walking to the main tourist sites; for good local restaurants; and for attentive and welcoming staff, with a high standard of comfort and convenience within the hotel. We had a wonderful time and will definately return to the Foscari Palace.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here on 17.1.06 till 20.01.06. Lovely hotel, had the usual superior room but was disappointed not to have a view of the canal. For that you need to be in the suites or the de luxe rooms at much higher cost. The room was lovely and very warm which was welcome as we arrived in the snowstorm. The coffee making machine was too high tech for me, no idea how to operate it, would suggest you take your kettle as they charge for tea and coffee taken in the room. The spa bath/shower was again a mystery, however the manager came and showed me how to switch it on and it was wonderfull. Invited to a soiree where two ladies performed on the flute and cello, greensleaves, well known type stuff, the champagne was flowing and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Would stay here again, central and near the sights. Getting from Marco Polo to the hotel was a long nightmare. Took the water bus which involved a long walk from the airport to the jetty, then a long boring ride stopping at every stop to St Marks Square where we had to change boats and finally arrived about 2 hours after landing. The cost of this was 33Euros. Coming back we shared a water taxi with a couple which got us there in 20 exhilerating minutes, cost 90 Euros for all of us, so it worked out very well. Would recommend this form of transfer if the pocket permits. Getting around by boat is not easy, there is a lot of walking and step climbing in Venice, I am fit so had no problems but others did. Return flight was one long queue from minute entering airport to boarding, security checks and very sensitive machines caused a terrible hold up, no time for a drink or browse, straight onto the plane. Also for the addicts reading this, Italy is a non smoking country.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A Pricey Splurge on the Grand Canal”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently extended our trip budget to include a five night stay at the Foscari Palace near Ca d'Oro on the Grand Canal. We requested a Canal View ( deluxe superior) room and were not disappointed with our view from the top floor corner. At $606 CAD per night we knew we were in expensive Venice! Compared to other 3-4 Star hotels we were were not being over-charged in our opinion. I suspect the side view rooms would be less appealing. We had a superb high-ceilinged room which was clean, airy and with a huge comfortable bed. The bathroom was marbled, well-appointed with a high tech shower that took a while to figure out. Despite the price a few minor things did not work, although we did report them (the tub jacuzzi, a small bathroom light) Breakfast was in an elegant although somewhat crowded room with generous choices of wonderful cold foods. The hot foods were a bit tired, but overall breakfasts were very satisfying. We appreciated the non-smoking policies. The Foscari Palace is next to a traghetto stop from which, during the day, you can cross to the vegetable and fish markets. The Ca d'Oro vaporetto stop is adjacent and the hotel is on the Campo Santa Sophia which adjoins a wonderful walking thoroughfare extending from Santa Lucia train station to St. Mark's Square (Sestiere Cannaregio). This hotel combines convenience for location with comfort. It was pleasant to return to after a long day of tourist travel.There do not appear to be many surrounding good restaurants although the Grom Gelato chain was very close! There is a cozy sitting room and a roof top perch that is a bit rickety but with a good view. The front desk staff were pleasant and helpful. We did not see porters but that service may have been available.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a beautifully appointed hotel in an excellent location right on the Grand Canal in Venice. Be warned if you booked and are arriving on Vaparetto, which is real easy and convenient: There was no information on the hotel website about what Vaparetto stop to get off at. We got off at the Rialto with baggage and ended up walking a real long way when we would have only been minutes away . Get off at C'Da Oro stop. It is VERY close. The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful. THey all spoke excellent English and were accommodating. The room was large (European standards) and there was a fruit basket and water bottles waiting for us when we arrived. The bed was exquisite, with high thread count linens, soft pillows and down comforters. Our room didn't have much of a view but given the views from the roof top and the views from the lobby, we were satisfied. We weren't willing to spend THAT much more to upgrade to a suite over looking the grand canal. The only thing we were disappointed with in our room was the fact that the bathroom was so small and the shower was uncomfortable. While they clearly spent a lot of money to remodel the hotel, including the bathrooms, the way the shower head was positioned was problematic because the water got everywhere and there was little room to move around. Breakfast is good but not great. I was expecting more from a hotel of this caliber. However, it wouldn't dissuade me from staying at the hotel. The location is great: It is a relatively short walk to S. Marks, to many restaurants, and shopping. As mentioned before, the hotel is extremely close to the Vapareto stop. Furthermore, it is right on the grand canal. I would certainly stay there again if I were returning to Venice.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Disappointing indeed! After such good reviews on here (and paying some Â£180+/night), we expected wonderful things. The building is a wonderful old palace right on the canal, 5 mins walk from the Rialto bridge. It is such a shame to step inside and see absolutely no charm at all. I have seen a 'Travel Lodge' with a better interior. Furniture looks as if it's comes from a discount warehouse, soft furnishings are 'chintzy' (certainly not Venecian style). The whole look of the place is very 80's, tired, uninspired and completely lacking in atmosphere. We went to celebrate my 40th birthday. We booked directly with the hotel and asked, if possible, to have a room with a decent view, by no means expecting a canal-front room. Unfortunatley, we had a room at the back of the hotel with 3 large windows which opened out onto a concrete wall about 2 metres away. Hence, not only was there no light, but the room was dark and forboding, despite the glorious sunny weather. On enquiring, we were led to believe that in fact only 2 rooms had a view! The room was packed with too much furniture, giving no space to swing a cat! And.....to pay for tea and coffee was a rip-off! The bathroom was like a marble cell with an awful shower and a 'jacuzzi' bath with no bubbles. The view from the hotel roof is stunning.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel on the strength of the positive reviews from fellow TripAdvisors. Many thanks folks because this really is a delightful hotel and I wouldn't have found it otherwise. Of course, the hotel's main advantage is it's location directly on the Grand Canal together with the sensible room rates. The No 1 vaporetto stop (Bus/coach/ rail connections - St Marks' Square -Lido) is just a block away. There's also a gondola ferry crossing - a 'Traghetti' - that's literally outside the side door and the gondoliers will ferry you across for 50 (euro) cents a go over to the main fish and vegetable markets - it's like living over Covent Garden but so peaceful and quiet at night! Take my advice and arrive in style from Marco Polo Airport in a water taxi. It's 100 euro but worth every cent and you can always eat pizza for dinner later if you need to make an economy. (There's loads of pizza bars, pavement cafes, 2 supermarkets and decent restaurants around the corner from the hotel. I just liked sitting in the corner cafe reading my book.) Some reviewers have complained about having to buy teabags from the room mini-bar. So, yes, bring your own with you if you must - but you won't starve or go thirsty in this place! - breakast is a joy - even for vegetarians like me - you are really spoiled for choice - and the staff are always happy to oblige with morning tea or espresso. I walked my socks off in Venice - so come prepared with stout walking shoes. There is an exquisite delight to see around each street corner and if this is your first time in Venice, the urge to explore is irresistible. I took vaporetti trips to Murano and Burano (thoroughly recommended) just so I would sit down! Apologies for being so effusive but I've been back in London 3 days now and still haven't wound down from the beauty of the place. I'm planning another out-of-season trip soon and will definitely be staying at the same hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Wonderful hotel for the end of our Italy travels!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Foscari Palace from November 3 - 5 and it was a perfect way to end our week-long visit to Italy. We found it easily from the Ca d'Oro vaporetto stop (go through the alley, make a right and then another right and it is on the left side directly on the Grand Canal). The standard double room was modern and clean, if just a tad bit on the small/crowded side. Since we did not upgrade to a room with a view, our view was of a building next door that was being renovated. We were able to completely close out the noise/offensive view by closing the windows and shutters. The king bed was two twin beds side by side, but not too troublesome. The shower was quite modern, but as seems to be the case with most hotels in Italy, the water gets everywhere! Their towels and toiletries were first-rate and they also supplied comfy bathrobes. The service at the Foscari was very proper and impeccable. They had a lovely flute/harp duet playing on Thursday evening. Their breakfast buffet was plentiful and delicious. Again, everything just was so proper -- beautifully monogrammed with "Foscari Palace" on all the linens, silverware and crystal. The front desk was helpful in offering dining suggestions, calling ahead for reservations, and giving us directions. One thing that we didn't realize until our 2nd day there was that you are supposed to drop off your key before you leave the hotel to explore Venice. This lets them know that you have left your room and they can turn down your bed in the evening. We are used to a more modern system of key cards. Here, they give you an actual key with a very large and heavy key ring! It was quite cumbersome to carry around our first day! The location is very convenient. We walked to St. Mark's Square and if you want to visit Murano, it is a short walk to the Hospedale vaporetto stop which is just a few stops away from Murano. I just loved Venice and I loved the Foscari Palace.</p></li>
