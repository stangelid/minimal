<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is very much a business oriented hotel and is very well located for the beach and city. Room facilities were good. The conference area smelled of sewage. The staff were very unhelpful and even rude at times. Unless you are getting an excellent deal and are not planning on spending much time at the hotel I think you could do much better elsewhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Beautiful hotel with ample buffet breakfast. The only drawback is it was not convenient to the metro to get out of the Olympic Village area and into the other parts of Barcelona. There was a bus line near the hotel, but the trip seemed a roundabout way to get to the center of the city. Hotel charged for pool towels and would fine you if you used a room towel.</p></li>

Everything about the place is nice and seem to be worth the value. The only negative is that it does take a little walk to get to the Metro. There are 3 Metro Stops all equidistant from the hotel. I may be spoiled, because I don't like taking buses. Buy at the same time I avoid using Taxis. Overall great!</p></li>

The hotel is not far from the beach and public transport makes it easy to get about. However, it's a bit far to walk into the main centre.</p></li>

The wireless internet does not work in the corner rooms, so ask for a room close to the elevators if you will need it 2. there was no shower gel - cleaning forgot to replace the big bottle. Not a nice surprise at 2am in the shower.. 3. The breakfast could be better 4. The bed was too hard - had a stiff shoulder the next day</p></li>

Its a nice, modern hotel that is super clean and with rooms that are quite comfortable and modern. The location is spot on with the Beach and the port olympic marina just a 2-3 minute walk from the hotel. The nearest metro stop is 5-10 mins away which is great for heading into the more vibrant Ramblas area. The olympic area is ideal for dining as there are numerous Restuarants there as well as many bars for the after dinner drink!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Hotel Icaria for one night upon arriving in Barcelona. This hotel is in the Port Vell and La Ribera area of the city away from the busy downtown. It was less than a 5 minute walk to the beaches and the pool was great. The employees at the front desk spoke some English, and we were permitted to check in a couple hours early. The only downfall of this hotel is it's location since it's so far from the heart of the city. Although a short walk from the beaches, it was 5-6 blocks to the metro, and a 20 minute walk to Barceloneta.</p></li>

<li>This hotel is in the Port Vell and La Ribera area of the city <span style="background-color:#e6194b">away from</span> <span style="background-color:#e6194b">the busy downtown</span>.</br></br></li>

<li>It was less than a <span style="background-color:#fffac8">5 minute walk to</span> the beaches and <span style="background-color:#fffac8">the pool</span> was great.</br></br></li>
<li>The employees at the front desk spoke some English, and we were permitted to check in a couple hours early.</br></br></li>
<li>The only downfall of this hotel is it's location since it's so far from the heart of the city.</br></br></li>
<li>Although a short walk from the beaches, it was 5-6 blocks to the metro, and a <span style="background-color:#e6194b">20 minute walk to</span> <span style="background-color:#e6194b">Barceloneta</span>.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The best hotel in Barcelona regarding location. It is situated in the middle of the city, bit more quiet and safer than city center locations...very close to the beach, to diagonal mar shopping center, to la rambla city center, in a few words...close to everything that Barcelona has to offer.... Great service, clean rooms and towels every day, mini bar, free internet access or computer use...elevators work only with room key so its safer, nice spacious bathroom etc etc....Stayed there twice and would stay there again! A+...would recommend!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was exactly what we expected. Nice position far from noise and crowd, close to see shore. Not too far from Metro stop (600 m. routhly), but 3 buses stop in front of the hotel, each with daily schedule every 10-15 minutes. Staff spoke good English. The only remark is about fitness and souna, which is outside for access, cold for undressing (no heating in a common space), and both sauna and turkish bath were just warm when working, so really unusably at all. So, dont' choose this hotel for the relaxation/spa, but for the rest it is ok.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Chose this hotel because of it's location near to the Razzmatazz club for a Noel Gallegher concert. It's a ten minute stroll to Port Olympic's many bars and restaurants and the same to Razzmatazz in the opposite direction. The hotel itself is modern and clean with a nice outside pool and bar area which I would imagine would be really nice during the warmer months, not so useful for our March visit! There is an underground car park but there is also plenty of free parking in the roads around the hotel. Was great value and would consider staying again.</p></li>

Lying on the sun loungers tried ordering drinks you would not get hold of any staff within 20meters. They say you can only drink at the terrace when some sipping their jugs of cocktails beside the pool. They do have a jaccuzzi but I'd call it a very cold children's padding pool, mini bar not fully stocked up, no shower gel unless requested, no dressing gowns, no slippers, and don't expect a hot cup of tea there are no tea bags in the room.. Would definitely not call it a 4 star hotel</p></li>

Not to far from the metro and a bus stop just before the hotel, close to the beach. For the hotel : very good airconditioning, nice pool and comfy seats outside, modern rooms, clean bathrooms. The breakfast was good, a lot to choose from, only there wasn't enough staff. You've to waited a long time till you got what you ordered. I was there from 7 august and I enjoyed my stay.

The rooms are of a typical hotel style with a bed, desk mini fridges and a bathroom. We went in December and it wasnt the warmest or the coldest. The swimming pool was not in use this could be due to the fact it was December. here are computers that are free to use. Room were cleaned every day. This is a very good hotel over all and i would recommend it to anyone staying in Barca.</p></li>

The hotel itself is lovely nice rooms breakfast was good. But there was very few sun beds around the pool so we never got to lounge by it. We walked to the beach a few days about a 10min walk and when i booked it I specifically asked for a hotel near/in the centre as we love all the nightlife but it couldnt be more wrong had to get a taxi in every night and pay usually 15-20 euros at the start and usually 20euros on the back. If your looking for a quiet break then this is for you sadly not for us.</p></li>

From the moment of my arrival, I felt that the entire staff went above and beyond to ensure that I enjoyed my stay. The hotel is spotlessly clean, and has everything you could ask for. The rooms are more than adequate, and the breakfast is superb. In addition, they offer very competitive rates. If there is one drawback, it may be the location, as it is not centrally located. However, it is so easy to get in and out of the city centre, this should not have any bearing on your decision. A great hotel!</p></li>

It is only 5 min from lovely beaches, 5 min from the shopping centre and a 25 min. walk by the sea to the centre of Barcelona. Staff, rooms, location, all was just right. The only minus, I would say, the drinks were not cheap and yes, the light system was not perfect. We did not eat in the hotel. Barcelona has too much to offer for a good day with a very tasty meal. We thank you to the hotel Icaria for a wonderful 5 days in Barcelona. Good luck and we hope to see you all very soon.</p></li>

We asked kindly at the reception and someone from housekeeping came directly. She told us she could not repair it and left. Was not repaired in the 3 days we stayed here. swimming pool was too small for too many people, it also needed some maintanance and cleaning. Parking was flooded. At night a lot of noise I guess from people coming back from a night out.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a great place to stay! Everyone was friendly, it was very modern, the room was very large even by American standards, the beds were comfy, and they do have a great breakfast but it is expensive. The front desk staff was very kind. My husband had a work emergency and his cell had died, the front desk let him make a call overseas for free. The pool area was great and it was only 2 blocks from the beach! I was a little scared to stay there because of some of the reviews but we cancelled our other hotel reservations to stay there because we liked it so much. The bus is right out front and it takes you right to the metro. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is located not far from the beach, but defenietly not walking distance from any tourist attraction. Public transport is a way to get around if you choose this hotel. The area itself is mixed, I guess it used to be an industrial area and it was partially renovated for the olympics. The hotel itself is nice and clean (apart from the gym, the pool and the sauna which were in a not acceptable condition), room is okay. Breakfast was good, but the restaurant was very cold (march) while at dinner we had to wait an awful lot of time for the waiter to get the orders and for the food as well... There were some misunderstandings with the reservation and the staff was showing no felxibility at all that was a bit annoying.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Icaria is a decent mid-range hotel, a block from the beach, and a few blocks from Barceloneta. The location provided great access for strolling along the beautiful and bustling Barcelona coastline. We stayed at Icaria during a major event in the city, and paid premium prices. The hotel, however, struggled with the "small stuff" that makes the difference between an enjoyable stay and a slightly frustrating one. Toiletries were not refilled once used (and even after requesting from the front desk); the hot water was out one morning; the breakfast buffet food was often cold; the laundry service was ridiculously expensive. With a bit of fine tuning, this could be a very nice place - hope the management gets on top of things.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Icaria for 4 nights at the beginning of November and had a wonderful time there. It is quite a distance from La Rambla and many of the restaurants but everywhere is easily accessible once you find your bearings. We have no complaints about the hotel but I would suggest trying to include breakfast in the price when booking as it is very expensive if you don,t want a big breakfast. Overall Barcelona is a wonderful place and I would definitely go again as there isn't enough time to see every thing. The taxi from airport cost us 28 euros going and 25 going back, so I think everyone must get charged different prices. I would probably use public transport if we go again now that we have been. couple from Newcastle</p></li>

Bar area was nice and relaxing on the terrace plenty of seats. Breakfast had a varied choice, but not so lucky the second morning, no cooked food, one of the coffee machines did'nt work and the othe one had run out of hot water. You also have to time going to breakfast at the right time, the hotel was full when we stayed, which meant that at one point there were no tables available, maybe we were just unlucky that day. Location of the hotel is good, its a 10 min walk to the nearest metro, and about the same time to the beach/marina area. In all had a good stay, would go back to the hotel and recommend it.</p></li>

The hotel is fabulous- extremely helpful reception staff, spacious rooms, good breakfast which is served till 11am but it's just not where you want to be to explore beautiful Barcelona. The closest metro is a 15-minute walk away - there's a bus stop round the corner though but the routes weren't straightforward to figure out and only took you to Plaza Catalunya. Its location makes it limited to choosing where to eat as there's no where decent closeby. Having said that it was a great chance to walk to Barcelonetta (25 minute walk) along the beach- don't think we'd have gone there if were were closer to the centre. This hotel would be perfect if the metro was a bit closer!</p></li>

The first day we caught the bus in front of the hotel to Las Ramblas but trying to locate the stop to make the return journing was very difficult so we opted for the metro and this turned out to be just a few stops on the same line. The second day we spent on the beach which is just a few minutes walk away. There are also some excellent fish restaurants in the vicinity of Olympic Village. The room was somewhat small for three but it was very clean. The only thing that disappointed us was the breakfast; frankly, we thought it was pretty dreaful but overall a great experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Icaria is ideally situated for exploring the city as it's just out of the way enough to be peaceful at night and just close enough to the beach, one of the stops on the city bus tour, and the Metro to provide you access. The rooms in which I stayed were spacious, airy, and comfortable, and both were on the pool (back) side of the hotel which meant I could leave my large window open all night long. They do begin cleaning the pool area at a very early hour, but the only thing I noticed was the music they played while cleaning - mid-tempo Sting and Sinead O'Connor hits. Free WiFi was rather handy for email and Skype and Anna at the front desk was just delightful. Were I lucky enough to return to Barcelona, I would not hesitate to stay at Hotel Icaria again.</p></li>

Don't see how anyone can fault the reception staff - they were considerate, helpful and kind at all times with us and we had our cases carried to the taxi on departure. They take no nonsense from anyone who spoils enjoyment of others. Witnessed three male teens (French) getting a massive telling off about something they did by the pool, just short of being ejected. The place is spotless and efficient. Great buffet breakfast. Main lunch/dinner menu is very limited but well-cooked. Cross the road for the beach and Port Olympic; turn right for the city. Metro is about 10 minutes to the right, just before the Zoo. Consume supermarket to the right. It's an upmarket trendy residential area and is very quiet.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for 3 nights with 4 teenagers. Chose it as it had pool, gym and internet, all of which kept them happy when we had half an hour to spare! Most of the time however, was spent sightseeing and although the hotel was slightly out of the centre, it was only a ten minute busride away and not too long a walk - with the weather at 23 degrees most days, that was fine. The tour bus stopped close to the hotel too. It was walking distance to the restaurants and nightlife at the port which made a great night out . We found the hotel relaxing, and while the staff kept a low profile, they were there when you needed them. The full breakfast was excellent, high quality and with lots of choice, superb for ever hungry male teenagers. Overall, very good value and highly recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a week in the Hotel Icaria. The Reception Staff were excellent and gave us a quiet room as requested. We found the staff always ready to give directions and were very helpful. Amy in the dining room was delightful and is a great ambassador for the hotel. There was a very good selection of food at breakfast. The rooms were very clean and the linen and towels were changed daily. We didn't use the metro as the 14 and 41 buses stopped outside the hotel and went to the city centre. It was very convenient to the beach and resturaunts. A shopping Centre with Cinema (films in English) and a supermarket is a five minute walk from the hotel. We felt the area was very safe and would have no hesitation in staying there again if in Barcelona. Thanks Icaria!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for my sons 21st birthday celebration with a group of 6 of us. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the breakfast buffet is very good if you can get it included in your room rate. When we were there the evenings were quiet with none seeming to eat or drink at the hotel. Pool area vey good although with a full hotel it could be a bit crowded. There are 3 pc's for internet use which while they remain free are a good facility. A bit of a hike to the main town Ramblas etc but it is only a short bus ride away. The beach is only 10 mins and is very good as is Port Olympic with its eateries. Just be careful as the metro etc are full of pickpockets and we did have an incident on our arrival. All said this is an ideal hotel for a break if you prefer a base out of the centre.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Myself, my Wife and 2 kids aged 12 & 8 stayed here for 3 nights over New Years Eve. We had booked a family suite for our stay, but upon our arrival, we were told that all the suites were gone. I think this was because of our late arrival from Dublin due to the delay with our flight. The hotel gave us adjoining rooms on the 4th floor, rooms 412-413. These rooms had one main door entrance at the end of the hall, and two excellent rooms leading from this door. The kids could not believe they had their own room, TV, safe and toilet to themselves. They felt like little adults but beware of the mini bar as our 8 year old daughter thought all her birthdays had come at once. The staff were excellent and polite, and nothing was too much trouble for them. Close to promenade, and beautiful walk to Ramblas etc.</p></li>

The following afternoon we informed reception about our problem and were told it would be fixed promptly. We waited for over an hour and a half for maintenance to come and eventually had to call down to reception to find out where the supposed maintenance person was! (This in itself was a little unusual as the only available phone was on the wall next to the toilet) Upon calling we were informed by the same curt and totally unresponsive girl that we had spoken to earlier. That the heating system had been turned off in our room. (nice of them to tell us) And that night we spent another night in an overly hot room with the heating still mal-functioning. Another thing. Why when you pay so much for your room, (especially a sweet as we had) is the breakfast extra?</p></li>

First let me say that the people who work here are very helpful and friendly. From the front desk personal all the way to the ladies who clean the rooms, they are all very professional. As for the hotel..it is very clean and in a very good location. It is only a 15 minute bus(14) ride to downtown Barcelona. We did have a problem with the A/C which in the afternoon couldn't keep the room cool. The management did offer to move us to better room. The ice maker machine on the 3rd floor doesn't work so I had to walk down to the 2nd floor. The breakfast price is a bit high by our standards. But all in all we did enjoy our stay at Hotel Icaria and we recommend it if you ever visit Barcelona you won't be disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The staff all spoke good english and gave sound advice. Service was good. The room was kept clean. Spent 8 nts there. The location on Icaria ave. is about 20 mins from the 1st stop in the Ramblas with a regular 10 min. bus service. The seafront restuarant area is some 10 mins walk away with plenty of choice and price. The hotel pool area is small and only gets the sun at certain times being enclosed by the hotel. The tce. below he pool is pleasant to sit in with drinks and snacks available. Breakfast buffet is OK but not great. Had my pocket picked while walking on promenade 1st night, my own fault was aware of problem as stated in guide books, he only took cash and threw wallet back when I chased after him. On last day walked away from 2 men on Icaria ave. who were trying plant and policeman scam, the supposed policeman didnt try and stop me and my wife leaving.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in the Icaria Hotel, Barcelona in September 2006. I was a bit apprehensive going, after reading a few bad reviews on Tripadvisor website but I can safely say I found the hotel to be very clean and staff on reception were very helpful and friendly. Rooms are very modern, with plasma and mini fridge in our room, and the pool area is nice. Nice gym too. Hotel is only apx 20 min drive (€30 in a taxi) from Barcelona airport and it's only a two minute walk to the beach and Port Olympic. Taxi to the city centre only costs between €5 and €9 and taxi to the Nou Camp is around €10. I was glad I didn't stay in the main La Ramblas area as Port Olympic is much nicer. Plenty of Irish Bar's around La Ramblas area and there's also one in the Port Olympic. Plenty of nice restaurants there too. I would defintely stay in the Icaria Hotel again and would recommend it to friends.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is really nice and as good as it gets at this price. I can see why it is so popular. Staff are friendly and helpful; we arrived early Saturday am before check in and so they locked our bags away while we went out. The pool is cold but refreshing and there is a hot tub next to it. The bar is lovely with an ouside terrace. The rooms are modern and smart and the bathrooms amazing. We had the two rooms at the end of a corridor with another door across the width of the corridor so we could leav our doors open to talk to each other. The breakfast is reallgood; there is an enormous spread. My only criticism of the entire stay is that the scrambled eggs were only lukewarm; maybe nobody turned on the warming dish!! It's a short walk down to the beach with its lovely restaurants right by the sand. We walked back from the Ramblas on Sunday. It's not far from anywhere! I'll be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel for one night when we stopped over in Barcelona. We've been to several hotels in this city and overall this was a pleasant hotel. Hotel is a few short blocks from the beach. Public Transport is also several blocks away but not too far. Hotel room was clean and roomy. One problem. Bathroom sink glass vanity which was attached to wall was falling off. Looks like they are not big on repairing. Noticed several things in room that needed touching up. This seems to be a recurring problem with these hotels. They put them up in lightening speed and tend to have contractors who cut corners or workmanship is not up to par. Regardless, hotel is recommended if you do not care about being in the center of the city, wish to spend less but not compromise on quality. By the way, I decided to book here based on the many reviews on here. They were pretty accurate. Thanks to them!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Icaria is an ok hotel though the staff of the hotel was very unhelpful. Me and my boyfriend stayed at Icaria for two weeks and after a few days one of my dresses was missing from our room. I contacted the staff about it and they did nothing to help me. All they said was 'come back tomorrow' over and over again. I even spoke to the manager himself who was very unpleasant and did nothing to help me. The day before our checkout I told them I could not wait any longer since we were going home the day after but all they said was that they couldnt do anything to help me. No help from them whatsoever. Very disaponting. I know it was just a dress, but when Im staying at a hotel I want to be able to leave my stuff in the room without anyone taking it. Anyway over all the hotel was ok. Nice breakfast. Rooms are ok. I would not rate this hotel as a 4-star though. It is more like a 3-star.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here in september, there was 8 girls in total. The hotel itself was lovely, really nice staff and the rooms were spacious and spotlessly clean (especially the pool area they were constantly cleaning this which is a really good sign to me!). The pool area was nice although it was shaded until after 1pm, due to the highrise buildings surrounding it. The location was excellent we were only a five minute walk away from the beach, resturants and pubs and clubs. The only negative really was we arrived home one night to sit in the resident bar which was supposed to be open until 3am and this was 2am but they were closing up, but with all due respect the girl behind the bar said she would sell us beer or shorts but no cocktails and that we had to drink them in our room which was ok with us. Overall it was a very pleasent experience, clean rooms, pleasent staff and great location what more could you want.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a visit to Barcelona. Not sure that the last week in October was a good time to visit Spain and get good weather, however we were not disappointed 4 beautifully warm and cloudless days out of 7 wasn't bad. The Hotel Icaria is a fantastic place. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast which was included in our cost was second to none. Full English or Continental and as much as you wanted. Our room was a triple and was well appointed although the air conditioning seemed to have a mind of it's own. Having wireless internet in the room was also an advantage. The hotel was spotlessly clean and although there were conferences taking place in the hotel while we were there, the relaxing atmosphere within the public areas of the hotel for non conference guests was not disturbed. It was a shame that I wasn't able to speak to the hotel Manager to offer my compliments before we left to return home.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent a weekend at this hotel with a group of lads. We arrived early from our flight, but the staff did their best to check us in early. In the end, we were eager to investigate the city, so left them bags in storage. The rooms were neat, tidy and compact. I had requested a quiet room, and was given an end of corridor location on a high floor which was great. Staff were all very professional and very helpful with information about the area, all spoke great english. The location is decent, within a 5/10 minute walk of the port area, which has plenty of good bars and restaurants. From there its a slightly longer walk into the city centre, but still is a nice area along the beach. The only slight concerns I had with the hotel was the expensive breakfast at €12pp - there is a great bakery within 2 minutes walking distance which was much more reasonable. But overall I would definitely recommend this place for all types of vistiors.</p></li>

A Club Room is supposed to have all the high end ammenities but dont expect to make a cup of tea as it has no kettle, it also doesnt have a working towel rail, found the pool area to be quite noisy with a load of kids running wild yet there is a notice saying that pool is a relaxation area. Cant fault breakfeast you can have a fry,cereal,fruit,croissants,cakes and rolls.Had a 3 course meal in hotel on 1 night for 21euro, starter was fine the main was a piece of meat and half a potato which was a joke, if i could go back again i would try somewhere else because this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel but in my mind it falls short, although cant fault the staff who where always helpful but the hotel just falls short</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First a few good things about the hotel. The room was big and the hotel staff was great. They were really helpful with the metro, taxi's and restaurants. Here is the bad: it is a 10 minute walk to the metro, a 10 minute walk to Port Olympic and a 20-25 minute walk to town. There is nothing around the hotel. I mean NOTHING...The hotel itself was just okay. The lobby bar was bad and their "nightclub" was empty. If it rains your room will smell like rotten eggs for most of the night, they have NO wash cloths, they don't really clean your room (the never picked up any Coke cans or room service stuff from the room, and hot water for the shower was hit or miss, and the bed was very hard.. Also if you wanted a towel by the pool it cost you 3 Euros. Overall very dissappointed for the hotel. I would not stay there again. I would suggest staying closer to town. I was fooled by the "it is only a ten minute walk" it really stinks when you are walking in an empty part of town at midnight.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Friendly and convenient hotel in a safe business area a few mins from beaches and restaurants. Clean and stylish. Very helpful well-trained staff. Massive help-yourself breakfasts. As a frequent business traveller - but this time with family - also noticed that it gets conference business and that's a competitive market. Free internet in lobby. Tips: note that you pay 3 Euro for a pool towel but you keep it for your stay. You must slot your key-card into lift buttoms to go up - but you must wait until door closes and is frustrating if you just arrive. Expensive mini-bar in room, but aren't they all. Shower controls in bath are hard to reach before you enter because the shower enclosure is fixed. Very expensive drinks in restaurant. Menu is international but the cooking is good. Not at all processed. Not very Spanish so also try "Mango" on the beach. There's a family Italian five mins to the right called La Vela, opposite a shopping centre and Consume supermarket. I would stay again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There's nothing very special about this hotel. It's quite a walk into the city centre and it's not near a Metro station. The breakfast buffet looks tempting, but the hot dishes are strangely cold. The coffee comes from a self-service machine. The rooms are small, and their air conditioning system doesn't work very well. The wifi is slow. And the front desk is simply chaotic. Checking out was taking forever and I had a plane to catch: three staff were on duty but seemed unable to process other guests in less than 20 minutes each. So finally I just plonked my room key down and said I had to go, having already given a credit card as a guarantee on arrival. At first nothing happened. I was sitting in a taxi about to set off when one of the clerks rushed out and accused me of trying to leave without paying the bill. The room was pre-paid, so all this fuss was for a few bottles of water from the minibar and one light lunch. Didn't leave one with a good feeling. The clerk was unable to explain why the card they'd already had was unacceptable, and I used the same one when I went back inside.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Modern hotel built we believe for the 1992 Olympics. Reception staff spoke excellent English and were peasant and helpful Staying two nights after cruise and arriving at 10.30am we were allowed immediate acces to the large air conditioned room with hugh bathroom and walk in shower, pool facing and quiet. Our 2 day package included breakfast at an inclusive cost of 108 euros per room night.A good choice of cold and hot food but unfortunately the hot food wasn,t. There was also a problem in finding crockery for late risers as tables remained uncleared The pool was clean and popular with too many 'reserved' sunbeds from early morning although the sun didn't reach the pool area until after mid day Ate in the hotel the first night with a reasonably priced menu well presented. The hotel is on;y a short strol from a lovely beach and the Olympic sailing harbour with many fish and tapas restaurants. The number 14 and 41 buses stop close to the hotel for access to the centre of Barcelona and the route show many of the sites. The hotel offers luggage storage for late departures We would definately use this hotel again</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel Icaria is a good 10 minute walk from the nearest Metro. Get a cab from the airport - I will do that on the way back. The staff here are all very helpful and friendly, recommending restaurants and giving directions. There are lots of good restaurants at Port Olympic which is just a few minutes walk away and I easily walked into the centre of the city, but not sure that my 66 year old mother could do the same. It is a long (but flat) walk with plenty to see on the way. This hotel does not have sea views but is close to the beach. Would I stay here again? Possibly. It is a bit far from the centre of town, the pool is outdoor and unheated so not useable at this time of year. The breakfast buffet was good but they didn't have porridge, meusli or granola or any soya milk. Still, there is plenty of food on offer and otherwise a good selection. Overall, a great place to stay if your priority (like me) is to be near the sea and within (just about) walking distance of the city. Next time I would probably look to stay at Port Vell which is both close to the beaches and close to the City Centre with more choice of bars and restaurants.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent a couple of nights at the hotel Icaria in June, the hotel is approx 20 mins transfer from BCN with a taxis costing approx 35 euros e/w. We were able to check-in at 11:30 althought the rooms weren't supposed to be ready until 14:00, the room was clean and spotless and nicely done, the views are a bit naff but that really wasn't an issue for us. The breakfast was great, lots of choice (hot, cold, fruit, cakes etc.) although it did tend to get busy round 10ish. The pool is a bit on the small side but with the sea a 5 min walk away again that really wasn't an issue, it also has a patio area alongside the pool which was quite handy, as we were able to sit and have a "few" drinks without hunting for loungers/chairs. As the Olympic port (10 mins walk) is just down the road, this is pretty handy for eating/drinking without having to go all the way to La Rambla. If you did want to go into Barcelona/La Rambla etc. then its approx a 30 min walk or an even easier option is to get the bus! During our stay not one of our party (13 of us) had anything but complimentary comments to say about the hotel, if I was coming back to Barcelona, I would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">OK -the rooms were ok but that was about it. The reception was incredibly slow - kept us waiting for thirty minutes only to tell us and other colleagues that the rooms would not be ready for another couple of hours once we got to the counter - could have saved us all time by just annoucing it to everyone. We were on a conference and the food served at lunch time was positively dangerous. One of my colleagues got raw chicken in the middle and the staff were disinterested in sorting out an alternative and could not care at all. Generally all meals on the conference were warm and not hot and this caused all of us concerns when eating. Then to cap it all on the last night, for no reason at all, the barman refused to serve us. if the owners of the hotel are reading this they should have words with him - he should not be in hospitality as he basically dislikes people. He was portuguese who spoke good english as he had lived in england for 8 years but on the night in question he seemed to be suffering from some sort of misplaced aggression to us - perhaps he was happier before we arrived when the bar was empty. Other than that the hotel is in a good location and the restaurants / bar close by were great. Barcelona is a great place</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were in Barcelona from 09.10 - 16.10.2011. The whether was perfect, somedays even too warm. Hotel has great location - 5 minutes from the beach, 2 minutes from the bus station, 5 -10 minute walk to Metro (Villa Olimpica). From there,5 minute to centre (Plaza Catalunya). Just perfect! Rooms were great,just enough space and big bathroom. Although, we were in the room with the view to the street, we didn't hear nothing! The staff was excellent-kind,warm and friendly! Special thanks to the girls at the reception! Breakfast was great - wide variety of foods which was very satisfying to us! Our experience in the hotel was overall excellent, but still we feel that we need to mention several things that need improvement: -wireless is not available in all rooms -service in the bar is very slow (we noticed the same thing in all bars and restaurants - maybe is just the way of life :) ). -in the bathroom, there is a big unused space for shells for examples (just one or two for girls makeup, parfums and etc.). To conclude, we are very happy we have choose hotel ICARIA for our stay in Barcelona and we would visit the same again, if we have such opportunity ;).

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a very modern hotel with clean minimalistic rooms. Good firm beds, laminate floors, clean dark green marble bathrooms and the best power shower I have experienced! On arrival we were offered a suite at the front of the building but after one night found it too noisy from the traffic on Avinguda d'Icaria and so asked for a quieter room. We were given a room, albeit smaller at the back of the hotel overlooking the swimming pool. 6th flloor and great view of Montjuic in the distance and a building site in the foreground but the room was lovely and quiet and so a small sacrifice to pay. If you are going to stay in April then note there is no air conditioning until May. We found it slightly stuffy as a result. I read on the Venere web site that this hotel is two minutes from the metro. Beware, it is not! The nearest stop is Ciutadella Vila Olimpica and it takes a good 15 minutes to walk to. However there is a bus stop outside the hotel and No 14 goes up La Rambla while No 41 goes a more direct route to Placa de Catalunya. Get the 10 trip card, valid on the bus and the Metro - good value as it will save you money on individual tickets and so much more convenient. Hope this helps with your hotel selection in Barcelona. Enjoy your trip.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel for my boyfriend's birthday and we very happy with it! I had requested a bottle of white wine for the room as a suprise for my boyfriend...the wine was brought up to the room about 10minutes after we checked in (it was red but the lady was only to happy to swap it for white as I had requested). The beach is only about a 5minute walk away and the water is crystal clear-the hotel lends you towels for the duration of your stay for 3 euros which is much better than having to pack towels. Reception staff were very friendly and only too happy to help. The room was larger than I expected with a big bathroom and it was of a high standard. As mentioned in the last review the metro is 10mins walk and the buses 41 and 14 stop very close to the hotel which both go to the centre of the city. We had the same experience with the coffee and milk...I asked every day for more coffee sachets and the man who was in the bar did not seem overly pleased to oblige. The hop on hop off bus also stops around the corner from the hotel. We had a couple of snacks at the hotel which were nice but did not eat breakfast there. We chose this hotel because of the close proximity to the beach and we were not disappointed! We would definitely stay again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good value - pool, on bus tour routes, on outskirts”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a good, clean, quite, hotel with a pool and good sized rooms (our room had a massive bathroom which was about the same size as the room space). Flat screen TV in room with reasonable channel selection. Internet access in the lobby. It is about 2kms from Sagrada Familia (which we could see lit up at night from our upper floor room, overlooking the pool) and La Rambla so about a 20 to 30 minute walk depending on your pace. It is less than 5 minutes from the beach which, when we visited in April was quiet. The hotel is located in a residential area so there are not a lot of facilities for the tourist nearby in terms of restaurants, although there appeared to be lots of cafes and sandwich shops around for day time use. There is also a small shopping centre nearby (a block away) where there is a supermarket to buy supplies. The hotel is also situated very close to the cross section between two of three hop and hop off open top open top bus top tours (with one of the companies) which is useful if you like that kind of thing. We did eat in the hotel restaurant which was fine and good, if standard grub. The buffet breakfast was good, varied and plentiful. Overall, although the location means you do have a reasonable walk to many things it is peaceful and of good quality.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “fantastic hotel”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from a week long stay and the hotel was faultless. Not sure what the below review is complaining about as I found the reception staff were extremely polite and helpful, room was spacious, cool, quiet, comfortable and clean. Beach towels at 3 euros for your entire stay definately doesnt seem unreasonable to me. There was a bus stop right outside the hotel which was served regularly and meant a quick 10 minute ride to the centre of town (La Ramblas/Pl Catalunya). The hotel was a 2 minute walk from a very nice beach. There's a supermarket 1 minute up the road so you can stock up on food and drink for a cheap picnic on the beach. Free wifi throughout the hotel was slightly temperamental but it was free so can't really complain. There's also 3 computers for guests to use in the lobby, very useful for looking for things to do in the city and printing things such as boarding passes. To top off a fantastic hotel there was also a beautiful pool, hot tub, sauna, steamroom and gym which were perfect for relaxing after a day of walking the city (which incidentally didn't seem to merit all the concern about safety - just act as though you would in any city and you'll be fine) Already recommended the hotel to family and if I ever go back to Barcelona it will be the first place I look for.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The stay was great, I can only cite user adt52's comment: "The Hotel Icaria is a fantastic place. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the breakfast which was included in our cost was second to none." The room was nice and clean, very comfortable - though some might be a little annoyed by the technology (hint: the key-cards). Location is quiet, near to the beach and Port Olimpic, bus stops for lines 14 & 41 that take you to the centre (Monument Colom, Placa Catalunya...) and 92 (to the Park Guell)are in front of the hotel, and a shopping mall is some 100 m away. Taxis are all around and relatively cheap, metro works really great. From the airport (besides a taxi of course) you can take the "Aerobus" to the Placa Catalunya (4 EUR per person) and from there bus 41 across the street (or 14 that stops in famous La Rambla some 100 m further), but the Renfe train line from the airport to Estacio de Franca would be the best solution as you can use a single ticket for the ride (unfortunately, at the time of our visit this line was not accesible). Check the Bus turistic lines as they seem a good option (not personally tested), one of the lines stops near hotel - othervise take advantage of the cheap T-10 bus/metro/Renfe/tram ticket. And of course, prepare yourself by searching the 'Net for all the info you can absorb before you embark! :-)</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Icaria for a week in mid August, a family of five. On the positive, check in was fine & we found the staff generally friendly & helpful. Rooms were roomy & modern, a feature of the whole hotel & everything was generally clean. Breakfast was fine although cooked items tended to be cold. Other food provided was mostly good. The terrace area & pool were excellent & service quite good. There's a nice hot tub next to the smallish pool & constant steam room & sauna in the back areas. Location was good if you want to be near the beach & there's a decent choice of restaurants all within 10 mins walk. Taxis are cheap & only 6/7 Euros into town. Internet access was very good. On the downside, no porter, you have to lug your own stuff around which was a pain. Coffe/tea making facilities were advertised but no tea/coffee provided & requests met with blank expressions. Luggage is stored in an area next to reception - not particularly safe & I noticed this was the same with all guests luggage. Major hassle was the keycard system, room cards were needed for the lift & along with almost every guest I spoke to it worked only half the time sending us all over the place. Health & safety check is required on the fire escape/stair doors, floors 1 & 2 were sticking & would be dangerous in an emergency. All the family enjoyed the stay & we'd probably use the Icaria again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Excellent hotel, very close to the beach with fab poolside restaurant”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for a week back in September 2007 (just catching up with reviews!) and had an amazing time. We were very happy with our room and the location of the hotel was excellent if you like the beach. We went to the beach once, the rest of the time we walked the ten minutes or so to the metro stop which takes you right into the centre of Barcelona. The bus tours stopped just around the corner from the hotel, so that was also handy. We did not have breakfast included so we only had the hotel breakfast once. The poolside restaurant was excellent, serving tapas dishes like scrambled eggs & asparagus and cheese & ham croquettes, and amazing cocktails. We discovered caipirinhas here and have never looked back. We spent most of our days sight-seeing in the morning then came back in the afternoon to relax by the pool. Unfortunately, there was some building work going on at the nextdoor building, which overlooked the pool area. It was sometimes noisy, but I was very impressed that the builders never once appeared to look down at the pool area and just got on with their work (unlike what might happen in the UK!) and I felt very comfortable under the circumstances. Hopefully, the building works are all finished with by now. Really loved Barcelona - lots to see and do, weather was fab and this is the perfect base from which to make the most out of it. We would happily return to this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a fab hotel for those on a sightseeing break or families with kids looking for a beach holiday. We were able to purchase a T - 10 multi-use train/bus/metro/tram ticket and use it on the many buses that passed right past the hotel to the main tourist spots (La Ramblas, Parc Guell, Nou Camp stadium etc). The beach was only 5 minute walk max with lovely restaurants and bars along the seafront. Great for some food and drinks at night. The hotel itself was ideal with sleek interior, free internet in the lobby (15 minutes maximum in one go), great pool. Free safety deposit box in the rooms which was easy to use. The rooms were modern with flat screen TV, good shower, air con (although the air con was a little noisy to have on at night). The only downside was that we had to ask for more pillows but these were provided almost immediately. Staff were great - we showed them where we wanted to go and they advised us on how to get there quickly and cheaply, mainly using the bus - a 1/3 of the price of the 'Bus Touristic' (which also passed by the hotel if you wish). Breakfast was a buffet which had everything to suit all tastes. Great selection, only point which could be improved was that the milk for cereal was warm and the cooked breakfast bits were sometimes cold. On the whole though, great place to return to after a day in the hustle and bustle of Barcelona, you could relax by the pool after a manic day of sightseeing.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose this hotel for a company conference in June 2007. The property was mystery shopped by my events team in March 2007 and we decided that this would be the venue for our 90 guests. I would add there was no building work when the booking was confirmed or any warning that this was going to start. Upon our arrival we were met with the sign of a very large crane and scaffoding directly in eye sight as you entered the swimming pool area. At 7.20am the next morning the building work started and the sound of a metal grinder made sleeping impossible. After very harsh words with the reception manager we were introduced to the hotel manager; an excellent man if ever there was one. He relocated all of our soon to be arrived guests at the front of the hotel, thus away from the noise. He visted the building site and warned the site officer that work wasn't able to start until 8am. He then made our stay as comfortable as he could with free cava in each of the 90 guests rooms, free breakfast the next day and a complementary stay for my events team to come back and sample the hotel, post building work. In summary, we experienced the Icaria probably at its worst. The building work is set to get less obvious and noisy. The conference was saved by the customer service of the manager and his team. When the building work is over (around October 2007 I believe) you will be hard pushed to find a nicer, friendlier hotel, nearer to the beach in Barcelona.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I visited Barcelona and booked the Icaria through Hotel Connexions. I was worried that it would be a bit 'out of the way' but as we like to use public transport, we found the hotel after a 15 minute train journey to Passeig de Gracia with a change to the yellow metro line taking us the 4 stops to Ciutadella Vila Olimpica. It was still a 10 minute walk from there but once we found the hotel, we felt comfortable with our choice! Although we were quite early, we were offered a twin room which was ready or the keys to view it to help us decide, or we could wait for the double room we had booked. The receptionist rightly said that the twins were slightly larger and we were glad that we decided to take the twin room. We never had to queue for the reception as there was always plenty of staff on duty, especially booking out time! Food is available all day with some options available all night as well. Breakfast was included in our room rate which we were glad about because quite a few people seemed surprised at breakfast that breakfast wasn't included in their rate and it was an extra 15 Euros each. You can eat 'bar snack' type meals which are reasonable or opt for the restaurant meals. Breakfast was ok for a Spanish hotel with plenty of fresh fruit and pastries, not much choice of cereal and no chance of a decent cup of tea!!! We enjoyed our stay, found the staff very helpful and able to speak good English, comfy beds, good bathrooms....we would love to go there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel at the end of August and it was absolutely brilliant aside from the breakfast wait staff ignoring us. Look at the pictures on the website above and they are exactly like that. We had a suite and it came with its own computer which was a major bonus - saved us from waiting to use the ones in the lobby. It also had a cd player and we had two rooms which was really nice. The bathroom is HUGE as well and there are a lot of accessories that you get too, so another bonus. I loved the pool area and the jacuzzi. Didnt get to use too much of it but we sat by the pool a couple of nights and drank Sangria so I was happy - the guys in the bar were just LOVELY and very helpful - even grabbing me a light snack that wasnt really on the menu and bringing it to me poolside! ANGELS! REALLY LIKE the fact that the tourist bus stop is just around the corner so you can get back to the hotel after a day cruising on the various busses looking at sites. The location is nearish to the Olympic port area (walking distance of about 5mins) which is nice - just dont stop at the first restaurant you see or like us you will have a dodgy meal. There are not very many options for vegetarians in Barcelona so make sure you get a few tips and maps on where to eat if you want to get fed properly and whatever you do - DONT EAT ON LAS RAMBLAS!! eeek.. the food was sooooo soooo bad!!! scary - wish we'd been warned before so now you have. The nightlife is awesome so have a blast and enjoy Barcelona folks, we did!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Icaria for a week in March 2009 and found it a lovely hotel. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms spacious, clean and modern. The location is about a ten minute walk from the beach and has shops and bars about a 1 minute walk away. The restraunts and bars in the area are extremely expensive, the cheapest places closting upwards of $30 each per meal exc drinks which are around 4 - 5 euros and higher for a lager/beer. The hotel bar seemed cheaper and that seemed expensive until we ventured out. Id advise if you arent taking anything out of the mini bar to have them empty it as things went missing out of ours, although we told the staff and they didnt ask for payment of the items so i assume they are aware the cleaners must have a dabble. To get there from the airport, take the blue bus outside the airport arrivals to the centre of catalunya then a furthur bus i think it was the 42 which drops you directly outside the hotel. A taxi from the Ramblas costs around 1 euros to and from the hotel. I stress when walking around the Ramblas do NOT walk down the alleys at night, we di having heard about pick pockets and just thought we'd be careful but its organised gangs of in excess of 20 men following you trying to get you alone to rob you....very very scary. The area of the hotel however is in a nice quiet place and feels very safe walking around at night. Overall a great experiance and if we ever went back to Barcelona wouldnt hesitate to stay there.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is geared to business travelers, with wireless internet and breakast included. Both made the hotel a huge plus. The buffet breakfast was very nice with fresh fruit, juice, pastries, eggs, ham, toast etc... The hotel was clean and new-ish, I imagine built within the past 5 years. It was built on the cheap. The outlets were falling out of the walls, the furniture looked like it might fall apart soon. The bathroom tile was a fake marble look, which was really cheap. We had numerous problems and were in 2 different rooms. The first room the internet access didn't work on the floor and after 2 days of complaining they moved us to a second room. In this room the shower was broken and they promised to fix and never did. We rigged up our own fix and made it work, but not impressed at all with the staff. They were nice, but didn't go out of their way to help and I didn't see anyone helping with bags! The front desk lost numerous packages of mine, including ones I was sending, ones sent to me, and congress bags. It has a very lovely outside area with tables and couches. Also, a very nice pool and work out area. The location is close enough to the beach and port olympic to walk to, so that was the best thing about it! Before checking in here we stayed at the Hotel Avenida Palace, which was gorgeous and had great staff!! I would go back there, although the hotel Icaria looked like the best hotel to utilize the beach! Also, highly recommend La Fonda restaurant in Port Olympic. They had excellent fresh seafood and paella!</p></li>

<li>It was built on the cheap.</br></br></li>
<li>The outlets were falling out of the walls, the furniture looked like it might fall apart soon.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#808000">bathroom tile</span> was a <span style="background-color:#808000">fake marble</span> look, which was really cheap.</br></br></li>
<li>We had <span style="background-color:#f032e6">numerous</span> <span style="background-color:#f032e6">problems</span> and were in 2 different rooms.</br></br></li>
<li>The first room the internet access didn't work on the floor and after 2 days of complaining they moved us to a second room.</br></br></li>
<li>In this room the <span style="background-color:#808000">shower</span> was <span style="background-color:#808000">broken</span> and they promised to fix and never did.</br></br></li>
<li>We rigged up our own fix and made it work, but <span style="background-color:#911eb4">not impressed</span> at all with the <span style="background-color:#911eb4">staff</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>They were nice, but didn't go out of their way to help and I didn't see anyone helping with bags!</br></br></li>
<li>The front desk lost numerous packages of mine, including ones I was sending, ones sent to me, and congress bags.</br></br></li>
<li>It has a <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">very lovely outside</span> area with <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">tables</span> and couches.</li>
<li>It has a <span style="background-color:#fabebe">very lovely outside</span> area with tables and <span style="background-color:#fabebe">couches</span>.</br></br></li>
<li>Also, a <span style="background-color:#fffac8">very nice</span> <span style="background-color:#fffac8">pool</span> and work out area.</br></br></li>
<li>The location is close enough to the beach and port olympic to walk to, so that was the best thing about it!</br></br></li>
<li>Before checking in here we stayed at the Hotel Avenida Palace, which was gorgeous and had <span style="background-color:#911eb4">great</span> <span style="background-color:#911eb4">staff</span>!!</br></br></li>
<li>I would go back there, although the hotel Icaria looked like the best hotel to utilize the beach!</br></br></li>
<li>Also, highly recommend La Fonda restaurant in Port Olympic.</br></br></li>
<li>They had <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">excellent fresh</span> <span style="background-color:#3cb44b">seafood</span> and paella!</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ater travelling for two days due to the volcanic ash delays, we finally made it and we were not disappointed. It is also important to mention here that the hotel did not charge us for the night we missed due to flight cancellation as we kept in touch with them and advised of our delayed arrival - this was an unexpected and pleasant surprise! The hotel is in a great location, five minutes from the lovely Icaria beach and a nice walk from the Olympic port and Marina. There are some lovely tapas and seafood restaurants and beach bars nearby, and staying here really made us feel as though we were on a relaxing beach holiday, despite being close to La Ramblas, Sagrada Familia, Parc Guell and and all the bustle of Barcelona. Taxis from here to the centre of town were frequent and cheap, as was the bus service that passed the hotel. We were here for the Primavera Sound festival, and were within half an hours walk from the venue, so would definitely stay here again if we return to the festival next year. The room was slightly small, but the bathroom was huge and well equipped, and the decor of both were lovely - could not complain at all about the cleanliness or appearance of this hotel, The pool was great, never too busy, as was the heated jacuzzi. The buffet breakfast, at 12 euros, was slilghtly expensive given that there are beach bars nearbv offering sandwiches for half that price, but had a good choice and ideal for filling up on before a long days sight seeing. We will definitely return to the Hotel Icaria - cannot fault it in any way.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here prior to cruise 2 nights with family ranging from 6yrs, teenagers and disabled Mum in Wheelchair. All rooms were spotlessly clean, modern and very comfortable. Bathrooms spacious, very clean and modern. As others on review sites have stated the lift system was a pain at first. Card in, let it register, then you can select your floor. Breakfast brilliant, great choice of everything hot and cold. Tried the restaurant at hotel they offered a la carte & 3 course with coffee 25 euro menu, that was good value and we really enjoyed the dinner. Across the road and a little way down the street there is an indoor mall. Inside various eateries, including a chinese buffet, Burger King, Mexican and others. The Mexican was good. Really nice pool area, small but adequate and enough shade if needed. Great spot 5 mins walk from the beach and promenade. We had a really happy stay and would return anytime. One downside, one of the rooms had a problem with the aircon and as it was August it was rather hot, we didn't complain as we thought it wouldn't be resolved before we left and the other two rooms were fine. Being too hot after always being cold in the UK is really a joy wouldn't you agree?? Buses stop regularly almost outside the hotel and 5 mins you are in the centre of Barcelona very cheap and easy, they even have a ramp that lowers to the pavement and was brilliant to be able to get my Mum on the bus without a problem. 10 mins by taxi to cruise port cost 25 euro as we hit traffic, thousands of others heading to port at Lunchtime. Tip cheaper to prebook with A2B Taxis,</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of 3 travels quite often and are members of several major hotel chains. However, there are no major ones other than Hilton near the waterfront in Barcelona. We opted to try this hotel, Icaria BCN...4 star, 2 blocks from the beach, away from tourists and a 16 multi-plex that plays films in the original language. It is in the Olympic Village area which is very residential but taking #14 bus goes to Port Vell, Las Ramblas and Plaza de Catalunya. and it is only 1.25 euros. The hotel is walking distance to Olympic port with numerous restaurants. If you like to walk, the promenade will all along the waterfront. Now the hotel...It is very modern and chic without feeling pretentious. The regular room was large for European standards, sound proof, comfortable bedding and bed and good quality amenities. The suite includes a computer, so no need to drag a laptop. There are 3 computers gratis for your use in the lobby also. The dining was good. Breakfast was a buffet and dinner had interesting choices that are prepared fresh, so be prepared to wait. But it is worth it. Pricing is very good. We had also ordered room service in which pricing is better than any hotel I have seen in the past. Some items are available 24 hours. The hotel has two outstanding members at the front desk. They are pleasant, knowledgeable and very efficient. I know it is a difficult task when dealing with the public but they do so with ease and a smile, which is important. They make an excellent impression. We decided that this hotel is outstanding in price, comfort and location. We will definitely stay there in the near future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros: Good sized rooms, Great location for Icaria beach and marina with it's numerous eating places but a littel away from the City centre, however tourist bus stop only 50 yards away and the metro 300 yards away, substantial breakfast from 7-11 am. Helpful staff. Swimming pool, Reasonable bar prices for a hotel. I paid £360 for two rooms for 3 nights, breakfast included for two adults. Cons: Building work next to hotel which is ongoing and will eventually cut out light and is a little of an eyesore at present. The new work is nothing to do with the hotel and not their fault. Originally given two rooms on separate floors for myself and my wife and my children. Private function on Saturday evening which substantially put pressure on barstaff. I heard one couple being told a barsnack would take 2 hours. The air conditioning didn't work well in one of the rooms. At checking in, my wife said for safety reasons we needed the rooms to be next to each other and to be fair to the staff this was sorted without any argument. In fact I foung the reception staff very helpful throughout. The building work will have an impact. Work stops at the weekend so I think this would be the best time to go. It is noisy early in the morning in rooms with the pool view. The road side rooms are very quiet but I think a little more expensive. To me the pros outweighed the cons, and I would go back to this hotel. My family had a great time in Barcelona. If I went back with my wife I would book a road-side room and and go at the weekend. I might skip breakfast. It costs £14 euro and there is too much. I am not a big breakfast person.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in hotel Icaria for a week. I would not recommend this hotel and do not think it is worth 4 stars. Our room was not ready when we arrived at 10 pm(!); At last the extra bed was ready, but on the nightstand we spotted an empty cereals box and in the closet a half eaten bag of nuts, from the previous guests. After two nights without sleep because of the noise of our neighbours (french teens) and early mornings because of the broken curtains (light), we moved to a better room. But still: the hotel is very noisy. The mattresses are very hard and uncomfortable. The reception staff is nice but the waiters (breakfast and terrace) are very unpleasant, almost rude.(exception: Fouzia). If they don't like to serve people why do they choose a job in the hotel and catering industry? They hardly greeted, it seemed like you had to be grateful to get a drink, when ordering a cup of coffee the saucer was full of coffee, they charged double and we were rudely approached when one of my daughters dared to drink a brought can of coke which she had not ordered in the bar. Regarding the fact that the terrace is the only possibility to sit outside (no balcony) and regarding the prices this is not very guest friendly, when the terrace is almost empty. And yes, the soap dispensers were not refilled, the one downstairs, next to the terrace and restaurant remained empty during our stay. The music played in the breakfast room is horrible and they play the same songs over and over. The positive comments I can make are about the reception, fresh fruit at breakfast and the location, near to the very nice and quiet beach and near to the busstop to the city center (14, 41). We won't return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is run down and in a bad part of town for safetly and cultrue. As for the important stuff the beds were so so the linens were nice though, but the shower was aweful it would get really cold and then scolding hot randomly.I would have rated it just averate because i got a good rate on the hotel but the less than helpful and honest staff made it a poor rating. We asked a non smoking room and was put in a smoking one anyways and when we asked the staff they lied and said we were in non smoking yet the whole floor was smoking. Then when our AC in the room wasn't working the front desk said they would send someone immediatly but after 3 hours of nothing we went to bed and when we asked again in the morning the front desk, same person, said she didn't know what we were talking about and that there was not a a service call for our room. I should have known we were in from trouble when at check in despite the fact that we were the only people in the lobby we had to wait until the two receptionists were done giggling and joking with eachother and then still didn't even ask us if we needed anything standing infront of them holding all our luggage. The area is bad and extremly unsafe as well it is a 10 minute walk to the closest metro and the streets are lined with cops and people have been hit in the cross walks here! There is no where to eat worth while over on this side of town. The beach is just across the street which is why we stayed here and it was the only highlight, but if you need a beach towel which you will becasue they claim they will cancel you reservation if you take a room towel to the pool or beach, you haveto rent if ro 3 euros a towel! What service!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for a week in June with a friend, and the Hotel Icaria was the perfect choice. It's out of the way enough to be a quiet, peaceful and relaxing place, while also being very accessible to the city centre by public transport, or even by foot. As an avid walker, I'd easily walk into the city centre from the hotel most days, but it would probably take about 20 minutes I guess. There is a Metro stop just a few blocks from the hotel, however, and I believe there is a bus-stop even closer, though I never took the bus. I must say that the public transport, particularly the Metro, is superb in Barcelona and gets you to pretty much anywhere within a few minutes. The hotel is also quite close to a number of beaches, and the Port Olympic village. We didn't have breakfast or eat in the restaurant so can't comment on that, but we did order in room-service a couple of times and it was grand. Arrived pretty late at night to the hotel but check-in was very quick and room was ready, as booked. The room was kept very clean throughout the duration of our stay. The front-desk staff were multi-lingual, and spoke English to us. We didn't make many requests of the staff but any interaction we did have with them we found them to be friendly and helpful. I found the bed to be very comfortable, and air-conditioning was unobtrusive and just right (ie, not too noisy or too cold). The room was spacious enough and the bathroom was quite fancy. There was free Wi-Fi in the room which was very handy. The room was good overall. This is the perfect choice of hotel for those who want to explore Barcelona but might want to avoid staying in the nightlife hub of the city. It's a peaceful area, and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the Icaria. - Cotard</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at the hotel on a Sunday afternoon. Taxi from the airport was 28Euros. We recieved a friendly welcome from the reception staff. Room 506 overlooks a road in a mainly residential area. The road is quite busy but the noise did not bother us. We enjoyed a tasty breakfast with a good choice. Although the food could have been somewhat hotter or served on heated plates. The reception staff advised us on transport into the heart of Barcelona, a bus 14 or 41 stops literally outside the door of the hotel, every 10-15 mins. A little further down the road there is a Tabac where one can purchase a bus ticket for around 7Euros, this will provide 10 seperate bus journeys, so excellent value for money. Ride into town is around 10-15 mins. On the way to town you pass the most amazing park, visit the park it is so beautiful, with amazing sculptres, water features and a boating lake. If you get the 92 bus opposite the hotel it will take you to Gaudi gardens (again with the bus pass) 40 mins and well worth a visit. On first arrival the hotel seems a little off the beaten track but the Icaria has the best of everything in my opinion. nice pool area, short ride to town, a stroll to the Olympic Port which has a lovely selections of restaurants. A cinema complex and restaurants over the road including Turkish, Chinese etc and a supermarket. Safe area, away from the hustle bustle of the Ramblas. The room had a slight technical problem with the TV and the staff couldn't have been more helpful. As the problem couldn't be repaired the reception sent chocolate covered strawberries, fruit and cava to the room. A really lovely touch. I would not hesitate to stay at the Icaria again and would reccomend it to anyone who is looking for a nice comfortable place to stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Decent hotel, close to the beach but a bit far from the city center”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had booked the hotel thinking it was close to the city center, but turned out its not. Definitely the beach is very close by, but we went in January so it wasnt of great use. The hotel is about 15 mins walk from the nearest metro station indeed not a 2 mins walk (as indicated on some other reviews). Alternatively, You can get a bus from right outside the metro and the hotel is just 2 stops away. The actual location of the hotel isn’t great, the ally next to the hotel has car repair and other mechanic shops and looks like a sad place. On the positive side, the city sighseeing bus comes just around the corner so if you plan to take that tour you can board the bus from walking distance. Note there are two different operators running the open-top sight-seeing bus service and our general observation was that frequency on the tour operated bycitysightseeing.com was lesser than the other one. Coming back to the hotel review, the interiors of the hotel are good, the reception staff were nice, we liked the outdoor swimming pool and the pool side table setting – note the hotel charges 3 euros per person for towels supplied at the pool (this is for the entire trip as opposed to 3 euro per swim). The room itself was nice, we got a pool facing room but it also overlooked upon nearby residences and shops. The room was spacious, and the amenities and room service were excellent. The first day we had ordered dinner in the room, enjoyed the food, and the almond cake was awesome :) The breakfast options were good as well, they had lot many options to choose from. Overall it was a good experience, not an extravagant 4 star hotel, but if you are looking for just a comfy room away from the hustle-bustle of the city center and still easily connected to the city you will like Hotel Icaria.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The beds were old and saggy. We had a twin room. My bed sloped off to the left and my friend's squeaked very loudly every time she moved a muscle. We could feel the springs in the mattresses. The pillows were hard, lumpy and very deep. I had to go and buy a travel pillow to use for my 3 night stay, as the first night there I slept little and woke with a painful neck. I was very disappointed with the overall quality of the rooms. Our first room, despite being on the non-smoking floor, had been used by a smoker. The receptionist changed the room immediately. I know hotels in Barcelona aren't cheap, but for what we paid I had assumed we would get a quality nights sleep. The weather was warm and sunny (18 degrees) and the airconditioning system would only heat our room..to a huge 26 degrees...no cold air was possible. This meant sleeping with the window open all night, with loud traffic outside our window. We were on the street side of the hotel. We didn't have breakfast. The hotel website stated that if you had booked your room more than 20 days in advance that breakfast was free for your stay. We had booked 7 weeks in advance via Booking.com and were told we were not entitled to the free breakfast as we had not booked directly through the hotel. The hotel is 20 minutes by bus from La Ramblas. Adjustable lighting in the room - we never mastered that. In our 4 day stay. Standard naff hotel hairdryer that takes forever to dry your hair. Lovely hot tub. We ran the Barcelona Half Marathon and had a lovely 2 hour soak in the hot tub. This was the deciding factor on choosing this hotel over others. Pool not warm enough to use at this time of year. If it's too cold for children it's definitely too cold for adults! Noce outdoor seating area for lunch or drinks. Amazing burger and chips! Staff friendly and helpful.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Second visit!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hotel Icaria in June of 2007. It was the second time I had stayed there (the first was a business trip in 2006), but the first time that I had taken my partner there. The staff are very friendly & even though I tried my (admittedly ropey) Spanish upon arrival, they immediately replied in excellent English! The rooms were excellently presented and my partner was very impressed with the overall quality of the hotel. Hotel Icaria is five minutes walk from a "crossover point" for the "Barcelona Bus Turistic" (the red / blue / yellow open topped hop-on / hop-off sight seeing buses), basically you walk out of the reception and go left (towards the car wash at the end of the road) and then turn right (the stop is across the road). You can buy a two day ticket on board the bus for 24 euros and we used this service to get around the whole of Barcelona during our stay. It's excellent value! As for the hotel's other amenities, the bar & restaurent are very good (although not that cheap) and the pool is fine (although being so close to the Olympic Marina & beach we didn't actually use the pool.) I would recommend this hotel unreservedly, it is great value for money, it's close to the beach and marina, has good public transport links and the rooms are excellent. Our flight wasn't until after 22:00, but we were able to leave our cases in a secure room behind reception whilst we went off having a final days exploring before heading back to pick up the cases and get a taxi to the airport with no problems at all. One tip I would give, don't take a taxi from the airport, get the blue bus from outside arrivals which goes to Placa de Catalunya, then pick up the Barcelona Bus Turistic on the Blue Line & then it drops you off minutes walk from the front door of the hotel! I'm looking forward to going back again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hi, we booked this hotel thru Alpha Rooms having read some good reviews there, we wern't disappointed. The hotel is modern and staffed by very young people from reception to the catering and even the cleaning...that said, the reception staff are a little aloof...extremely helpful ....but still aloof. We had room 113 which overlooked the pool but was right next to where building work was taking place so was noisy from early am ...however as we wern't gonna be in the room all day we didnt bother changing. The room is spacious, had a fridge, a flat screen tv (only 2 English channels )heating/airconditioning unit which you could adjust yourself, a safe, a couple of comfy seats in addition to the roomy twin beds and a spotlessly clean fully tiled bathroom with a hairdryer in it. The pool/jacuzzi area is gorg with the pool up on a decked area and the terrace had big comfy leather sofas and squashy cushions, (a business meeting took place on the saturday and the pool was off limits )...very hip and trendy but this is overlooked by the building work. The dining room is large and the breakfast was scrumptious, cereal, fruit and yogurt, cheeses and cold meats, bread rolls and bread for toasting,and boiled/scrambled or fried eggs with bacon and baked beans. Also tea/coffee/orange juice and a selection of pastries. Plentiful and hot and just yummy and served from 7 am until 11 am...excellent service. Walk out the front door and turn left, 50 yards down the street cross over the road and then go left across the next road and you are facing the beaches which are just lovely. Before you go to the beach is the touristic bus stop...great value at 24 euro for 2 days and you get on and off them all day long from 9 am until 7 or 8 pm. You could walk into the city in 20 mins briskly but buses and taxis are cheap enough. I would return to this hotel and this area....enjoy.</p></li>
