<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I wanted some luxury in Istanbul and found it here. Great staff and a spacious and clean room with a stunning 14th floor view of the Bospourus. The spa is great, with a good gym area with free weights, machines, cardio and a pool area to catch some sun. I took a Turkish bath and I highly recommend it! I felt so squeaky clean afterwards! The location is good by Taksim square. The advance purchase rate plus my Ambassador benefits made this a good value.</p></li>

There are things that you have in your own hands with a holiday, some aspects lie with the people in the hotel and they were truly remarkable.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a very nice hotel and has all of the amenities you would expect. Beautiful views of the bosphorus. Nice fitness center. We stayed in a smaller hotel in Sultanahmet the first half of our trip so I felt this was a little impersonal although quite nice. If you are only there a short time and want to tour a lot of sites, I would stay over in Sultanahmet rather than here. This hotel had more english speaking staff than anywhere else we stayed in Turkey.</p></li>

The hotel does have an excellent gym (one of the best anywhere as far as space, equipment and pros, and then treadmills, etc.) and a great turkish steam room (time for men only, women only (recommended time for women to use without a bunch of men with/without towels) and then mixed).

The neighborhood is close to Taksim Square and the surrounding area is nice to walk around. The hotel had a very nice pool and spa/gym. Even got a Turkish scrub there which was awesome! We had a robust wireless and the breakfasts were outstanding. Yes, it is about a 40 Lyra cab ride from Attaturk but once there, you are in the heart of the city.</p></li>

Room was spacious, beautifuly decorated and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! I stayed with my girlfriend and I took her there in order to propose to her. During my check-in I had told this to the reception and they were nice enough to send me complimentary wine, fruits and a cake to my room. Had dinner at the rooftop restaurant. Pricey but well worth the money spent. It is a great hotel if you can afford it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have just organised a medical congress here and everyone loved the hotel. Service is exceptional and the food, especially the breakfast, is excellent. The rooms are very good and is well worth while paying the extra for the Bosphorus view. One can always tell a good hotel when the General Manager is always available and when he can be seen checking out breakfast. I have no hesitation in highly recommending this hotel in this fabulous city. But.........watch out for the taxi drivers! Only use those recommended by the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is very well located; itâ€™s away from the Taksim noise yet only a minuteâ€™s walk to the business heart of Istanbul. The reception was perfect and we got an early check-in at 10:00 and they even gave us a room on a high floor with partial Bosphorus view upon our request. The breakfast was also good. All this made us wish we had stayed longer as we only had booked one night with the hotel. The only downside was the standard rooms being a bit cramped and the beds which were not big enough for anyone taller than 6 feet!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">During my recent stay at this hotel, I was thrilled by the level of hospitality of the staff. Knowing this was my first trip to Istanbul, he upgraded us to a suite with a great view of the city. The hotel for the most part is extremely clean and the staff is very cordial. The food at the hotel is great, although expensive. You are a short walk from major authentic restaurants so this would not be a great problem. The hotel is far from the airport and old city, which can be a problem. The pastry restaurant at the lobby is fantastic.</p></li>

For my needs, I like this property best for value, location to the walking area, and especially for the super friendly staff. Best of all is the view from the Sky Bar which is absolutely mesmerizing as you watch the sailboats, yachts and cargo ships pass through the blue waters of the Bosphorus. Recently, I was on a business trip and forgot to take a copy of my invoice. I emailed the hotel once back in London, and within one hour, I had received a PDF copy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A colleague recommended that we stay at the Intercontinental. It is a good location in Taksim. Most other people may stay in Sultanahmet because of the close proximity of the tourist things to do, but we decided to stay (and glad we did) in Taksim because it was near the shopping district and bars. This hotel is everything you would expect from an Intercontinental hotel. We had breakfast included in our price (150 euros plus tax per night). The staff were friendly and the concierge helpful. Internet was not complimentary. Swimming pool was also very nice.</p></li>

Located very close to Taksim which has shopping,nightlife, dining and very cosmopolitan. Walk, taxi or take nearby train across to the Asian side of Istanbul to visit most of the attractions.

But it is close to the main shopping street district and also very suitable for business purposes. The room is wonderful, large, clean, all facilities. Really, one could not wish anything more.

The service was great: You could have anything you wanted just with a phone call to the reception. The food was very good and the breakfast had a great variety. All the rooms were very big and very nice decorated. In my opinion the best was the gym... It was the biggest and nicest i have ever been in and the trainers were very helpful. The only negative was the bar in the lobby which was very noisy. There is also a bar-restaurant at the top flour with great view to the Bosporus and the rest of the town.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">2 things were bad about my visit. The restaurant on the top floor was in renovation, and so you only had the smaller garden restaurant on the lobby floor to eat. This takes away one of the most important features of the hotel. I would have appreciated that they would have mentioned that at booking. Second the rooms...they are quite old, a bit worn out.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed in the hotel when I was on a business trip. There is no way that you rank this hotel 5 stars. the carpet is old and smelly. The internet is extremely slow. The worst part is the housekeeping. Whenever I leave the room they go in even though the room was cleaned earlier. I was really suspicious. One of my colleagues left 350 TL in his jacket inside the room. When he came back he found 150 TL. Other colleagues were complaining about the housekeeping as well. The situation is really not comfortable. To be fair, the hotel serves very good breakfast and it is located in very nice spot of the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is bit old and the rooms kind of reflect the same but the location is excellent. You can walk out and have breakfast in small restaurants just below and Istiklal street and Taksim is just around the corner (5 min walk). We were given an excellent room with the view of Bosphorus. It is not in the city centre but the travel to main tourist location is very easy with tram / train. The hotel staff is very knowledgeable, well trained and helpful. The service is excellent. The bar on the top floor has an amazing view (must visit). I would love to stay again in Intercon Istanbul and would recommend it highly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked a room with Bosphorous view for the weekend. On arrival at 2pm the room was not ready after waiting 1/2 hour we were assigned a corner room with a tiny view of the Bosphorous. On complaining we were given a club room without club benefits and again no view. They finally gave us the room with a view that we had booked and were charging us handsomely for (234 euros room only). It took an hour to get this most of the time being ignored by the reception staff while they checked their computers. Unsurprisingly my feedback form did not elicit a response. Overpriced and not worth it, will stay at the Hilton next time.</p></li>

As most of the Intercontinental Hotels the building itself is a high rising concrete block . The hotel is centraly located on Taksim Square. The staff is very freindly and competent, assisting whereever they can. The doormen are very helpful when hiring taxis, always explaining the driver where you want to go to. We had nice rooms with Bosporus view. The lobby, the bar and the restaurants are missing some kind of cosiness but the service is perfect.</p></li>

If you carry more thann1 device, you are required to pay for them if you require wifi connection on each. Likewise, no digital movie rental service. You need to physically check out their 100 DVD library service, stashed in their depressing "business centre" - half of which you cannot understand as the covers are all in Turkish, and to top that, they charge you to come over to your room and installva DVD player + for each DVD you decide to rent. Other than the location, this hotel is nothing but a grand waste of a show! The hyatt next door is far better & deserving!</p></li>

The room is very nicely decorated, not old fshion at all. The hotel facilities are very good: pool, hammam, gym etc..The lobby is huge and well decorated. The breakfast was great: amazing selection of food including Turkish delights, fresh orange juice, omelette etc, etc.. Staff is very friendy and efficient.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A really pleasant stay all round, from good first impressions at check in to departure. Every single staff member was friendly and willing to help in any way. The only thing I would say is that the club lounge breakfast could be more varied and improved to reflect the status of the club privilege. We tried breakfast on the last day in the brasserie restaurant and while the service was again very good, the buffet selection could be better. I would have expected much better (quality and variety) meat selections for breakfast - both cold cuts and warm - at a 5 star hotel. Other than this i have no complaints about the hotel and would come and stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I picked this hotel for a three day leisure trip. It proved to be a great choice. It is well located close to Taxim square, but also away from all the fuss. The rooms are comfortable and kept well cleaned. A room with a bosporous view would be a good choise, allthough more expensive. Roof top bar also great with wonderful view of the city. Hotel staff is friendly and efficient and will provide any information needed for travelers.However they should pay more attention to breakfast wich is not up to five star hotel standards. Expensive internet use and lack of an indoor swimming pool are a disadvantage for the ones on business trips or those looking for realaxation.</p></li>

Spacious room with a separate working area, partially overlooking the Bosporus. Friendly and professional staff. Good breakfast choice, though the regular coffee is not great (better order espresso from the machine). Pity the city bar on the top floor was closed this time. The hotel is well located, close to Taskim Square Architecture of the building and the interior design is not particularly beautiful and is no way as sumptuous as Ciragan Palace or Four Seasons at the Bosporus, but at half the price a good alternative for business travel</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A very nice hotel, friendly staff and very good service. Hotel also has a top floor bar with great views of the city. The hotel is in a good location close to Taksim Square and with restaurants nearby. The city is spread out and at first seemed difficult to get about, but once you get your bearings you can walk to most of teh sites. Taxis are pretty good, but the traffic at rush hour is very busy and it can be quicker to walk. The rooms at the hotel are of a good size and well furinished. The food is good, but generally it is cheper to eat out plus there are great restaurants offering good local cusine nearby. Overall a good hotel either for business or a short break.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Basically you get what you pay for: high standard of room, service and faciliites as you'd expect. We were staying on a free night voucher and had an upgrade to a bosphorous view king room which was well accomodated. Pool area and sauna facilities also good. If you want to visit all the old town sites and have limited time, then i wouldn't recommend staying here as it's too far out of town. If you've done the old town or want the newer area of town nearer the shopping, bars and restaurants then this is pretty well located. You're never going to get an authentic ottoman experience at a 16-floor international hotel but in return you get the service and safety element instead</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The most amazing thing about our stay was the quality of its service. The staff were extremely courteous and welcoming, doing their best to help. The hotel is located near Taksim, the heart of Istanbul. It's also very close to NiÅŸantaÅŸÄ±, a hip neighborhood. Rooms were comfortable and clean, with excellent sound insulation. Safran restaurant, City Lights bar and room service food were all excellent. However they were very expensive. Way too expensive even considering the quality. Besides this price issue, my only complaint is that there was no free wifi. This is a big issue for business travelers. Highly recommended (except for the lack of free wifi and the pricey food&drinks)</p></li>

Just feel the linen and you can feel the really luxurious quality. I felt like i was rich when i slept in this linen. The curtains are beautiful. Go up to the top floor the restaurant is very beautiful. wow. food is also good. Try going to the bathroom of the bar and you will be amazed. what a bathroom it is! I also went to the gym expecting the usual hotel gym, wow was i impressed, this was the size of a normal gym!! Lots of equipment and space.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for a short two day business trip. Check-in was quick, polite and efficient and gave me a free small upgrade to the Business Club floor (without access to the lounge). Rooms were of a pretty reasonable standard (but no in-room movies), only real criticism would be of the slow internet service. Value wise, this is correctly priced as a low to mid level 5 star hotel in a central location. Have stayed in both the Cirigan Palace and Ritz- Carlton in Istanbul many times and found these to be appropriately more expensive but not as good value as the Intercontinental. So, if you want a decent room in a decent hotel in the heart of Istanbul at a reasonable price then this is a good pick.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is nearly perfect for a relaxing spa break. Both the room and the spa facilities meet the 5-star level. The hotel offers everything not to want to leave it in this winter weather. We had a corner deluxe room with side Bosphoros view, and it was very spacious. Floor-to-ceiling panoramic windows do their job and one can watch the vessels pass by during the day time and the Bosphoros bridge changing its illumination colors at dark. Amazing! The bed was very comfortable but for the picky ones there was an option to chose pillows to their liking from the list of about 8 different kinds. Other details were well thought out and taken care of as well. It your budget allows. definitely go for it.</p></li>

As a priority club member, I was upgraded to a club room with no access to the club lounge however... The room was very traditionally decorated, as the hotel in total, probably close to the taste of the Russian and Arabic clientele. The room service was very expensive and the breakfast as well. I paid 125 euros for the room and I was requested to pay 40 euros for breakfast! The fitness centre was fully equipped. There was also a swimming pool, turkish bath and everything one would expect from a 5 star hotel. Service was very good in total. I would probably stay there again, although I would prefer a more European style hotel next time...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'll admit that I'm not a regular customer at Intercontinental hotels, that might be the reason why I thought it was just a bit too snobby, too much "gold & glass", but it was very elegant. I stayed at a business room in the corner of the seventeenth floor and had an amazing view over Istanbul and the Bosphorus strate, my colleague had a view of the blue mosque. I had room service-dinner and enjoyed the view all night after a lovely stay in the pool. It's not too big but it's absolutely lovely when you've had a busy day in 35 degrees celcius:) The hotel is located on a hilltop so I would definatly recommend taking a taxi home, but it is still centrally located. I will also warmly recommend a cold beer in the bar on the 20th floor. The view is amazing.</p></li>

I asked for a rental mobile phone and it never came even though I reminded them about it twice. I also asked if I could make a local phone call at the reception since my room was not ready and they sent me to the business center where I had to pay. It's the little things that matter.

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Ceylan Intercontinental for 4 nights with my husband. We were upgraded to the 18 th floor, the club level and the room 1824 was lovely with an excellent view on the Bosphorus. Great location , 2 minutes walking to Taksim square and Istiklal street where all the shops and restaurants are. The staff are friendly. The buffet breakfast is excellent with lots of varities and some Turkish specialities. There is also a Japanese section for breakfast.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in this hotel for three nights and it made what could be a difficult city a lot easier to see! The front desk was very helpful and knowledgeable and everything was very fast. They were glad to tell me the best and safest ways to utilize taxis. For example, they recommended we visit a well known hotel taxi stand in order to get a taxi back from the Hagia Sofia to avoid any potential problems. This hotel is not exactly next to the that tourist area so it took a bit of effort to get over there. Nearby is a mostly pedestrian street lined with restaurants and interesting shops. It is a very modern and young section where many people are walking around. You just have to navigate your way through a park to get there. The rooms were very clean and modern. Everything was up to expectations! I would gladly use this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just got back from a wonderful trip to Istanbul and it was topped off by the terrific service and hospitality and beauty of the Intercontinental hotel. A thumbs up to all the staff with a special mention to a Mr. Dogan. He upgraded us on checkin to a junior suite and offered us complimentary hot chocolate while waiting for the room. The room was incredible and made our stay very comfortable. It was so nice that we had to fight with ourselves to leave the room to sell the sights. Overall, Istanbul was a great place to visit - the only negative that has nothing to do the hotel was the taxi prices - they are so expensive especially if you are from Thailand like I am. Try to use the metro or tram whenever possible :) Also use turkeytravelplanner.com to plan your trip and use the backpackers tour company for the airport transfers :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is not located next to all major sights, but it is a short taxi ride away, about 15 mins depending on traffic. Staff, especially the concierge was wonderful. Rooms are large and clean and modern. The one caution note. They offer 30 mins free wifi each day. They don't tell you that is 30 mins consecutive mins. If you go off and on for total of 30 mins they try to charge you extra. We complained at check out and they did remove the billing. They may have changed the notice by now because they admitted their instructions were unclear. The breakfast was excellent, huge amount of selections and good food. I'd suggest dinner out at local restaurants since the local food is so good. If you want to be in walking distance of blue mosque, bazaar this is not the hotel to book. But if you want an excellent secure hotel, this is it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed here six or seven times - I've often been left with a great impression and other times, I leave wishing I'd stayed in the Hyatt across the street. Some rooms are out of this world. It is worth paying for a room with Bosphorous view as it is breathtaking. However, while some rooms have a full view (magnificent), due to the strange design of the hotel others just have a small view (you might just see it if you angle yourself right). I have been upgraded to suites a couple of times and these rooms were amazing. The standard rooms, however, aren't anywhere near as luxurious. They look a bit dated too. The service is very very good. Checkin staff are always friendly. Room service is high quality (albeit expensive). The pool is really great in the summer and there is a sauna, steam room etc too. And of course a Turkish bath (which I am yet to try).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Made a mistake with my reservation and I was very impressed by how helpful the reception staff were in sorting it out for me. Iâ€™d booked at the Crowne Plaza by mistake and they cancelled that reservation (even though it was past the time) and gave us a beautiful room at a good rate even though the hotel was almost full. This is a classy if typical Intercontinental and very comfortable and elegant. Most of the rooms have fantastic views over the City and Bosphorus. The view from the rooftop bar is fantastic. It is an expensive hotel but you get what you pay for - the minibar is going to be a rip-off - don't book here if you are on a budget! I was really impressed by Istanbul - the City has come on leaps and bounds since I was last here some 30 years ago. The Ceylan is an intercontinental (small 'i') hotel and not very Turkish but enjoyed this as a contrast to the frenetic Turkish traffic and city life.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We felt welcomed the minute we arrived. Very friendly staff at all levels. We stayed on the club level which included breakfast and happy hour. Both had great food and drinks. Our room had a view of the Bosphorous. Room was clean and shower pressure was wonderful. Very quiet too which is one of my favorite things. We stayed five nights and never heard anyone else. The walk to the tram to get to the historic district was easy and the trams are very efficient. Bed was wonderful. Anytime we called down with any request it was solved in minutes. We accidently set the room safe incorrecty and called down an within minutes security arrived to fix it. Our only complaint was the laundry service was out of control expensive. $12 for a pair of socks! We asked about local self serve laundry and couldn't get a straight answer from the concierge. Also asked that the local tourist office and was told to go to the hotels.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here 3 nights prior to embarking on our cruise. The staff couldn't have been nicer and more helpful. We arrived at the check-in desk about 10:45 on Easter Sunday directly from the airport and our overnight flight. Check in was quick and when we asked if they were still serving breakfast, the desk called up to the restaurant to let them know we would be coming up for breakfast to be certain they kept the buffet out for us. We were greeted cordially then in the restaurant and every morning thereafter. The concierge recommended wonderful restaurants and made reservations for us. The staff at the rooftop lounge was also very pleasant and eager to please. The food was excellent both at breakfast and in the lounge. All of the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. We were so happy to be so centrally located. we took the tram to Sultanahmet and it was very convenient. We would definitely stay here again if we return to Istanbul.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A very enjoyable stay at the Ceylan Intercontinental”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is what one would expect for a 5 star hotel. The lobby is big and it feels like a classic, solid 5 star hotel, the moment you step in. Check-in was fast and efficient. The reception staff was very professional. The rooms are big and comfortable. The restaurants are wonderful. The food is very tasty. I recommend vividly the Saffron restaurant, located in the top floor of the hotel. The Turkish cuisine served is fabulous and the view is simply magnificent. I dinned there twice during my stay and both times I was not let down. The other restaurants are very good, but I think the staff needs a little more training, compared to that of the Saffron. The hotel has a very central location, and it is only a 5 minute walk to the Bosphorus. It is also very convenient if you want to explore the city. I enjoyed very much my stay at the Ceylan Intercontinental and I will definitely be back on my next trip to Istanbul. It is one of the best hotels in Istanbul.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotels in Istanbul are very expensive, and even more so during the season period. We booked the Ceylan Intercontinental depending on the Intercontinental brand which for most part is quite consistently good. However, I must say that we were extremely disappointed with this property. The rooms were very average and and in the need for some major renovation and modernizing. For the price we paid (upwards of Euro 300 without breakfast) we would have expected much better. The hotel lobby was also ok and the restaurents also very highly priced. the fitness area was also quite bad to say the least - somthing i would have expected in a 2-3 star hotel. The location though is quite ok, about a 7-10 minute walk along the main road to Istiklal Cadessi. I think other hotels like the Ritz and Hilton in the are better options but my recommedation to tourists would be to stay around the Ortakay or Machka areas - the swissotel or the ciragan kempinkski if you dont mind paying a bit extra.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were put in this hotel for a conference and it was a couple of notches up from the Hilton where I stayed earlier in the week. It's closer to Taksim and the lobby is a bit fancier. There is a very nice bakery in the lobby and a delicious but expensive restaurant on the roof--Safran. It has a gorgeous view but a kebab dinner there was double the price of a meal at my fave kebab place (Tike) and the portions were smaller. As far as surly staff, there was one woman at reception who was fairly surly but everyone else was fantastic. I have spent quite a lot of time in Turkey and find the people there are very warm and helpful but, of course, it helps to get things off on the right foot by smiling and saying good morning before asking for help. I've stayed in an number of hotels in Istanbul and there are many with far more personality and elegance than the Intercontinental and Hilton. Some like the gorgeous Ciragan Palas (Kempinski) are also three times the price but some are not.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Extremely satisfied with this hotel. While somewhat pricey, the service and experience was very well done. While maybe not the real hamam experience, this was a very well managed and staffed spa and relax area. I have even visited here after company put me in another hotel where I was not happy. Very nice facility. The top floor lounge had great views, atmosphere and great presentation with service of drinks. The breakfast was very well maintained with good signs identifying all the items. Varried daily the three nights stayed there. They had anything you wanted to order along with a huge varried buffet. The hotel had a very cosmopolitan atmosphere and the staff were excellent. While not really happy with the restaurant recomendation, the concierge station was always staffed with 2 excellent concierges. Very efficient check-in and check-out. Handled complicated departure well with partial to business, spliting charges and payment in two currencies. Obviously well-trained experienced international staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We decided to stay in Intercontinental because of the location near Taksim and because of the possibility to stay near Bosphorus. Hotel is in good condition, room nice and clean with nice view to the sea. Breakfast buffet with all you need, warm and cold but I think a little bit expensive. But nearby are nice coffee shops to have breakfast or the best idea is to go by taxi 5 minutes to the seaside and have breakfast in Hotel â€œthe houseâ€�. Very nice location directly at the water with all you need! Pool is very nice for relaxing after a day of walking and donÂ´t forget to have a drink in the roof bar. We ask at the reception for restaurant recommendations, we had nice dinners in Topaz and Borsa near convention center. Both restaurants were very good, expensive but not typical Turkish restaurants. 360 were also recommended but it was fully booked that days. At least we had really good meal at Hamdi restaurant near bazaar. Istanbul is a very nice town, clean and Turkish people were friendly and helpful!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked 2 rooms on the spring promotion which included upgrades, discounts on food and services and breakfast. One room was upgraded to a suite as per the promotion. We requested connecting rooms, but the hotel was too busy and they had none available. Breakfast was good and included some local foods as well as international. My daughter tried the Turkish bath in the spa which is free to all guests and went during ladies only hours 12 -2 pm weekdays. She also had a body scrub and swedish massage which she really liked. We used room service every night for dinner and my daughter loved their lentil soup. They were always efficient and fast. After coming in from the cold the lobby was inviting and we drank hot chocolate and tea. The location was great, a short walk from Istiklal street with cafes and shops and beware the area is very busy> Location was not an issue for us because we had a private driver. Can't imagine staying anywhere else. The price for this hotel is great as compared with the other 5 star hotels at 1000 Eurose/room. We paid 245 Euros/room and really enjoyed out stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">stayed here for business for 5 nights. great location. good internet and business center who gave me a power converter since I left mine at home. got upgraded to a suite so no complaints on the room at all. Real bonus was the club lounge access but the bigggest benefit wasnt the free breakfast or beers but the people who worked inside the club. welcomed me by my name the second day. they all were super attentive and friendly especially Idan (spelling?). They had at least 3-5 staff members in the club at all times which was mostly empty. I suggest buying club level if you stay at this hotel not only for the free food and booze but the great service. Only thing I think they can improve on is to communicate that they will open the gym if you request. I read from another poster that it was closed and was upset. Then read from a different one that all you have to do is ask. I asked at 5:30am and they promptly opened it for me. Overall great stay and if I return will book here again. This is probably the best Intercontinental I've stayed in and thats coming from a past was royal platinum ambassador.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Intercontinental Ceylan for 4 nights and I must admit that the location of the hotel is excellent. The hotel is located on Taksim square (5â€™min walking) which is the centre of everything: restaurants, bars, shops etc. Further it is close to the metro station (5â€™min walking), nostalgic tram (10â€™min walking) and Kabatas tram station (10-15â€™min walking) which is the tram youâ€™ll use the most in Istanbul. Trams run every 10-15â€™min and can take you to all important sites. I draw your attention to taxis. You should always keep an eye to the meter. We stayed in a Bosporus view roomâ€¦the view was amazingâ€¦.i really recommend it. The breakfast was very good and the staff very polite and helpful. You should try the Turkish bath experience in the hotel spaâ€¦.But have a look at the rates if you want any other treatment (massage, etc). I think that the rates are too high!!! I didnâ€™t have the opportunity to try the food and beverages at the hotel restaurantsâ€¦but I tried the room service and I have to say that the service was good, the food and rates ok but not anything particular.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was just lacking something for me. The reception/lobby was nicely decorated but lacked atmosphere and there didnt seem many travellers a round. The rooms were a good size but were just a little worn. The bathroom was small and again the fittings were well used i.e. the towel ring kept falling off when you touched the towels, if you had a bath you had to keep your heel pressed on the tape or the water ran out. The towels were also thin and well used as were the robes. The duvet had the stragest lumps inside it and if you lay on top of the bed it was uncomfortable (almost as if there was socks left in from the wash!). That being said it was all extremely clean with helpful staff. There was a spectacular 18th floor and restaurant which again was empty but the food in the Sefton Resturant was the best we had in the 6 days of being in Istanbul well worth a visit - the taster menu was fab but expensive but worth it. The best thing about this hotel was the location, just at the top of the main shopping street which leads down to the Galata Tower, Galata Bridge and then you can walk to the Grand Bazaar. The outside pool was also very nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'm surprised at the lukewarm reviews. My husband and I booked a deluxe room with a water view for two nights at the end of a cruise. The room was large, clean and very comfortable. The view during the day and night was absolutely spectacular! We were very happy with our choice to stay near Taksim Square vs staying in the more touristy areas like at the Four Seasons. Each night we walked over to the square and then into the streets with the locals and selected one of the restaurants on the side streets. The pedestrian only streets were full of people strolling, lots of activity and a trolley going down the middle. There were so many restaurants it was hard to choose. In the morning, we just walked back to the square and over to one of the red carts for a 25 cent roll that was something like a bagel. My husband grabbed coffee at a local place and that was our breakfast. We prefer to eat local fare when traveling, but also the price of breakfast at the hotel was exhorbitant. Telephone calls were also very expensive for local calls - we didn't even try long distance. We had a great stay and thought that this hotel was perfect. I would recommend it highly.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed he for 4 nights over 2 stays late June/early July 2008. I have to say the hotel is superb, this would have been a 5 rating, but, as said in earlier reviews the price of drinks here is outragous. A few examples of this (approx 2YTL=Â£1): Glass of soda by the pool 10YTL, small beer in the city view bar 15YTL, local water from mini bar (0.5YTL outside of hotel) was 11YTL. One of the visits was breakfast included the other wasn't - again really expensive but if you take a left and 1st left at the lights there are plenty of eating places 200m away. Anyway enough about the add-ons, the service here is great and the views from the higher floors through the floor to ceiling windows are unbelievable. Good selection of English TV channels. There are many staff on hand look after all requirements. The pool area is well maintained and No. 1 son said the health centre ang gym were great too. The hotel is around a 5 min walk from the start of the public transport, you can be in the old town in about 20 mins by using the funicular at Taksim Square and then the tram, costs 2.8YTL and probably quicker than driving (chaotic!) Overall a great experience and would highly recommend to anyone, just watch the extras!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I read somewhere that the Istanbul Intercon won their company award for the best hotel in the Group. After this stay I can believe it. I used to stay here but it was very bad - now its really top class and probably the best in Istanbul and I know - Ive stayed in most of the big chain hotels there. Its not cheap but then none of the big hotels in Istanbul are. The Club Floor is worth the extra for the facilities to hand that you would normally pay extra for - internet access, Club Lounge etc I stayed on the Club floor and the room was excellent - I have absolutely no adverse comments. Staff were friendly and the food beverage outlets were well managed, full of choice and clean/tidy. A real change from 10 years ago. My only complaint - two in fact. Do not use their limo service from the Airport - its Euro 177 for a 20 minute drive - get a taxi at Euro25 instead - that Euro 177 is extortion but seemingly people pay it or they wouldn't be charging it ! The other complaint - somebody decided to paint something one evening and the Air Conditioning spread the smell of gloss paint throughout the hotel - nasty but only temporary and it was not so bad in the room itself. A really top notch hotel and my choice for all my future stays.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for two nights. Am an Intercontinental Gold Ambassador member. First they had two bookings for me and were insisting this wasnâ€™t a mistake, after my travelling colleague from work had the same issues they then realised this was a glitch on their internet website. This whole process took them 20 minutes and about 3 staff, all in Turkish whilst i am was kept standing at the check in. Then once that was sorted they couldnâ€™t find my Intercontinental Ambassador details, again another 15 minutes, until i suggested they call Intercontinental, once they did they found my number. SO after about 35 minutes standing at reception I finally to a so called upgrade room. The room was awful, old musty and clearly hadnâ€™t been cleaned, it had greasy hand marks over the windows and the bathroom was disgusting. I complained and said i wanted to move hotels, they then put me in a suite, which whilst it was larger was still same old furnish and tired deco. At this point the front office manager finally was called and then couldnâ€™t do enough, but by this time the damage was done. Only good thing about this hotel is the door staff, friendly and helpful. Donâ€™t stay here until they renovate and retrain staff, much better in Istanbul.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Its nice to enter a large well appointed lobby, check in at a well staffed desk with no wait, be conducted to a large well appointed room and get your luggage directly, have a good view, and not have to demand a better room. Istanbul can be a difficult place for non Turkish speakers, but we found the Concierge staff to be so helpful and kind, giving us detailed instructions that made getting around pretty easy, by underground and tram. This was necessary, as Taxi travel can be a disaster owing to the traffic in this town. One evening leaving for dinner at 7PM for a restaurant on the Bosporus, after 1 hour and 15 minutes, the non-English speaking taxi driver let us off at a different restaurant as he gave up trying to get to the original address. Unfortunately, his tolerance for "traffic" made him take "short cuts" which only got us into more traffic congestion. Had he stayed on the normal route we would have gotten where we we supposed to, albeit 15 minutes late. When we reported our adventure to the Concierge department, they were very upset and took it upon themselves to take us to the airport on checkout gratis with the hotel car (a new Mercedes). This is a delightful reasonably priced low 5 star property which we unhesitatingly recommend.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a decent hotel to stay at during my 6 nights in Istanbul. The location is great- it was easy to get most sightseeing places like where the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia are, as well as the Asian part of the city and the Bosphorus.. not to mention Taksim Square is only a 2 min walk away! I found the hotel restaurants to be over priced and not that great, but at least there are lots of other food options near by! The room was kept very clean, which I really appreciated, but overall I wish the room was bigger (especially the bathroom). I have been traveling the middle east and eastern Europe for about a month and this was by far the smallest room I stayed in. I was also a little disappointed by all the extra costs that were thrown in... wireless internet was expensive and had to be purchased for each laptop in our room (this was frustrating to me as it was important for both me and my traveling partner to be able to work remotely on a regular basis), as well as other charges such as having to purchase adaptors (this was the only hotel we stayed at in over a month that required this)... Overall, although I felt service could have been a little better, the hotel is still luxury and is in a great location. I would probably try the Ritz Carlton across the St if I came back to Istanbul, though...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Istanbul Intercontinental is in all aspects a fantastic hotel. Its location is perfect, its facilities top class and its staff way above average. I was rather surprised to see its average rating on here, but I think I know why that is. Intercontinental attracts a special group of customers, they mostly only stay at intercontinental and I think they may have lost their objectivity when judging hotels. I can imagine if you only stay at intercontinental hotels you loose your sense of realism. Intercontinental hotels offer this strange similarity in service and facilities wherever you are. I find it rather amazing how this hotel in Istanbul knows to reach its chain standards and I consider this hotel therefor way above the rest of the 5 star properties in Istanbul. My room on the 8th floor was avergae size but fantastic in facilities and ameneties. Fantastic beds, clean, quiet and great view. I was especially impressed by the healthclub. You can easily spend a full day here. The gym, is full size and its cardio equipment is plentiful and of fairly recent purchase date. Weigth equipment looked a little older but was in great shape. Free fruit is a great added service here. Since it was winter, the pool was closed, but it looked fabulous, I am sure you will enjoy this in summer. This hotel offers great rates through its website and I will certainly return.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent five nights in an Executive (i.e. junior) Suite on the 12th floor while attending a conference in early September. Check-in was fast and efficient, and every aspect of the service to the rooms (room attendants and room service) and in the restaurants was uniformly friendly and efficient throughout my stay. The welcome fruit bowl was replenished daily, something that some much more expensive hotels in Europe fail to do. The room was possibly the largest junior suite I have seen anywhere in the world. The living area had a large sofa and an armchair arranged around a coffee table, a round dining table with four chairs, and a good size desk with convenient power outlets. There was also an electric kettle and the wherewithal to make tea and coffee. The bedroom area had a true kingsize bed and two sets of built-in closets; also an armchair and ottoman placed by one of the two enormous windows which provided a floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall view of the Bosphorus. The big bathroom had double sinks, a large bathtub and a separate shower. All the furnishings were very comfortable and in excellent condition. The dual zone air conditioning was silent and effective, and the room was quiet - I heard no traffic noise. The included breakfast buffet was extensive, and the waiter-provided coffee service was fast and friendly. Check-out was fast and accurate, no surprises.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at intercon for 4 nights using our ambassador weeekend night certificate and ambassador points. But in no way we had any compromise in service. We were upgraded to a suite and given club access since we were celebrating our little girls 2nd birthday. The staff were very friendly and helpful at every level. The suite was just beautiful although dated but tasteful nonetheless! Ask for a higher floor because the views are just superb whether you choose sea view or city view. We did not eat in the hotel but the restaurants recommended by the concierge were amazing, namely 'kosebasi' near the hotel and 'matbah' near the hagiya Sofia museum. The breakfast in the club lounge was limited but good. I recommend speaking to the concierge before you set off for the day, they are very helpful. Cabs cost around 18-25 tl depending on the traffic and it can be quite frustrating if u get stuck in the mad traffic. So I recommend taking the excellent trams to the city. The funicular station at taksim is only abt 5mins walk and will take you down to kabatas which is the nearest tram station. From kabatas the tram goes straight into sultanahmet. Each train journey cost 2tl per person so to get from hotel to sultanahmet will cost 4th per person. Cheap and cheerful! All in all it was a fantastic stau and highly recommend it. We will def stay there if we visit again! Happy holidays. :)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Writing this review from my room on the 17th floor with magnificent views. A perfectly placed hotel with easy access to just about everywhere in the city. Staff offer exceptional service without being over the top and they all seem genuinley pleased to be working here. The bars offer many choices and for stunning views alone just aim for the roof (Floor N), OK so you pay a premium for drinks up there but what do you expect? As for eating, I have a perfectly adequate breakfast in the Club Lounge and a few drinks in the evening all inclusive on my tariff. From the hotel you need walk less than 50mtrs to find more than enough choices of restaurants, so if the hotel seems a little pricey there are some excelent options. As for getting about, the metro is easy, cheap and on the doorstep, bus tours 100mtrs up the road in the main square and masses of shops (branded) and small bazzars again only a few meters away. I was apprehensive with reading all the stories of taxi drivers and hassle from shop vendors and can say that I had absolutely no problems,this appeared a very safe and comfortable city to walk around at all times and exeptionaly litter free. So, the Intercontinental, well it is a comfortable top rate hotel, I consider Intercontinental to be a statement for quality in standards and service and in my opinion you get what you pay for and in my case as the title says I can't find anything bad to say about my stay either in this hotel or the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Going back to the same hotel after two months is an indication of how good this place is. The staff at the front door are polite and helpful, the reception staff are both check in and out are quick polite and efficient, what more do you need. The hotel itself is lovely.. lots of seating to relax around the lobby, a bar should you want to watch the football and a really good outdoor grill restaurant. Rooms are spacious and very well equipped with a safe, iron, tea\coffee making facilities, comfy sofa, deck to work on and plenty of complimentary bottles of water. And whilst the internet connection is not free at 25Euros for 3 days it is reasonably priced. On the down side the cost of items in the mini bar really are outrageous. 7 Euros for a bar of chocolate !! The patisserie had a great selection of items in the lobby, the outdoor grill restaurant is also excellent and if you want a view across the city then the rooftop restaurant is highly recommended. A word of warning about the roof top restaurant though.. for some reason the staff feel it necessary to hover around your table constantly which are the first five minutes gets a little annoying and once you've finished a course your empty place is whisked around within milliseconds. On a final note when I stay here in September I arrived in my room and had a selection of fruit left in the room this time around absolutely nothing at all.. Some consistency would be good or maybe I was just lucky last time. :o)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A good big hotel you don't go wrong with. In a big, popular old city i wanted to be on the safe side with the choice. it doesn't disappoint. again to be on the safe side I asked for their van to pick us up from the airport, the cost is very high, but the reason was to avoid the Istanbul taxi surprises which I experienced on my last trip. Now to the slightly negative experience, when we reached we didn't get the connecting rooms, the hotel was busy and then we were put on the smoking floor without being informed. finally the assistant general manager got involved ang got us acceptable rooms on the seventh floor.What I don't like is the shrug of the shoulders by the reception people with the regular dry reply " sorry". The taxis you get from the hotel are extraordinary.They are the same yellow cabs,but they have the hotel's name and the drivers are really good and honest. The conceirge arranged our ferry boat tickets to Bursa, and we were not sent to lousy restaurants because they had an arragement with the hotel.We went through such an experience when my brother was directed to a bad restaurant in a dangerous area.But he was staying at the Crowne plaza. The taxi driver took us to some of the best places in Istanbul for breakfast and sightseeing. Taksim aeea is very crowded, we didn't like the area.I would try to avoid next time.But I find many reviewers who like it.I believe the stretch from the Four seasons hotel to the Kempinsky and down is more enjoyable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The service in the Hotel is excellent, but i am really expecting more from an intercontinental hotel and for the price we paid (among the highest in the city). One disappointing event was when i asked guests service for an adapter for the laptop charger socket because my laptop comes electricity cord plug which is three pins and the outets in the hotel are 2 pins. They said that we had to buy it and one is available in the room. it is only 16 Euros they said! I am a frequent traveler and this is the first time that i need to buy an adapter. Another issue was the lack of English Newspaper in the lobby. It did not escape the management mind that certain people might like to read morning news, and Turkish newspapers are abundant, but not English one. I thought that it should also occur to them that normally foreigners mostly need to stay in hotels and as such, English newspapers could be an a viable option. The lobby is not impressive, and does not have any scenery, whereas neighboring hotel with same rating overlook the phosphorus. There is good quality breakfast, but food assortment is limited. We paid extra $$$ to have phosphorus view, what we got was partial view. you have to stick you head in the window at an angle to see.Finally the rooms are a bit small as is the bathroom. The SPA on the other hand is amazing. I tried the Ritz carlton hotel a couple of year back, it is within walking distance, it is cheaper and in my view a better choice especially the reception and rooms .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you don't want headaches in Istanbul, go to Ceylan. We've tried a number of Istanbul hotels during the years but whenever we want a stay without surprises, we return to Ceylan. The hotel is in Taksim and after a 5 min walk you find yourself in the shopping area of Istaklal. The hotel offers everything you need, but it is not an authentic piece of Istanbul. If you're looking for some old style Ottoman experience, perhaps you should stay in Sultanahmet. There are plenty of small family hotels in that historic area , charming and clean, close to the main tourist attractions, but you'll never get the standards that Ceylan offers although you are probably paying the same amount or more. And if you choose to stay in this area, you'll probably go to Sultanahmet to visit by Metro, tram or taxi. The Metro station is 3 min away. CAREFUL WITH TEH TAXIS!!! The taxis you take from the hotel are safe and the staff will make sure you have the nr of the taxi on a piece of paper in case of any problems. The taxis you pick on the street to get you back are another story. Many are rude, drive terribly and will take you on the longest route possible. We had some really bad experiences and found that it helps to write the taxi number yourself on a piece of paper and make it obvious to the driver that you did so. Feel free to call the hotel concierge and they'll tell you what the average fare is for the trip you took. They also report to the police any taxi number that you bring to their attention.</p></li>

I also ate at the Garden Grille several times during my stay. The restaurant topside was closed for remodeling. I did have the opportunity to enjoy the view and drinks at the bar. First of all I must mention the staff. I think every one of them must go to a charm school before they are hired. The hostess at the breakfast buffet is professional, courteous, and friendly. Need I mention that she has a regal walk. I had a slight problem one of the first days, but the staff are problem solvers. The doormen who hail the taxis provide you with a slip of paper on which the license of the taxi is written on one side and the other a list of estimated fares for many of the more common attractions. The room was comfortable, the bed provided a great sleep, and I had a great view of the Bosphorus that was easy on the eyes. I never tired of it. The concierge was extremely helpful in arranging a couple of day trips: one to Efes and another to Princess Islands. As a woman traveling alone I was comforted by the fact the tour companies were ones which the hotel frequently did business. As a woman traveling alone I found this hotel extremely comfortable! On my birthday a floral arrangement appeared in my room. Also at dinner the staff of the Grille brought me a birthday cheesecake with sparklers and sang "happy birthday" to me. What a great memory. In recent years I have traveled a great deal and I would say this is the BEST hotel I have ever stayed in.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I came here for a blend of conference and relaxation. We really enjoyed this hotel. I'm trying to think of anything that we did not like about the hotel. The bed was comfortable and the linens were in very nice condition, plus very comfortable, plush bathrobes and slippers provided. I can hardly recall hearing any other guests through the walls of the room. The staff was friendly and professional. In particular, even after just 2 days some of the front desk and restaurant staff remembered us by name. The staff are attentive, including turn-down service each evening and complimentary bottled water as much as is needed (you are discouraged from drinking tap water anywhere in Istanbul). We had the hotel's wireless internet, and it was reasonably fast--much better than at many hotels where it's painful to wait for pages to load! Our stay also included the breakfast buffet each day, and it was really a complete breakfast that included hot and cold foods of both Western and Asian style, plus a made-to-order omelet station. After the close of the conference, we were enjoying staying in the hotel so much that we extended our stay rather than find lodging cheaper or closer to the historic center. We were able to get a good rate by talking with the reservations desk, rather than paying the publicized rate. The location is convenient to Taksim Square and Istiklal Street. It isn't close to the historic city center, but the area seems more modern and vibrant, which certainly makes up for it. Next time I come to Istanbul I will definitely consider this hotel first.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Grand or pretentious?”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Following a cruise of Greek islands we spent the final night of our holiday in a grand/pretentious hotel. Which word to use would be a very personal conclusion. Situated close to many other major hotels it is also near the Bosphorus and the busy Taskim Square. It would require taxi journeys to the Blue Mosque and the Topkapi Palace. Entering the hotel one is stunned by the apparent grandeur with a swirling staircase. Spacious lobby, marble and plush furniture extend into a "Palm Court" and a highly polished English Bar (didn't see anyone use it). Reception was always busy, usually three or four members of staff eager to respond to need. Checking in at 10 a.m. I was surprised and pleased to know the room was available immediately. A pleasant, reasonably spacious room with a good bathroom. As someone who suffers from vertigo I was a little stunned when I saw the floor to ceiling, wall wide window at the end of the room (8th floor). One must say it was a splendid view, but I had to hold on to something whenever I went close. We dined out. The hotel has at least two restaurants, but they are pricey. In fact such prices annoy me. We found a very modest restaurant within two hundred metres used by locals and tourist and had a reasonably priced and satisfying meal. At breakfast in the hotel the English are not forgotten - scrambled eggs and bacon are available - but Turkish fare dominated. I certainly enjoyed a mixture though the egg was cold. Service was good and the restaurant comfortable. It is not a hotel I would have personally chosen, but as part of the cruise package it was most acceptable, though a little grand/pretentious!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Very swanky--especially the common areas and hammam”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Among the 12 hotels of our Middle East trip, this was the swankiest, although perhaps not my favorite (that privilege belonged to the Izmir Hilton). Both the common areas and the rooms are beautiful. My Platinum Ambassador status was rewarded with a Bosphorus view room--although since it was on the 4th floor, I would say just barely (but the view was fine). Some InterContinentals don't provide their Ambassadors with free internet and, indeed, this one threatened to charge me 30 Euros/d, so I only used it for one day. Fortunately, I was not charged on check-out, however. Although the price for the internet is rather outrageous, the service did work reliably and quickly. (No free internet in the lobby, either!). The hammam in particular is very nice--definitely the nicest I saw in Turkey. They have some separate times for men and women, but most of the time both may use it. The pool was closed at the end of April. The bar on the top floor has unbelievable views--and prices to boot. It really reminded me of the bar at the Hong Kong InterContinental on Salisbury Road at the tip of Kowloon: drinks with ruinous prices, but incredible vistas I will remember forever (unless I get Alzheimer's). My only quibble was with the concierges. One problem was that they recommended a restaurant I found horrible: Haci Abdullah. But when I looked it up after the fact here, it looks like it may have merely recently gone downhill. The other was that a concierge was socializing when customers were waiting. I empathize that it's often difficult to end a conversation when others are waiting, but this is a skill I feel a good concierge needs. That being said, I was quite pleased with my stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When you enter the hotel you have to pass through a metal detector and then you enter in a large lobby which has a luxurious colonial/ottoman feeling to it. The rooms are a descent size, have a minibar and coffee making facilities. In the bathroom I even had a scale! From your room you also have a nice view at the city but the traffic noise you can still hear a bit (even though I was at the 7th floor). If you really want to enjoy the view you have to go to the top floor where there is a bar and restaurant. The breakfast buffet has a good variety of hot and cold dishes with also a variety of Turkish items. If you want you can sit and relax in comfortable sofas in the bar nex to the lobby and have a very expensive drink (8 euro for a soft drink). The meeting room are well equipped although you constantly hear the airco which is rather annoying and the chairs are not very comfortbale to sit on all day. Five star service: staff welcomes you when you enter; helpfull to carry your bags; when you return in the evening the curtains will be closed, bathrobe and slippers being placed on your bed and a card with the next day temperature will be available; when you order a coffee in the bar you will receive some cookies with it; restaurant personnel is very friendly and helpfull. Reasons for not being a five star service: front desk personnel could be more friendly (like the restaurant personnel); drinks in the bar (and also the minbar in the room) starts at 8 euros for only a soft drink which is too expensive; the food at the buffet is a bit to much Turkish influence; to much background airco noise in the meeting room. For having meetings the hotel is a very good value for money but if you come to Istanbul for sightseeing I would't stay here since it's to far from the old city where all the attractions are.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “typical 5 star hotel of a big city but a lot of impersonal hospitality”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay was fairly comfortable ae the Hotel offers typical amenities & services expected from a 5 star hotel. The room view was very nice, overlooking Bosporus!! The SRA & Turkish Hamam services were excellent but overpriced. The staff is friendly showing willingness, but as an overall estimation we found a lot of impersonal hospitality. The door-cards were dectivated every second time you used them (mine & my friend's as well) & you had to go down to the reception without making the mistake of not having your passport with you, in order to be able to enter your room. I had the unfortunate & unexpected need of sanitary napkins the 3rd afternoon of our stay at 5:00 in the afternoon. I called from my room the maids department & room service, I talked with 3 employees, but they could not understand what I was asking for. Finally I contacted the Conscierge, who informed me that there were no sanitary napkins in the Hotel.He also told that he was going to send a taxi to get a precious packet.. Actually after 15 mnutes, a hotel-boy delivered the packet to our room, asking me to pay 30 TL (turkish lira) the relevant of 15 euros!!! for the taxi!!! Seems that the taxi driver crossed half of the city!!! I find this incident very humlilating for women, showing that turkish menatlity cannot get rid of overpricing goods & services. Our stay was during Greek Orthodox Easter, as a lot of Greek people visit Istanbul theese days.Usually big hotels in every part of the world, show respect to such special events, offering special dishes, decorations etcThe most typical tradition of our Easter is to dye red egg in memory of Christ's Resurection.The Ceylan,which was full of Greeks at that time, served dyed blue, yellow & green eggs in breakfast.We asked for RED eggs stressing the fact that since they showed willingness to respect our tradition (not religion) they should do ti properly.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “No complaints, just prefer Sultanahmet area.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked the Intercontinental because I had a free night certificate, and am a Platinum Ambassador. On our previous visit, we stayed at The Four Seasons Sultanahmet. While MUCH pricier, I preferred the Four Seasons because of its close proximity to the tourist sites. There is nothing like walking out the door and being in the middle of the historic area! It was possible to walk to the waterfront from this hotel, just not an easy walk. While it was in a nice section of Taksim, next to a beautiful park and European streets with shopping and cafe, I just much preferred Sultanahmet. We arrived via private transport, booked with Backpacker's Travel. I am terrified of the Istanbul taxi drivers, with reason. 99% are crooks. This was a pre-Black Sea Cruise stay, and we only took a taxi once, from the hotel to the cruise terminal. I was relieved to find that the Intercontinental has a group of taxi's that are registered with them, and honest. This alone is worth staying there! We were upgraded to a Bosphorus view room on a high floor, and for some reason they threw in free breakfast, and free Club Floor access. Great except the Club Floor was closed for renovations, so the free goodies were located in the bar on the ground floor. The food array was very disappointing. There was a tray of carrot sticks, olives, and celery, and a chafing dish of dried out fried fish nuggets and cheese rolls! That's all! Breakfast did have a comprehensive array of dishes, nicely presented. The room was comfortable with a beautiful view of the Bosphorus. The electricity was unreliable, and their generator backup had to be used about 5 times during our stay. Lobby was very pretty, and no complaints about service. In summary, this was an upper level international hotel in the modern section of Istanbul. While I have no complaints about the hotel, and was treated to nice perks, I would have preferred staying in Sultanahmet.</p></li>
