<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved this place. I was in town for a convention and it is an easy walk to Moscone. It is also convenient to buses and the cable cars. The breakfast was awesome every day we were there: fresh fruit, oatmeal, banana bread or muffins from scratch, and an egg dish. And we loved the happy hour in the PM with wine and snacks. Would definitely stay here the next time in SF.</p></li>

The location is perfect for catching the cable car and walking to Union Square and many restaurants. The staff was very accommodating with reservations and the food (breakfast and afternoon wine and appetizers.) was superb. We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in San Francisco.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had booked to stay here for a week in San Francisco and were very happy. When we were stranded because of the volcano the hotel could not have been more helpful. They extended our booking until we were able to get a flight home. The fact that breakfast is included saved us a fortune and the evening wine was a really nice touch which allowed us to meet and socialise with other guests.</p></li>

The free breakfast (including egg dishes) was quite good as was the free afternoon wine and cheese offering. It was also nice to have a fridge in the room. Their location is close to public transportation to all of SF. I have stayed at many 5 star properties, but for the money, I think this was a steal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We enjoyed our stay at the White Swan Inn. We were greeted on the first night with a very pleasing cheese and wine party. For the three nights we stayed, the wine was fabulous -- though the cheese was a bit more variable! We resorted to visiting the nearby Hidden Vine for some cheese and wine to help keep up our cheese quota. In any event, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this to other travellers that are looking for a friendly and convenient location to visit San Francisco from.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently spent several days at this wonderful hotel/B&B. The staff made a big effort to accommodate my family's requests about finding off the beaten path things to do. We felt comfortable and safe. The breakfast buffet and evening appetizers were tasty and plentiful. The location is great as well. It is a short stroll to Chinatown and Union Square. The rest of San Francisco could easily be reached by convenient, efficient, public transportation. It is a good value with a good location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice place to stay in the city. Minutes from Union Square. Rooms are comfortable and clean. The dining area is a cozy and relaxing place to enjoy a cup of tea. My only disappointment with this inn is the breakfast. Labelled as "gourmet", but did not achieve such status. The kitchen staff is friendly, but food is restocked slowly. Scrambled eggs, sausage and quiche along with muffins and some pastries. Yoghurt upon request. The food was ok but not inspiring. The room was clean and spacious. Front desk people are very cordial.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for the second consecutive year and things were above my expectations. New TVs were an upgrade from last year. The walk to Union Square for my work meeting was short. The breakfasts are a great start to the day. The work-out room is small, but the weather is nice enough in SF that you can run outside anyway. I'm not sure what the WiFi situation is, but I needed to do more reading for work than any computer work. All in all, a nice change from the chain hotels, a great price, a great breakfast and a great location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Unlike my friend, I prefer more modern properties. However, I was delightfully surprised at the charm of this property, cleanliness and friendliness of staff. We loved the old Otis elevator that brought us to our floor and the English Country charm. Staff was helpful when we needed directions. Also, the breakfast that changes daily and the afternoon "Happy Hour" saved us in food purchases. The location was not far from transportation. We learned to take the cable car up the last steep hill. We'd definitely stay here on a future visit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife joined me for a trip to a convention. She explored the area while I attended the meeting. We both loved the gourmet breakfast, and the afternoon wine and snacks. The chef was creative and provided lots of healthy, delicious choices. These events attract nearly all of the guests, many of whom were from out of the country while we were there. It was delightful! We made lots of new friends, and got tips about local "must see" restaurants and highlights. The staff was also extremely helpful. The rooms are charming, and the fireplaces a nice touch.</p></li>

From the friendly staff , to the excellent location, to the lower level breakfast \ wine and cheese room . All made one feel a part of the Inn. Meeting similar like minded people that traded places to dine to sites to visit made the stay wonderful. One can walk out the door and catch the cable car, or go to the theatre within a stones throw of the Inn. Rooms are quaint and roomy and offer great value for the money. One has to be prepared to stoke it up hills and stairs but it is San Fransisco!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the White Swan Inn as part 1 of our honeymoon in California. We couldn't have asked for a better start! After a $36 cab ride from SFO we checked in to our wonderfully furnished room (basic, but lots of space and decor that had real character). It was the perfect base to explore San Francisco. Just minutes from Union Square, or a lovely 30 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf/Pier 39/etc ... Breakfast was fantastic, as was the service from the friendly guys at the lobby desk. Would definitely stay again at this perfect mid-priced hotel. Thanks!</p></li>

We loved the beds and linen! They offer a full and delicious breakfast, an evening happy hour with yummy hordeurves and wine not to mention friendly setting to share experiences with fellow travelers. The location is perfect, just a quick walk up hill to enjoy the quieter neighborhood setting. Such old world elegance... We cannot wait to return!</p></li>

I can't say enough about the hotel. Our room was terrific (very large) and the hotel has a wonderful atmosphere with fireplaces everywhere. Breakfast was great (and lots of food) which kept us going until evening. The wine hour was a nice touch (not fabulous, but so what). The staff were incredibly helpful and the location can't be beat. We bought a 3-day MUNI pass and were able to go all over the City very easily. I'll stay there again.</p></li>

VERY good value for the price. Complimentary happy hour was very quaint and cozy. Breakfast was not 5 star but certainly sufficient. We actually had some plumbing issues and had to retrieve a plunger from the front desk a couple of times and that would NOT deter us from booking again! It was a very old building and that added to the ambiance, but certain issues do come up. Absolutely LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it! In spite of minor problems, I DO recommend!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed in SF a number of times and each time at different hotels ( Holiday Inn, Hyatt Regency and others) so this year in Sept '04 picked the White Swan following reviews in Tripadvisor. It totally lived up to our expectations: very friendly and helpful staff, lovely public areas with very interesting and at times very amusing pieces of art (pottery, pictures, ornaments etc) and terrific bedrooms: very large, very well furnished, gas fire, personal library, fridge/mini kitchen area. Good breakfast and nice touch with the cheese and wine at "tea-time". Great place! Terry - Coventry, England</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I plus another couple wrapped up a two week vacation in California with a three night stay at the White Swan Inn. There simply are not adequate superlatives to describe the charm and comfort this lovely hotel exudes. We were breathless when we stepped into our room ... all the comforts one would expect from a nice hotel but to also have a fireplace in your room is way over the top. We would not hesitate one moment to stay there again. If you're traveling to San Francisco (whether business or leisure), be sure to include The White Swan Inn in your travel plans.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed in this hotel during out trip about California in May 2009. The room was quite big and comfortable with a gas fireplace. As San Francisco is the city where you can do a lot of walking, we found this place very well and centrally located. Breakfast was good and tasty but took us some time: during “rush morning hours” we had to wait for the employees to re-fill the plates at the buffet. But this waiting was quite pleasant as we’ve been on vacation and not in a hurry anyway. We loved the service – the receptionists were all very helpful and supportive. All in all I recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I and our two teenage children spent two nights at The White Swan on a vactation to the Bay area in May, 2009. We loved the quaint European-style suite we had with fireplaces in each room and period decor. The rates were very reasonable, and the complementary breakfast and wine reception were great. My kids loved it. Both before and after our arrival, the staff could not have been more helpful to us with restaurant reservations and general tourist advice. The hotel is perfectly situated near Union Square, China Town and the Cable Car line. I will not look any further than the White Swan the next time in I'm in San Fran.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We've been there for 5 nights in November. The hotel is ideally located a few steps from Union Square, it's not so big but beautifully renewed in an old English style. Breakfast is "cooked" and served in a room downstairs, where you can find tea, chocolate, fruits and cakes in the afternoon too. The room we had was big enough, with a "high" and very soft bed and a little but comfortable sitting space. Everything was very clean in despite of the fact that the floor was carpeted. The staff is friendly and helps you with advices on what to do and how to do things. In conclusion, White Swan Inn is a place where we'll be back in our future trips to S.Francisco.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed there during a meeting at a "convention hotel". Everyone welcomes you like family. Breakfast is a delight, and, if you like old English lots of floral decor, it's a fun place as well. There is a wine, cheese, appetizer and sweets reception daily, and cookies and coffee out all the time. Our room was old but fine for five days and included a fireplace. When our heat didn't work, they provided an electric heater. Elevator is a challenge for the faint-hearted but an adventure for everyone else. We would stay there again happily and feel at home (maybe even better). Note for the five star crowd but we loved it as did friends who stayed there as well.</p></li>

We each thought we had the best room. The breakfasts (four of them) were fantastic, the cookies and coffee anytime were wonderful and the wine and hors d'oevres were great. We spent mornings and afternoons walking and taking the cable cars all over the city and then came back late afternoon and played cards, either in the breakfast room or on the back deck. Everything was perfect. The staff was so helpful and nice. Thank you for a perfect trip. We are already planning our next trip to San Francisco so we can stay at the White Swan Hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is reasonably well located near the city centre in San Franciso. The decor is quaint with an English theme and a old-fashioned lift of a type that I have not used for years. The room was clean and well laid out and the bed was very comfortable. The hotel also has free wifi which we used. We did however find that some of the staff were not particularly friendly or helpful. The breakfast was fairly disappointing - with limited hot food and not a huge amount of choice when we stayed there. Whilst the hotel is well located - it is close to an area that you are advised to avoid after dark. Back on the positive side, the hotel does provide complementry cheese and wine each afternoon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a beautiful, quaint hotel, it has a old time elevator with a lot of charm! We enjoy staying here due to the ambiance, there is a downstairs area, that reminds us of a old time gentlemans lounge, complete with a library, fireplaces, and even a old time globe. It is very relaxing to go in there during coctail hour, they have different wines, cheeses, fruit, and a dessert. While we were there it happened to be Easter, and they included colored eggs in the wonderful breakfast that is provided each morning. The rooms are very cozy, with a fireplace in each, beds are very comfortable, and bathrooms are antique. I very much enjoy our stay there when my husband and I go, and look forward to our next trip!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed a wk at this lovely, clean hotel.Bathroom was small. Fridge was stocked with water and soda-gratis Staff was super friendly,especially Andy. He gave us great direction, helped with luggage etc. Bed was super comfortable. We used the fireplace one cool nite, when we returned from dinner. Breakfast was delicious. Choice of fruit,pastry,croissants, eggs,cereal etc. The cook made a great quiche some days. Five PM wine was nice, even thought we didnt make it every day. One day they had awsome sweet/sour meatballs. Other days it was a cheese plate or veggies. Always with either brownies, or a bundt cake. Location was good for walking or taking cable car or buses. would definately stay here if we return to SFO</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My friend and I just got back from San Francisco and we stayed @ the White Swan Inn from Monday through Friday. We had a wonderful stay. The Inn was very homey and comfortable. Nevin (works at the front desk in the evening) was fantastic as was the whole staff. The breakfast each morning was excellent and the wine & cheese hour in the evening was very nice. It gave us a chance to meet other guests and mingle. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. Enjoyed the complimentary bottle of champagne and box of chocolates that were provided in the evening. Would definitely stay again and encourage other to do the same. Thank's to all at the Inn who helped make our vacation very enjoyable. Jill & Joy from Tampa Florida</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I ended our honeymoon here and stayed only 2 nights. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. At check in, we were upgraded to a luxury king room and enjoyed complimentary champagne and chocolates. The room was like a small apartment! It was fantastic! We had a fire place (and since it was chilly in San Fran during our stay - the fire place was great!) Breakfast in the morning was nice. Fresh fruits, eggs, toast, cereals. The evening wine and muchies were great as well. We enjoyed talking with other guests and it really did become a bit of a social hour(s) :) The location is perfect as well. Only a block from the Powell line cable car stop and 2 blocks to Union Square. It was a great end to a great trip! Thanks!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have been staying at the White Swan Inn when I travel to San Francisco for the past twenty years and I have never been disappointed. The hotel is well located within a short walk or cab ride to anywhere in the city. The staff is always courteous, helpful and knowledgable. The facility is kept clean and up to date, and the rooms are well appointed, comfortbale, spacious and quiet. I love getting my day started with the great breakfast served every morning and they also offer a nice snack in the evening. The rooms include water or sodas and internet. All the things other hotels nickel and dime you for are included here. The White Swan Inn can always be counted on for quality, value and a memorable and friendly experience.</p></li>

Great location in San Francisco just a few blocks from Union Square and the F line cable car. The staff were superb and attentive from the moment I arrived. I missed the complimentary social hour but upon check in a hotel employee offered me a glass of wine to have in my room, so I did by the nice fireplace. The rooms are comfortable and cozy I could have relaxed there all evening but wanted to enjoy the city's offerings. I can't say enough of the quality of the staff. Everyone there was friendly, accomodating and willing to go the "extra mile" kudos to the White Swan Inn your a success.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Maybe we should have known this, maybe not. But this property has no air conditioning. Which is probably not a problem on about 300 days of the year. But when the City has a warm spell as it did on our visit, the lack of A/C renders the guest rooms and public rooms uncomfortably warm. The staff seemed stretched thin on our visit. At the afternoon reception, the cheese wasn't put out till halfway through. The white wine was no match for the warmth in the common area. At breakfast the next morning, the quiches were not even remotely warm, much less hot. And since one was not replaced when empty, there was barely enough in the second one for the four of us to get more than a couple of bites anyway. We had long been intrigued by this property. Maybe we just hit it on a bad day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family recently stayed at the White Swan for five nights. We had a deluxe king and a deluxe twin room. Both rooms were spacious, nicely decorated, and very pleasant to come back to at the end of the day. The hotel is not a new building but has every comfort we wanted. The breakfast was terrific. The front desk gave us a list of recommended restaurants at check in, and offered to help with reservations. The hotel is very convenient for touring the city, and we really enjoyed it. In you are looking for a small hotel with a great location, and lots of character, I would recommend the White Swan. My one caution is that it might not be a good place for an elderly person. The elevator is small and you sometimes have to wait a while. We used the stairs most of the time, which was fine for us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The White Swan Inn offers its visitors a true escape into a world of luxury, enchantment and beauty not found too often in the travel industry. Each guest is treated like a king or dignitary. The breakfast is wonderful, the wine hour fantastic and the staff attentive to every detail to make your stay wonderful. The room is cozy and warm and soundproof. The location in Nob Hill is fantastic - only a short walk to the cable line and bus lines - and a few blocks down hill to great shopping in downtown San Francisco. This boutique hotel is every bit as memorable and romantic as those fabled cable cars. We travel more than 2000 miles to get to the White Swan - thus you know we love it. It's been our vacation destiny for the past three years! I dream of our return. Please don't ever change a thing!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location - have to get the cable up (& down) to Fishermans Wharf but that was half the fun! Near the shops. Hotel had some good recommendations for restaurants. Wine and nibbles very nice we made sure we got back early a few days to do that. Room was lovely - very OTT on the decour but again was half the fun! Staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Only areas for improvement would be the breakfast - was billed as full English - no way. Quiche and small sausages do not equal full English. That was a disappointment but on last day did have scrambled eggs. Also the bed - when we arrived there was a lovely arrangement of cushions. For the rest of our stay they were piled in the corner - that let the quality down. But, overall, lovely and would recommend. Street outside noisy but didn't bother us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everyone at the White Swan Inn was helpful and friendly from the moment we walked in until we left. Upon our arrival, we found out we had been upgraded to a King Suite, and the room was great. Lots of room, very comfortable, fireplace, complimentary drinks in the fridge, books to read, and a separate sink outside the bathroom. I enjoyed the flowered wallpaper and felt it added to the charm of the hotel. The location is perfect. Just a few blocks from the trolley line and easy walking distance to Union Square, Chinatown and even the Pier. The front desk people were helpful with suggestions of how to get around, where to eat and what to do. I loved the fresh baked cookies in the lobby and it was nice to have a real breakfast instead of just rolls and fruit. Would definitely recommend staying here and would stay again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Have stayed in a number of hotels recommended by Tripadvisor.com, but this just did not live up to the reviews. Given Room 25 on the ground floor, very dark as it overlooked walls, decoration very drab and tired, paint peeling, definitely did not look like the pictures on the website. Commented to the front desk the next evening and was immediately upgraded to Room 57. As I was leaving for dinner I packed my bags and was advised everything would be moved by the time I returned and a complimentary bottle of champagne would be provided. On my return around 22:00 nothing had been moved. Went to front desk and moved myself with assistance from front desk staff. No champagne but this was quickly rectified. Very disappointing experience. Room 57 was lovely, did look like the pictures on the website and was very comfortable. Breakfasts excellent. Breakfast room lovely.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The White Swan Inn is in a terrific location (just outside Union Square and Chinatown) and is a charming respite in a bustling city. Besides being reasonably priced, a delicious breakfast is included in the cost, as well as complimentary red & white wine and an assortment of hors d'oeuvres in the evening! They also always have coffee and tea available with a different homemade treat each day! What's better than that? My mother and I stayed there for 3 nights in August. My only complaint would be that our room was not air-conditioned and our room was on the street. It was hot one night and noisy all three. Ear plugs did the trick for me. They did give us a good fan that muffled the sound and did cool off the room pretty well. Everyone that works there is friendly and helpful, too. All in all, I hope I have the opportunity to return one day...I'll just request a room in the back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visited San Francisco with my wife and older daughter from May 27-31, 2009 and we had the privilege of staying at the White Swan during that time. The purpose of the trip was to attend a Seminar at the Hotel Nikko( We preferred to stay at the White Swan rather than the host hotel). We were very pleased with the service we received during our stay. First and foremost ,Andy went out of his way to assist us. We have known Andy for many years, having stayed at the Petite Aurberge many times over many years. We were also treated very well by Eno, Anne and Brian. They were all wonderful and we feel all of these wonderful employees are assets to the hotel. The hospitality of the White Swan is superior. The rooms are very attractive and comfortable. We enjoyed the food. We are looking forward to visiting San Francisco next May and plan on staying at either The White Swan or Petite Auberge.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had mentioned in passing to our travel agent that our trip to San Francisco was to celebrate my partner's birthday but were still surprised (and delighted) to find birthday balloons, a half bottle of sparkling wine and a rather sweet Teddy bear waiting to greet us! This is a great place to stay: very central, with helpful and friendly staff, comfortable beds and a good breakfast. The wine and cheese reception gives you the opportunity to meet other guests and we met some really nice people - but if you want to be private you can do that too as there plenty of places to sit and read quietly. If you're new to San Francisco then the restaurant recomendations are very helpful - and there are some great places within walking distance. You can't really go wrong here if you want the experience of staying in a small, welcoming and above all, affordable, Inn right in the centre of this beautiful city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I hunted for weeks to find the perfect place to stay in SF as it was the last stop on our roadtrip and I wanted somewhere fancy but not too expensive. We loved this place! It was great value for money, in a great location, close to union square and the cable cars to Fisherman's wharf. It's on a fairly busy street but once you're inside the hotel it's so peaceful you could be in the country. Good breakfast and hot drinks available in the breakfast room all day. We had a queen room with a fireplace which was very welcome as the temperature dipped dramatically in the evening. Great size room and very comfy bed, we had room 24 which was on the ground floor next to the lobby but we weren't aware of any noise and slept very well. The gentleman on the front desk was very helpful as was the valet. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Just watch the post at the bottom of bed, I have a lovely bruise on my shin!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently attended a large conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Rather than stay at a conference related hotel my wife and I opted for the White Swan Inn. We were impressed by the cosy atmosphere of the inn, its close proximity to points of interest and transportation, and particularly by the fact that once inside the front door we felt distant from a city as large as San Francisco. We found our room quite spacious, the decor well appointed, and both noted how comfortable the bed was. During the evening social get together in the downstairs parlor we had the opportunity to meet and talk to folks from other parts of the country and share our thoughts and experiences on places to visit and see, something that is difficult if not impossible to do at a large hotel. I felt as though we were literally at a home away from home. Given the chance to return to San Francisco I will return to the White Swan Inn.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Based mainly on the reviews we read here, we selected the White Swan to visit the Bay Area over Christmas. The property was charming, the breakfasts were both satisfying and varied from day to day, and the location was convenient. I expected small rooms but the rooms were more than adequate in size. The staff was extremely helpful, taking time to fill us in on not just local attractions but discussing local culture and news. It was a perfect location for a family Christmas gathering, with the fireplaces (we brought our own stockings). The walk to Union Square was easy. We stayed there with our children 15 & 23, and they liked it as well. We checked out at noon and they graciously let us store our luggage until late that evening. If I had to stretch to pick negatives, I would mention that the bathroom fan sounded like an airplane engine, but that was the only negative. Overall a very nice experience in the heart of the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were celebrating our one year anniversary and this was a perfect vacation. We stayed 2 nights / 3 days and it was perfect way to see San Francisco. We loved the location! It was sucha nice quiet resort in the middle of the city. We were right off the cable car line and could hop over a few blocks to Union Square & visit the beautiful Christmas tree. We walked over to China town and were able to go up the cable line to Fisherman's Wharf and the cable car museum. Basically all the good "tourist" sites. The price was very reasonable. We lucked out on the weather. The breakfast in the mornings was quite nice and we enjoyed the appetizers and wine in the evenings right before going out to eat. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. Our bed was comfortable, the room was clean and we enjoyed the fireplace in the room (all rooms have fireplaces here). I could rave on & on but I think you get the idea. Blissful, romantic, good location, nice staff, good price...</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at the White Swan Inn for one week of vacation and sightseeing. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly. The staff was exceptionally courteous and helpful. The room (a deluxe king) was roomy and comfortable with a charming and romantic fireplace with gas logs. Breakfasts were plentiful with hot and cold dishes. These morning treats were substantial enough to last a good part of the day. The evening wine and cheese presentations were delightful, as were our conversations with the other guests. The quirky cage elevator was at times charming – and at other times maddening when a guest forgot to close the gate-like door, thus making the elevator inoperable. We would recommend this hotel without any hesitation. It is situated perfectly for Union Square, Chinatown, and public transportation. If you are unfamiliar with San Francisco, be sure to ask the front desk for the hotel’s list of 20 “Guide Sheets.” These are quite helpful in getting oriented to the area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I came here with my spouse for my birthday weekend. We absolutely loved the stay here! The inn is older, but its charm makes up for it. We had one of the larger king rooms in the back of the hotel and found it quiet and comfortable. I loved having my own seperate vanity and large closet completely separate from the bathroom. It was so nice to have a staff who not only seemed to enjoy their jobs, but went out of their way to give us inside tips on how to best get around the city. The morning complimentary breakfast is the best I have had since staying in inns in Europe. The evening wine and cheese is not to be missed - it was not only delicous, but we made friends with many of the other inn guests from around the globe and had so much fun sharing our stories about our day in SF. I room did end up having a water leak during one night from the bathroom upstairs, but it was quickly attended to by the staff ASAP in the morning. We will most definitely be returning for a stay here!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 6 days 5 nights at the White Swan Inn. I chose it because it was a B&B and also because it had a fireplace in the room. Didn't have much of a view but that was alright with us. Room was a decent size. Bed was very comfortable. Had no problems sleeping. My only complaint would be the tub. Let's just say it wasn't "SQUEAKY" clean. Size of bathroom was fine though. The breakfast every morning was very good and convenient, especially the day we rented a car and drove to Muir woods and Napa Valley. We were able to have breakfast as early as 7am and then walk a block to pick up our rental car. Also liked the evening wine service. Was able to meet other hotel guests and talk about where to go and what to see. Really liked the location of the hotel. Easy walking distance to China Town, car rental, cable car and Niketown/shopping. Had no problems with the lift. Hotel staff was nice and friendly and very helpful suggesting restaurants and sightseeing locales. All in all, a nice place to stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My daughters and I stayed at the White Swan Inn/San Francisco for two nights in March. The Inn is decorated in an "Olde English" style theme. Wallpaper on the walls, floral prints on the rugs/carpets and little touches of home everywhere. The fireplaces located in the rooms and sitting rooms add to the coziness of the Inn. As soon as you enter the lobby, you feel at home. The staff are all helpful, and well informed. There is a jar of fresh baked cookies available all day in the lobby area. The complimentary breakfast is outstanding - Fresh baked bread, a variety of pastries, hard boiled eggs, fruit, oatmeal, sausage, quiche and cereals are arranged in a pleasing display. Wine hour consists of crackers, cheese, veggies and a homemade bundt cake/pound cake. Our room (#56) was of good size. The bedding is clean and comfortable. The sofa bed is not very comfortable. The location is on Nob Hill which is a little far from the main tourist attractions if you are walking. We were very pleased with our stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had booked two rooms for our family group of four from Dec 1st to 4th. The choice was based on good reviews on TA and a good price through Booking.com. I am happy to say that we experienced none of the problems descibed by Disneyfan. When we arrived at 1pm we were prepared for the rooms not being ready, but they were. The hotel is charmingly oldfashioned and cozy, the rooms are big and comfortable with nice sitting areas in front of the fireplace. One of our rooms was on the fifth floor facing Bush Street, but we kept the windows closed and noise was not a problem. The antique elevator is a gem, it only takes a ride or two to learn how to operate it. The breakfasts were excellent with different warm, cooked dishes every day. Afternoon wine before going out to dinner was an extra treat. The reception staff was very friendly and helpful. Location is perfect, close to Union Square, restaurants, cable cars and other public transportation. I highly recommend this hotel, a lot more character than the typical chain operation.</p></li>

Anna was fast and efficient with check in. She explained breakfast times, wine & chesse tasting times and that our rooms would be stocked with water and pop each day of our stay. She told us that coffee, tea and hot chocolate were availabe in the breakfast room 24/7. Also she showed us to the cookies that would be available 24/7. As he took us to the room, Andy gave us the lay out of the land. He also reccommended that we purchase a Muni Pass. What a lifesaver, as you can get on and off the trolley cars as often as you like with the Muni pass. WIthout it, the trolley cars cost $5.00 each trip. Our room was clean and quaint, Andy showed us how easy it was to turn on the fireplace. Breakfast was awsome and each night we came back to cold or hot beverages, whatever we were in the mood for. My husband was known to grab a cookie as we were running from one activity to another. The bed was comfortable and I slept like a baby. And Im a very light sleeper.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sadly, we only got to spend one night on a recent swing through San Francisco. Read the review on this site and decided to try it. It was a very nice evening. Within a few blocks of Union Square, easy to get around downtown. After circling the block a few times looking for a parking place, we were finally able to get close enough for the valet parking to take over. Check in was easy and the woman at the front desk was very helpful. We left the Victorian-era lobby and made our way to the elevator, which is one of those old-timey close-the-folding-gate-and-close-sliding-door kind of things. Very cool. Push the little button and the elevator goes up (or down) and lands on the correct floor...usually within an inch or two. The rooms were tastefully decorated in an Olde English Romantic style, but with modern amenities. The bed was very comfortable, the tub was big, my wife was happy. Breakfast was not outstanding, but very good. There were certainly some signs of age, cracked tiles, etc., but only added to the historic charm. We only wish we had more time, and we will definitely back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One of the traditions of the English B&B is the "cooked breakfast," as contrasted to the "continental breakfast" of yogurt or cold cereal, and this B&B really lives up to the tradition. If you are a serious trencherman of the a.m., you can look forward to hot porridge, excellent quiche (an easy dish to do badly), sausage, toast & marmalade, pastries, fresh fruit, croissants, fruit juices, fine coffee and a variety of teas. For both the days we stayed there, we could skip lunch altogether with no trouble; there is also a free wine, cheese and biscuit soirée every afternoon. (And free cookies in the lobby!) Our room was nicely turned out as well; quite spacious, comfy, and tastefully decorated if a little on the froufrou side. It was quiet despite the hotel's central location, though the plumbing was somewhat noisy, not surprising since the shower was like a fire hydrant -- just the way I like it! -- with an old fashioned bathtub for the more genteel bather. The staff were courteous and very much on the ball. Best recommendation: many of the guests I chatted up at breakfast were English!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It has been 14 years since I have been to San Francisco, and my husband has never been there. I booked a 4 night stay at the White Swan Inn, and we were not disappointed. Not really knowing the city, the staff was extremely helpful with both recommendations for restaurants, and places to see and things to do. They were always pleasant, and happy to accomodate with any questions or requests. The valet was extremely convenient, considering parking yourself in the city is a pain, and I'm so glad it was available. This place is NOT your run of the mill, cookie cutter Best Western. If you are looking for something with character, charm and history, look no further. This hotel is almost 100 years old, but is extremely well-kept for its age. The room was very large (we had the luxury king), with walk-in closets and a fireplace in the room. It was extremely charming, and we had a wonderful time here. It was conveniently located within walking distance of just about anything in the city - if something's too far to walk to you, the cable cars are within two blocks of the hotel. I definately recommend this place!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had a group of friends with me and we all stayed at the White Swan for one night on our way to Napa Valley. The hotel is a few convenient blocks from Union Square, the trolley, BART, Chinatown and several great restaurants. The rooms are quite spacious (all single queens) which works for couples and girlfriends, but may not for families. Extra amenities included a fireplace and supplemental area for sitting. We had plenty of room to spread out and have some closet space. The only thing that can be a little much is the floral decor (wallpaper, carpet, upholstery) but this is a minor detail. The hotel was surprisingly quiet since it is on a major street, but our room looked into the interior of the hotel and I'm not sure if all of them do. The breakfast was lovely, lots of hot and cold choices and the hotel also offers a nice afternoon wine happy hour. The hotel has a fun, old school elevator with a metal grate door and a sliding metal door with manual push button controls. There is definitely a knack to working this! This hotel is a wonderful choice for the value, location and extra amenities that they provide.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfirend surprised me with reservations at this charming hotel to celebrate my 50th birthday. We totally enjoyed our stay from the moment of check-in. Exceptionally nice and knowledgeable staff, clean, tasteful rooms and an unexpected bottle of champagne with balloons! We took full advantage of the wine & nibbles every night, as well as the quiche and other goodies every morning, both served downstairs of the lobby in a wonderful gathering area. Gas fireplaces with a flick of a switch are everywhere, even in the rooms. Travellers looking for marble bathrooms and uber chic spaces would be horrified by the flowery wallpaper, winged sidechairs, and four-poster beds. Teapots, books, matchstick models of cathedrals of England and Matchbox cars are some of the items tastefully displayed throughout. The tiny elevator was a kick, and took some getting used to, even after growing up in NYC. There was a small exercise area, nice sized meeting room, two outside sitting areas, and a pay-as-you-go computer available. Visitors having problems with stairs, claustiphobia in elevators, or chintz, may need to look elsewhere...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a phenomenal place: it's gorgeous, well maintained, romantic, private, and convenient. We just can't say enough good things about it. A fireplace in every room, complimentary goodies in the fridge, complimentary wifi in every room, comfy robes... Just fantastic! Outside the rooms, there is a lounge for relaxing by the fire with wine and cheese in the afternoons, not to mention coffee, hot chocolate, daily newspapers all on hand for you. And the staff--wow! From the moment we were booking the hotel over the phone, to our arrival and stay, to our departure, we were treated as VIP's. They accommodated us in every way we asked--and beyond: they knew it was our anniversary, so we were greeted with champagne and chocolates (complimentary), and we felt immediately in the right place. We loved it so much that for some of our dinners, we just "ate in," sitting in front of the fireplace in our room in the very comfy chairs, soaking up the warmth and reflecting on our day out and about in the city. What a wonderful trip to SF, and much of the credit goes to the White Swan. I do hope their staff is paid well; they deserve it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a charming hotel! Staff is very friendly and helpful. We booked the deluxe king room and found it very clean and spacious. The fireplace in the room was a nice treat. The hotel was built in the early 1900's and retains the original charm and character of an older building. The buffet breakfast was wonderful: quiches, fresh fruits, pastries, cereal and sausages. So much more than we had expected. Our room faced the street, and yes there is street noise. But, no much more than one would expect in any large city. True, there is no air conditioning, in fact very few hotels in the city do have a/c. But with the mild climate of San Francisco, it is almost never needed. Parking is off site, so there is a bit of a wait for your car to be brought around if you need it immediately. But, with a little planning ahead, its a non-issue. We decided to do some shopping the day of our departure and the hotel stored our luggage for us until we returned. We called ahead for our car and it was waiting for us when we returned. The hotel is within walking distance to many great restaurants, shopping and the cable car lines. We will definitely be back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We would not stay in the Inn again. On arrival we where told that we could attend a wine tasting and when we asked what time we where told between 5.00 and 6.30, the time was then 6.10. When we arrived in the dining room there were no staff to welcome you or tell where to find wine glasses or nibbles of which there where very little. This event is to welcome new guests and a nice idea but they only had to check to see that not all the guests for that day had arrived or once they booked us in come down to welcome us. This we found was the standard of customer service in the White Swan, the front desk never spoke to you coming in or going out and they never offered to help with the cases up or down the steep steps to the road. Breakfast was very limited, if you came down at the wrong time the food had not been replenished the selection was not good. Our room was large and the furnishings well warn and tattered with peeling paint. The windows did not all open and one rattled when the wind blew until we put some card in it. The bed was creaky and soft. After staying in a very good Portland hotel just before this one for the same price it was a shock.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I like to travel spontaneously and were looking for a nice place to stay in San Francisco. We really feel we lucked out in booking two nights at the White Swan Inn on short notice. We greeted by friendly staff--especially Andy who helped us with our car, bikes and luggage, and gave us the lay of the area upon our arrival. The front desk staff kindly upgraded us to a larger room. We found our room (#32) to be very spacious, clean, and charming with lovely touches including a sink and make up mirror/hair dryer in a large brightly lit closet, wet bar, fridge with complimentary cold drinks, and nice sitting area. The only thing about the room we didn't care for was the squishy bathroom (2nd sink, bathtub, and toilet). It was really tight in there. Each morning, they served us lovely fresh breads, fruits, juice, cereals, egg dishes, and potatoes. Coffee was delicious and always available. Staff also provided us with wonderful restaurant recommendations within walking distance of the hotel. We had no disappointments during our stay. If you are looking for warmth and charm, we highly recommend the White Swan Inn. We will definitely stay there on our next visit.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed here three times starting about ten years ago and you always wonder if quality has been maintained and it has. Rooms are all large and very comfortably furnished with old-fashioned furniture, much like a home. All rooms, I think, have a gas fireplace. The bathrooms are old-fashion but spotless. Our room also had a wet bar and small fridge with some complimentary beverages. Very good full breakfast included and fresh baked cookies out in the lobby in the afternoon. At five, they put out a tart and/or savory with tea and coffee and sherry in the lounge. The lounge consists of two very comfortable rooms with fireplaces. This is a great place to go if you are using more than two or more rooms since the lounge is a really nice place to get together during the day or at night. The rooms are also well set up for relaxing. Our most recent room had a wing chair and ottoman and loveseat. Great location for exploring, up a hill from Union Square. Sometimes there is noise on street at night, but we have never been bothered by it and my husband is a light sleeper. Less expensive than what we would consider a comparable hotel. Very homey feeling. They have wi-fi and a little workout room.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “On a noisy street-hard to sleep well, but great location and price”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a room overlooking the street so it was noisy. The room was warm with no air conditioning making it necessary to sleep with windows open so we heard the street trafffic all night. If you book here, request a room away from the street. There was a box fan provided in the closet which helped cool the room somewhat. The room was large with a comfortable couch and chairs. The bed had good pillows but was somewhat lumpy so not the most comforable for sleeping. The ironing board had broken legs. The bathroom was cramped, but it's an older building so that's to be expected. The front desk staff was friendly and very helpful with bus schedules and routes to ATT park for a Giants game. The location and price can't be beat. Union Square is within walking distance. The bus line is only 2 blocks away. It's difficult to find a hotel close to Union Square for under $200, especially including a hot breakfast. The breakfast was good with crustless quiche, sausage, toast/jam, fresh fruit, milk and juice. If location and value are more important than a good nights sleep, then book here. If a good nights sleep is what you need, book elsewhere. I value a good nights sleep when travelling so would not stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here in April 2010 for 3 nights. Upon arrival they informed us that we were only booked for two nights, they checked the system and sorted everything out. After this all i can say is we had a fab stay. As first timers to San Fran we found that it was well located for Union Square, Grace Catherdral and lots of attractions. The staff are very friendly and helpful if you ask them where places are. The room we had was on the top floor at the rear of the property. The room itself was large with a very comfy bed. Being Scottish i appreciated the tartan bedcovers with the cushions and teddy bear. The rooom was lovely and warm and could not be falted. The only thing i did not like was that you could not move the shower head in the bathroom. The breakfast provided in the morning was great everything from porrigde to eggs. Plenty of food and the staff are always topping it up. At night they provide free wine and nibbles between 4.30( i think or it could have been 5.30pm.) The wine was realy nice and i found it a nice way to relax after spending all day outside on my feet. It was a little noisy at nighttime due to the traffic but i used earplugs so i slept like a log. Overall a great place to stay which i cannot recommend enough.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nine girlfriends who've known each other from kindergarten to high school in Maryland, plus four husbands, were treated like queens and kings during our "Forever Friends 65th Birthdays Celebration" in San Francisco. Eric, Kevin, Brendan, Ana, Mike, and the staff went all out to make sure we had a memorable reunion. Great wines and hors d'oeuvres in the early evening, deelish breakfasts, yummy cookies in the afternoon, tea and coffee 24/7, lovely rooms (all different) with nooks and crannies and a bunch of books to read -- as if you couldn't find enough to do in San Francisco! The elevator is a surprise, a real conversation piece and perfectly safe (though one friend decided she'd just use the stairs). Be aware that there's no central AC -- although in SF, that's almost never a concern. Our weather was perfect, with great breezes available from windows that actually open. Can be a little noisy in street-side rooms ... but the White Swan offers free earplugs, if you'd like! As I said, they think of everything and make sure you have the best possible experience. Location is great -- just two blocks from the Powell Street cable car, lots of great restaurants within walking distance, not far from Chinatown, Nob Hill, Union Square, etc. The White Swan is a true San Francisco gem.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Hate "English Inns" but White Swan won us over!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I don't usually like english-style inns (at least in the US). Don't like floral wallpaper. Don't like antique carpet. Somehow, we ended up loving our experience at the White Swan. We took a chance based on Tripadvisor, along with a very good special that Joie de Vivre hotels was offering - yes, the White Swan is part of a boutique chain, but quite unlike most of its (more modern) sister hotels. I agree with most previous reviewers about its great staff, convenient location, good-sized rooms (for San Francisco), good breakfasts, fresh-baked cookies every day (a different varieties, and definitely not from a tub of cookie dough), free soft drinks, fireplace in our room, and our wi-fi did work throughout our stay! What won us over was the "total package" of the White Swan with its unique charm, slight quirkiness, as well as its imperfections! We didn't want the overly personal attention of a small B & B, but also not the blandness of a large modern hotel. We felt we could retain some privacy, yet also felt welcome to socialize with other guests - both were perfectly okay here. We could tell that the staff genuinely liked working there by their friendly pride, the way they interacted with guests and more importantly - they way they treated each other. We felt so comfortable - at home, yet well taken care of - the hallmark of a great hotel experience!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We really enjoyed our weeks stay at the White Swan. Andy is an excellent member of staff - always friendly and helpful and a beaming smile.All the housekeeping staff are also very efficient and polite. The hotel is traditional in style but our room was vey large. The furnishings were comfortable and very flowery with lots of teddy bears around the rooms which was slightly odd - but that is the style of the hotel. The fridge in our room complete with free water and soft drinks was very welcome. We also had a coffee maker in the room. There was coffee and tea available 24 hours in the lounge downstairs. The breakfasts were very good and included fresh fruit , cereal, porridge,sausage and eggs, cakes etc. If anything was running low you only had to ask and it would be replenished. Every evening between 5pm and 6.30 there was also free wine and snacks in the lounge. It was lovely to come back to the hotel after a busy day and relax in a comfy armchair by the fire with a glass of wine. It was very chilly in San Francisco although it was July - we were told this is quite usual. One evening all the guests in the lounge decided to stay in and not go out for dinner, so we extended the "happy hour" by sending out for pizza ! We decided to buy an extra couple of bottles of wine for the other guests to share. A thoroughly good night. Overall a lovely older style hotel with a wonderful atmosphere.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Beware of the bathtub!!!!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I gave this hotel a 2 star rating because it is not a Hotel... it's a large Bed & Breakfast with a few distinct problems. #1 The bathtubs are an absolute nightmare! Think "YUK" and you'll get a mental picture. They are so old that they're rusty and corroded around the drains. The hotel is supposedly redoing them next week, but what good did that do me? I got robbed out of my daily hot bath & wore flip flops in the shower so my feet didn't have to touch the black stuff. I asked to switch rooms, but the only one available with a refinished bathtub had a BROKEN FIREPLACE!!! Real classy. #2 If you have eyesight problems, don't try to watch TV. It's a million miles away from the bed. #3 The bed is REALLY comfy, but the rest of the room needs help. #4 Old, old, old elevator. #5 OK, ok... So it's within walking distance of Union Square & Chinatown. However, all the hotels along Powell Street (Westin St. Francis, Chancellor, etc.) are MUCH more convenient!!! If you want to stay off Powell, choose The Orchard. The saving grace of this B&B is the yummy breakfast buffet, the SUPERIOR wine/ fruit & cheese sampling at 5:00pm, and the adorable bellman, Louis. The only way that I would ever stay at this B&B again is if they sent me a voucher for a free night's stay AFTER they refinished the ALL bathtubs & fixed ALL the fireplaces. Otherwise, for the hefty $200 price tag, I'm at the Westin St. Francis. Hope my reveiw helps!</p></li>

<li>However, all the hotels along Powell Street (Westin St.</br></br></li>
<li>Francis, Chancellor, etc.)</br></br></li>
<li>are MUCH more convenient!!!</br></br></li>
<li>If you want to stay off Powell, choose The Orchard.</br></br></li>
<li>The saving grace of this B&B is the <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">yummy</span> <span style="background-color:#bcf60c">breakfast buffet</span>, the SUPERIOR wine/ fruit & cheese sampling at 5:00pm, and the adorable bellman, Louis.</br></br></li>
<li>The only way that I would ever stay at this B&B again is if they sent me a voucher for a free night's stay AFTER they refinished the ALL bathtubs & fixed ALL the fireplaces.</br></br></li>
<li>Otherwise, for the hefty $200 price tag, I'm at the Westin St.</br></br></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “White Swan Inn: Confused About Their Target Customers”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The White Swan is a decidedly mixed bag. On the one hand, their luxury king rooms are spacious with a fireplace and dressing room (see pictures). There are complementary beverages in the refrigerator. The desk clerks were polite and helpful. The evening wine and cheese is a lovely touch (although cole slaw was a definite first for an accompaniment -perhaps that's an English thing :) The breakfast buffet includes a variety of foods to meet most tastes but the servers are very slow to replenish items -including the coffee--and on two of the three mornings we were there were late to put the items out at all. The hotel lacks air conditioning so be forewarned that if San Francisco is experiencing warm weather, as it was when we were there, you will roast in you room. A fan is provided but the choice remains -street noise or uncomfortable warmth. The hotel is conveniently located but lacks a porter to assist with bags on arrival and there is no way around the stairs at the entry. This is not a hotel for people with impaired mobility. The Victorian decor is pleasant enough but the towels and bath amenities are more suited to a budget motel than a "boutique hotel". On one morning, the maid left no washcloths at all in our room. That seemed to exemplify the spotty nature of the service at the hotel. Sometimes great, sometimes awful. All in all, my husband and I agreed that this hotel is confused about its target market.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Cozy and Convenient”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This quaint English-style hotel near Union Square was perfect for our 7-day getaway. Our room (huge) was on the top facing an atrium. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable, and at night, we used the fan provided. With windows open, we didn't miss A/C. One night we needed the fireplace, which was cozy. Big flat screen TV was nice, with limited cable. Bathroom was small, but adequate. We liked the coffee/ refrigerator area with an extra sink. ++ Free spring water each day was great. We used the FREE wi-fi every day. All the staff we encounted were very helpful, and requested taxis showed up fast. The breakfast was decent with limited hot food and no milk alternative. I mentioned a mushroom allergy to them and they left them off the quiche. We took public buses and walked everywhere and felt safe enough. The complementary wine and cheese in the afternoons was nice. The old-fashioned lift is charming and slow. We ate outside on the back deck one morning, and thoroughly enjoyed it. The only negative is a small one: they need to invest in some bowed shower rods so that the curtain doesn't stick to you when showering. This is not a chain hotel with on-demand movies and every convenience, but it is nice and we didn't hear kids running up and down halls. All in all, White Swan gives super value for the money. One note: like all hotels in the area, you will hear sirens and emergency vehicles. The noise was no big deal with windows closed, but when opened, it was loud.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “European charm in San Francisco”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is the second time we stayed at the White Swan so we knew what to expect. This time we booked a top floor king room. The room was huge by city standards, with a separate dressing area and extra sink area, large walk-in closet, and bar area with additional sink . The bed was very comfortable and the room was clean. In addition to complementary soft drinks and water, the refrig. had plenty of room to store anything else one might want to keep chilled. We found the overall service to be very good, the maids did a good job of keeping the room clean and the front desk called cabs and provided directions to where ever we were going. There was no valet to help with bags when we were there, but for us, that was not an issue. The breakfast is definitely not gourmet, but was more than adequate and plentiful. We liked the fact that there was always coffee and tea available and a nice wine hour. No, the hotel is not spanking new, but then it does not claim to be. In fact, that's part of the charm. It reminded us of a higher end, older European hotel.The bathrooms are not huge, but clean and the extra sink in the dressing area makes up for the smallish bathroom. There is no air conditioning, but then it's not really needed. The windows are easy to open and provide a nice breeze, just be sure to shut them before you go to sleep as there is a bar behind the hotel that gets noisy at closing. Overall, we had a very nice experience thanks to a good staff and pleasant, even romantic surroundings.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I booked a long weekend in San Francisco and after searching the internet for city hotels, we chose the White Swan because of its location and the amenities noted in the advertisements. In Fact we stayed two additional days. We were not disappointed. A little gem of a place in the heart of the city. Great location, quiet neighborhood street, safe. Wonderfully attentive staff , friendly and yet professional. Took care of all requests and even provided a surprise birthday gift of wine delivered to our room (with chocolates and balloons). Our room was sunny, nicely sized, with very comfortable furnishings, arm chairs by the fireplace and a loveseat by the windows. The bed and linens super comfy. Lovely gas fireplace . Tucked away in a little alcove was a coffee, refrig. stocked with complimentary drinks. and a wet bar. The bath was clean and well sized with a nice marble vanity. Charming lobby (with a jar of freshly baked homemade cookies everyday). An excellent breakfast every morning, in the main salon downstairs. This area is spacious cozy, set up like several drawing rooms in a country manor. There were also two outside gardens areas which were lovely, hard to believe you were in the city when sitting out there. The evening wine and cheese social is very nice, allows you to meet some of the other guests, and compare outings and find out about points of interest. Highly recommend this charming establishment. Our future trips to San Francisco will always include a stay at The White Swan.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed for just one night at The White Swan to finish our stay in San Francisco. What a lovely old hotel! It's in a perfect situation too-only five minutes from Union Square. Our room was as chintzy as anything I have ever seen with lovely rosy wallpaper, rosy prints, lots of space, a sofa and a decent bathroom. The complimentary drinks in the fridge were a thoughtful, and unusual, addition. The lift was a real old Alfred Hitchcock movie one with a clangy gate and plush red inside. The wine and cheese at 5.pm was delightful and a really lovely meeting place for the guests. Breakfast was great too and the cookies in the lobby-oh my gosh! Lemon poppyseed when we were there. There were lovely teddy bears in the lobby too but I was a tad disappointed not to have one in our room! Our bed was only a double which was mildly disappointing and our neighbours were noisy, waking us up several times during the night. Not the fault of the hotel though. I had a bad fall in the dining room at breakfast time while carrying two cups of tea. There is a small flight of stairs beside the tea urn and I missed my footing and fell right down, in a mess of spilled tea and broken china. I was very shaken afterwards and have an enormous bruise to show for it but no serious injury thank goodness. The maids cleaned up immediately and other guests assisted me. I don't know if it was reported to management. Maybe something could be done to make that area safer? Anyway we enjoyed our night there and would definitely stay again.</p></li>

<li>Not the fault of the hotel though.</br></br></li>
<li>I had a bad fall in the dining room at breakfast time while carrying two cups of tea.</br></br></li>
<li>There is a small flight of stairs beside the tea urn and I missed my footing and fell right down, in a mess of spilled tea and broken china.</br></br></li>
<li>I was very shaken afterwards and have an enormous bruise to show for it but no serious injury thank goodness.</br></br></li>
<li>The maids cleaned up immediately and other guests assisted me.</br></br></li>
<li>I don't know if it was reported to management.</br></br></li>
<li>Maybe something could be done to make that area safer?</br></br></li>
<li>Anyway we enjoyed our night there and would definitely stay again.</br></br></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Quaint Old World Charm”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights as part of our 25th wedding anniversary tour of California. We were not disappointed with our choice. They say that location, location, location is everything and this is certainly the case with this hotel. It is within one block (easy walk) to Union Square, from which you can connect to any part of the city. It is near numerous restaurants and within walking distance of many of the popular tourist spots. If you like the old worldly charm, coupled with a quaint old fashioned elevator and a spacious, lovely decorated room, then this is the place for you. There are warm comforting lounges, library and pleasant outdoor seating options. From the complementary breakfast, hot cookies in the afternoon and the evening wine and hors oeuvre reception to the ever helpful and responsive ancillary staff, this is a great place to stay. They have the valet parking option which is also convenient. It is important to remember that any hotel that is in the middle of a major city is susceptible to noise, however we requested a high floor, non-street facing room and noise was not a problem – we were able to sleep easily with the windows open. Although my wife and I would stay here again in a heartbeat and will recommend this hotel to anyone we know who is travelling to San Francisco, there is only one thing that I could identify an opportunity for improvement, i.e., the friendliness of the hotel front desk. Although they were always professional and courteous, they lacked the sincere warmth and constant smiles that were always presented by the housekeeping staff. This however would in no way detract us from returning to this wonderful hotel. Good job White Swan Inn.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice place with some fun extras!”</li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in the beginning of May & was actually hot that weekend! He needed to be there for a conference at the Moscone convention center. He did walk there a few times but since it was hot he took 7-dollar cab rides to from the conference most days. The streets are confusing and the hill on the way back to the hotel from the main city area is super steep and did cause some thigh and calf burning! Anyways, we took a cab about $40 from the airport and we got checked in promptly. Our room was pretty big, bigger than I expected! Best part was the free mini-fridge in our room with 2 cokes, sprites, diet cokes, and bottles of water-replaced daily. The bed was a queen, the bathroom was nice, white fluffy accents and the Aveda products were a really nice touch. The hotel is decorated old English style with teddy bears everywhere. Not my style but it was fine. The free cookies were a nice touch. We went to the free wine and appetizer hour a couple of times, nice! Breakfast was good. Quiche, cereal, breads, and fruits were offered daily. Plus juice coffee and tea were offered. Better than a Holiday Inn continental breakfast, that is for sure! The hotel is like 7-8 blocks from the major shopping areas and convention center. Walking down the hill is no big deal in fact I recommend it. I went to the beach one day. I took the BART with a friend who lives there. I recommend that! The Fisherman's W. is totally touristy and new with chain and non-chain restaurants. We got crab at a cute fish market... oh and we went to Alcatraz as well. Nice tour. Buy your tickets online & in advance. When we showed up there was a sign and they were sold out for the following 3 days! Overall, good trip. Decent hotel with fun little extras at a good price. I can't remember exactly but I think we paid around $175 a night with a AAA discount.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For our 30th wedding anniversary, we chose a trip to San Francisco. After much research, we fortunately picked the White Swan for our 4 nite stay. We had been to London in 2006 and were attracted to the European boutique style hotel. It is not a hotel for everyone, particularly if you are into modern. But it you love history and antiques and the atmosphere such presents, you will fall in love with this hotel. First, the staff is very welcoming and knowledgeable about the area. They provide you with a list of outstanding local restaurants and were exceptionally helpful with tourists sites. The SF City tour they recommended was incredible. The hotel is also totally convenient to downtown SF. It is about one block to a cable car & then two blocks downhill to Union Square. It is one block uphill to the Mark Anthony Hotel and Grace Cathedral. The room we had was great. We splurged on a Deluxe King bed room. It was spacious, had windows overlooking a side greenery area, was beautifully decorated in red/green plaid bedding with floral wallpaper. The most unexpected but wonderful discovery was the hotel's original, and in perfect working condition, old type elevator with its pull back metal screen door (think the movie Charades). The food was fabulous, starting with a hot breakfast that changed daily. I loved the french breadpudding. Breakfast, included in your roomrate, had a variety of eggs, quiche, sausage, fresh fruit, toast, pastries, and hot gourmet oatmeal. The breakfast room is full of antiques. In the early evening, wine was served with a variety of cheese, crackers, fruit, fresh vegies, and a dessert. In the late evening coming in after a cold walk in the rain, we welcomed the hot cider and again fresh homemade cookies. The hotel was one of the great highlites of our trip. We highly recommend it--particularly to couples. We will of course stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “We had an Absolutely Wonderful stay at the White Swan Inn!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I were coming to San Francisco to attend a holiday party in early December. From the recommendation of my sister and her husband, we chose to stay at the White Swan Inn. My brother in law, who is British, felt much at home at this English themed inn. They had nothing but wonderful things to say about this inn....and my husband and I fully concur! We were delighted by the lovely decor, warm fires roaring throughout the hotel and in our room, as well as the warm reception from the front desk staff. We brought our car, along, but we had a great experience with the valet service...getting our car was quick and easy to use. Our room was immaculate and well appointed with many special touches that you don't find in a regular hotel, including darling teddy bears on the large comfortable bed. We had the best time at the complimentary breakfast the next morning. The selection of freshly baked pastries, fresh fruit, and egg dishes were delicious and beautifully displayed. We were very impressed with the quality, quantity, variety, and presentation of all of the food. By the way, the coffee was execellent..as well as a great variety of lovely teas and hot chocoloates. The breakfast was served in a warm dining area, with french doors opening up to quaint garden courtyard. Right below the dining area is a welcoming large sitting area and also french doors into a darling library and sitting area where a warm fire was burning. The great part of staying at the hotel was that it is within walking distance of Union Square and Nob Hill. My husband and I were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go, without having to use our car or hire a taxi. The whole experience at the White Swan Inn was wonderful and I think we'll make it an annual trip each December to enjoy all of the holiday splendor and lights at the hotel, Union Square, as well as all of San Francisco. It is a magical city!</p></li>
