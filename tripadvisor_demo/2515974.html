<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location in Nob Hill. Close to cable cars. Stayed with husband and 2 teenagers! Breakfast was OK- but very convenient. Close to Chinatown, Union Square is walkable. This hotel served as a great base for our 4 day stay in San Francisco.</p></li>

But most of all, sliding glass doors and my own wonderful balcony! The view was fine, but not being hermetically sealed in ....priceless. Pleasant staff, nice continental breakfast, and a fine location. All for $109/night. Hard to beat that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Grosvenor Suites in San Francisco for a week. The hotel is at a great location, but the rooms could be better. It wasn't bad, but the furniture was quite old, a renovation would be nice. Otherwise it was okay, was nice to have a kitchenette. The breakfast was quite poor without a wide selection of choices, but still okay. We found this hotel a bit overpriced.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of 5 stayed at the Grosvenor Suites on our holiday Sept 2007. It is a great location at Nob Hill. Easy walk to downtown. We had trouble finding accomodation in San Francisco that would accomodate 5 people in one suite. Grosvenor was good, very clean, decor was a bit tied. Breakfast was included, basic but OK. Very small eating area, so we had to take food back to our room on one day.</p></li>

Had a great view out over the city from our balcony and the room itself was clean and comfortable if a bit dated.The free breakfast was a bonus. Location is good though it's a steep walk up Powell. We found the cable cars were fun but not the quickest way to get around. Staff were friendly and helpful and all in all we enjoyed our stay</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay at Grosvenor Suites was better than expected. The room was spacious ( 1 bedroom suite) and comfortable and the staff was very helpful. The bathroom was small but that was not an issue for us. The continental breakfast was basic but sufficient. The location is good however be prepared to walk up a very steep incline when walking from Chinatown or Union Square. Highly recommended if you are looking for a moderately priced hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in a corner king suite on the 17th floor, and the view was magnificent! The room was spacious, had a king bed in a separate room, and a sofabed. There were two flat panel tvs- one in the living room and one in the bedroom. It's not luxurious, but the space and the view made up for it, and everything was clean. Checkin and checkout were a breeze. Parking was $35 in a garage that had plenty of spaces. We drove a full size SUV and parking was not a problem.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It was nice to have the space of a 1-bedroom apartment but it is a cozy apartment. The hotel is a converted apartment building with several long-term residents still, as near as I can figure. Could use some updating. No decent food stores within an easy walk which was disappointing. Simple walk down to Chinatown or Union Square and even north to Fisherman's Wharf (apart from the first block which is brutally steep uphill!). The hills back to the hotel are a good workout!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel recently and had a fantastic time. Location is great, within walking distance of Union Sq. and one block from cable cars. The rooms are huge and we are a family of 5. Plenty of wardrobe space. Continental breakfast is served downstairs - cereals, apples, danish pastries, bagels, etc. Staff were very friendly and I would definitely recommend it. It is not a luxury hotel but it is clean, good location and perfect if you are travelling with a couple of kids.</p></li>

TV in each room and kitchenette. Staff helpful, washing machines in basement useful, quiet. Easy walk downhill to Union Square/muni/buses etc and near small playground opposite cathedral. Near cable cars or a few dollars in taxi to some other sites. Negative is a basic breakfast and a bit dowdy in decor but perhaps that keeps price down! Suited us - 2 adults 2 young children.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having stayed here at least 10 times in the past decade, I concur with other reviewers in general terms. In short, the location is terrific right beside the Mark Hopkins on Nob Hill and the price is sensational given the apartment-like accommodations. It is not a luxury property (very small bathrooms, no hot breakfast or on-site fitness facilities, routine bed and furnishings). However, the relatively new wireless internet connectivity worked great during two stays covering 11 nights in late 2007 - a big step forward.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not really a luxury hotel but very clean, comfortable and the well equiped kitchen made it very convenient to keep drinks and snacks handy. The bed was extremely comfortable. The free breakfast was more than enough to keep us going until lunchtime. Lots of fruit and coffee and juices. Cereals and various pastries. High on a hill all the rooms have really good views of the city and are free from street noise. Staff very pleasant and helpful. A perfect place to stay and do some siteseeing as it is close to all the main tourist spots.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was the first stop on our month long holiday. We enjoyed our stay. The staff were friendly and the free breakfast is a great way to start the day. The rooms were large, maybe as others have said, a little dated but quite oppulent - with a floor to ceiling mirror behind our bed! I would definitely stay again as the location was perfect and I loved the small and friendly feel of the place. You can catch a tram from the corner of the street or easily walk into town or down to Chinatown. Would have no hesitation recommending the Grosvenor.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in the Grosvenor Suites in June/July 2004. It's the perfect base to explore San Francisco. In the centre of everything and on the cable car line, no where is far away. Staff are very friendly and though the furnishings are not the most modern, it's spotlessly clean and has everything you'd need - rooms are a great size too! Great having a small kitchenette - Calafoods supermarket a short hop away. Views from our balcony were spectacular down to the Transamerica building and the harbour. I'd recommend it to anyone and would return without question!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here from Feb 3 through Feb 7,2011 with spouse and 2 teens. Arrived late in evening from the east coast so we were ready for bed. The suite was clean and the separate bedroom with 2 beds was just what we needed. Overall this hotel met our needs. While it does not have the amenities of the name brand hotels the location, clean rooms, free breakfast and very accommodating staff help to make the trip enjoyable. The price we paid for the value we received on Nob Hill in San Francisco was well worth it. Try this hotel if you need extra room, a fridge and a good location</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from an 8 day stay at the Grosvenor Suites. We had an amazing corner suite on the top (19th) floor. The views were stunning from all sides - difficult to tear ourselves away from the night time views over the city. This suite had millionnaire type penthouse views at a bargain price and to top it all, a balcony to sit out on with the cocktails! Absolutely no complaints at all about any aspect of this hotel. Note, however, that the balcony and the opening windows this high up, which we loved, might be a problem if you have small children, or suffer from vertigo!</p></li>

With a teen, we wanted a suite with some privacy. We had a huge living room/kitchen where the teen was very comfortable, a very nice bedroom, and it was a corner suite with views north and east - spectacular. It was clean, comfortable, friendly, quiet, fantastic location, and the simple complimentary continental breakfast was just right. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants great value in a moderate, solid, comfortable accommodation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a perfect location. Walking distance to Chinatown and Union Square. We rented a suite with the full kitchen as we had made plans to go to the Farmers Market on Saturday at the Ferry building on Embarcadero. What at great plan. Having the full kitchen with a full size refrigerator was a great choice for all the fabulous local goodies we found at the Market. The market is a great way to start the day with all the free sample goodies to try. Fresh local cheese, citrus, vegetables and jams. If you ate driving to the market go early and they have a few parking areas that offer a $6 a day fee just for the day.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The pluses of this hotel are the location (just close to union sq at Nob Hill) and the rooms spacious enough and with a kitchen. Yet our room was damaged (specially the walls) and looked quite old. On the other hand, it had a panoramic view and a small balcony. The hotel services are essentials: the hall very tiny (you can seat on a small sofa just close to the main entrance) and the complimentary breakfast poor. The bellboy is unhelpful (leaved us wothout any information parking when we arrived and asked to him). Instead the staff of the concierge are nice and helpful. Price reasonable, if consider the location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A great place to stay in SF. We were a family of 4 and stayed in a suite with one bedroom (2 queen size beds) and one large living room (with a sofa-bed for 2). We had a wonderful view at the 13th floor on 2 sides of SF. Kitchen was correctly equipped (but not many dishes), with microwave oven, electric heaters and oven, fridge and freezer. Personnel was very kind at the reception desk. Lobby small, but with an (old) PC and free internet access. Location was perfect, in low Nob Hill (very quiet), and 1 block from each of the 3 cable car lines. A place to recommend : a bit expensive, but quite OK considering it's SF.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It is a bit late to write the review as we stayed for nearly a week in Grosvenor Suites in May 2004. The room was of very good standard and the details were as mentioned on the web site. We had a great stay with family here and everything was comfortable. It is centrally located with good access to the cable cars for easy movement around San Francisco. Went by reviews written by others at this web site and therefore I thought it would be proper to write my review as we has a fabulous time in SanFrancisco without any bother of accomodation. Grosvenor Suites - A1 Go ahead and book. I will recomend without any hesitation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a two week stay in the US where we spent the first week at the Grosvenor Suites. Very friendly place with helpful staff and brilliantly situated for Union Square and the surrounding neighbourhood; two minutes walk from the Powell-Hyde tram stop (although getting on one is often a problem) and only twenty minutes brisk walk to and from North Beach. Our room was a basic studio apartment with a small built in kitchen and very modest fittings, but this was more than compensated for by the breathtaking views - we were on the 19th floor overlooking the transAmerica Pyramid - stunning. Verdict: Not flashy but a good deal.</p></li>

PC and printer free in lobby. Good area for public transport. They provide car to and from airport at a good price.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There is nothing wrong with this hotel. The price was good, location was great, and the hotel is very nice. It is a totally reasonable 3* hotel that is great for family and walking distance to lots of the best of SF. It is not a 5 star place, and is not priced like it. The staff is nice, the included breakfast is good, and it is the perfect place to use as a base for seeing the city. If you are going to be super particular about there be some scratches in the furniture or walls, or other imperfections- it is an old hotel, with oldish carpets and amenities, but for what we paid, we were way more than satisfied. I would totally stay here again.</p></li>

The breakfast in the morning was great, and they even keep your bags for you if you need them stored while you explore the city. The front desk staff are very friendly and accommodating. When our kids were looking for "state quarters" the front desk staff personally looked through all there quarters to see if they could find any! Talk about friendliness! It is very well located and for the price (in San Francisco) you can't go wrong. They have two computers and wifi located throughout the hotel, which is also great. Highly recommended!</p></li>

The staff upgraded our room which was good but as we were on the 3 rd floor - the view wasn't as spectactular as further up. Breakfast's were very filling but service a bit inferior.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfectly located in downtown just few blocks away from Powell Street. Numerous restuarents, cafes and Chinatown all within 10 mins walking distance. Wonderful view of the city and the mountains from the rooms. You can even walk to Union Square and Bart stations. The rooms are quite big enough and have a small kitchenette which has a full size refrigerator and a microwave oven. The bathrooms are on a smaller side but not inconvientent by any way. A large wardrobe with a locker is also there in the rooms. The breakfast is included and is ok with not much variety. The staff at the reception are veru courteous and helpful. Few of them can converse in many different languages.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Grosvenor Suites on Nob Hill for four nights while attending a conference at the Crowne Plaza. The room was very nice and cheaper than the Crowne. Two queen beds, a nice little kitchen and a full bath. We were on the fourth floor so street noise was there...not intrusive but there. The walls seemed a bit thin when we were awoken at 2 am with 4 drunken people on the other side of the wall. It was like we were in the same room. Front desk took care of them quickly and they were gone the next day. Continental breakfast was in a former hotel room converted to small dining area and the food appeared to be donuts and bagels (I had breakfast elsewhere). I would certainly stay there again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our requirements were simple; to find accommodation for our family of 5 in San Francisco at a location within walking distance of cable cars and close to a good selection of restaurants - without paying the earth! Grosvenor Suites met these requirements fully. A two room suite meant we didn't have to pay for two hotel rooms (much more expensive). The suite was comfortable without being luxurious. Parking was $25 per day plus tax (pretty standard for SFR). Complimentary breakfast was very good offering pastries, juice and coffee. Demand for this meant the dining room was a little cramped at peak times but easy to grab a bite to take back to your suite. Would particularly recommend for families of 5 or 6.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Yes its true, the Grosvenor does need a facelift however the dated decor and building does add a certain unique charm to the place. Located on Nob Hill, the veiw from our room of the city skyline was sensational. The beds were comfortable, the suite was clean and a continental breakfast is included. The suites are serviced daily. The location cannot be beat, cable car just a short 2 minte walk if that, in one direction Union Square, in the other Fishermans Wharf. Chinatown was within walking distance. It was nice as a family of 4 to spread our wings after a week in hotel rooms. The suites are well laid out. BARGAIN BARGAIN BARGAIN.....but lets keep this one a little secret so there's availability next stay :o)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed here twice. The rooms are a little shabby but the prices are outstanding. For about $110 you get a suite with a sitting room, little kitchen, separate bedroom and a small bath. The room I had even had a dressing table with large mirror and outlets. The kitchen comes equipped to make small meals, with toaster, coffee maker, pots and pans, etc. The views cannot be beat--the windows looks out over fabulous SF views. The Cable Car stops one block over, and Union Square is within walking distance. And it has a handy parking lot! A real gem...........Just a note for the mobility-challenged. There are steps up to the front door and steps inside off the lobby to the elevator. Not accessible by the front door.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this directly through the hotel's website and changed the reservation twice at least via telephone. The front desk staff are nice and the breakfast is very thorough, apples, oranges, cereal, milk, tea, coffee and pastries. I was happy to take it back to my room and more than 1 person was down there in their pajamas doing the same thing! My room was rather spacious with a great view and the kitchenette area was very clean. The location was on a little hill, but convenient to many things, including the bus and trolley systems as well as grocery store. I'd be happy to stay here again! The only thing is that the dishes and all were only enough for 2, so no entertaining for more than 2! And, I couldn't get the wi-fi to work.</p></li>

The fold out bed in the living room was decent and the kitchenette had a 3/4 size fridge/freezer, stove, oven and microwave. The room was very nice with great views of the city and bay. The included continental breakfast was quite good (muffins, bagels, donuts, juice, coffee). The location is GREAT up on Nob Hill next door to the Mark Hopkins and Fairmont Hotels. We were on the 15th floor and it was quiet and extremely clean. I would highly recommend this hotel! The only reason it wasn't rated as "excellent" is that it is not a luxury hotel, but for the price it really was excellent.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here with Terri (Wife) on a our quick RTW trip. We were only ini SFO for three days. Place was terrific value for money. Very large suite/apartment with two double beds, kitchenette, kitchen table, sofa etc and en suite. After terrible crowded hotel in Toronto(Bond Place Hotel) this was a welcome blessing. Bit old and tired though still very comfortable. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Daily Continental not the greatest but better than nothing. We walked up to the hotel a couple of time from Downtown and Finance District and it can be a challenge. Hills in SFO are steep. Plus is Cable Cars are only one block from Hotel so no need to walk unless you want too. We will be coming back again after we relocated to Denver and ready for our next holiday.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband & I stayed here for 4 nights after a tedious 2-week package tour where we have to check in/out of hotel room almost everyday. We needed a hotel with lots of space, finally able to have some own cooked food, comfortable and not too far from U.Sq & Chinatown. Grosvenor Suite was a great choice. There's lot of storage space - too much in fact unless you plan to stay for months, clean & good firm beds. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Continential breakfast was much better than other hotels that we have been to. Downside was the bathroom a tad small and also the storage area in our bathroom smell musty as it was hardly used & no ventilation. Yeah, it's a bit old and worn but we have no complain on that as the whole place is still very well taken care off.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is in an extremely convenient location only 5 mins walk to Union Square down Powell Street, but maybe 10 minutes stagger back up the hill! We got an good deal from Expedia, direct flights from London, including 14 nights stay here for the price of 10 for less than £700 each in early October. Our room was large, 2 Queen beds and a generously sized bed settee. Fully equiped kitchenette and more than enough storage. The staff here were very friendly. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus as we were unaware of it before we arrived. Laundry and drying facilities available. I would definitely stay here again. Only real suggestion for modernisation would be the installation of air conditioning as we had a heatwave whilst we were there and it got a bit hot.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent three days here and was concerned about my decision based on some of the reviews here. I had a studio suite with a balcony on the twelfth floor. The queen bed was very comfortable, the TV had Comcast cable and the kitchenette had all the utensils I needed. The morning continental breakfast has a staff-member on duty to assist. The location is on the same hill as the Mark Hopkins. The Powell St. cable car line is a block away and is the best way to get up/down the hill after check-in (don't try to take luggage on the cable cars - I used Super Shuttle for airport trips). Buy a Muni pass at the booth at the cable car turntable at the bottom of Powell St. or at the airport info centers. These passes include unlimited bus, subway and cable car rides for 1,3,or 7 days for less than twenty dollars.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got home from staying here 9 nights and have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Although the place is a little dated. It was very clean and you couldn't beat the views and the location. Walking distance to the Cable cars which bring you down to Wharf area or to Market street where you can catch the street car, bus or subway going anywhere in the city. Staff couldn't have been nicer. Friendly and full of great suggestions on where to go and where not to go. Stayed in a one bedroom suite with my husband and 2 teenagers and there was plenty of room to move around and have some space if you needed. Continental breakfast was perfect to get you started and out the door in the morning. Very happy with Grosvenor Suites and would definately stay there again. Walking distance to union square and to China town. I am so happy with my choice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location A++ - This hotel could not be in a better neighborhood. It is a very close walk to Union Square, Chinatown, and the attractions of Nob Hill. It is even a manageable walk to Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardelli Square. We also took a taxi back from this area and it only cost $10. Downside - some very steep hills, but great exercise, especially with a stroller! Staff A++ - The staff was very friendly, helpful and accommodating! The Room was also great - we had a top floor, 1 bedroom unit with a kitchen. It was very roomy with 2 full size beds in the bedroom and a full pull out bed in the living room. The view was incredible! Full, unobstructed views of the bay and Nob Hill. Downside - not very fancy, but very comfortable. The elevator was also a little noisy! Overall - an excellent choice in a great area of Nob Hill for a great price!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for three nights at the start of our 3-week road trip through California, We picked this hotel because of the fact it catered for families and the kitchenette. As mentioned it sells its self as a luxury apart/hotel I would dispute that, more of a basic apt/hotel but adequate for our needs. Good location few minutes from the cable car stop and about 10 minute walk to Union Square. The room we stayed in was fine and clean. The bottom line is though when visiting cities for 3 or 4 days you don’t spend much time in your hotel room, but having the small kitchen was a real bonus with teenagers, just stock up on goodies and juice for the odd munch out. Overhaul a decent clean hotel in a good location, just a note it is located on a steep hill but you are in San Francisco and this was not a problem for us but could be for older visitors.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here 30 mar to 01 Apr 2012. I spent these two days in SF as a stopover on the way back from Vegas to home. Price wise, SF hotels were all a lot more expensive than in Vegas. So the tendency would have been to compare the luxury I got in Vegas for the price I got there, to what I was getting in SF. However that would be unfair. By SF standards, after scouring the web for good deals and well located hotels, I found Grosvenor Suites. Got a corner one-bedroom suite, and it was really nice and spacious. What some other reviewers call "worn-out" or "old", I call "has character" and "cosy". The suite certainly reminded me of decor you would find in a typical rich man's home in east asia in the '70s. Location was great, just 10-15 min walk to times square. 10 min to chinatown. Right next to the cable car that would take you to Fisherman Wharf.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 3 nights at the Grosvenor Suites in a 1 bedroom apartment in September. We booked this stay on the Grosvenor website which offered a rebate for booking on line. We had a corner suite and the view of the city was great. The suite had a kitchenette with microwave, oven, full fridge, etc. Although the decor was a little dated the suite was clean and had everything we needed. For what we paid we were really pleased with the standard of the suite. There was also a free Continental breakfast each morning which was good. The breakfast room is a bit small so we would get a tray and take it back to the room. The location was also great. Near two cable car lines and within walking distance to ChinaTown and Union Square (it is a bit of a climb on the way back!). I would really recommend the Grosvenor Suites and would stay again if I ever got the chance to get back to San Francisco.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel in July because it offered a suite at a reasonable rate. To say is was gross and dumpy is an understatement. It looked like a metropolitan fishing/hunting camp for men. Do not stay at this motel. The people in the room next door would cook with unusual spices, which was sucked right into our suite. The decor is lousy, the location is lousy (near the highest peak, but no view, only a walking workout), and the smells from the neighbors were lousy. Do yourself a favor and stay in Union Square at one of the clean hotels that has standards. And don't fall for the "on-line cash rebate" offer on their website, because the prices listed on their website already include their "rebate", so there isn't actually a "rebate" or savings of any kind. Their "business center" had one old and outdated computer. Could not get the internet to work. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just back from 5 nights at the Grosvenor, which we had booked as a result of everything else that we had read here. Very good location - 1 block from cable car, 2 blocks from bus line, easily walkable to/from Union Square and cable car turnaround. Plenty of small supermarkets/liquors store in the vicinty. Huge corner room (1005) with great city views. Breakfast is simple and really no room to eat there, but easy to take a tray back up to the room. Room very quiet - some noise from sirens but hardly worth mentioning - beds very comfortable - flat screen televisions in both lounge and bedrooms. Free computer access next to the front desk but internet was so slow we gave it up as a dead loss.(Don't bother trying to print your boarding cards - it'll take a week!) Room available (with bathroom) for storing luggage on last day. All in all very good value for US$240 per night for 4 (Room would have comfortably slept 6).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Checked in early. Room wasn't ready, but staff took care of luggage and off we went. Much to our suprise the room was huge, AND clean. NO BED BUGS! If we needed anything all we did was ask. They has the answers to everything these tourists asked. So close to everything. Ya it was hilly, but once you figure out trolley you can get off by the Fairmont and walk downhill instead of walking up hill from China Town or Union Station. Breakfast was filling. Juice, milk, cereal, muffins, fruit, toast, we took trays to our room and spread out while we planned the day, and staff cleaned up after us! And the best coffee! We took the "classic cable car sighseeing" tour. So much fun, just wish we had done that the first day to see what was out there. Would have skipped the trip to Saualito (pricey art and not much else) and spent time at Crissy Field at the Presidio, Candlestick park, or Goldengate park. Next time Nappa valley, and Yoesemitte</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here in August 2011 for 3 nights, we'd looked at a lot of hotels online before we chose the Grosvenor and were encouraged by its location and room size for the price (based on the prices in San Francisco which are pretty expensive!!). Despite being told at the airport that it was too far to walk from the BART we managed it fine - up a big hill dragging our suitcases (yes, we had a rest a couple of times). Our room was great, good size, nice kitchenette and beds comfortable - it was nice to be able to open the window! All our questions were answered very helpfully at reception - though a smile was a little hard to find from one of the staff there.......a smile goes a long way! Breakfast room was a little small but you could take your breakfast back up to your room if you chose - we were happy with the breakfast. Best of all though was the location - near to the cable car stop and shopping and restaurants. I'd stay here again.</p></li>

We need the exercise! Booked on line on their web site, got the on line rebate credited to the room charge which pretty much paid for the $29 +tax parking charge per day. Got the two room suite for the family of five and we had plenty of room. Kitchenette was great to have with dining table. Price was great for SF. Front desk very helpful. The not so good Minor things here: a little worn, window had tape over a crack, shower head awkwardly low and didn't operate real great. Bathroom was tiny. Breakfast was pastries & bagels (but good ones!) They put us in the wrong room type at first but corrected the error quickly. Absolutely would recommend.

The hotel is not new and the rooms although remodeled, reflected that. But check-in was easy and the location very convenient. We stayed on the 18th floor and were wowed! by the veiws. Close to Union Square and both major Cable Car lines, an all day bus pass made moving around the city incredibly easy. The resturants and bars within 15 minute walk were very good and not over-priced. A 2 night stay extended into 3 nights and a very romantic long weekend. We felt like newlyweds on their first trip to San Francisco, rather than an old married couple of 22 years.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 nights last week and was very satisfied with the Grosvenor Suites. I was a bit tenuous about the rooms being worn and dated based upon some of these reviews but our room was perfectly fine. Not sleek or dramatic, mind you, just nothing to complain about. We found the location perfect for us. Pretty much equidistant between Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf. It is 1 block off of Powell St. (the path for the Trolley Cars) however, we found it difficult to catch a trolley from this stop because it is located at the top of a steep hill and the cars were already filled up before reaching our stop. The best thing to us about the Grosvenor Suites was its views. It is the tallest building in its immediate vicinity which means unobstructed views above say the 6th or so floor. Our room (room 1005) was a corner room with huge windows on 3 sides. You can stay in much more expensive hotels in San Fran and still might not have as great a view as here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After booking this place at a great price - $60 or so, way below what you'd expect in a San Francisco summer - I was pleased with everything it offered. My studio was large and clean, had a nice view with kitchenette and the bathroom was fine, though it looked a little old. I didn't have a balcony, but if I had, I guarantee I would have used it. I love the idea of looking over the city and drinking a glass of wine. The decor was nothing special, but I wasn't there long so it didn't bother me. And the continental breakfast was very nice. If you come early and remember to tip the girl, I think she may give you extra courteous service. At least she was very courteous to me! The front desk clerk when I checked in was helpful and quite friendly, too. Oh, and the location is superb - just a bit up Nob Hill. High enough to feel it when you walk, but not enought to hurt. All in all, I'd recommend this place over a regular hotel - even a fancy one - any day of the week.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I have just returned from an 8 night stay here. We had two queen beds in a spacious room overlooking Union Square on the 19th floor. It was an amazing view..just watching the Christmas tree lights and Macey's in the square. The bay in the distance. The service was good, rooms clean, nothing was too much trouble from the staff. We booked on line with the hotel direct which gave us a great discount. A phone call asking for a room with a view ensured we had our request. From here with a 7 day muni pass we expored the whole city by cable cars (one block) muni buses etc and walking. Boat trip to Alcatraz (u need to book in advance). Walking the golden gate bridge etc etc..absolutely wonderful...all the usual sights. What a great city we would love to come back again. We passed several other hotels I had spotted online and checked them out to see how they compared. We never found anything better for the price and would always go back here again. D & M Parish.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here on a perfect weather weekend 75 degrees so we were not bothered at all by the lack of heating or cooling and really enjoyed that we could open the windows and enjoy our view of The Mark. The room was in need of a bit of an updating but was well kept and had all the necessities including a fridge to bring home all our yummy leftovers. The staff was very attentive and helped us get a car service to the airport (which was the same price as the taxi and so much nicer) as well as gave us wonderful directions around town. I was a bit disappointed in the breakfast service and did not like feeling that I had to tip for the continental style service since they had the bagels locked up and the only personal service i received was of handing me a bagel that I am perfectly capable of picking up on my own. I am happy to leave a tip I am just opposed to tip jars. Be sure to eat before you make your hike back up nob hill as there are very slim pickings near the hotel but then again, you are in San Francisco so everything is good.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Workmanlike Accomodation in Frisco”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Grosvenor Suites offers workmanlike accomodation in Frisco. We were two couples and had one each of a studio (higher floor) and a suite (first floor). Both units had well equipped kitchens, and both offered great extra space. As expected the property was comfortable without being luxurious. There is no lobby to speak of, and if you have to wait for any reason it can be a problem. The breakfast is served in a smallish ground floor room and offers basic choices as is customary of a continental spread. The location is indeed very useful... right between Union Square and the wharf, so you are equidistant from both. We walked to Union Square several times as its all downhill, but preferred a taxi coming back uphill ! As mentioned by other guests, the front office gentlemen are most helpful and courteous. Tony, Ryan and others, as also Khalid from the little office to the side, made things easier all through for us. To sum up, it is a great deal for budget conscious travellers, if you avoid overpaying and have booked at the right prices.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed in Grosvenor Suites for around 3 nights while visiting San Francisco. The location is great, just a couple of blocks to Union Square, the cable car is just around the corner. And if you really planned your trip, getting around on buses, cable cars and subway is really easy. Also it is located in a quiet neighborhood and it feels relatively safe to walk around, even at night. The staff is friendly. We requested for a room on a high floor and we got a big room with a view. There is a small kitchenette in our room and 2 storage room (?). Though the bathroom is a bit small but it is ok. Oh ya, you might need a pair of strong legs…. Walking up to the hotel from Union Square (or anywhere) is no joke. I was panting halfway through. But I guess it is because I am not accustomed to such steep terrain. For an expensive city like San Francisco, Grosvenor is indeed a rare find. But if you are looking for branded hotel or modern, sleek and chic hotel, look elsewhere. But you are just looking for a simple place as your base to explore the city, this is it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were in SF for the first time (Sept 2010) and stayed at the Grosvenor suites through recommendations from Trip Advisor. The staff were friendly and helpful while the rooms were clean and well serviced. Although the hotel probably needs another renovation, it was one of the better value for money hotels that we could fine close to Union Square. It's conveniently close to the Powell & California cable car lines. It is also within walking distance to China Town. The hotel also provides a free continental breakfast in a small room on the ground floor. Free internet was also included as well as coin operated laundry facilities in the basement. The only downside was that the hotel was half way up the hill, so it can take a bit of effort walking back to it from Union Square. (Best advice is to take the cable car - you should get a SF Muni pass, which lets you gives you unlimited trips on the cable cars and most buses around SF). Overall the stay was enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in SF but doesn't want to spend $3-400/night on a hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First the good things: the hotel ist best located near downtown SF, has a good neighborhood and some rooms have spectacular views. You can get an affordable parking lot, the appartments are big enough and have a full kitchen (!). Staff is friendly. But don't use the Grosvenor, if you want a warm room in winter or cool room in summer. The heating is a joke and air condition doesn't exist. Windows are absolutely leak and it's windy and noisy in the room. The offered wifi mostly does not work or has the worst performance I've ever seen in american hotels, so this house is not usable for business travellers. TV-Quality is poor but has a lot of channels. If there is something broken or defective it will never fixed. I was here for 3 times in 3 years, always in the same room and found the same defects. Nobody comes if you complain. They have old ethernet adapters in the rooms but they don't work and nobody of the staff knows anything about it. Local calls are free, says an info sheet, but another sheet demands 0,75 $... There are lots of details, which could work much better, with competent, not only friendly staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 5 days on our trip to california. Good location in Nob-Hill which is an affluent area of san fran-certainly never felt threatened in this area, a concern on some other trip advisor reports of other hotels we looked at before booking. Rooms are a bit dated, however we didn't go to sit on our hotel! Found it a good base for our stay, room offered all normal hotel things, i.e. tv, iron, hair dryer, fresh towels daily etc + also gave free internet access. Breakfast was basic coffee and pastries, although if you didn't make it early enough the pastries would be gone. We absolutely loved San Fran-loads of touristy things to do + see, wine tasting, open top bus tour, walking tour, trip to yosemite, pier 39 (defo try clam chowder mmmmm), alcatraz, great shopping, chinatown etc etc etc Just never had enough time to do it all so hope to return and would certainly stay in grosvenor suites again. Try Loris' Diner round corner and 2 blocks down towards union sq for authentic american breakfast and for a nice touch try a drink at Mark Hopkins International Hotel opposite on the top floor with lovely city views!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at this property seven times in 10 years and it has always been consistent. San Francisco can be a really expensive city to visit and frankly the chain properties are often over priced and kind of bland. The Grosvenor does a very nice job of being an independant property and balancing the needs of it's guests with the reality that it is not a chain. The property is a suite-type-hotel with a kitchen, fridge microwave and stove. It is located near the top of Nob Hill. It is a block away from the Hayes Street cable car and a short walk to Union Square. The one thing to keep in mind is that this property does have some quirks and it can look a bit dated but for the rates it is well worth over looking those little things. As for the staff, the are OK but if you engage them they will step up and shine with great advice about local eateries. The breakfast is truly continental. If you are here for more than a night, slip the breakfast lady a tip. She can be surly otherwise :-) I can not stress this enough. You will not get a better view of the city for the price. That alone and the location are the strongest assets.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">JUN 30 - JULY 3, 2007 This was our family, plus girlfriend, vacation and we were not disappointed. The rooms were clean, spacious and exactly what was represented by the on-line photos. We had a 1 bedroom suite, and a queen/queen studio. Had I known how spacious the studio was, we'd stayed in two studios...( I felt we had to have two completely seperate accomadations ) they were very spacious. Being from Georgia...I never thought about air conditioning, or rather not having it! ! But we were on floors 5 and 9, and w/ the windows open there was more than enough of a breeze to keep the rooms comfortable, even w/ hair drying and ironing. We also had great views. The public transportation was close, and nice, once we got the hang of it. (purchase the Passport). The front desk personnel was always friendly, and helpful. Just behind them was a computer w/ internet access and tourist brochures to choose from. The breakfast was sweet rolls, bagels, cold cereals, juice and coffee. We got ours to-go w/ no problem from the hostess who seemed...gruff..(?) but yet, accomadating. Would certainly stay again; wish they had sister properties in other areas!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just came back from a trip to San Francisco and stayed at the Grosvenor Suites for 3 nights. I was very pleased with my accommodations. First of all the hotel is very conveniently located - within easy walking distance of major downtown attractions - and for those who have trouble negotiating San Francisco's steep inclines, it's only one block from the Powell Street Cable Car. While the property is not brand new, it IS clean -- which is far more important to me. My room had a balcony with large windows opening on a very nice view of the financial district with the Transamerica Pyramid in the background. The room included a comfortable queen-size bed, a mid-sized love seat, dining room table (a little worse for the wear) and entertainment center with large TV. The full size refrigerator/freezer and microwave are a definite plus since I usually try to avoid eating in restaurants in order to save on food expenses. There is also a coin laundry and dry cleaning service available. Overall, for the cost - this is a great deal, and without hesitation I plan to stay here again on my next trip to San Fran, and will definitely suggest it to my friends.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is my 3rd stay at this property - and I'm still amazed that it is still such a good value. I booked through their website and with their rebate program, the total cost per night is less than $80, can't beat a deal like that - especially in SF. Pros: 1. The rooms are big. The studio that I booked is probably about 500 sqft. It's very hard to find a room that big on a Nob Hill hotel for under $100 a night. 2. Location - 1 block from both Powell and California cable car lines 3. Full kitchen - great for saving money, get some real Chinese take out from any place off Stockton and you get yourself a tasty feast. 4. Great view - I stayed at Mandarin before at their bridge-to-bridge room and it has possibly the best view in the city, but Grosvenor comes close, especially if you're on the higher floor. I stayed at the top floor on a room facing North. The view is Financial District skyline, SF bay and Coit Tower. Cons: 1. A bit old - the interior is probably an 80's vintage, so if you're looking for a luxurious room design - don't come here. 2. No safety net on balcony - it's great that some rooms have real balcony but it's a hazard for small kids</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family and I (2 adults, 2 young children) stayed for 5 days/4 nights in early August 2008. We had a wonderful stay. By far, the best features of this hotel are its location and the incredible views (it's a tall building near the top of Nob Hill). The location is perfect -- just one block from two cable car routes, only a short walk to Union Square, and only a short walk to Chinatown. We loved being in the middle of everything -- it was very convenient. The views were spectacular -- we had great views of Coit tower and the Transamerica building. We stayed in a one-bedroom suite. It had a nice kitchenette -- full sized refrigerator, stove, microwave oven, all the plates/glasses/utensils you would need. The unit was spacious. In addition to the bedroom and kitchen, there was a living area and a dining area. The rooms could use a little renovating, but it wasn't that bad. We were very happy with them. The continental breakfast was good -- bagels, pastries, donuts, cereal, coffee, juice. The wireless Internet worked great. The parking, while expensive ($35/day), was very easy and convenient. The staff was very friendly. Overall, we had great stay and would definitely recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">At first I really enjoyed this hotel. We were traveling with an infant and the kitchen area and space in the room really helped. On our last night in the hotel, we were told the water would be out for "a couple hours" for repairs. Several hours later the water was still not back on.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We are a family of three with a teenage daughter looking for separate rooms and space. Grosvenor (pronounced Grow-venor) fit the bill for us. We stayed in the one Bedroom Suite with King Bed. Located one street down from the top of Nob Hill we had a spacious, corner suite with great views on two sides and a small balcony. Union Square, Chinatown were all within walking distance (although being at the top of a hill makes the return trip harder). The location is quiet and the only noise we heard were from the steam pipes and the Powell Street cable car. We had a small kitchenette. The room was great for our purposes. The hotel is not new and has been remodeled. The result is an effect blend of old and new. It was interesting for the things not included: no free newspaper, fruit or coffee for the kitchen, pen or paper, swimming pool. Basic cable on old TV's. But those things are not important and if it helps cut the costs then I am all in favor of their choices. There was a basic buffet breakfast room - coffee, juice, fruit, croissant. Note that there is a online booking discount that you can claim on their website [--] Note that Parking is $33 per day including tax. Note you can use the Fairmont health facilities for $15 per day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">5 of us stayed on the 15th floor, corner (1503) with 2 queens and a sofa bed. I was a bit dismayed by the drabness of the rooms and dirty carpet, but praise the location, the view, the helpfullness of the staff, the spaciousness of the living room, the full kitchen/dining area and the view, the view and the view. We had very warm days and cool nights, so found it nice at night, in spite of the city noise-loved to hear the cable car bell. The Powell (Hyde or Mason) Cable car stop is a block down a decent hill and the Mark Hopkins is directly across the street up a very steep hill. It costs about $8+ for a taxi from the Wharf and about $40-45 to the airport. You are 5 minutes away from Sears (for breakfast, even during lunch) and the shopping at Union Sq. and about the same from Chinatown. The wharf is better reached via Cable Car, trolley (from Powell/Market), taxi or bus. It is very doable (no hills) by walking to Chinatown, then through little Italy, but can be long. Our stay, with the on-line rebate averaged $200 a night, a steal in this city. I wish it had been better updated, the carpet scared me. I would recommend to families on a budget who want to stay on Nob Hill. The kitchen was great for bringing back cracked crabs and enjoying them in the room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We don't like confined, air conditioned, boxed in hotel rooms, so after a lot of internet searching we were so glad we found Grosvenor Suites for the 3 of us. I don't think there are many apartments in San Francisco!!. It is an average size one bedroom apartment - separate bedroom, comfortable sofa bed in the lounge, kitchen facilities and most important - a balcony with a great view and fresh air!!! We had a large corner suite on a very top floor. The staff were helpful, the cable car is 2 minutes walk away, there are lots of restaurants in the vicinity, and also convenience/grocery stores. At the end of a hectic day of sightseeing it was great to come back to the space and comfort of the Grosvenor suites and have a drink on the balcony, taking in the great view, before going out to dinner. We stayed in similar places in Los Angeles (Magic Castle Hotel) and Las Vegas (Desert Rose Inn) which were also apartments with a balcony, and although they weren't as expensive as Grosvenor, I guess that it because it is San Francisco. Anyhow I think it was on par dollar wise with a hotel room which would not have given us the space and comfort that the 3 of us wished. So we highly recommend this to those of you who don't like hotels!!. Thankyou. The Andersons, NSW, Australia.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 4 nights 11-15 OCT in a 1 BR apt. 18th Floor and had a smooth stay. Great views of the bay. We were lucky that it was fleet week and could see the aircrafts zoom past from our window, not to mention the fireworks at night! Agreed that the bathroom was small but that is a small price to pay for its fantastic location. After hearing all sorts of stories about so many locations, this was was perfect. Situated a block from the Intercon / Fairmont on nob hill, posh area, we felt safe and could walk to china town/union square etc. Agreed that the hotel is on a slope and the upward walk can be hard, but only if you have any knee probs. Overall a good choice, especially if with family. We like spacious rooms so this was a treat. The breakfast could do with a few additions but for a start its not bad. We saw people Q-ing up for BF on the restaurants rond the corner so whatever little we got, was sufficient to kick start yoyur day. The rooms were clean and the reception staff was friendly. The tram is also round the corner to take you to the wharf/union Sq. I would defi recomend this place for a central location and the luxury of space for the price it charges! We would defi stay there whenever we go back to SFO! Do keep a map with you and know your surroundings as it all depends on what you a re looking for. The wharf was so crowded and touristy, so this area was good for us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Even if it calls itself a luxury accommodation in San Francisco I’d be careful to consider it that way. It is a good accommodation but far from a luxury one. A 20 story building not far from the center where many things in the apartment look old. For our four days stay we had a clean and large apartment which could accommodate four people in two comfortable queen size beds. Two large windows with a view on the far bay, a clean bathroom and a small kitchen. Unfortunately the kitchen was very poorly equipped: just the basic utensils. They may not expect people eating in the apartment. If you think to eat there or want to stay more than few days, check your necessities and ask or what your kitchen lacks (we had two chairs for four people). The apartment had plenty of room for storing the baggage, in room wifi and complimentary breakfast. For the breakfast this accommodation is not a luxury one. The breakfast room is too small being a one room apartment now adapted to breakfast room. Be ready not to find seats if you arrive when the four tables (yes, just four) are occupied. The choice is not large and not completely self service. You must ask for bagels and muffins while you help yourself for cheese, butter, jam and drinks. As you see breakfast without pancakes, eggs and bacon. Anyway if you accept its limits and check carefully if its prices are good Grosvenor could be a convenient choice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed for 7 days while attending a conference at the Moscone Center. The Grosvenor suits in a in fabulous location on Nob Hill. Safe neighbourhood and only a block to a cable car line, a 6 minute walk downhill to Union Square and about 15 minutes to the Moscone Center. It is certainly tired and somewhat shabby but still decent. Decor was once very nice but now dated. Suites are serviced daily, the kitchen cabinetry has been updated even though the stove is old. Kitchens have a full size fridge. The kitchen was very poorly equipped with only one very large saucepan and fry pan - and only a few utensils so any serious meal preparation was not practical. The weather was mild during my stay which was fortunate as there was NO airconditioning and the baseboard heating looked as though it probably didnt function. There was a pedestal fan in the hall cupboard. Staff were very helpful and friendly. I didnt partake of the continental breakfast so cant comment. The basement has a row of new & clean commercial washing and drying machines. Very reasonable rates for using these machines. There are also snack vending machines down there The other advantage is that it has plenty of off street PARKING. $35,00 per day but worth it in this city where parking is very difficult in most areas. Would I stay there again? Most likely - if it wasnt high summer or mid winter. Despite its drawbacks, I thought it good value in an expensive city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My spouse and I, and our 2 kids, ages 1 and 4, stayed in a 1 bedroom suite at Grosvenor Suites March 11-13, 2009. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. A crib was provided for our little guy. The 18th floor suite (of 19 floors) was spacious, and had wonderful views of the city skyline. The king bed was comfortable. The pullout sofa in the living room was ok, given that it is a sofabed. The suite was quiet too. Free continental breakfast was basic; juice, pastries, apples, coffee. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful with info about cable cars. When we paused out front of the hotel to determine if we had the right place and to figure out where to park, the hotel asst. manager came out and gave us a parking pass, so that we could park at the hotel prior to checkin...excellent! The suite was clean, though the carpet appears to be somewhat dated. The kitchen was well stocked for cooking. There is access to laundry in the hotel, though we didn't use it. There is also a vending machine for snacks and a small grocery store nearby. The hotel is centrally located. It is only 1 block to either the powell st cable car line or the california st cable car line. It is also only a couple of blocks walk from China town for great shopping! Overall we had a really good experience at this hotel, and we would definitely return in the future. Be sure to take advantage of the rebate program...the value can't be beat in the Nob Hill area of San Fran!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I love to stay at this older hotel in San Francisco. It is an older property, and not a 4 star hotel, but very clean and comfortable. Loads of hot water, with good pressure. They have a free, continental breakfast. The rooms are big, and there is a real, but small kitchen in the room, including coffee maker, pans, cutlery and dish soap. There are 4 grocers in the 2 block radius. We shop, then pack our own string bag snacks/ lunches while we see the city. (China town is a fast cable car ride away, and the food and fruits are wonderful, and CHEAP.) Often, when the kids are tired, we order in pizza,Asian, or Italian food, and have our own wine, soft drinks, and desserts out of our kitchen. It saves a fortune over a 9 day vacation. It saves a ton of time, while visiting the city. You can make yourself a full, hot breakfast/lunch/dinner, or store and reheat leftovers from area restaurants. We and make hot brownies and ice cream for an evening TV snack. There is a kitchen table, too, so the kids don't have to eat in bed. Bathrooms have great storage, and there are huge closets, so when you stay for a week, the rooms feel spacious and tidy. It is also on the cable car line, just walk to the corner. The hotel is quiet, and in a very safe area. The staff is very helpful, and the elevators are quick. The only possible downside? The rooms windows actually open , which I love, but it could be a problem if you have toddlers who like to climb.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had crawled all over hotel reviews for San Francisco. I came across pretty good reviews for this hotel and when comparing them to my budget, I decided to take the chance. It was just my husband and I for a little bit of business and a ton of pleasure. We spent the extra $10 a day for the corner suite. TOTALLY worth it. We had 90 degrees of floor to ceiling windows and a tiny balcony. The full kitchen was so nice to have and made leftovers an option from all of the incredible restaurants we dined at. The first thing my husband said was, "Wow. We have a hallway on the inside of our door." The size was amazing. We had friends paying double what we did for a room at the Grand Hyatt. They had a tiny bathroom and tiny bedroom. We had a tiny kitchen, tiny balcony, small bathroom, small dining area, huge living room, tons of closet space and a decent sized bedroom. Everything was incredibly clean. It was like when I would stay at my grandmas. The furnishings were outdated, but SUPER clean. I'll take that with space to move about over brand new, tiny and overpriced with a fancy lobby. The location was incredible. We were literally a block from the trolley's and walking distance to several options for food, shopping and entertainment. I can not recommend this place enough. We could have easily had 4 adults, more with the roll-a-bed that they charge $10 a day for. If you're staying more than a day, do yourself a favor and book your trip here. You will not be disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of 4 (2 kids 11 and 16) stayed at Grosvenor Suites for a week in August 2011. We had room 1703 - a one bedroom suite with 2 queen beds, a pull out couch in the living room, kitchen and dining table. We had two TV's and the hotel has free WIFI. Also there is a coin operated washer/dryer in the hotel. The room had super views on 2 sides and windows that actually open - we could see the ocean from our room. I didn't realize when I booked that there was breakfast every morning (cereal, bagels pastries, fruit) which helped to cut down on restaurant meals. The kitchen was great for keeping some snacks for the kids and heating up leftovers. The best thing about this hotel is the size of the room, the location and the price. It is a short downhill walk to Union Square and Westhill Mall. One block to Cable Cars. We walked to Union Square and the mall several times to shop. Once we caught the F train to Fisherman's Wharf and another time we took a city bus from Union Square to Golden Gate Park. The hotel is located only a few blocks from Chinatown. The only downside to the hotel is that there isn't a pool which I think is quite common in San Fransisco. Also - the rooms are dated, so if you really need the hotel to be modern with all of the newest furniture, granite countertops then this place isn't for you. The hotel was clean, comfortable and was reasonably priced. The staff were super helpful by giving directions and booking us a cab to the airport (45.00 from hotel to airport).</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Large suite, good value & location”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Located 4 very steep blocks from Union Square, I thought Saturday night for $159 minus the AAA discount was a good value. Parking was rather expensive at $35 plus tax. The staff was not particularly helpful. The continental breakfast was a little disappointing with just pastries, bagels, cold cereal, bananas, apples, coffee, milk, and juice. We booked a two room Junior Suite with a queen bed, but were sent to a one room Studio Suite initially. We complained and were assigned another room without an apology or comment from the desk clerk. I believe we were given a Corner one Bedroom Suite because it contained a King bed. The suite was very large and comfortable. The bedroom could be separated from the living area by closing the doors. The bathroom could be accessed without entering the bedroom. The kitchenette was small but well equipped with a stove, microwave & large refrigerator, plus pots, pans, dishes, glasses and silverware. The furniture was comfortable, but worn and scuffed. It did not appear particularly clean. The free WiFi was adequate at 2.5Mbps. The only problem was regulating the temperature. Despite weather in the 50's, the room was uncomfortably warm when we entered. Opening the windows helped some, but there was no central unit to circulate the air. Upon check out we were informed that we could have requested a fan. We had a nice view from the 14th floor, but the traffic noise was bothersome if we left the window open to cool the room at night while trying to go to sleep.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at this property numerous times, both for business and pleasure, because of its outstanding views, well-maintained efficiency suites (it is an old apartment converted to hotel), and high value. I am not an overly picky traveler, but I appreciate good value in all aspects of a hotel. It had been a couple of years since my last visit, but this time the furniture and carpet were worn (literally threadbare), the walls were bare of any art save the entryway, and the whole place needed a deep cleaning. Quite frankly, it just felt ratty. The refrigerator had been wedged into its spot in the kitchenette so tightly that the door would not close all the way without leaning all of my 6'2" 180 lb weight on it. The wireless internet system went down right as I was about to settle down to business and never came back up. Also, the TV had more non-English than English stations and none of the usual fare travellers expect (i.e., CNN, Fox, ESPN, Weather Channel, etc.). The view (a panaorama of the city if you are fortunate enough to get one of the upper floors) obviously remains a strength. The staff is quite friendly and helpful, and was able to make up for some of the slippage I experienced, but you get the impression that the staff is trying hard to turn sow's ear into a silk purse. i sincerely hope that the hotel can regain its old form, but for now, there are too many wonderful boutique hotels in San Francisco to waste time on this one. I am checking out four days early in search of better quarters.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “We said we'd love to and we did come back”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After a lovely stay in 2003 we said we'd love to come back and we did in April 2005 for 14 days. We had a two queen bedroom, corner suite on the 15th floor with stunning views which provided a great backdrop for breakfast. The rooms in the suite were spacious, clean and tidy. The suite was cleaned and had the beds made each day. The kitchenette was useful again for a morning tea or an evening coffee and to warm milk for our children (using the microwave oven). We had a problem with our fridge/freezer and the staff sorted this out quickly. The bathroom was small, but met every requirement one would have for such a room - washbasin, bath, shower, shaving point, seating area with flush facility. After all its not like your visiting San Francisco to spend all the time in your bathroom! The deskstaff were, as before, helpful and friendly always having time to talk to the kids or the grown-ups. Tips on where best to eat were as good as before, though some of the venues recommended had changed since our last visit. The staff were also very happy to guide the visitor around the city providing a take-away map for added assistance. Parking was $25 + tax per day, but this is not unreasonable for the city. The free internet access was a very useful. The complimentary breakfast was a bonus and, as it is free, can be passed over if one feels the need of a more substantial breakfast. Don and the team at the Grosvenor Suites have done it again for us. We would love to come back again, I just hope we can make it, at least, one more time.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I can honestly say that I have never had such mixed feelings about any place my family has visited. There is so much about the Grosvenor that is simply 5 star: unbelievable views that any top of the line hotel would die for; nice layout of a small one bedroom apartment that was more than spacious for three of us; some tasteful updates like granite and modern fixtures in the very small bathroom; a fabulous location that really makes it easy to take advantage of everything San Francisco offers. And then there are some things that are strictly 1 star: chipped paint on window sills that have been repaired with mismatched paint; a crack in the window; tears in the linings of drapes; grimy door and window jambs; piled on grease on the exhaust fan in the kitchenette (so much that I wouldn't use the rangetop); a really suspect bedspread; broken heating covers. If it had not been for the 5 star elements, we would have checked out instantly. Gratefully, Housekeeping did an awesome job with daily cleaning, but really basic, quality maintenance is needed. Another reviewer said that this is not a luxury hotel and that is right on the money. The lovely rooms shown on their website are long term rentals only so be prepared for something less. If the units are maintained as they should be, there is no question that the Grosvernor Suites would be the best deal in town. I guess the bottom line is: would we stay again? ONLY if I researched all other options, and had the assurance from management that we would once again have the incredible views that make up for the inside of the unit.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">sorry folks, the grosvenor is just plain....gross! surprised this place is getting any positive reviews. on the plus side, the rates are cheaper than most hotels in the area (you'll see why when you get there), and the rooms are larger than most in the area. that's about it. this place is a dump. do not believe the pictures on their website because that is not what your room will look like. from the minute we walked in, i knew we had been had. the "lobby" consisted of a beat up wooden unmanned check-in desk. when i made our reservation, i had requested to be placed in one of the "renovated" rooms (as seen on the website" and was not told that would be a problem. after we checked in to our large but dirty and dilapidated "suite" i asked the clerk why we weren't placed in one of the renovated rooms and was rudely informed that the renovated rooms were solely for monthly apartment renters!! again, their website shows nicely renovated rooms and makes no mention of the fact that your room will actually be old and disgusting. there were 4 to 6 inch holes along the bottom of the walls where some types of pipes were running. carpet and bed linens looked like they hadn't been changed since the 70's. the couch and tables looked like they were taken from a dumpster. there is no AC and the windows dont shut tight so the rooms are very noisy. we were booked for 3 nights but checked out the next morning and promptly moved to a better hotel. this hotel could be renovated modestly into a nice, clean property with spacious rooms but until then, this place has seen better days and apparently those days were a long time ago.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We really enjoyed our stay here - the view from the 15th floor, while not of the Golden Gate, was wonderful, and the location rocked for taking the kids on cable-cars to Fisherman's Wharf, Ghiradelli Square, and walking to Union Square and Market Street and SoMa. It's within a couple blocks of the Ritz and the Fairmont, so a safe neighborhood (though don't stay here if you can't walk on hills! It's at the top of everything.) Close enough to walk over to Dottie's True Blue Cafe (get there before 8 or after 9!), which makes breakfast much more fun (though we also took advantage of included bagels and cereal and juice at the hotel). Beds weren't overly luxurious, but very comfortable - we had two queens and a fold-out sofa bed that wouldn't work for adults or teens, probably, but was great for our 8- and 6-year olds. It was SO helpful having the little kitchenette, 4-person kitchen table, enough room to spread out our things, and a bedroom with a door to close - you won't get that many places in SF. We found it beat renting an apartment because the service and help of a hotel is so useful. We used the house computer as well as the included Wi-Fi, both were great. Staff was genuinely enthusiastic and helpful and nice to our kids, which we appreciate. The rooms are clean and perfectly attractive but a little beaten-down by time around the edges, which we were just fine with, even though I'm usually very picky about decor. Only actual complaint was that hot water could be a bit waffly - there was plenty, and very hot, but it was hard to get a good, regular mix in the shower. Parking was $35 a night, so be forewarned, but there's no searching on the street or tickets, so we were fine with that, too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a fantastic trip around california, we booked the Grosvenor after much searching and obviously reading the reviews on here. We were on a tight budget so this hotel fitted well for us. Upon arrival the hotel staff we very helpful in getting our parking sorted and we checked in with no problems. I think as long as you remember what you are paying for this hotel then its just fine. The breakfast is actually pretty good, the room is small where it is served but you can take it up to your room. We ate there every morning and enjoyed it, coffee is good and you can have cereals, bagels, fruit and juice. As many others have said the location is great, easy walk down to Union Sq. obviously coming back up the hill is a bit more of a struggle for those unfit like me! But you can easily jump on a cable car. We only had the smallest room, the studio. You get a large bed, a table with 2 chairs, a sofa and a kitchenette with fridge, cooker, sink etc. The only thing I would say is that the interior of this hotel is dated and so are the rooms, everything is very old but considering what you are paying I think its fine. If it was top notch then the room rate would be massively higher! Only thing I would be aware of when staying here or any of the hotels in central SF is the cost of parking! Think it was about $30 plus per day, so adds up if you are there for a while. My advice would be to only have a car when you are doing day trips out of the city as you don't really need one for all the central stuff as the cable cars do the job well plus you get to take in the atmosphere. Last thing to say is I thought the staff at this hotel were great, and really helpful. would recommend for those on a budget</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed on the 19th floor in the corner one-bedroom suite. This is room 1909. My room was spacious and nicely decorated. I am a college kid so I am really not to picky, but i peeped in a smaller room and would have to stay I would not stay in anything but a one-bedroom suite. A real plus about the room was that it contained a nice sized fridge with freezer, stove, oven and microwave as well as untensils and glassware, etc. We brought food back every night and made plenty of drinks in the room. The view from the blacony of downtown was absolutely fabulous. I would not say in this hotel unless you are in one of the rooms facing downtown with a balcony either, it makes it all worth it. The tv's are a bit old and the bathroom a little small, but there are 70 channels and the water is steaming hot with a nice showerhead. Those are the biggest complaints I have of the room. Great location right off the bay bridge, easy routes to pier and wharf, and plenty of restaurants and shopping within walking distance, but the streets in san francisco as you should know can be like climbing a mountain. The continental breakfast was like any other continental breakfast, muffins, bagels, donuts and coffee and orange juice. So don't expect anything special. Compared with the prices for other hotels in the area, I would have to say this place is great. If you're looking for something special the Ritz and the Mark are right down the street this is for budget minded folks. I almost forgot we stayed in November and it got a bit cold, we went for the thermostat to find out there was no heat or A/C in the whole building. With a sweater on we were perfectly fine, but i would count on a summer stay being uncomfortably warm and would look to stay elsewhere.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked in here after reading mainly positive reviews of the hotel and was impressed. The reception staff were very helpful with local info and routes/transport ideas. This was backed up with a small area next to the internet terminals in the lobby which held travel brochures and booklets for days out. Anyone that that says this is a terrible hotel should do a bit more travelling to gain some perspective on the age old formula of service/location/rooms and price. The Grosvenor Suites scores fairly well on most points for us and very high for service. At checkout the staff overheard that we needed to get to Emeryville (about half an hour away) and one of them volunteered to take us in his own car. Top service we reckon. Yes the rooms are a tad old fashioned, but ours was clean and very spacious with separate lounge and a small kitchenette area. See the attached pics for a better idea of the place. Breakfast was good and the staff were making the most of the room available. Some folk (including ourselves) took the food back up to our room to give others a bit more space. The hotel was the best location to catch a trolley down to the sea front, only about half a block to the nearest trolley stop. Also close by were two delis, one to the left and the other to the right out of the hotel entrance. Both did excellent sandwiches for you night time munchies. A little further afield was Chinatown and Union Square, both about a 15 minute walk if you amble along gawking at the sights. Take a look at our travel map, we joined TA late in life and only review the places we have been since then. But, you can see that there is a good chance we know a decent hotel when we stay in one. The Grosvenor Suites is somewhere that we will definitely recommend to the discerning, budget conscious traveller.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent 4 nights at Grosvenor Suites for my birthday. Book directly through the hotel website for their online discount and you are basically getting the 14% hotel tax paid for which is a great value. I booked a one bedroom king bed suite and noted it was my birthday and I was a return guest. Upon check-in my partner and I were greeted by Barbara at the Front Desk who was extremely helpful the last time I stayed there and was wonderful with a "welcome back" and "happy birthday". They had blocked us on the highest floor (1909) and when we walked into our suite we were pleasantly surprised with a nice foyer with huge coat closet and in-room safe, the bedroom had two hanging closets and a built in wall dresser with TV, beautifully appointed bathroom with the great little "closet" for your toiletries so it doesn't clutter the sink area, living and dining room that were very nice, nothing overly elaborate but comfortable and had a homey feel. The full kitchen was nice for beverage storage and warming up things, it being my birthday there was no cooking! View my pictures for the views, spectacular! Grosvenor Suites is for those of us who just want clean, comfortable and very afforable accommodations with a great service from a nice and friendly staff. The only small complaint was that the weather was warmer than usual and even though we turned the heat controls all the way down it still was warmer than we wanted in the suite, but the windows and balcony door all opened so that was an easy remedy. They now offer wireless internet service and it worked fine most of the time, it sometimes would disconnect and reconnect but it was free. Breakfast is ample and basic, a great way to start the day. I love this hotel, will be back whenever I visit SF and recommend it to all of my friends and colleagues. Grosvenor Suites is a true gem on Nob Hill!</p></li>

<li>The only small complaint was that the weather was warmer than usual and even though we turned the heat controls all the way down it still was warmer than we wanted in the suite, but the windows and balcony door all opened so that was an easy remedy.</br></br></li>
<li>They now offer wireless internet service and it worked fine most of the time, it sometimes would disconnect and reconnect but it was free.</br></br></li>

<li>I love this hotel, will be back whenever I visit SF and recommend it to all of my friends and colleagues.</br></br></li>
<li>Grosvenor Suites is a true gem on Nob Hill!</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I arrived at the Grosvenor with three colleagues from work (a nonprofit with limited budget), and when the young girl at the front desk lost our president's reservation and then made a wry joke about our organization's name, I knew we were in for a treat. Later that week, my boyfriend checked in to find the staff chasing a hummingbird around the tiny lobby, and there was one well-meaning but slightly loony girl at the desk who talks to herself in such an animated, confused way that I couldn't help but enjoy watching her run around looking for my checked bag. The important things are all covered: friendly staff, clean linens & bathroom, great location, and larger suites than you expect for the price. The Grosvenor seems something of a luxury dinosaur--the mirrored walls at the end of each hallway once made sense, and the carpeting was probably more plush. But that's alright, so long as the worn edges are also clean, and they are. With its Nob Hill location, it also boasts terrific views, especially in their large corner suites up higher than the 13th floor or so. (Other old hotel bonuses: windows that really open, with no screens, and honest to God balconies way up in the air. Suicidal maniacs are welcome, I guess.) The only concern you may have as a traveler with a computer is the up-and-down wi-fi. It worked for the first two hours after I arrived, and was up again the next day after a repairman made a visit. Then it was down again in the next day. The staff on hand don't seem tech savvy, and on a Sunday they say they can't get someone in to fix it. (Thankfully there is a cafe with free wi-fi about six blocks away called Cup-A-Joe.) All in all, the Grosvenor is a great deal for family or non-business travel. The wi-fi problem is a big one for those attached to email, and it's a bit too scruffy around the edges to impress most business--or spoilt--travelers.</p></li>
