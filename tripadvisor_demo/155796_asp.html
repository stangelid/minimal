I don't give it 5 stars just because the rooms feel cold: very big, but with lack of decoration ( I like cozzy environments). The mexican restaurant was pretty good and not too expensive.</p></li>

It is a 1960's hotel with 1960's furniture and the hardest beds on the planet. There is nothing to do and no where to go after dark. I guess there are few choices in the area but either stay anywhere else or go to another town. This post is the best thing I can do for fellow travelers.</p></li>

The rooms were clean and spacious. The pool was always clean and warm. The staff was friendly and the food at the Blue Iguana was great. Just beware of Fajardo drivers! We also booked a sailing charter with Captain Mingo on the Getaway and it was fantastic!!! Hotels in PR are expensive - this was a great mid-price alternative!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our one night stay at Fajardo Inn was not terrible, but nothing spectacular. The sheets in the room were thin, the bathroom poorly lighted and dirty. No restaurants nearby except the ones located inside the Inn. The neighborhood surrounding the Inn is run down and honestly, scary. Although we never used the pool, it seemed very nice. Our GPS could not find the address of the hotel, but there are signs pointing the way to it, which happens to be the only hotel in Fajardo.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Many excellent common use facilities at this hotel, including two good size pools, basketball court, miniature golf, tennis court, small zoo, good size gym. The room I stayed was poor, tiny vanity top that not enough place to put towels and necessary person items. Really poor design. Expensive room charged in low season, I saw only single digit cars parked there. The owner of this large hotel has no idea to lower its charge to attract more local visitors during low season.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Fajardo Inn last week for two nights and paid $90 USD per night. For Puerto Rican hotels this is a very good price in high season. As a budget traveller with a spouse, I was looking for an inexpensive, clean, safe hotel and Fajardo Inn is just the right place. We were given a room with fantastic view of the ocean and El Yunque mountains, which made our stay even more pleasurable. The hotel is NOT luxurious, it is not a resort. It is for people looking for a simple, clean place to stay at.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Jan. 26th, 2007. We rented four rooms for one night and wish we could have stayed longer.

I do wish the pool bar, lower level was open and the hours extended at least for adults. I do feel the Starfish restaurant is over priced but the Blue Iguana restaurant is priced very well. This was a post cruise stay and we were happy with the Fajardo Inn.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Fajardo Inn for a couple nights before departing to Culebra. The rooms were clean and spacious and the kitchenettes in the rooms were great. The workout area was fantastic - also well equipped and very clean and open. The only downside was the requirement to pay to use the workout area if you stayed less than 3 nights. The hotel pool is like the rooms and workout area -- well equipped with lounge chairs and tables and also very clean and spacious. We would definitely recommend this hotel.</p></li>

Really?? Otherwise, beautiful pool - but not too many eating choices - just Mexican - that's it. Fajardo itself is another story. Very run down and poor area. People live in beat up old shacks.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Would definitely not go back. We stayed for a week and the entire time I woke up with new bites on my arms, legs and torso. If you stay here, check for bed bugs before you sleep in the room and be sure to bring some anti-itch cream just in case and some benadryl to help sleep at night. It took a week before I actually got rid of these bites too. On the plus side, the hotel was incredibly quiet (as there were very few people there) and the pool was large.

Put-Put golf, two pools -one standard and the other with a river, slide, basketball and jacuzzi, a playground, a large aviary, two restaurants and a very nice work-out room. To get to the beach, you have to drive about 5 minutes, which we did. We also went to the Conquistador resort nearby for lunch. Our room with a small balcony was $140 for two. It would be a good place to stay with kids for a day or two before catching the Fajardo ferry to Culebra or Vieques.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed one night, 1/23/12 t0 1/24/12. Views from Inn swere awesome. Beautiful, clean comfortable place. Staff was very friendly & accommodating. Ordered a late supper from one of their restaurants the Blue Iguana Mexican Grill & Bar. Food was Tex-Mex/Mexican and was very good. Their other restaurant the Starfish, which serves P.R. fare was closed when we were there. Would stay there again. The Inn was close to the El Yungue Rainforest & the Laguna Grande (Bioluminiscent Bay). These two places were the reason we traveled from Guayanilla to Fajardo.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were a bit concerned, reading some reviews, I have never reviewed before, but felt compelled to tell others what a great hotel this is! The location is perfect if you want to explore Loquillo, El Yunque, local beaches and the Bio Bay. You MUST have a car. The restuarants were pricey and service a bit slow, but you can easily drive a few miles route 987 - to many loocal options. The staff were helpful and the room was fine, not fancy, but certainly better than expected. The pools are wonderful, clay tennis courts, basketball court and miniature golf were great extras.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved the Inn. The rooms were clean and spacious, nothing fancy but had what we needed--TV, fridge, Wifi in the lobby, good bathroom. Surprisingly, the two restaurants and one bar on site were great--also the hotel gave each of us a free drink for each night we were there. The pool is really cool, having a little lagoon and slide for kids, plus they have a hidden birdcage full of macaws. Fajardo itself is a little hairy to navigate, but if you want to be close to the fun of the East Coast I'd recommend staying there. Staff is very friendly too. Will recommend it to our friends and family!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is quite nice. The rooms are large, and beds comfortable. They also have laundry facilities on site, which makes it very nice if you're changing hotels every day. The downside is that there are no elevators, however they do have a sign up that if you need help with your bags----ask. Getting morning coffee means walking downstairs and waiting in the restaurant. I tried the Mexican restaurant on site--The Blue Iguana, and found their food excellent, and very reasonably priced. (Under 10.00) The front desk staff was exceptional, and very helpful. I will go back, but will bring a coffeemaker.</p></li>

The rates are very appropriate and the front desk is capable and willing to assist with business needs.

To make the matter worse was the manager's response that these ants don't bite. I was also very concerned about my luggage and clothes since I had them in the room. When I explained my concern, the manager simply ignored it. I don't know if I was more disgusted by her attitude and indifference towards her customer or the "ants room" itself. Needless to say, I checked out Fajardo Inn even though it was 10:30pm at night, trying to get away from this nightmare as far away as I can.</p></li>

Location - close to ferry terminal. Away from traffic congested areas of San Juan. Cons: Location - too far from the ocean, not much entertainment. Food choice - not much variety. Service - too many hotel employees doing basic chores in sight can get annoying. I prefer invisible service. Also, yellow "caution wet floor" cones in the corridors seem to be placed there permanently, which distorts otherwise nice interiors of the hotel.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I recently stayed at the Fajardo Inn and had a great time. The location is ideal for reaching the port (for ferries to Culebra and Vieques) and is also fairly close to El Yunque. We enjoyed the lovely pool with the slide and the mini golf! The restaurant was pretty good (we didn't eat at the seafood place, it looked good but it was pricey). The only complaint I have is there was no fridge in our room. That would have been handy. There is a coffee maker, although you have to buy coffee at the front desk. The fridge was a minor complaint in what was otherwise a very fun stay. Given its price, I was very pleasantly surprised.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Fajardo Inn is a welcome oasis in a superb location. The room and bathroom were both huge and very comfortable. The staff members were extremely helpful in every way. The pools are gorgeous! The grounds are lush and well-maintained. It was great to have two restaurants on the premises. About the only "complaint" that I have is that the quality of the food in the restaurants was not the best, but it was adequate. If they offered a breakfast buffet, that would have been ideal. The room had a fridge, so we went to the supermarket and bought our own breakfast items. At this time there is no wi-fi in the rooms and the business center has internet, for a price.</p></li>

It is very clean, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the new pool is the best. The savings for us were the best. We were able to choose restaurants outside of the hotel and come and go as we pleased. At $105.00 per night we had ample space, a balcony, views of the Caribbean, and a small kitchen with microwave and fridge and a sink and service for two. The ferry to Vieques and Culebra are 4 minutes away, Gambling is 10 minutes. and two of the best restaurants we've ever been to are maybe 6 minutes. Pasion de fogon, and Ola-ola great tapas.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hmmm...Where should I start. The rooms were mosquito invested. When asked for more towels and wash cloths, we were only given ONE for myself and my husband. The website is misleading and looks nothing like a paradise and more like a run down motel you see on the side of a highway. There were ants all over the room, the lighting was horribly dim, the safe in our room broken and the pool was disgusting and not cleaned properly. The hotel is located in the ghetto of Farjado so beware........Oh and did I forget bars on the windows and the food and service in the restaurants were TERRIBLE, slow and matter-of-fact. I could go on and on. Don't stay here unless you have to.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Michelle and I stayed at the Fajardo Inn for a week. The room smelled damp upon arrival but that should be expected in the Caribbean. We opened the windows and everything was fine. The rooms are clean, spacious, comfortable and nicely appointed. The views of the countryside and ocean are breathtaking. The staff is friendly and helpful. The location is ideal for exploring Puerto Rico. The hotel is sItuated a short distance from the ferry to the islands of Culebra and Vieques. it is also close to El Yunque which is the only rainforest in the national park system. The fitness center is state of the art and the pools are nice. All told, this is the best choice in Fajardo. Mark and Michelle i</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Missing Rest and Relaxation only because there is so much to do in the area, the hotel is conveniently located. The hotel was pleasant and clean... and the price was excellent. The wait staff was hmmm... I'll try to explain. Single men are attended to VERY well by a long haired, usually pony tailed waitress/bartender who is above and beyond flirtatious with the men, this I did witness first hand over a period of a week. Single men traveling there will do quite well, no waiting for drinks as another reviewer had mentioned earlier, no rudeness to the men from the long haired waitress. The rest of the staff was very good. Food service was slow during breakfast but no fault of the wait staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a true gem of a hotel - it would be called a resort any where else. Not once have I been dissatisfied with my stay here. The rooms are clean and comfortable. There are two swimming pools which are immaculate and rarely crowded. Hotel staff are friendly and helpful. There are two restaurants on site, unfortunately not much diversity of selection and no restaurant for breakfast or lunch. But there are plenty of restaurants in the area. It is minutes from the Ferry that goes to Culebra and Vieques, only 45 minutes from San Juan. There is definitely a need for a car here, but a car is needed if you plan to stay in Fajardo. I have no reservations whatsoever in recommending The Fajardo Inn.</p></li>

The hotel is pretty, clean and the pool is great!!! The beds are reallyyyyyy comfortable and the rooms are big. The only bad thing that happen was that somebody stole my professional blower and my hair iron. When I got home I stated to look for then and they where not in the suitcase,I call the hotel manager right away They told me They would call back and I never receive their call back. Is a shame that such a beautiful hotel employs people that do this kind of stuff to the clients. The hotels try to charge you for everything that you do, but but when is all the way around they are not responsables. ??????</p></li>

TV was a bit outdated though. My only complain is that the Air Conditioner was leaking. It also has a very nice pool that kids and adults would love. Oh...the woman working as pool attendant was quite rude...there was an open gate and we didn't knew we couldn't enter going through there and she was implying we opened the gate when we didn't.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I thoroughly enjoyed my one-night stay at The Fajardo Inn. It is perched on a hilltop slightly outside of Fajardo with views of the rainforest and the beach. The two pools, gym, and mini-putt course seemed very well maintained when we were there. The room was spacious, the bed was comfortable, and it was a 5-minute drive from our BioBay tour that night. It is a little far from Fajardo proper, if you want to go into the town. The prices at the two restaurants on-campus were a little higher than normal, but you have to expect that if the hotel has its own restaurants. The food and drinks were good, and the service was about par for the course for restaurants in Puerto Rico. Really enjoyed my experience at The Fajardo Inn.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Love this hotel. Great price, magnificent views of the ocean and rainforest. Very nice and accomodating staff. Loved the breakfast in the restaurant. The Blue Iguana had awesome food(nice presentations), fun atmosphere, pool tables, it was also nicely decorated. The pool area was very relaxing, never more than 10 people,usually less than 5. We saw the almost completed new pool area, it is going to be outrageous!The only complaint is that the sheets kept coming off the bed, like they were too small. The comforter was pretty badly stained also.Don't stay in the guest houses, they may be $20 cheaper, but it seems like another hotel. Rooms are completely run down. Make sure to stay in the main hotel, and you'll be very satisfied.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Fajardo Inn wasn't close to much. There was a bar a little ways away. 20 min walk if I remember correctly. No continental breakfast, but they did have a restaurant downstairs. Went there quite a few times. We had to take a cab just to get to the beach, and we all felt like fish out of water there. When we went snorkeling we went with the company East Wind. Also went to see the Bio-Bay that night. Catamaran and 2 or 3 snorkeling spots. We also saw a whale while on the catamaran. Definitely bring sunscreen! Pools were very nice. They have a bird cage next to the second pool that's down from the first. The swim up bar was not in service when we were there, or they just stopped running it. Very good place to tan...or get burnt.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice looking hotel, the front desk staff were very nice, I did encounter a real problem with the Mexican restaurant/Bar downstairs, I had to wait 20 min to have someone get me a table..even though the place was empty...another 20 to get the waitress to get my order. (no exageration) Then to top it off the food was horrible, So when I said I want my money back, they got a rude, So I ask for the manager and explained the situation, she was not so pleasant herself. I am not really a picky person, but this was the worst restaurant service I have ever encoutered...Another tip...be careful if getting to this Hotel at night time if you miss the Blue Hotel sign to turn into the hotel you will end up in the Ghetto that it is right next to the Hotel..</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here during February vacation week and it was not crowded. The location is not near the beach so a one night stay was fine. We went out and explored the area, visited the rainforest and ate in a small restaurant by the bay. The room was large, with a balcony overlooking the area. The ac was strong. The water for the jacuzzi took at least 10 minutes to get hot so don't give up. We had only a snack and drink at the bar, our waitress was very friendly. One pool was closed but the larger one was delightful. Check in was not until 4:00 and they made us wait until then even though the inn was mostly empty. By that time towels were not avaiable at the pool so bring your own from the room. Construction on site is a nuisance but that is unavoidable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is OK for the price. But, I would recommend staying at the El Conquistador, which is only a little bit more expensive (depending on the season). The staff isn't exactly helpful, and the location is only so-so. If you visit Fajardo, definitely invest in a trip to the Biobay. I recommend Capitan Suarez, who does a boat tour. If you kayak into the biobay, the kayaking takes up more of your trip than spending time in the biobay. If you go in via boat, you get to spend much more time swimming in the water, which is a very special and unique experience. Plus, Capitan Suarez talks about the area and the creatures that you encounter during the tour, things you might not notice on your own. Fajardo is fabulous, and is well worth the trip, no matter where you stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent views of the sea and the mountains from my room. Very charming stroll through the grounds where there are many tropical fruit trees. Hotel staff was friendly and informative. Rooms were clean. Housekeeping mopped the halls about three times per day. It is within short distance to the ferry for the island excursions. I felt it was a value and would stay there again. I spent 5 nights here. Downside: only one washer and drier on site, no dry cleaning. Restaurant on site was overpriced but good. I saw others leave on 2 occasions after sitting to eat and seeing prices. Must ask staff for detergent which they serve in a foam cup. The main pool was used by noisy local high schoolers, but also added to the local charm--just a bit too crowded. I spent most of my time off premises.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Fajardo Inn is a wonderful oasis on top of a lovely hill. It is comfortable, clean and very reasonable. The grounds are beautiful and landscaped. The pools are terrific...nice and warm. Only problem, the whirlpool was not working but this was not a big deal. We enjoyed ourselves so much. There is a real local feeling there and the staff were very helpful and sweet. We stayed two nights before leaving for Culebra and when we returned, we decided to stay there again. They offered us the opportunity to leave our rental car there, which we did, and I was very pleased with the whole experience. The restaurant was terrific ( the Puerto Rican one, not the Mexican one, which we did not go to) and the birds that are on the property were gorgeous and fun to look at. Great place and very affordable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked hotel for 4 night. First night we checked in, no view. King size bed with 2 flat pillows, called and asked for two more and they said they would bring more... they never did. The room smelled of a must odor. The decor was nothing fancey at all. In the morning, my toddler was kind enough to bring me a huge palmetto bug (very large cockroach), thankfully it was dead. Went to take a shower and the was NO hot water. That was our first and last night there. I called the site where I booked the hotel and told them that I wanted to cancel the rest of our stay and that we would not stay whether or not they refunded our money. Thankfully they gave us our money back and we stayed a beautiful hotel a few miles down the road for about $20 more a night and well worth it. It was BAD! I would give it 1/2 star.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel at the end of our summer vacation. We really didnt know what to expect, since we read so many different reviews, but their prices were perfect for us. My family and I were very impressed with what we saw. The hotel has amazing facilities: two pool, mini golf, basketball, tennis. All of them were included. The only thing was that the swim up bar was closed. But no problem we went up and had a few drinks in one of their restaurants. Food was good and the service too. The rooms are very well kept, is like a tropical atmosphere all over the hotel. During our stay we saw roosters in the parking, some homing birds. And a lot of tropical fruits around the property. We try some of them and they were very tasty. Thank you for making our last days of our vacation a memorable one. See you soon...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">we spent two nights at the scenic inn before heading out to culebra and then one night at the Fajardo Inn when we came back. The Scenic Inn was a good deal. The floors are linoleum and kind of gross, never walked barefoot. There was no remote and there are lots of roosters on the property but still a great deal. The fajardo inn was not worth the price. For twice the price we got the same accomodations except for this time we got a remote, no roosters, and the room was bigger. Still gross floors. The restaurants on premise are not worth mentioning. The really neat pool closes at 7pm. No one is hanging out at the hotel at 7pm! The staff was okay, Budget travellers, stay at the Scenic Inn. If you want nice, the Conquistador is to die for and starts at $70 more per night than the Fajardo Inn. Definitely worth it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room was clean and spacious, with a nice view. The bed was comfortable enough. We had a small balcony with a beautiful view of Fajardo, the rain forest, and the ocean. The bathroom was large. The area felt safe (especially compared to other areas of Fajardo). There was one restaurant with good food opened all the time, and a different restaurant opened in the morning. We had a great stay here, and wished we could come back when we ended up in a much worse hotel in San Juan. We also were surprised by Coco's park - there was a HUGE pool, miniature golf, and more to do. It seemed like a resort without the overly high prices. I had only two complaints: the air conditioner blew directly on the bed and we could hear everything through the closed windows. The people at the front desk were incredible helpful in recommending good restaurants nearby.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We got a great deal on Expedia for this hotel, around $100 a night. The room is huge and comfortable. Their stuffs are very friendly and helpful. I even borrowed their business center freely for an hour video conference. Well, the wireless signal is very weak in the room so I have to do so, which was a bit disappointing at the beginning but happy that they worked out a way to help me resolve it. The hotel is peaceful and beautiful. Plenty of parking and hangout space. The location is not bad if you want to spend 1~2 days to explore the northeast Puerto Rico, which is definitely a very best experience. I also liked the hotel's Star Restaurant. Better than those we tried in San Juan and cost less with better service. We had two breakfast and dinner there. You pay $5.95 to get coffee, fresh juice, cheese sandwich or fruit plate or bagel. Highly valuable and delicious!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When we found this hotel on the Internet, it looked wonderful. When we got there, it was not much like the photos at all. We thought we had booked a room with a view: instead we had a view of a dirt parking lot and construction. Our room looked and felt sparse, empty and unwelcoming. The mattress was so uncomfortable that my lower back ached. Something about the room made us so ill at ease and gave us such insomnia that we checked out in the very early morning hours, two days into our booked four-day stay. The food in the upstairs restaurant is simple and good, not expensively priced. The landscaping is very pretty. The new pool looks nice but the water was warmer than a bathtub. That being said, the hotel was booked solid during our stay, the majority of the guests Puerto Rican families with children who looked very happy there. It just wasn't a good "fit" for us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT - I have to tell you all, this was the perfect vacation for my kids and I. The location was great it was up on the mountain but only about 5 minutes from the Seven Sea beach and only 15 minutes from Luquillo Beach. People on the property were magnificent. (Especially Juan) The Employees were very friendly and pleasant to us and also very helpful, if I may add especially (Juan) the maintenance guy. He was great to us especially with the kids. They have different tropical fruits, everywhere on the properties. The pool was breath taking. Like a dream come true for the kids. I mean they have a beach ramp, which is great for small children. Then thereâ€™s the slide that goes into the 5ft. for older kids and adults. I have included pictures of us. Hope you enjoy your next vacation. I highly recommend that you go to the Fajardo Inn. www.fajardoinn.com</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This has been definetely the most rewarding place I have ever been with my family. I have two kids, 10 and 5 year old. They enjoyed the pool and the water slide. Even my wife had a blast! Rooms are very clean, confortable, spacious, and great price. We planned a Vieques/Culebra trip and although we visited both islands during the weekend, we knew we were returning to a fun place to spend a nice evening. They have two pools, one by the hotel, the other by the fun park. The only down to the fun park is that it closes to early in the night. Maybe is because it lacks lighting, but it would a great plus if the park would open until at least 10 or 11pm. I've stayed a few times, for business and pleasure. The rooms vary on sizes, so it meets all your needs. The staff was really helpful and available to us. The hotel has a Caribbean taste which makes you welcomed at all times. Will go back any time!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My family stayed at the Fajardo Inn from April 2 to 6, 2007. We had an excellent time exploring the surrounding area, and the Fajardo Inn was a nice place to stay in the area. It is economical and although it is not on the ocean, it has excellent clean swimming pools for the kids. We enjoyed a short drive to nearby beaches, Luquillo and Playa Azul in particular. The Fajardo Inn was clean, spacious and the staff was helpful. The 2 restaurants on site were nothing to brag about, but they were ok and provided a convenient meal when needed. The food was acceptable. If you are looking for the all-inclusive, on the ocean style resort, the Fajardo is not for you. But, if you want to save a lot of money and still stay at a nice, clean place that is conveniently located and that offers good swimming pools for the kids, I would recommend the Fajardo Inn. We would definitely go back, if we return to Puerto Rico.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a family of four, we spent three nights at the Fajardo Inn. We occupied the "family room", a room with three double beds. The room was huge! There was large walk in closet that doubled as a changing room for our teenage son or daughter when the bathroom was occupied. The pool is awesome but the pool hours are way too short. It would have been nice to go for an evening swim. The grounds are very resort-like and well maintained. The floors throughout the establishment are ceramic tile and therefore easy to keep clean. The staff seemed to be constantly buffing and polishing. Our only disappointment was the Blue Iguana restaurant which serves Mexican food. It was just OK. We found a great spot for breakfast a couple blocks away (the Golden Bagel). Their coffee, fresh squeezed OJ and baked goods were out of this world. I had tears in my eyes on the last morning when we had to say goodbye. It's a special place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staying at the Fajardo Inn after two nights at The EL Conquistador is something of a letdown but the difference in cost sort of evens things out. The Fajardo Inn is spotlessly clean with a large pool and nice facilities. The room was large and comfortable with TV, phone and air conditioner that worked well except I had to unplug it to turn it off. There are nice views of Fajardo from the upper bar terrace and the place is undergoing major renovations and additions. Aside from El Yunque Rainforest and the Ferrys to Vieques and Culebra there does not seem to be much to do in Fajardo. I didn't need a car at the Wyndham resort but you need one at the Fajardo Inn if you plan to do any exploring. I used the Inn to see the Rainforest and as a jumping off point to Vieques. The Mexican resturant on the lower level was good and reasonable. I had breakfast at the main resturant and it too was good. Staff were friendly and helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I found that this hotel was a faboulous hotel. All the employees treated me wonderfully. They were always willing to help and were always respectful. I tremendously enjoyed the two pools. Especially the Bamboo beach pool. Every Saturday at the end of each month they have a great pool party which is called the Family Day event. All ages love coming and playing in the pool. They even open the bar down at the pool. If you'd like to explore the rest of the island, they have great transportation services. The drivers never have any trouble of where they are going and always keep good conversation. After a full day of either exploring or relaxing you can go to either of the two restaurant. My favourite restaurant is the StarFish Restaurant. The have exceptional food, and great service. I enjoyed my stay very much, and highly recommend other people who love being treated great, having fun, and being pampered with such great food!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Was here for 2 nights on June 18 and 19. This was a family vacation ..... i had booked two rooms. The room my husband and i booked was the Honeymoon suite ........... awesome! Very clean......... had a small balcony. Our two older teen children had a room in the mainhotel..... .... also very, very clean and nice. Front desk staff very helpful with giving directions and asking questions. The pool is incredible ............. and i really liked that they didn't close early like some other places i've stayed. We ate one night at Starfish ........this is probably the only thing i did not like here ........ the food was very overpriced for the quality. The Blue Iguana however had delicious food at reasonable prices. Hotel is centrally located so you can go elsewhere to eat if you want .......... very short drive to Burger King and Sizzler. There is also a bakery right around the corner called Golden Sweet that had really good empanadas.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at The Fajardo Inn for one night so we could head out to Culebra the next day. It was right down the street from the Ferry terminal. There are signs clearly showing the way to get to the hotel from the highways, which was a bonus. We arrived before check in time, but they allowed us to handle all the paperwork and drop our bags off so we could head out to El Yunque. Once we got back from El Yunque we just picked up our key and bags and headed to the room. We walked in and was unimpressed. Very plain with an old tube tv. The bed was EXTREMELY hard, which made for a rough nights sleep. Even after being exhausted from hiking El Yunque and kiaking the bio bay! But I do have to say that the grounds were wonderful! It sits on a hill so that lends to wonderful panoramic views! The morning from the nice restaurant we were able to have a gorgeous view of the sunrise! I would stay here again, if they did some renovations to their rooms.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I can't give the Farjardo a "terrible" rating because it wasn't an evil nightmare, it just made me profoundly relieved we had only booked one night and I had great sympathy for the staff - they couldn't just flee like we could! Ironically, the place looks rather impressive in a fancy schmancy way, then your soul is slowly sucked out by the surreally dreary, impersonal rooms, the counter-productive attempt to limit pool time (guests nervously edging around the early evening "pool closed" sign as if fearing they might be yelled at) and the ghastly "Mexican" microwave food at the cheaper hotel restaurant. We timidly asked if we could buy tennis balls (like, to use on the tennis court?) and might as well have been demanding to purchase ski boots! It's by no means a nasty place, the sun shone, the pools were lovely - when open - but thank goodness it was only a stop-gap stay. You creep away with a lighter wallet and no special memories whatsoever.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We are a local family of 3 and just returned from the Fajardo Inn and stayed there for 3 nights. We had a little trouble at check in and our reservation. We where going to have a double room and they claimed we were canceled. The hotel gave us a suite at the same price. The staff was not the friendliest. Rather than that, everything was okay. The hotel was very pretty and the rooms were comfortable and very clean, and have cable tv with movie channels, whic was nice. The pool was nice but had too much clorox when we came, and irritated our eyes. We ate outside the hotel. There is a bakery called Golden Sweet nearby. Do check out Metropol, a cuban and puertorrican restaurant located next to the cinemas, the food and service are great. You have to pay extra for mini golf and gym. There is a buisness center but you have to pay.There is free Wi-Fi so bring your laptop instead. We could return to the hotel though I personally don't like to go to the same hotel twice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fabulous Inn- exceeded expectations in every way. I am a former airline employee and have travelled extensively. The Fajardo Inn was honestly the cleanest place I have ever stayed- and I have stayed in far more expensive places. Linen was changed every day; floor in room washed every day; - new towels brought down after morning shower. Personnel always had time to answer questions, make suggestions, and always treated each guest like they were there just to insure a good vacation. The grounds are beautiful, well-maintained, and the pool area 5 star. Lots for kids and adults to do and yet very relaxing. Mexican restaurant on premises delicious and very reasonable. Service great- gentleman brought my food to the pool so I didn't have to miss even minutes of a beautiful day. My only complaint? I was spoiled! Will I ever again stay in a hotel with these high standards at such a reasonable price? The bar has been raised and the Fajardo Inn will be a tough act to follow.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Fajardo Inn from 5/31-6/2 and we were NOT impressed with anything about the hotel. There was a guy who worked in the office that was very nice and was very helpful in getting us to the hotel when we couldn't find it but other than that we did not like it. It is at the top of a hill and once you go down it you feel as if you are in the ghetto of PR. There isn't any security so anyone can wander into the hotel. The restaurants were closed most of the time so you had to wander into town just to get something to eat and when one of them (the Blue Iguana) was open the food was terrible. The electricity went off a few times while we were there and some of the workers were quite creepy. Now I'm not a diva and being born and raised in NY I am not easily frightened but I did not feel safe at this hotel and would NOT stay there ever again! On a positive note our room was very clean. It is definetly worth the extra $ to stay at El Conquistador or Rio Mar...at least it's nicer and you'd be safer there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Finding Fajardo Inn can best be described as a challenge, particularly if arriving at night. My daughter and I booked our stay and had planned many day trips. Our room was spacious with 2 queen beds. The bathroom was very dark & it seems washcloths are unheard of & impossible to get. Towels are like gold and @ one point, a used & rather wet bath towel was folded by cleaning staff & left on the bed??? Another time the entire pile of used towels were left on floor. The only ice machine is on the 1st floor -inconvenient to those on the far end of the 2nd floor. The only Wi-fi service is on the porch by office as noted by numerous people each evening sitting there with laptops. On our last night the noise level in the hallway was out of control & didn't stop until I finally called front desk @ 1am. On a positive note the office staff is very helpful with local attractions, & will assist with making reservations. They are both knowledgable and friendly. The pools and workout room were excellent & clean. We would stay there again on future trips.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed for one night before visiting the rain forest. It was a convenient place to stay for my first night in PR. The drive from the airport was easy. Print the directions for the hotel website. The hardest part of the drive is going through the town of Fajardo. I also stopped at the Walmart in Fajardo on the way to pick up water, sodas and small ice chest for my road trip in PR. I went around to a few places then spent 3 nights in San Juan. Next time I would reverse that and spend a couple nights in San Juan first, then pick up the rental car and go outside of San Juan. The hotel room was pretty basic. The bed was a bit hard, the bathroom was nice and clean. In my room the phone cord was broken. Bring your own travel alarm. I paid extra for the balcony room, but the door to the balcony is not glass - it is normal, so the view is only through the window. The staff was nice and helped me book my next night in another part of PR - Rincon. If you need to book tours - you may want to call ahead first. They didn't offer or have any pamplets out anywhere.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Executive chef, monsart (sp?), for the 2 restaurants (star fish and blue iguana) was beyond amazing. He accommodated our every need and request. The food at star fish is excellent! They opened the breakfast area for us beyond their regular hours, because we missed breakfast. They made us some really good stuff at noon. Talk about going the extra mile! The friendliest staff greeted us even after their shifts in the hallway. The resort is amazing and quaint. From miniature golf, to tennis, basketball and 2 pools with an amazing gym facility and lush views. We would have liked a hot tub during the nights. We'd have to remove one star because the mattress and bed was not to our standard. We thought they were pretty cheap with their towels, one day we got only one of two towels replaced; and the other time none were replaced. I'm sure if we asked we could've got towels, but we expected them with our daily room service. Not many dining options in the area, but the star fish in the inn is excellent and rated one of the best in the island. Overall, a great experience and we would come back again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The beautiful gardens and Spanish-style architecture of the inn make it a pleasant place to stay. The rooms have attractive, newer furniture, though the bathrooms are a bit dated (but clean). Advantages include: iron & ironing board in the room, convenient cubbyholes in the closet, extra pillows, dorm-size fridge in the room, great ocean views from the patio up top, laundry facilities, and Internet-access computers for guests (at $5 per half-hour). There's no elevator, but you can ask the staff for assistance with baggage. The lower pool appears to be open to non-guests who pay for day privileges, and while we were there it was quite crowded. The upper pool is quieter. We ate onsite at both the Blue Iguana (Mexican food, sports bar atmosphere) and the other, more traditional restaurant. Food at the Blue Iguana was very good, with most lunch items priced at just $5, including a large soft drink. Portions were large. Outstanding chips and salsa! The other restaurant was nothing to write home about; the service was poor, selections were limited, quality of the food was not the best, and it wasn't inexpensive. For the price, the Fajardo Inn is a true bargain.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Fajardo Inn is a nice place to return to as you explore the beautiful & exciting northeast of la Isla del Encanto. It seems like some of the complaints about the hotel come from people who expect a fully self-contained resort destination â€“ thatâ€™s a lot to ask for $100 a night. We stayed about a week and really enjoyed our stay, especially daytime activities, but youâ€™ll need a car to reach attractions or if you want any nightlife (see our post under â€œFajardoâ€�) for stuff to do. The rooms are clean, comfortable and spacious, if pretty spare (absolutely no shelf space in the bathroom), with AC & small TVs. We didnâ€™t see any benefit to the Ocean View over the Mountain View. The pool area is very nice for a hotel this size, and really uncrowded â€“ good for a few afternoonsâ€™ relaxation. However, the towel service is sometimes unattended, and the swim-up bar is not up yet â€“ youâ€™ll have to hike up to the restaurant for water. The two restaurants are good, although youâ€™ll get tired of them if you donâ€™t eat anywhere else. It looks like they are adding many units, so the hotel may get more crowded in the future. Overall, a nice stay and a great value.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My buddy and I stayed at the Fajardoo Inn for 2 nights during our week long stay in Puerto Rico. We travelled during the second week in April 2008. We didn't plan our trip in advanace, so finding the Fajardo Inn was absolute gem ! First, the rooms were extremely clean; sheets, towels, and bedding were changed every day. We shared a huge two bedroom suite and the balcony view was absolutely amazing. Beds were very comfortable, our room had satellite t.v, air conditioning, and full shower/bathroom. Second, the newly rennovated pool/bar was perfect for lounging and sun bathing. Good place to relax after a long day hiking in the El Yunque Rainforest. Third, we made good use of the gym and new fitness equipment. Also, Protein Smoothies/Drinks are available at the Juice Bar : Highly Recommended! Finally, the staff was amazing, everyone from maids to servers were very nice and very friendly. The staff was extremely helpful in showing us nearby tourist attractions. The prices are also fairly resonable about $130/night, I have paid more for a hotel with half of the amentities the Fajardo Inn has. I would highly recommend the Farjado Inn to anyone visiting Puerto Rico. Cheers !!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for two days while exploring El Yunke before going off to Vieques. The Hotel is serviceable, but it seems like it's seen better days. The restaurant fare is microwaved and dinner at the Starfish (the onsite restaurant) had terrible service and food and ambiance reminiscent of a airport lounge late at night. Everything you want comes at an extra price (exercise room, internet) and there are draconian rules in effect at the pool, whose swim up bar featured in their brochure no longer exists (the seats are still there, and a half torn down tiki hut sits sadly on the cement, but it is not functional and no staff are around the pool to help with any requests). There is no collection of brochures for local dining or attractions, so you're on your own. We got lost at night in a slightly alarming neighborhood foraging for food. We finally found the Metropol restaurant the next day and had a good meal there - wish this type of local dining had been available at the hotel. Front desk staff was helpful when asked, but seemed more oriented towards checking people in and out. Room was a bit musty and strangely, the shower has no ledge for your bathing products even though it was gargantuan in size.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for one night on our jaunt through Puerto Rico. The complex is very nice, but a bit hard to find. It is not on the beach and is a little drive to anything else. The rooms were clean, well appointed, but a very small TV for the size of the room. No problems with service or maintenance. The pool area was beautiful, but we weren't here long enough to enjoy it. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for relatively inexpensive, clean accommodations in Fajardo. We did take the East Wind bioluminesence tour in the evening that was 109.00 per person. It was well worth the money as it included a catamaran boat ride to Vieques (with rum drinks included), a van ride to dinner (included in price), at a very unique little restaurant, another bus ride (old school bus) to the middle of nowhere- a little scary for some! Then a pontoon boat ride to the bay where you can see and swim with the marvels of nature. Many folks in our group jumped right in and swam with the creatures that make this an ultra unique gift from nature. You can get more info on this at biobay.com Well worth the money. All in all the Fajardo Inn was fine for us. I am a stickler when it comes to cleanliness and this hotel met my demands.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We began our trip heading to a hotel we had read about online only to be sorely disappointed. We drove on down toward Luquillo Beach which we heard was beautiful, it was but very limited accomodations in the area. We spoke with a lovely lady at the Luquilla Sunrise Beach Inn who had no rooms available but called the Fajardo Inn for us and helped us to acquire a room there. We were so tired we didnt care and drove up there only to find this absolutely exquisite Inn! The people there are wonderful, service was wonderful! We enjoyed our stay so much we extended it a few days to enjoy all that surrounded us. This Inn is not advertised and praised the way many others are and we would have never guessed it would be as nice as it was based on information we got here on the internet. We can not express to you how wonderful this place was, we do intend to go back there again in the near future. The pools (there are 2) are lovely, the one on the lower level we really enjoyed. The views are spectacular, the food is wonderful and those that work there are just the best. We couldnt have been happier with Fajardo Inn...If you get the chance to go, make reservations ahead and be ready to relax and enjoy...We just thought it was the best!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Fajardo Inn for 4 nights. The good parts about the hotel are the price (reasonable for the area), the family-friendly pool area, both restaurants have good food at reasonable prices, the staff is friendly, there are nice views of the ocean and the mountains, it is very close to the ferry for Culebra and Vieques, and they help coordinate excursions including bioluminescent bay kayak trips (which are also close by). There were a few bad things that would make me reluctant to recommend this hotel. The rooms are very sparse and dismal (not even an alarm clock, with tile floor and fluorescent lights). I did not feel comfortable relaxing there in the evening. The bed was uncomfortable with bed-bugs. I woke up several times during each night itching and in the morning saw many new bites--not from mosquitoes or sand fleas, definitely from some insects living in the bed. The staff did not communicate very well with the excursion companies. I suggest arranging tours yourself and calling to confirm the status of the tour the night before or day of, in the case of the night bioluminescent bay tour (so cool!) instead of relying on hotel staff. Overall, this hotel seems on-par for Puerto Rico and for the price you pay per night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Fajardo Inn for a 2 night stay with hubbie and 2 kids 7 & 4. It was clean and appreared nice but really lacked a lot of the little extras that make a hotel a home for a few days. Let's start with the room - no folder in the room giving us info a on the hotel, called front desk but never received it. No clock in the room, 13" TV in big armoire, not enough towels. The pool areas - the large pool in Coco's world was great for kids, lots of shallow 3 ft areas with seating in pool for adults, nice slide, everything looked very new. Actually gave out beach towels , thick and fluffy! The downside... swim up bar with no one working it, no food or drinks available, the hot tub needed to be turned on by the guy at the top of the hill in Coco's hut and it never got hot. The pool is a fair distance away from the main hotel, so you are sort of in limbo land .... what I would have given for a pina colada! The restaurant Starfish was okay . Pasta for the kids, fairly laid back service, slow bar service. Good but again just lacking something that would make it stand out. Oh, no elevator ...pack light. All and all just an average place to stay, if you can't find anywhere else to stay, at least it was clean and not too expensive. I would probably not stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We really enjoyed our stay at Fajardo Inn. The room and bathroom were lovely and VERY spacious for our family of 4. While we were traveling people kept asking if we were staying at the Conquistador (which we had looked at, but was out of our price range). People had not even heard of the Fajardo Inn. We were worried, but unnecessarily so!! It was really a pleasant experience from start to finish. The pool was excellent. The shallow depth was perfect for our young children. The front desk staff was always very helpful in giving directions. We stayed in Culebra for 2 nights and the Fajardo Inn for 4. We took day trips to El Yunque and Old San Juan If we had it to do over again we would either stay at the Fajardo Inn the entire time (and day trip to Culebra) or spend our last night in Old San Juan to make the day trip and return to the airport slightly more convenient. Fajardo is really a nice location to do day trips from. Our only complaint was the overpriced food that was unimpressive. That really has more to do with Fajardo though, not the hotel. We did eat at the Blue Iguana - it was fine, but overpriced. The gym was really nice too - it does cost extra. The laundry facilities were a plus (they also cost extra) as we went through more clothes than planned - it was over 100degrees every day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">PROS.... Hotel is extremely clean and it's grounds beaufifully landscaped with all variety of flowers and tropical plants. The room with a balcony is a most, great view of the ocean and the surroundings. The personnel was friendly and helpful. The bartenders at the Iguana Grill mexican restaurant are the best and the food was great and inexpensive. The big pool is an amazing work of art with the miniature gold and Tennis court. CONS....Directions to the hotel are horrible and very hard to find especially if you can't speak spanish and never been to PR. Way too many locals around the grounds of the hotel and the swimming pool which made me kind of nervous. The upstairs restaurant was always empty, very expensive for what they offer. They do not offer continental breakfast, you have to pay for it at the restaurant . we went there once and it was expensive for what they offered so we ended up at Mac donalds. That tells you something. I asked if there was a gym and they said yes. I went down the hill to work out one morning and it turned out that it was a paid gym. they forgot to mention that. They also forgot to mention that you have to pay for the miniature golf as well. OVERALL..... If you're looking for a nice relaxing vacation at an affordable hotel, this is the place to stay. I will definitely consider it next time I visit the island...</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent three nights here in March. The Farjado Inn is physically very nice-beautiful views, inviting lobby, polite staff. That being said, the longer I stayed the more I could not wait to leave. The huge beautiful pool has ridiculously short hours. when we did find time to lay by the pool one afternoon we walked away with our ears ringing--from 10am to noon they were pressure washing the pool (very loud!). When that finally stopped it was replaced by the soothing sound of dump trucks, cranes, construction and the very loud stereo of the construction crew directly behind us. Yes, the huge pool is adjacent to a huge construction site. I would have retired to my room for a bit of peace and quiet, however directly oustide of our room was a large table saw. They seemed to be building closet doors and doing miscellaneuos carpentry the whole length of our hallway for the duration of our stay. For days after we left everything in our suitcases smelled like mold (the general aroma of our room). The food also left a lot to be desired. There was absoletuly no consistency, and there is only one restaraunt open for lunch which is entirely mexican food. never did find the jacuzzis. when i called to ask the front desk where they were they replied that the jacuzzis were not currently open and that they are never open unless the hotel is at maximum capacity.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The grounds were nice, the location is good. I can't believe that you can get the same price for the Conquistador, which is what the previous review stated. I did a lot of research, thanks tripadvisor! The room was not great: we reserved a room with 3 queen sized beds. After we got there we were told that all of these types of rooms do not have a view. I would have like to know that when I made the reservation, so I am giving the hotel a lower rating. The room was a bit dark and musty, but it was clearn and the beds were comfortable. We did not spend much time in the rooms anyway. They have a nice lobby with wifi. The kids loved the pools. We went to Rosa's seafood, the Golden Bagel, Pallo Tropicals, Metropols, Richs, and had some very nice meals. The surrounding area was not great, as reported from a previous review, but I don't think it was squalor. I was thinking that my family would also be turned off by the area, but they were not, and I am proud of them for that. Many areas are poor, but the people are all very friendly. I found the experience very genuine. Its not a resort where you are walled out from the undesirables; you are part of the crowd, not an outsider, and I liked that. When I made the reservations I specifically asked about a room with a view. They should have informed me then that the rooms with 3 beds do not have views. Besides this annoyance the hotel was pretty good.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I should probably not be reviewing this hotel, since we did not actually stay there, but... We stopped to ask directions while in Fajardo, and the experience was so nice that I feel like I should put in a plug based on what we saw and experienced... We asked the woman at the front desk for simple directions to a restaurant in town (and told her we were not guests), and she was more than happy to take time out of what she was doing to offer us not only directions, but maps, recommendations, and any other assistance we might need (including the offer to call her on the phone if we got lost). We asked if we could look around, and she helpfully pointed us to various spots around the hotel grounds, which are huge. The hotel is at the top of a high hill, and the view is spectacular. The hotel grounds are spotless and nicely decorated. There are two pools, one of which is huge. From the few glimpses we had of rooms, they looked large and nicely furnished. The lobby area is large and well-maintained, there are two nice restaurants in the hotel, and there appeared to be a number of activities for guests (and families / kids). The guests we saw all seemed happy to be there. Again, please keep in mind that we DID NOT STAY at the Fajardo Inn, but from everything we saw (i.e. if the overall service is anything like what we found at the front desk), we certainly intend to give it a try on our next visit to Puerto Rico.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When we arrived in the Fajardo area, we went past the small sign that said "Inn." The Inn is in a great location once you realize it is on the hill. We only stayed the night, however, the check in service was great. The staff over extended themselves in order to ensure we were comfortable. They even checked my flight for me, to see if it was leaving on time. We were there on a Saturday, when we arrived we had the front desk book a tour for us at the bioluminous Bay. We went kayaking at night. Try to pre book; we got the last two spots. The area where you kayak has several little "shack" like restaurants. Lively music was playing every where. It was quite the experience to kayak through the canals into the bay. The trip was $40.00 approx. The restaurant at the Fajardo Inn was having a rough time Sunday morning, half their staff didn't show up. Needless to say I drank several cups of coffee and no breaky! We didnt' get a chance to get to the beach around there, however, we went for a quick dip in the pool. Amazing, they had a few different pools, one I had to myself to do laps. Their gym facilities had very updated equipment. Things to consider: -there is no elevator and it is very steep; not appropriate for seniors or disabled unless you get ground level -rooms were adequate; mattress too soft -clean -several families there; obviously a popular place for the locals to holiday as well. ***Rented from Charlie Car rental excellent value and great service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were in Fajardo over Presidentâ€™s day weekend, so we were very limited in our choice of hotels. Otherwise we would not have taken a chance on a hotel with so many really bad reviews. I should have listened to the reviews. This is the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in -- in the developed world. The beds were swaybacked, the bedspread was not clean, the linens were so worn that you could see through them,pillows flat, the walls were dingy. Fortunately the lighting was so inadequate that you might overlook some of these problems! There was one tiny window with bars and a dirty view of bare ground, weeds and a chain link fence. The only amenity was a 20â€� tube TV. The bathroom was mildewed and had a single (bluish) fluorescent light overhead. Internet access was limited to a room that remained locked all day.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Fajardo Inn this past memorial weekend. Its a economical alternative to El Conquistador â€“ a resort. This hotel (do not confuse it with a inn) has a family friendly atmosphere and locals on vacation. We found the rooms were clean and well maintained. My only negative comment will concern the in house restaurant called The Star Fish. Be prepared to wait for food during the breakfast service since it appears that food would leave the kitchen slowly. The wait is very long. We also heard many other family's complain of the slow service. This happened on both days. An honorable mention should go to Lasaira who was very professional and pleasant while she served. She was hardworking despite the fact she handled a large portion of the restaurant. While the co server seemed concerned for only his small section by small I mean, 2 Tables. Yes two tables with 2 people each one. I know that those 4 people did not have any complaints about service. While, Lasaira had to take care of the other side of the restaurant with about 8 tables. Two of these tables had big family to serve. She literally was running back and forth, from the kitchen to the dinning area. If there were more staff like Lasaira the Starfish would have a better rating in service. The manger needs to enforce the idea of team work. Overall, we recommend the Fajardo Inn. This hotel would look more prestige if the staff had a uniform,simple polo shirt with the hotel logo and khaki pants especially at the front desk. Overall, it was a pleasant stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Adequate for an overnight stay.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We chose the Fajardo Inn because we were planning a morning departure on the Vieques ferry and needed a place close to the terminal. The Inn is pleasantly situated on a little hill and is within walking distance(.7 of a mile) to the ferry. We chose the economy room because of the brief amount of time we would stay there. The buildings of the Inn have a kind of blocky, institutional feel about them and could use a few more plants and ornamental accents to warm things up a bit. Our room-which we note was the Economy" room-was a little plain and dreary, with a wall and tree blocking much of the light from the window. The inn has two pools, a plain, rectangular "quiet Pool" and a much more elaborate swimming complex a bit further down. It was a bit cold for swimming in the late afternoon but it looked like a fun place to spend a few hours if we had more time. There is also an on-site miniature golf course as well. I'm sure families with kids would make good use of this whole area. We chose not to dine at the two on-site restaurants: the "Blue Iguana Cantina" and the more upscale looking "Starfish. We had read about the La Estacion restaurant a few miles away(A great experience by the way..check my separate review) and decided to go there. My interactions with the pleasant, professional, Bi Lingual staff, both before and during our stay, were all first rate. They even offered for us to leave our rental car parked there for two days for free. A really nice touch. I would not want to stay here for more than a few nights, but as a reasonably priced place to spend the night before heading over to Vieques or Culebra, you won't do any better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed during the Christmas holiday after spending a wonderful week on Isla de Vieques. The hotel was pleasant enough at first, but then things got pretty bad. We had a room with 2 full size beds. After the first night, my husband was getting bitten by some sort of bug. I don't believe they were bed bugs. We spoke to housekeeping, and they said they would change the bedding & bedspread. This did not help. My husband asked to change rooms, and they wouldn't comply. They said they would change the mattress. This didn't happen. So after the 2nd night of being bitten up, we asked to change rooms again. The people at the front desk said they couldn't do this. It was only after we mentioned "Trip Advisor", they finally agreed to change our room. After that the bug bites stopped. The hotel is pleasant enough for the price but be advised there is alot of walking to be done. There are no elevators but is is only a 2 floor hotel. We were traveling with our young children, so if you forgot something in your room, it's up the steps. It's also a distance to the washer & dryer, and if you use the larger pool with the slide next to the mini golf course, it's another LONG walk and a full flight of stairs down to the pool.So if you have a problem with stairs or traveling with small children, you may want to think twice! The staff was very pleasant but we started off on the wrong foot. We ate breakfast out at several different bakeries. Most served some sort of egg sandwhich or french toast (for the kids). It was cheaper than eating in the hotel restaurant. For dinner, try heading down to the seaport where there is a road lined with many restaurants.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Beautiful grounds, but need some practice..”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The grounds of this hotel are beautiful! The view from our balcony was very pretty, both out over the pool and to the sea. But...we had a couple of issues with the hotel itself. It was nearly impossible to get hand towels, and it *was* impossible to get washclothes. Each day our bed was made up with clean sheets, and each evening we found a couple dozen hairs in the sheets. I am sure the sheets were clean, but as I said, they could use a bit of practice. Lastly, there were some tiny ants running on the hard floor in the room. They did not bite and they weren't really a bother, and I do realize that it's the tropics...but we had bought some pastries at a local bakery, and the ants truly seemed to enjoy them. The moral here is just to put food into zippie bags. If you can, bring your own pillow. The mattress wasn't good, but wasn't too bad. But the pillows were terrible. There was free wi-fi service, but the connection out to the internet was down when we were there. Not a big deal - I only wanted it to check in for our flight, which I ended up doing on my phone. But if internet is a big deal, keep this in mind. There are two restaurants on site. The grill was pretty good, and the prices were great! The more formal restaurant was not so good, and was quite expensive. Hours here for the restaurants can be quite flexible ("closes at 10" can mean anything from 8 - 11). Again, just keep it in mind so you don't count on a late dinner and then find you have to go out. The Fajardo area was interesting. I loved the "local" feel...my wife would rather have had something a little more touristy. But the people in Fajardo were very nice, both in town and at the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Fajardo Inn was a totally mixed bag of an experiences. You simply could not have asked for a more personable staff, extremely willing to go the extra mile to help you set up excursions, rent a vehicle, whatever. The location and grounds were both beautiful and well maintained. And, the pools? Well, it is hard to describe the meandering waters from what was basically 3 large pools tied together with water ways, plus the adults pool up near the dining area that was very nice. There are plenty of places to sit and relax around the property, most with very scenic views of the mountains and glimpses of the sea. To the contrary, there was no restaurant or lounge open while we were there. There was an independently owned bar/restaurant on the grounds. It served foods that were named as Mexican food names (Tex-Mex actually) but not recognizable by taste. The location of the property is off the side of a side street (nowhere near where the GPS takes you) and difficult to find. The â€œFree Wi-Fiâ€� only works in the lobby or front porch area so do not expect any in the rooms and do not expect any wired service internet either. I have to say that the rooms and furniture looked nice enough, however they were extremely musty with a heavy mildew smell and the showers were horrible. Shower heads should have been replaced back in 1980 something but were not and the bath as a whole was small and very cramped with no shelving and very poor lighting. Donâ€™t pay extra for the balcony rooms, there is not enough room on the balcony to stand and close the door without squeezing tightly into the one corner where the door does not reach. All in all; Looks Great, very friendly, not quite what you pay for.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed for 4 nights. The hotel and grounds where very clean and attractive, they have many fruit trees and nicely landscaped grounds. We did not use the pools but relaxed by them one evening and it was great. I recommend this hotel to families with young kids as the pool seems like a great place for them, there were a couple of families using the pools. As we where a bit tired the first night we went to the more expensive restaurant in the hotel grounds, it was ok, but you can find better food for the same price or less outside (Pasion por el Fogon, Calizo, and a restaurant by the Bioluminescent Bay, etc) I also stayed in Passion Fruit bed and breakfast. Passion Fruit was great as well and the service and attention was better and more intimate than Fajardo Inn. Breakfast was very good and the place was very clean. Passion Fruit was a bit nosier in terms of people coming in/out of rooms and all the AC units running created a lot of noise. These are two distinct logging options so comparing them is a bit unfair and it depends if you like a Bed and Breakfast vs. Hotel/Resort accommodations. I will probably not go back to Passion Fruit, depends on the price, etc. I only saved a few dollars in Fajardo Inn vs Passion Fruit, so I think Fajardo Inn is a better bang for the buck. On Fajardo Inn - Negative - 1. We stayed in the 1st floor room and the window overlooks a large common terrace, so not much privacy unless you close the curtains. 2. The AC drip caused noise on night #1, as it was hitting the exterior of our room AC. We complained and told them to put a towel out to absorb the noise and the problem was resolved. Positive - 1. Quiet and clean 2. Attractive room and grounds, lotâ€™s of trees and plants. 3. Very good for the price we paid 4. Super close to the Culebra/Vieques ferry 5. Many bakeries around, for good break fast.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Two adults check-in March, 2009. Hotel would be very difficult to find in you are driving and is situated on a hill overlooking the bay and surrounding valleys on the eastern end of the island. A easy downhill walk to the bahia and Ferry terminal to Vieques/Culebra. Dont look for trendy shops. Our room on the second floor was not ready when we arrived. The day of the week of Monday and our arrival was around noon. This is an early check-in but considering there was no one else in the hotel and the guest was a VIP in Fajardo, the room should have been ready. Day two there was no hot water in the shower. The shower needs grab bars and mats for security. Air conditioner did the job and TV was good. The much publicized Coco's pool and playground was closed. Housekeeping was attentive, friendly and bilingual. Male office staff seemed huffy and the office itself was cold with a pungent aroma of fine island cigars. So, whats for dinner? A big sign opposite the office says MESONES but the name of the resturant is Star Fish. Confusing. The Star Fish is clean, breakfast at six, service is attentive but slow, on our last night we had an excellent skirt steak with Chimichanga sauce. Downstairs is the Blue Iguana for Mexican style food. Pool tables need maintenance. Clean, good food. This place is a good value for tourists and locals. At night you can go up to the five star El Conquistador Hotel, (if you can find it, if not, the FI has a shuttle for a small fee) play some Roulette in the Casino, and eat Italian, Chinese, or the Long Horn steak house if you are craving some beef. Other big attractions in the area are Luquillo Beach and maybe Croabas Natural Reserve, El Faro, etc. I went to Luquillo and ate some good frituras de Bacalao, fried tortilla with cod (very small) inside with the local Medalla beer. . Also at night, do not miss the sonorous sounds of the Coqui, unique in Puerto Rico.</p></li>
