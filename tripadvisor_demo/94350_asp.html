<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We, a couple from Germany, stayed at the Midtown hotel for four nights and really enjoyed it. We had a big room which was very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The price was perfectly low - compared to other hotels in Boston. And not to forget the good location... It's just a few minutes walk to Prudential Center and Copley Place. We can really recommend this hotel.</p></li>

We stayed here for 2 nights and found the room comfortable and a good size. The room was a little dated but clean. My only complaint would be that the air conditioning is very noisy - you can hear the corridor one all the time. Saying this it certainly didn't keep me awake at night.</p></li>

For a older hotel, the rooms were clean with plenty of room and the hotel was right across the street from the Prudential Center/Mall, T Station and plenty of places to eat. They had a nice conceirge that gave us helpful directions and tips and all the staff was friendly. I recommend the Midtown to any family touring old town Boston.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Midtown is pretty much right in the center of everything in Boston. You're close to attractions, shopping, food, clubs, Sox games... Plus they allow pets which is great because I can bring my lab with me when I am visiting friends in the city. If you want to be pampered, then book one of the boutique hotels. If you want an affordable, comfortable place to stay while you are out and about having fun and exploring Boston, then the Midtown is great.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here during a four day stop over in Boston, and as others have noted, the location is truly very good. It is the closest non-overpriced hotel to the CBD. Public transport is conveniently close, shops, and with abit of walking the whole city is reachable. The service was not too welcoming but efficient, the rooms were clean, neat and what you would expect for the price. I'd say very reasonable for a almost budget stay-over. We will stay there again.</p></li>

One if you are affiliated with the Christian Science Church, it's directly across the street. The other reason is if you are unable to get any other hotel reservation in Boston. The hotel was charging the same as other major hotels during a meeting in Boston; it wasn't worth half of the rate they charged, and even at that anything other than basic services simply are not available. Give this place a pass.</p></li>

Read other reviews that complained of noise. We didn't hear or see anyone while we were there but I know that they had full occupancy based on traffic in lobby. If you are looking for a place simply to sleep, shower and shave then this is the place for you. If you are looking for something more fancy go somewhere else.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed at the Midtown hotel twice now. The best thing about the hotel is safe parking and the location between downtown and Fenway Park. Parking is around $18 unless you have a ticket to the Red Sox game, then it's free for the day. Both Fenway Park and downtown are within walking distance and there is a subway station right next to the hotel (don't worry, it doesn't cause any noise). I'll likely stay here again. The only bad thing is it's tough to find a deal for this place so it'll usually be close to $200 a night.</p></li>

Our aircon didn't work, but we didn't bother making a fuss for our 1 night stay so can't say if it would have been fixed for us. Felt a bit like a student hostel.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was easily the cheapest hotel we could find that was in Boston central (well, Back Bay but not far from the centre). A short walk to the underground it was very very well positioned for a budget hotel. We were given a huge room which was a little bland but was nevertheless clean and well maintained. There was no gym but the YMCA was a short walk away and was cheap with a day rate. This was a very reasonable hotel in every way and we were very pleased with it as a good budget experience. The receptionists were really welcoming and friendly too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This 2 storey hotel made us a bit nervous at first as it is old and in need of modernization. The hallways resemble college dorms and it has an apartment feel to it. Our room was a bit musty but very clean. Once we got over the initial "this isn 't a chain hotel" we actually found it quite charming and appreciated it for what it was - a simple, clean, safe, no frills place to stay in a great part of Boston. Staff was great. Pool was well maintained. Too bad wifi was not free. Walking distance to so many places and subway nearby. Really enjoyed our time there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location was ok with access to the subway. However, we could hear the tv's blaring in the other rooms, people playing drinking games, distinct conversations (complete with loud swearing) from other rooms, and when our neighbors took a shower the pipes rattled so loud I thought they would come out of the wall. It is dark and smelly. We couldn't sleep at all. Burn marks all over the carpet, the window latch was broken so it wouldn't close and the television was also broken, but the staff didn't care when we called about the problems. I would NEVER stay here again.</p></li>

When we eventually got to our room the so called double bed was like a single bed but just a bit bigger! The plumbing made such a terrible noise all night! The Air Conditioning was like a washing machine spinning in full spin cycle, the room was a nightmare. The bathroom and sink were split with no door on the sink section! In all fairness the maids cleaned the room spot on but we will never go back to this Hotel ever!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Staying at this Hotel, worst part of the trip! The room had a very Musty smell to it. You can hear your neighbors as if they were staying in the room with you. Bathrooms need to be updated. The average guest must be about 5 feet tall since, the bed was not long enough and the shower head was at eye level and I am not quite six feet tall. The pool area is very dirty, the pool towels were thrown in a pile on the ground. Not too pleased with the weekend staff! The price is great but, if you want to be nickeled and dime for everything else stay here. Cheap ...cheap...cheap! Did I say Cheap?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Midtown is in a great location, close to Newbury Street, close to the T, across the street from the Prudential Center. Hotel staff, especially Ron, is very nice and helpful. Ron went out of his way to help us and suggest places to go. Hotel is older and nothing fancy but bed was comfortable and room was very large. Sink is outside the bathroom which was kind of strange. Area where shower and toilet are is a bit small. Went to Fenway Park for the game - walked, kind of a hike but it was a nice night so it wasn't bad. Compared to other hotels I checked, Midtown is a good price, considering the great location.</p></li>

Easy access to Tourist Trolley car which is excellent for getting around the city especially on a short stay and if you want to see the city. Staff were very helpful especially the concierge who was from Kerry in Ireland - a lovely gentleman and very helpful. Initially we thought the car parking charge of $18 per night was a little steep but apparently this is normal if not better than most othe local hotels (according to the staff!) The only negative about this hotel (and it is not a major issue) is that the carpet running through foyer/hallways needs to be changed (badly) This hotel was perfect for our short term stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Midtown Hotel for 3 nights. Location is great - near shopping malls, 5 mins walk from a subway station, approx 25 mins walk to Boston Common and Downtown area. The outside of the building is really unattractive and the corridors are poorly lit with stained carpets so we didn't get a great first impression. However the room was huge with 2 double beds and a sofa. It was clean and well maintained. The bathroom was small but had a good power shower. There is no restaurant for breakfast but there is a cafe down the road. We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel and I think it is good value for a trip where you will be spending most of your time sightseeing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a value! We chose to stay here for the price and location when we went to a concert in Boston. I got a lot more than I expected for the price. Staff was welcoming the minute we walked thru the door. Our room was "clean!" I am that person who looks for the unknown hair on the floor or dirty (skeevy) blankets and I was pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness. The cleanliness is the reason for this review, staff would be second, and you can't beat the location! I will most definately recommend to everyone I know that is looking for clean, convenient, welcoming hotel this is it...the best bang for your buck in Boston!!! Thank you Mark at the front dest - you were wonderful</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a 2 story old building, lobby looks like 1960. The halls are dark and dreary, really is a typical motel of that era. In our first room there was no wifi signal. After awhile we realized that water was dripping from an old ceiling air conditioning unit onto the desk and carpet. We asked for another room and next were shown a handicapped room with a broken noisy air conditioner. The third room also had a broken noisy air conditioner . Finally we accepted a fourth room. Here the wifi (10$ per night) worked but would allow only 1 computer. We selected the hotel because of the location and the fact that is was relatively inexpensive. Well as usual you get what you pay for.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is reaaaally well situated, just behind Prudential Center and with a T station just in front of it. Everything is here, soap, towels, beds, TV, etc. The rooms are really wide and you feel comfortable. BUT the walls are really thin, you basically hear EVERYTHING. I had a bad experience with a neighbor the last night and the woman at the front desk barely did something: "Yes, I'll see what I can do...", at 5am. They talked, yelled and f*** all night long and the hotel didn't do a thing! Plus, there's Berklee University near the place, so you can musicians all the time rehearsing next to your room until 2am. Anyway, the location is perfect, and this is all that mattered.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel in Aug. 2011 for one night. We were in town to see a Red Sox game. The lobby area was nice with a gift shop near the entrance selling Boston souvenirs. The room is nice with a flat screen television. It was raining heavy and high winds ( Hurricane Irene ) when we there and the tv lost satellite reception. We called front desk about the problem and they sent someone who arrived within two minutes! He tried fixing it but you can't beat mother nature. We eventually got service back. The beds are comfy and the place is clean. The area around the hotel is 2nd to none. Wonderful neighborhood! If you have Red Sox tickets, parking is free for one night saving you $18.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is not fancy. But it is clean and sufficient. You can get amazing deals on the place, making it one of the best deals in the heart of Boston. If you're planning on seeing the Boston sites and not spending a lot of time in your room, this place is perfect, and less than a block from Metro stops. If, however, you want to spend a lot of time in your room and want to hang out at the hotel, this is probably not the best place. It does have a pool, but it's not fancy. It has a restaurant, but it's mostly sandwiches and pizz. This was fine with me, since I could afford this restaurant, but almost never eat in fancy restaurants at hotels. I thought the place was perfect for me.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I spent 5 nights here on our first visit to this wonderful city. The location is perfect and free parking in downtown Boston is fantastic. Have to agree with a previous reviewer that you need to ask for a room at the back of the property - the road at the front is VERY noisy. The rooms were well cleaned daily, the linen and towels changed and the knowledgeable and friendly lobby porter(s) were more than happy to impart their advice. Don't get me wrong, this hotel is not Holiday Inn standard, but for a budget hotel within 5 mins walk of the Prudential Centre and with a T-stop and Duck Tour stop virtually outside the door, it is a really good value-for-money Boston property.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We used to live in Boston and wanted to go back and visit with friends. We brought our 2 year old son with us and had a pleasant enough experience. They did not charge for the pack n' play crib - we were able to use the pool, located in the center of the building, but it was outdoors. It was very cold though! The rooms were a little run down, but basic - we spent most of our time out revisiting this city and just wanted a place to sleep/store our belongings. Our room faced Huntington Ave. - but it was really quiet - I've read the other reviews on how you could hear the other neighbors - maybe we just didn't have neighbors or just couldn't hear them?? The staff was friendly and we would go back. :)</p></li>

Our room was a great home base while we enjoyed the city and went to see our son perform at the music conservatory. All the basics were there for us. No frills. But the staff was friendly and very accommodating. Because you are less than a block from the Symphony station on the T, it is easy to get to many places in the city using the subway. We had difficulty with wireless access to the internet. But thanks to TripAdvisor coupon special on this hotel page, we didn't pay for it. We could only get a decent connection in the lobby. But I would say that this was the only downside. Overall, a wonderful experience. We plan to stay there again, next time we are in Boston.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel isn't expensive (for Boston standards), but you get what you pay for. My room had several burn marks from the hotel iron (I guess that person didn't like the ironing board). The walls are super thin as I could hear my neighbors' conversations, urination in the toilet, television, etc. I ended up waking up every hour or so in the middle of the night because whenever the heater turned on, it literally sounded as if someone was trying to break through my door (the heater is placed near the doorway). If you're in Boston for a day or two (no more than that), and you don't need to relax or get lots of sleep, then this hotel will work just fine. I don't recommend this place for vacation or relaxation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It is true that the Midtown is pretty no-frills - no restaurant, no fitness center, etc. However, if you want an affordable hotel in a convenient location, it's pretty hard to beat. Our room was clean, comfortable and quiet (as well as a pretty good size). The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is located about midway between the Symphony and Prudential T stops on the Green Line. The shops and restaurants at the Prudential Center mall are a short walk away, as are a number of stores and restaurants on Massachusetts Avenue. Pretty much any Boston attraction you want to visit is easily accessible by public transportation, which is really easy to get to from the hotel. I would absolutely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Came to Boston in September when dropping my daughter off at Berklee College of Music. The location was perfect for us as it was a pretty walk thru the Christian Science Church complex and their beautiful reflecting pool. At first we were a little put off by the status of the hallways. But we left early one morning and by the time we got back our whole section looked brand new. The room was much bigger than I had expected, and being a bit of a germ freak was worried about the bathroom, but it was spotless (thank you Marie â€“ our housekeeper)! The staff was very friendly, including David, the maintenance man, who changed the light bulb in our room. We have found our resting spot for the next 4 years for our Berklee visits</p></li>

<li>At first we were a little put off by the status of the hallways.</br></br></li>
<li>But we left early one morning and by the time we got back our whole section looked brand new.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#aaffc3" title="p=0.998">room</span> was much bigger than I had expected, and being a bit of a germ freak was worried about the bathroom, but it was spotless (thank you Marie â€“ our housekeeper)!</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1" title="p=0.999">staff</span> was very friendly, including David, the maintenance man, who changed the light bulb in our room.</br></br></li>
<li>We have found our resting spot for the next 4 years for our Berklee visits</br></br></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The first thing you notice when you enter your room is the stench of the cheapest Febreeze unsuccessfully used to hide the foul stench of molds. The towels are so old and worn that leave you feeling disgusted with yourself for having used them in the first place. Hallways and rooms aredark and gloomy. You have to pay $10 for Wi-Fi and the room had a very poor signal, so I couldn't use the Wi-Fi. They had DSL too, but I had no clue how to set up my laptop to use DSL. There is a strong humming noise at night that I couldn't figure out what it is, but had to sleep with earplugs. This hotel is cheap, located close to almost everything in Boston, and the staff are friendly, but its cheapness is completely not worth the bad experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place is a great deal for a no-fills overnight. Convenient location, clean rooms and friendly, helpful staff make this a winner. Any type of internet connection costs extra (either in room or in lobby), but we didn't need to stay connected on our overnight. Booking on-line on their site gave us the best price. We requested rooms next to each other, and they did us one better by giving us connecting rooms. No great views (room overlooked inner courtyard parking area), but they were quiet. Thornton's Restaurant, just a very short walk up the street, serves a good breakfast. Be aware that the showers are short - at about 5'10" I fit in, but had to duck down to wash my hair. My 6'2" son would find it difficult to stand up in the tub.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My friend and I stayed in the Midtown for 4 nites. Our visit to Boston was mainly for shopping. The Midtown is located beside the T line. The prudential centre is only a 10 min walk from the Hotel. The room was very big which allowed for the many shopping bags. our rooms were clened every day and we got cleans towels also. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The staff also arranged transpot for us to Wrentham Village and back to the airport. My only critiscism would be that there is no restaurant/bar or cafe in the hotel, but there is a litle cafe beside the hotel(at the T). All in all the hotel was a good choice although it was not the luxury of the Marriot up the street. Would highly recommend it for those who go for the shoppin!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked the Midtown knowing it was a middle range hotel but inspired by good reviews on Trip Adviser. The reviews were right. The decor is a bit tired and seen better days but that is more than made up for by the great central location, really good sized rooms and helpful staff. My wife and I asked when booking to be in a room near my son and daughter who also booked. After a disappointing hotel in New York which ignored all booking requests, it was a delight to arrive at the Midtown and all our requests met with no fuss. Indeed, they found us adjoining and linked rooms staff. The excellent customer service made for a really enjoyable stay. Oh. And finding there was a swimming pool there during a Boston heat wave was a real bonus. Well done Midtown and thanks.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is in a great location. The staff were friendly and it was very clean. However, the "motel" is just a made over Days Inn, and the makeover was rudimentary at best. We could hear every door shut all through the night. Televisions and conversations could be heard through the walls. The bathroom is tiny and the shower light cannot be turned on seperate of the vanity light which floods the bedroom area. Also, only a plexiglass partition (no door) between the vanity and rest of the room. So, you have to come out of the tiny shower dressed if privacy or modesty is an issue. We taped a Boston newspaper over the plexiglass. If you can swing one of the other hotels near the Prudential Center, do so. You'll be close to the train lines and have a much better stay.</p></li>

There are a bunch of good restaurants and pubs close by, and chain restaurants and shopping are also within a few blocks). I would probably stay there again for a reduced conference rate. I don't know that I would pay full price to stay there. I didn't go in the pool, but it looked nice and there were plenty of others using it.

It does not have amenities such as an exercise room, a toiletry kit, or a continental breakfast. But it is perfectly fine as a quiet place sleep - a good value for the money One thing that my wife and I appreciated is that it has on-site parking for $18 a day. No need to rely on valet nonsense.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A friend and I stayed here the weekend of the Pats-Jets game. Great locations - right by the Prudential Centre and its subway stop (which takes you directly to the Boston Common, and the start of the Freedom Trail) and the Back Bay Station (which we used to take the Patriots Train to Gillette Stadium). Lots of restaurant, pubs and the college-age crowd. Rooms were HUGE with lots of drawer space. Some people have commented on the odd bathroom design (the sink is outside of the bathroom) but I personally found it handy to have access to the sink while my friend was showering. Staff was professional and courteous. I did not use the internet at all while there so I have no comments about it. It was easy to get to the hotel and to exit Boston (we were driving). My only complaint are the thin walls! You can hear everything in the other rooms!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My girlfriend and i stayed at this Hotel at the beginning of December while doing some Christmas shopping. I had never been to Boston before and did not realise how local and compact it was. The Midtown Hotel is the ideal location to base yourself from and it is definately value for money. We walked everywhere and were just across the street from the famous cheesecake factory restaurant which we couldn't fault. The rooms were modern and very clean. My only worry was the connecting door to another room but thats my only bad point. The staff at the desk were very helpful and we booked our bus to Wrythem village from here. We were collected from the door and dropped back in the evening. I would have no problems in recommending this Hotel to anyone. Boston is a great city with great bars and restaurants and great shopping. Will definately go back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a great place to stay if you're looking for somewhere in the Back Bay area. Close to transport links including both Back Bay station (fifteen minutes walk) and the subway (Symphony is the closest stop and about five minutes walk), this hotel is great if you're looking to save money and see all Boston has to offer. The only disadvantage is that there was no restaurant when we were there, so sadly the convenience of B&B was out, but it does benefit from being close to several restaurants and a mall, which all serve great breakfasts! Plus, a twenty minute walk takes you in the direction of the main shopping area and the common which has a lot of choice. The rooms are clean and decent sized and the staff on reception were friendly. If you want something wallet-friendly then I'd give this a shot- don't expect luxury but it certainly is quality.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Actually, I should preface this with the fact that I recieved "Buy two nights, get one free." So my bill ended up being about $200 for three nights and an addional $18 per day for parking. For an urban area this hotel is acceptable. It is located about a block and a half from the Prud center and multiple subway stops. The hotel itself has it's setbacks, but these do not supercede the bargain. Originally we were put in a back room overlooking a parking lot with no table or desk. After requesting a better room, we recieved a view of the Church across the street and a larger room with a table. However, the room is old overall. It is not dirty, just run down. There's no bar or resturant on site. The desk employees were helpful and friendly, as was the concierge. Just an FYI there are quite a few Europeans here because it is a Berlitz recommended hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked the Midtown in Boston through hotels tonight (nothing negative to say about the app - worked great!) and did not have a terrific experience (though didn't have a horrific one either). Arrived really really late, and even though I had called before to enquire if that woul dbe okay, they had no record of this at the front desk. The person doing the check in looked like he was annoyed I was checking in so late, and as a consequence was not the least bit friendly. While the room itself was not small, they crammed too much into it (two double beds) so it made it feel really tight. So while it was clean, it was not very comfortable in terms of moving around, and also the bed wasn't too comfy either. Location is good, parking is relatively cheap for the area, and wifi was good. Got a coupon for free parking and wifi through TripAdvisor, so that was a bonus.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Midtown Hotel is very centrally located and easy to find and just a couple of minutes form the T-line. The rooms are really large considering the price and our room was clean with comfortable beds. However, the small window in our room didn't shut properly and there were no safe storage areas within the room (ie wardrobe safe etc) meaning we carried passports etc around at all times. Lot of noise from other rooms, not very good sound proofing, you could clearly hear people talking in the next room and if they flushed their toilet in the night it was loud enough to wake us up. The air conditioning/heating didn't appear to work either. Rooms were quite dark and as mentioned the whole hotel looked like it was in need of decoaration - our room looked like it hadn't been decorated for a good few years. All in all, a good price for a great location but very basic.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for its proximity to Fenway Park and the Museum of Fine Arts, with an easy walk to both. Room was clean, roomy enough for two, king-size bed, plenty of storage space. Bathroom was clean and sufficiently supplied; shower sprayer might be too short for some. Small fridges available for small daily rental fee. Front desk people were friendly, helpful, offered maps and directions. One night parking available for free if you present a Red Sox ticket, available through this season according to check-in person. Had a good late breakfast at Thornton's, just down the street. If you are sensitive to noise, take earplugs. Party in room beneath ours was noisy at 2:30 AM, but front desk responded to our call within 10 minutes. Walls are thin, some outside traffic noise. Overall good value for price. Got a great price by checking in repeatedly on their website.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel during March for a couple of days while visiting Boston. The hotel is good, it seems that it might have been a very good business hotel like 20 years ago, but now the place looks as if we were in 1980. Good things: the rooms are quite large, they beds are comfortable, they provide complimentary coffee and tea maker and it is 1 block away from the subway. Bad things: they do not have wi-fi, they charge you if you want to use the hotel PC located in the lobby, the bed covers are a little bit dirty and ours had cigarette burns, there is only 1 elevator located in the exact opposite corner of our room and to get to the elevator from the lobby you have to climb stairs (which is complicated when you have a lot of luggage as we did) Even when we had a good time, and our stay was pleasant, I think that you might be able to find a nicier hotel for the price they charge for the room</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This 2 story hotel is located by the Prudential Center on Huntington Ave. The room was well priced for the location in the heart of the city and parking is available on site for an additional fee. Room was clean and quiet although the TV was small and old, also WI-FI was only available for $9.95/24 hour period. A little pricey given most places have it free. Desk personnel were very friendly and access to tour buses is close by as is dinning. Garage was a little small but then we have a pickup truck. Had to get in and out by a service entrance as would any larger vehicle as main garage entrance/exit is too low. There was a coffee maker but fridges were an extra charge. The heating system is a little wonky but didn't bother us too much given temperatures outside where well above seasonal. Given the price of lodging in Boston this place is very reasonable and would recommend to everyone going there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My son and I spent two days here. Rooms are clean and basic, beds are comfortable. You get no extras like room service. Internet is NOT free ($9.99/24hrs), parking is not included ($18/24hrs), no ice machines, only soda and candy machines. Parking is underground of hotel, however, if you own an SUV it may not fit...my sequoia touched the building and just squeezed in. All you get is a place to sleep. Don't stay in front of hotel as road and people noise from campus at northeastern is very noisy. Also, they have 24hr security guard so that concerned me if there's issues in the hotel. The location is great for train and walking in the area. I also felt the cost could be equal to staying at other/better hotels like Sheraton, Hilton so look into it. In summary, if you just need a place to sleep and don't mind some local noise this is a decent hotel. Overall, we had a good experience with this hotel but will shop/price compare better hotels in this area next time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We just returned from a brief trip to Boston and stayed at the Midtown for one Saturday night. We chose it after reading reviews here that suggested it if you were going to a game at Fenway due to it's proximity to the park and low parking rates. If your primary focus is to be close to Fenway and pay relatively little to park and you don't care much about the actual hotel experience, this will work for you. On the other hand, I wouldn't recommend it if you are at all looking for a nice, comfortable, quiet and well managed hotel. Everything about it feels budget and truly, it's just a motel that they plunked down in the middle of the city. There's nothing horrendous to report, just a lot of annoying issues with the room and the overall accomadations. We were very glad to move on from the Midtown and stay at the Commonwealth which is also very near Fenway, but a quantum leap in experience. Yes, it's more expensive, but in the case of the Midtown Hotel, you definitely get what you pay for.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was delighted to find such a reasonably priced hotel in Boston, and had high hopes for my stay. Check-in was friendly and efficient and I was assigned a room at the back of the building. The first night was fine (mainly due to jetlag!) but I began to notice the noise on the second day; my neighbours (a dad with two children) spent all evening shouting and running about in their room. The noise went on until about 3am at which point I may have banged on the wall! That morning I complained to the very helpful Ron at reception, who moved me to another room. After a couple of nights of (relatively) uninterrupted sleep, the New Year's revellers began to trickle in and the noise became unbearable. The rooms are badly soundproofed (I could hear my neighbour's ablutions!) and the doors slam. It was also a shame that the restaurant was closed, as that was another reason for my choosing the Midtown. On the whole, a good, clean hotel - friendly staff, but if you want a good night's sleep you may be out of luck.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Midtown Hotel is a bargain with a great location and a superior staff. If you want to spend your money on 15 pillows and a heavenly bed, then you must. But f you plan on seeing Boston and not sit in your room all day, have a central location for walking, eating and Boston transit, and spending your money on Boston fun, then the Midtown is your hotel. It's basic decor and not fancy but it's clean, convenient and reasonable. I've stayed at the upscale hotels on business and for conferences and have heard every word and movement in the room next door. Ask for a room away from the street at the Midtown and you will sleep well in quiet; we never heard our neighbors. The staff at the Midtown were "heavenly", meeting all our requests and going the extra mile on two occasions. No room service but the close access to the Prudential Center with bridge to Copley and Shaws Market, made it convenient for a variety of eating choices which were more reasonable than room service. Thanks Midtown, you are a gem from the past.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our destination was Cooperstown, NY for a youth baseball tournament. My husband and I were traveling with our kids, ages 15 and 12. We flew into and out of Boston to see the Red Sox as part of our trip. I had read reviews on this website for various hotels and chose the Midtown from them. The reviews were right on and we were happy with the Midtown. Good price, plus a discount using AAA. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is older, but everything was clean and well kept. Our room was a good size. Parking underneath the hotel was reasonably priced and fairly secure. The location is great. Nice area, easy walking to the Prudential Center and Fenway Park. The subways are very close for farther desintations in the city, which we took several times. I would definitely recommend the Midtown for travelers on a budget, especially families going to see the Red Sox (note: do not buy grandstand seats if your family is tall!). I would not recommend this hotel to travelers looking for higher end accommodations.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Midtown was fine for just a couple nights with our children. Location was good - walking distance to Fenway & T stops. Front desk was helpful & a tour desk is also located in the lobby. The building is obviously old but they have done some remodeling - updated bathrooms, carpeting, etc. We actually stayed in two different rooms because we had an unwelcome "critter" in our room the first night. Managment addressed situation immediately and we were ultimately satisfied with their compensation. Our first room overlooked the parking lot (Free Parking by the way - big plus) -- the second was facing the street. The noise from traffic & people walking by was quite loud and that was difficult with our young children. Outdoor pool was fine - decent temperature, towels were provided, clean & attendant was on duty. Although Breakfast is Not included, the Cafe does offer a large menu for breakfast & prices and service were good. Overall - OK price for a decent locaton -- but we'll probably try somewhere else next time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is a blot on classy Huntington Ave and the whole city of Boston. It is a low rise grubby looking place resembling the worst motel in Hicksville. The staff are rude and its DIRTY and smells.The bath was slick with someone else's bath oil. The fan in the bathroom that went on with the light was so noisy it was like a motor bike at full throttle so even had the bath been clean there was absolutely no chance of relaxing in there, I went to the loo in the dark!!! At night the corridors reverberate with the noise from similar fans. Then there is the wiring, I assume this place has a fire certificate but I don't know how. The floors have trailing extension leads with multi sockets, plugging in an adaptor led to lights going off and flashing. I have photos of the wiring and intend to take this further. I would have left immediately unfortunately I was booked with GREAT RAIL JOURNEYS who used to have reputation for good hotels, not anymore. I strongly advise anyone going with GRJ to Boston to insidt on a different hotel</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First time in Boston with my daughter. First time driving on the wrong side of the road in an automatic car so my arrival at the hotel via a satnav was very frought. It did not help that our booking was done via Virgin and was done in 2 stages-4 nights broken up into 1 and 3 nights. As a result they did not realise even though I had sent an email before I had left. Our room for nights 2-4 were held for someone else. We were told to sort it on our first morning- no-one knew anything about it. Explanations all over again. Good for Fenway Park and Sarah's first baseball match. Free parking which saved us $18 by providing your ticket. Room was old, and overlooked the underground garage. Could be quite noisy as we were on the corner of a busy thoroughfare next to the drinks machine. Steps down to the garage and up to our room-don't bring heavy suitcases! Shaw has a great supermarket just up the road with the Cheesecake Factory nearby. Died and went to heaven. Great location for everything, Metro was easy,walked everywhere. Left the car in the garage for 3 days.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location, location, location. That's what the Midtown has going for it. Definitely worth checking out for parents with students at the schools along Huntington Ave. Right across the street from Symphony Hall and a block from Jordan Hall and BU/Huntington Theater. 2 blocks from the Pru. When we stayed, it wasn't cheap... but it was significantly cheapER than the other hotels in the immediate vicinity. It's very basic... kind of like a 1960's motel transplanted into the city. Skim the reviews and you'll find some complaints about cleanliness... our room and the corridors were clean, though dated and a bit institutional. AAA's two-diamond rating is quite accurate. The staff we met were extremely friendly and helpful. The parking was convenient. This hotel is not a destination. It's a place to sleep, for a few bucks less, while you do other things in the area. Worth your consideration if that's what you're looking for. We would certainly consider going back. But if you want an exercise room, places to hang out, lots of cable channels, luxury, onsite restaurant, or a view, check out the fancier places.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I expected old but I didn't expect this. There are flat screen TVs in the rooms but I don't think anything else has been touched in 20+ years. I had 3 rooms (246/220/204) over 2 nights. The initial room assigned had virtually no wireless signal, so I was moved closer to the lobby. That room had a marginal signal at best that dropped off frequently, so I moved again. With the last room very near the lobby, the signal was acceptable. While the Front Desk was perfectly gracious in making the changes, it's still a huge issue that they offer wireless but it's so ineffective in much of the building. I'm only giving it 2 stars for cleanliness but this is more a reflection of the room being old and shabby, not necessarily dirty. White socks worn around the room weren't black on the soles, so the rugs looked terrible but weren't actually dirty. The thermostat did work for temp control but the fan went from "off" to "jet engine" with nothing in between. The room did not have any fridge, nor did it have any convenient outlets for my laptop or phone charger. I moved the table around to make a suitably powered desk.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here at the start of our New England Tour,which was a package so we had no choice in our accomodation. Guess it must be cheap as most of the other hotels we stayed at were of a similar level. On a tour you only stay at a hotel for one or maybe two nights so you just put up with it and move on. Well,we were glad to move on from this miserable place! The room was dreary,although cleanbut the bed was comfortable, which was our main concern.Was extremely hard to turn around in the bathroom without bashing your elbows or knees! At least the room we had wasn't far from reception so we didn't get lost in the corridors( as many others in our party did.) It also overlooked the courtyard car park ,so was fairly quiet,although there were ,what sounded like a family with children above us,who liked to run the length of the room with their boots on! Tip: take earplugs! Would have liked an on-site bar to relax in during the evening too but we were told by our guide that the Christian Science Centre opposite had owned the land and stipulated that when the hotel was built,there was to be no alchohol sold on the premises.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Midtown Hotel while attending a conference at Northeastern University, and wanted to be within walking distance of the university. The rates are very reasonable and the room was basic, but spacious and comfortable. (I had a room on the street side of the hotel; rooms on the inner side were smaller). If you require luxury bedding, name-brand toiletries, room service and a fancy lobby, you won't be happy at the Midtown. But if like me you need only a clean and comfortable room for sleeping and showering, and spend most of your travel hours out and about, then this hotel might fit the bill. Reservation was made months in advance and there were no glitches. Desk staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. Great location, just a couple of blocks across from Prudential Center if you need a high-end mall fix, and a short walk to many restaurants, coffee shops and pubs if you want local fare. Close to boutique shopping on Newbury Street. Bus stop and the Symphony T station are a few steps from the hotel door, so you can go all over the city for a few dollars. I'll definitely try the Midtown again on my next trip to Boston.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I needed a cheap place to stay in the downtown Boston for a night, and took this off of Expedia. I did not expect luxury, nor does the hotel provide more than a clean, quiet room. But if that is the bargain that you want to make, then this hotel delivers well. The hotel is located on the south side of the river, just south of the big Christian Science complex. It is within convenient walking distance of the T, and there are lots of stores in the area that can provide fast food, perscription meds, hardware, and small electronics. The cab in from the airport had trouble finding the street address at ten at night, so print a map before you come. The staff is friendly and efficient: the concierge / porter in particular never failed to ask if I needed directions to where I was going. The room was huge (about 2X the size of a normal hotel room) but sparsely furnished and dark. I was on the back, away from the street, and it was reasonably quiet and free of glare from adjacent buildings and streets. No elevators, and dark hallways with a maze of room directions: make sure you know where you are going before you leave the desk. The bathroom was small but clean, hot water and pressure was good.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel itself gave us no complaints nor did it give us anything to rave about. With a "makeover" it would be really cute - however, the cheap early 80's furniture and the didgy appearance of the common areas would turn a lot of people off. The rooms themselves are very spacious - with a couch and dinning table ( although neither was comfortable or very good quality - even for a hotel! ). Our bed was not the most comfortable - but nor were many other beds in our 10 week trip! The staff were quite polite and willing to assist - and a bonus was being able to book tour tickets and be picked up and dropped off at the hotel door! The location was really good and lets face it...you are there to see the city or whatever, not to stay in a hotel room the whole time! It was an easy walk to the Prudential Centre and Newberry St with all the shopping and dining options you could ask for. And the FREE PARKING was a real bonus - considering that this is a more reasonably priced hotel. I would recommend this hotel to others - but with a warning that the decor is dated and not the best quality. So if you plan to only sleep and shower there - I would stay there and spend your money on a nice meal or shopping!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had read the mixed reviews of the Midtown and wondered what we'd encounter - but absolutely nothing significantly wrong with this hotel. Excellent location - very close to the Prudential and Copley centres - both fantastic places to shop, shop, shop! T stations close by - just so convenient. Wonderful views from the window of the Christian Science buildings. This place cannot be beaten for value AND location. Our room was the largest we'd had all holiday. Bathroom was small - but good enough for what you need it for. Beds perfectly comfortable. We had a room overlooking the road - no significant noise issues. The check in staff were very friendly. Yes they do charge for parking but 1) cheaper than other places and 2) once you parked it there you never need the car again. Plus, we had a late flight so they let us pay for another day's parking after checking out. Pool looked very good - but I overheard someone saying how cold it was so I avoided using it!! The corridors did smell a little of cigarette smoke (and I'm a smoker and can't usually smell it!) but nothing in the room (we had a non-smoking room). Yes - the hotel is plain and maybe a little dated but for it is value for money and excellent location we would certainly use again - just think about the extra money you can spend on shopping!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The layout of this hotel is a bit of a trip in time. It has a very long halls and is very low (looks like 2-3 stories high), like an old-school motel. There is even an outdoor pool in an enclosed courtyard, surrounded by floor-to-cieling windows and carpeted (that's right) floor. The style of the hotel sign kind of says it all. But if this is discouraging to you, it shouldn't be. Aside from the fact that there are steps (?!) leading to the first floor hall, everything else about the place is comfortable and modern enough. The room layouts may be weird (small bathroom with door separating it from the sink; no full length mirror), but the furniture is well maintained, the carpet is impeccable, the bedding is comfortable, and there is ample storage space. The room was also huge, even by American standards. Oh! And the windows open. The hotel has no in-house restaurant or room service but they recommend a great cafÃ© down the street and the keys advertise a dine-in service. My complaints were: a noisy vending machine above my room which made me request a change; the tub didn't drain well; the bathroom fan didn't seem to work. Above average: the friendly staff (90% of them anyway), and the proximity to the Hynes Convention Center at a comparatively super low price in relation to other properties in the area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were staying here because of a convention. The convention center is an easy one block walk, even in the winter. The Prudential Center which houses the convention center also has a plethora of dining options. There is even a full grocery store that is 24hrs. Laundry and a little diner and convenience store and even closer. If you exit via a side door, you are steps from the Symphony T stop. We paid $67 a night which is about what this hotel is worth when you add in the minifridge for $5 a night and the wifi for $6.50 a night. There is no breakfast. Parking is $18 a day. Pros beyond location and price are that the front desk is always staffed and very good, housekeeping is very quick, usually done by 2 PM, and wifi is pretty fast - we got 10 MBPS and could stream netflix. Cons - very thin walls which when the school kid trip came to town was really annoying. A lot of the vending machines were broken. The furniture, bathrooms, and decor were very dated. The heater is very noisy, as many have noted. We took to turning it on while we were gone then turning it off at night. The TV would have really weird static bursts on several channels making them nearly unwatchable. If you need to be at the convention center and don't want to pay $200 a night, then by all means, use this hotel. But, scale your expectations down accordingly. We enjoyed our stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at The Midtown Hotel in Boston for a long weekend over the President's Day Holiday. We paid $99 a night for our room, we were touring Northeastern University and given this special rate when we made our reservation. Such a bargain! We arrived at 12 Noon and although check-in is not until 3 pm we were very happy to learn that our room was ready. Check-in was quick and pleasant and we were given a map to help us navigate the city. I was pleasantly surprised with our room. I did not have high expections given the price. The room was spacious and clean. Furnishings were a bit outdated but not a big deal. I felt perfectly safe in the hotel. No restaurant, room service or mints on our pillows - so what. Don't go to a hotel like this with expectations of The Four Seasons. We were quite pleased with the great location of the hotel. We felt that the fee for parking our car was very reasonable for a city. We left the laptop at home, we came to tour the city and the school so wifi was not a concern. No complaints from me. We really just slept and showered in our room. Our bed was very comfortable. I could see how some claustrophobic guests might be uncomfortalbe in the small bathroom. I will say that the hallway was rather loud in the morning, it was not an issue for us as we were up and out early, but if you want to sleep late this may not be the hotel for you. If you have reasonable expectations you will not be disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I did a lot of checking when trying to find a hotel in Boston. The Midtown had the best price, and I received a AAA discount. Also, parking at any hotel is extremely expensive ($35.00 a night on average). The Midtown had the best price at $14.00 per night in a safe underground location right below the hotel. We didn't need use the car once!! Location of the Midtown was very good. We weren't right in the center of the city, but were close to many things. We saw a Red Sox game at Fenway and were within walking distance. We were very close to the Prudential Center where there is a mall and lots of shops and stores and restaurants. Also, very close to the subway, which we took to the North End for a fabulous dinner. There is a great little restaurant next door called Thorton's where we had breakfast twice. The staff at the hotel was friendly and accomodating. Although the hotel is a little on the older side, our king size room had new furniture and a very comfortable bed. The room was pretty big. Our room did face the main road (Huntington Ave.), but at night it was quiet and we did not hear any street noise. There was even a concierge who we asked a lot of questions to and we were given great advice. We even booked a trolley tour at a discounted price that picked you up one block from the hotel and looped around the entire city. It was great. All in all, I'd say this hotel is definetely worthwhile to stay at. It offers a great price and location. It's not as fancy as a Hilton or Radisson may be, but it was clean, comfortable and affordable. Recommended with flying colors!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was aware of the comments previously written about this hotel, but can honestly say that the hotel is clean, rooms are spacious and the hotel was handy for the subway. The desk staff are pleasant as are the housekeeping staff. We had booked for 11 nights and the first 7 were uneventfull, however on the 8th night we were kept awake till 3am by the room above us. My husband complained to the front desk and the noise did go down a little, and eventually at 5:30 it stopped. There were 3 groups booked into the hotel that day, one of them being high school kids who come to Boston for Uni visits. The next night was slightly better but the layout of the hotel is over 2 floors and there was an exit door at the end of the corridor which can be accessed 24 hrs, meaning that guests can come in this door without going past the front desk- resulting in many young people going past your room at all hours-noisy. I spoke with the manager on the second morning asking if the group leaders could remind their groups that other guests were staying in the hotel, and he informed me that the group was checking out that day- hurrah. However when we arrived back that evening another group of kids were checking in- my husband spoke to a very understanding girl at the desk, who said that this group were in rooms all over the hotel, but she could move us to another room at the back of the hotel which would be quieter. We then had the last 2 nights in peace. So I would recommend that if you intend to stay here in March/ April- ask for a quiet room. Apart from this one incident I would recommend thhis hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great Value, Dog-Friendly, Nice Pool, Convenient Self-Park”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent a great deal of time here while my mother stayed here on her visit to Boston. I used to be a hotel manager in Boston, and this is hands-down the best value you are going to get in the city, without question. One great perk is the self-park, which means you can come and go as you wish, without having to tip a valet each time. Just make sure you bring the ticket that you receive entering the lot, to the front desk to have it validated each time. The pool area had a lifeguard on duty, which is quite nice if you have children and like having that extra eye on your kids. The pool area is basic but very clean. There are tables and chairs there and it's sort of like a little oasis in the middle of the city. We also had a room near the pool, but there were no noise issues. The room is spacious and modestly updated. The only issue in our room was that the television was low, and not exactly in front of either of the double beds, but it was fine for us. While there is no breakfast at this hotel, if you walk one block west, you can find Dunkin Doughnuts and other places to eat. We did have a dog in the room, and there is an additional charge to have it in the room. Although this is of course not ideal, it is to be expected, considering that no other modestly-priced (under $200/night) hotels in Boston even accept dogs. The housekeeping staff was pleasant and always greeted us whenever we walked in the hallways. Best value in the city, with a great location as the icing on the cake. I am surprised that with how valuable real-estate is at this location, that it still exists and charges such modest prices. I would absolutely recommend to anyone who seeks a basic, comfortable, value steps away from Copley Square.</p></li>

<li>Best value in the city, with a great <span style="background-color:#008080" title="p=0.999">location</span> as the icing on the cake.</br></br></li>
<li>I am surprised that with how valuable real-estate is at this location, that it still exists and charges such modest prices.</br></br></li>
<li>I would absolutely recommend to anyone who seeks a basic, comfortable, <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">value</span> steps away from Copley Square.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">-Stayed here for two nights at the start of a New England tour and again at the end of tour for another two nights. Hotel overall was OK....small two storey hotel conveniently situated in city. Staff friendly and efficient. No restaurant on site but a Thorntons restaurant one hundred yards along street for breakfast and snacks, so too is a small convenience store, plus at the second traffic light turn right, walk fifty yards to a 7-11 convenience store, walk another 100 yards past 7-11 to a liquor store. Rooms good size but bathrooms tiny, with very small vanity area outside bathroom. Plumbing noisy on occasions. Plenty of towels, changed daily. Comfortable beds. For our first two nights we were in room 134 at the back of the hotel with a small window overlooking parking area and another opaque window looking onto interior corridor so very little natural light. However this room was quiet. We had no qualms about returning here for our last two nights in Boston. On our return we were in room 110 on first floor overlooking sidewalk and road, much more light, room spec the same but slightly larger with more storage space and more noise which however did diminish at night, except for the family of elephants in the room above ours. Maybe a good idea to ask for a room on upper floor. Diagonally across the road is The Prudential Centre for shopping and a food court. Check out the view from the 50th floor Skywalk. Just a few yards further is a large Shaws supermarket outside of which is the starting point for the Boston Duck Tour(very overated and overpriced, I would give this one a miss). With the exception of a splash down in The Charles River you would see the same sights on the city tour. The hotel is within easy walking distance of Copley Square, Boston Common, Quincy Market and very pleasant Frog Pond gardens. Plenty of restaurants and fast food outlets nearby. All in all a good place to stay without breaking the bank. Would stay here again if in Boston.</p></li>
