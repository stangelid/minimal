<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">About what you would expect from the Sheraton...exemplary service, above-average rooms, good business services. Nothing extraordinary like the Ritz, but a solid business hotel. The location was a bit out of the way if you are looking for the Quays, but I was on a business trip, so it was fine.</p></li>

The upgrade to the Club floor or facilities makes sense as it covers Internet and breakfast for the same price. But you should be able to choose the club floor or main restaurant for breakfast which is typical with most hotels.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hi, We stayed for 5 nights at the Sheraton Towers in Singapore. I would rate this is a very average hotel - the property is dated and needs refurbishment. The location is ok - a 10 - 15 min walk from Orchard. I would not recommend this hotel. I would recommend that people look at other 5 star options.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice hotel but nothing amazing either... its a little out of the way and seemed very quiet at all times. The pool was freezing as the sun was always blocked by the building and the gym was being upgraded. The rooms were very nice. I was some time ago when I stayed but i've been poor at reviewing... for the same price i could get an amazing marina view hotel so no real purpose to staying here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Sheraton for five nights. On the first day we checked in super early, 5:00 a.m. Nobody said a word, just checked us right in. We thought we had booked a room for that night. But turned out we messed up our booking and didn't have a room for that night. But they had space and just checked us in without any complaints. Very professional. Overall a great stay, thanks to the staff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed 3 nights in Singapore and chose this hotel due to its good location near Orchard Road and MRT station. The corner room we had was renovated and nicely decorated. The service was superb and the food way above average. We would definitely go back in the near future when visiting Singapore again. The only bad thing was that we had to pay a rather high amount of SGD 30.00 for a 24 hour WiFi access.</p></li>

If they offer a good deal and you dont mind the tied look and older feel to the place it is an okay place.</p></li>

The lady who checked me in gave me a room at monrning 10.30 and made it sound like a big deal (being early to their regular check-in hours) The hotel hasnt been renovated for ages (25 yrs or so).

The corridors and rooms have an unique smell that is bad, the rooms are not well lit and poorly equipped (CRT TVs!). The bathrooms are small and really badly equipped.

The hotel needs to renovate its interior and upgrade. The room was a bit small, kinda expected for a hotel in Singapore. Carpet and TV were very old. The TV was still the old type with tube at the back. The bathroom was small but functional. The bed was very comfortable. Plus points: Convenient. Very near an MRT station. Good service Minus points: Very old. Very outdated interior.</p></li>

Its situated on Scotts road, about 10 mins walk from Orchard Road, Singapore's premier shopping destination. But the hotel hasn't properly leveraged its great location. Food is just ok, rooms are average sized, interiors not really lavish and you don't get the feel that you are staying in a Sheraton property. Having said that, it doesn't mean that you won't have a pleasant stay. You will. But for the price it charges, there are much better options in the city.</p></li>

The breakfast was great and the fact that we could seat (if there was an available table) just besides the waterfall (on the other side of the window) was nice!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is slightly overpriced for what it has to offer. The location is excellent, quite close to orchard road, but definitely cannot walk, if you have a full day of shopping planned. We chose to live there with exactly that in mind. (shop till the wife drops!) The hotel building though they say is refurbished, still looks run down and dated. The service is good and there is nothing to complain. It could pass off as a decent business hotel, but for a city like Singapore where there is no dearth of choice,they need to up the ante.</p></li>

Staff very helpful, well maintained and decorated rooms and good breakfasts - although nothing like as good as at the Shangri-La! The hotel is just a few steps from Newton SMT staton but with Singapore's cheap taxis - these are your best option unless you can't get one, which seems to happen sometimes when you're away from a hotel.</p></li>

I had asked for a room for early check-in which was not provided (though they are not obliged to do this for me). The toiletries provided are virtually zilch (not even a toothbrush) just some ear buds and a shower cap. The bathroom fittings are not in the best condition and the mini refrigerator's door creaked.

With our busy daily business schedules, all the staff was helpful in assisting us with all our needs. The concierge, Xavier, even came in on his day off to bring us special dietary items we were unable to locate. Continuous, personalized service was amazing! I would suggest the Sheraton Towers to everyone I know visiting Singapore!! and the daily flower arrangements were very, very beautiful!!</p></li>

We were holding meetings on a daily basis in the hotle and all 10 of my colleagues had signed up for the weekely WIFI service at 107SGD each. But we found that this did not work in the board room, or that the connection dropped out. The staff were very attentive at getting us back on but this was a real pain. The breakfast at the hotel was fab. The location i thought was fine, straight across the raod from the mrt and a 10 minute walk to Orchard rd.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was decent - a usual Sheraton. The breakfast had a really good selection of food the days I was there. The metro is a very short walk. The only complaint is that there is nothing around it. I couldn't even find a place to buy water. I did find a 7-11 quite close though. Go into the metro and walk past the entry gates. The 7-11 is just past that on the right (underground). There is also a good food court (food hawker stalls) behind the metro on the opposite side of the street. Walk behind the metro and take the food bridge over the main road in behind.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sheraton is a very good business hotel to stay in: 1) Location is PERFECT -- Hotel is two minutes walk to/from the Newton MRT station. 2) Rooms are spacious and comfortable. The amenities are good, and the hotel just gives a lot of extra services to make you incredibly comfortable (8 pieces of free laundry a day... what more can I say?) 3) Service is amazing. The staff is courteous and helpful. If you give them a call for whatever need you have, the response is always quick. 4) View is amazing :) I guess my only comment about this place is that it is pricey. I wouldn't recommend this for people on a budget.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Always a first class stay at this hotel. Staff at all levels are very friendly and professional and nothing is too much trouble. Club lounge an oasis of peace most of the time, although the breakfast selection is slightly limited. This is perhaps due to constraints of space of the lounge and in any case I could also have taken breakfast in the main restaurant. Perhaps the only criticism (and this is across the Sheraton range) is that the bathrooms are relatively small and they still have a combined bath shower with curtain. This is a minor issue though and I would not hesitate to recommend my friends to stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice comfy hotel, conform Sheraton standards! Rooms are spacious, well maintained but for me ... Could be refurbished, not that it looks worn or whatsoever... But more too classic, old fashioned! A pitty is that they charge you for wi fi connection, even you are having drinks in the lobby, you need a paid voucher....!!! Unbelievable... Singapore itself is completely wifi, but Sheraton still charge you for that... In 2011!!! Location wise: very convenient, both for buss. Or leisure travelers! 3 min. Walk to Newton MRT Station and 7 min. O Orchard Rd I will rate average for the rooms, only for the decoration, not for the comfort!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel is generally good, with good communal areas and a decent pool and gym, but rooms are sadly dated. I was in a Towers room, which is exactly the same as a normal room except you get various extras, like access to the Executive Lounge and 6 (or so) items of free laundry a day. I did miss having 'Club Rooms' which you get in many normal Sheratons and are a nice middle between a standard room and a suite. Whilst these little 'Towers' extras were much appreciated (the executive lounge is great), a refresh of the rooms would go a long way. They're very dated and this really lets the place down, and until the rooms have had a refresh, I'd probably not return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights stopping over in Singapore on a trip to the Middle and Far East. The rooms and public areas are getting a bit dated and are no longer any comparison to some of the new or more recently upgraded properties. But what did impress us was the very friendly and attentive service we experienced everywhere in the hotel, right from the minute we entered through to breakfast and maid service. Tis certainly did make the difference. With the convenient MRT station across the street you are minutes from anywhere on the island and I can recommend this hotel to anyone looking fo a convenient and friendly spot, whether for business or pleasure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is our 3d stay at the Sheraton Towers Singapore...as with most Sheraton hotels in Asia, quite a bit better than the same brand in the US. Great location a few steps from the Singapore subway and within walking distance to Orchard Road and Newton Hawker Center. The hotel is not luxe but very clean, comfortable with attentive staff, very good food and very affordable. If the timing is not right to take the subway to the airport, the hotel will provide a affordable car service. All our stays here (and in Singapore) have been for a few days to lessen the impact of jet lag as we make our way to other areas of Southeast Asia...you really can't go wrong with this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I knew something was up when one of my Singapore contacts asked, "why are you staying at the Sheraton? Was nothing else available?" It was a nice place to stay, but is not on par with other Singapore Hotels I've been (Millineum, Four Season and Marriott ). The Sheraton's location is a long walk from Orchard Road, but close to the Newton subway station. The fitness center is nice and overlooks the pool. Breakfast at the restaurant was good, but my ceasar salad at dinner was horrible. The hotel restaurants are pricey and there is nothing in walking distance. Take a cab to Boat Quay or River front for a nice meal. I would stay here again, on business, as a backup option.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Sheraton Twrs for two weeks on business and found it comfortable and pleasant. The staff were very friendly and made a point of making me feel at home. The room was a good size for Singapore and well serviced. While the bar and dining areas are most pleasant and enhanced by water features and plants, there's not a lot of variety if one wants to use communal areas over a longer stay. The main dining room menu was OK, and the food was reliable. Love the juice lady at breakfast! The location is good - I preferred being a bit away from Orchard Road. Newton MRT station is a brief stroll away, and Newton Food Centre is most convenient for a quick and cheap meal.</p></li>

Rooms were clean and well maintained but the decor was very dated and old-fashioned. Bathrooms were quite small with shower over bath. Location is not bad - its just off Orchard Road, but Newton Circus MRT station is just two minutes walk away. If I was paying for the room, then I wouldn't stay here as there are better located and equiped hotels in Singapore for the same price. The swimming pool area and gym were being renovated so were not really useable during our stay. This is an ok hotel - you won't love it or hate it, and if you are doing lots if sightseeing in Singapore its fine as a base.</p></li>

The hotel is well located just steps from the metro station and a short walk from Orchard Road. The rooms are large and clean with most of the amenities expected of this class of hotel, but the decor and old TV are showing their age. Floor to ceiling windows let in a lot of light and room views are nice. Based on the rate I paid and the countless other options in the city I probably would not recommend this hotel to others.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">At US$149 a night for 2 with breakfast (booked through hotel.com) we did not have high expectations. The old, musty odour in the corridors thankfully did not carry over to the rooms which were comfortable enough. Drilling noise from refurbishments was annoying but stopped after 6pm. Gym was in temporary location due to refurbishments but at least there was exercise facilities available. The included breakfast was great and the concierge service was superb , staff going out of their way to find a suitable restaurant and make reservation for us . Location is not on Orchard but not far from it and the MRT station is close by. If looking for a value option in a central location this is a reasonable choice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is perhaps one of the great hotels of the world. In the times I've stayed here, when I arrive at the airport, there is a representative of the hotel there to greet me and put me into the taxi. I handed my bags to the taxi and the next time I see them is in my room. When I arrive at the hotel, I am escorted (early in the morning) directly to my room and I am checked in there and offered a night cap. When I leave clothes on the floor, and go about my daily business, they are laundered and hanging in my closet when I return. The restaurant has a great breakfast. The whole experience at the hotel is nothing like anything I've experienced in any other hotel in the world. Checking out is just as pleasant.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Sheraton Towers is located just few steps from Newton subway station. It is on Orchard road. The main lobby is really amazing and huge like some concert hall. There is live music and restaurants and bar. The lobby & reception staff is very helpfull and kind. The check in and check-out was really quick. Behind reception desk there is business center. The rooms are tidy but a little old style in my opinion. I prefer newly renovated in modern style. The deluxe room was the smallest from Sheraton that I have ever been and the same as bathroom. I had late 4pcheck out and it allows me to sleep to 12pm :) Depending of price I recomend to stay here. A little far from airport but really close to Orchard district.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed at the Sheraton Towers. We chose this hotel because we got a great deal with Starwood points. The hotel is fine if you don't mind the 80s style interior. The hotel is very much outdated and needs a good upgrade: old fashioned 'box' type tv, instead of flat screen, outdated interior, and a swimming pool which needs some serious retiling. In addition I thought the bathroom was very small and the breakfast buffet below average for the price we had to pay. On the positive side, I have to say that the staff were very friendly, especially Daniel the bellman. Also, the hotel room was clean, the beds quite comfortable and location was fine (near Newton Circus and Newton MRT station, 10 min walk from Orchard Rd.).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose this hotel because I was able to use SPG points and cash to book a room for 3 nights. Overall experience was fine, had a room on a high floor with a view of the pool. Size of the room was good and clean, and bed was very comfortable. It was really hot while we were there, so we made really good use of the pool at night after dinner which was very refreshing to have. Close walk to Newton food court with a wide selection of food and really inexpensive. The concierge was friendly, had helped me book my dinner reservation on night. Took the shuttle bus(not expensive) from the hotel to the Zoo. Took taxi to the Botanical Gardens. Never really had any issues with hailing a taxi from the hotel. All the staff was pleasant enough.</p></li>

There is a retro feel to this place that would seem even dated for the likes of Austin Powers, complete with faded carpeting, laminate doors to the rooms, and a frumpines that makes the Raffles Hotel appear cutting edge in comparison. Unfortunately, management have appeared to try the soft make-over approach by updating bits and pieces here and there when what they need to do is face the truth: the grand old lady has seen her days and it's time to close her down and renovate 'big time'.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel. The rooms have finally caught up with the outstanding service. Last night I checked into a beautifully reonovated room. Big flat screen tv, new carpet, new shower, new furniture. NICE! I have stayed at this hotel before and the service has always been excellent but the rooms were a bit tired. Now that the rooms have been renovated, everything is great. The Executive Lounge is relaxing and is managed by great staff. The Chinese restaurant in the basement is one of the best in Singapore. High quality, yummy dim sum for lunch! The fitness center is kept clean. NIce, friendly and helpful doormen, bell staff and front desk. Good transport options nearby (subway, bus) and 10-15 min walk to Orchard Road. I would recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stay at this Sheraton all the time mainly because the SPG points are a great value here. This location is steps from the Newton MRT, and it is extremely easy to get a taxi here (versus LONG taxi queues on Orchard). There's also a 711 in the Newton MRT for convenient snacks and drinks. The rooms are definitely dated and the whole facility could use a facelift, but the bed and sheets are fresh and comfortable and that's whats most important. 5 stars for sleep quality. Service is good. Very positive interactions with doormen, housekeeping, and frontdesk. One bad feedback I have is that the $20/day Internet occasionally hangs and times out. I hope they fix it. As long as the SPG points continue to be a good value, I will keep staying here when I'm in Singapore!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at the hotel a few times I've been to S'pore. Its a good property with very comfortable rooms. And for its price, a very good option in Singapore. The staff is courteous too. What I liked most about the hotel is its location. Within 5 mins (by cab), you can reach Orchard street - the busiest and most happening shopping street in Singapore.You can find all the big brands there. Not just that, at a minute's walk from the hotel is an MRT station (Newton). Thus travelling around the city becomes very convenient. And the hotel is away from all the hustle bustle providing you with just the peace you'll need. The hotel's pool is ordinary. However, The restaurants at the hotel serve sumptuous food. Overall, a very good hotel mostly for business purposes.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having stayed here over 10 years ago I was very surprised to find it in exactly the same state as it was in the mid 90's. The room furniture, bedding and fixtures are just tired and look pretty shabby now....and checking in and out took forever with only 2 people on the front desk at 7pm at night and 8.30 am when there was at least 8-10 people trying to check in and out. Although there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the hotel the price for value of the experience is way too high at SGD 370. I have paid far less for much better quality hotels in Singapore so would not go back to this hotel. For Starwood guests there also aren't starwood preferred floors - i did complain to the manager who simply told me that they were going to be renovated at the end of the year.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As a frequent business stayer at Sheratons in Asia region, but not having stayed this one before, it was a disappointing experience overall. Sheraton Towers Singapore is just not up to scratch for what is supposed to be a premium hotel brand. Property BADLY needs a complete overhaul throughout. Decor is old and tired. Fittings and fixtures are so 1970's e.g. small CRT TV in a cupboard; and I have not seen a shower curtain in a top chain hotel for over 20 years! Carpets are worn, room stale and musty smell. Jug did not work, and internet kept dropping out. Come on Sheraton, wake up and read these reviews on this hotel. This property is not worthy of Sheraton name. Before this hotel I stayed at Sheraton HK Towers and after stayed Sheraton Imperial KL. Now those are proper Sheratons!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at Sheraton Towers Singapore for 1 night, really to collect a stay from SPG bonus system. The hotel is located quite far from the Chiangi airport ( nearly 30 S$D by cab). But few steps from hotel there is Newton subway station - red line. So from airport You can take green lina and then make switch for red. By the walk from the hotel there is Orchard district - many malls, shops with best brands. By the metro it is just one station. The hotel lobby is really enormous and fancy. Live music and concerts. There is huge conference center. The hotel and room service is high quality. I give 4 stars because of room. The rooms need renovation and are quite in old style, like sheratons earlier. Especially I have claims according to the room main doors, You can hear everything from outside. There is gym and pool.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 1 night on my way through from India to Australia and used SPG points. Very disappointing hotel and the rooms are old and dated. Staff at reception are friendly and I was given early check in and late check out which was appreciated but sadly I was given a room with single beds. However, they're very comfortable and after 3 weeks on hard Indian planks the softness was very welcome. Also given a room on a lower floor to be away from the contraction noise but I wish I'd insisted on a renovated room. Tired, tired, tired. Old box analogue TV, over bath shower with a curtain that clings to you, carpets are brown and just look dodgy even though I'm sure they're not. Once renovation is completed I'm sure the hotel will be restored to it's previously excellent level but give it some time before staying there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had read the poor reviews and was a bit uncofortable travelling there but no need to worry. Just make sure you get one of the spacious club rooms. I agree with some of the comments that the hotel is a bit dated and it def needs an upgrade. The technology in the hotel is clearly gifted from one of the bond movies from the 80s. Anyhow, apart from that I didn't see a problem. Don't get me wrong, its not a 5 star super resort but for a businenss traveller it will do the trick. Good lobby area with plenty of room for working. Exec club is actually in great shape and the service there top notch. Rooms are spacious but dated (but clean and ok). A couple of good restaurants (not the least the Chinese) and generally good service. I wouldn't have a problem going back there next time I am in Singapore. Just make sure you get a good room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice hotel. Nice location with just a short 1 min walk to Newton MRT station. Orchard road is 4 mins on the MRT so there is always plenty to do around there. Service in the place is very good especially from the inhouse staff and butlers on the executive floors. The rooms are fantastic and if you get a room facing the pool then you get a nice view across the north of the island. Also the apples in the bowl where you get the lift on the ground floor are fantastic!!!!! Shame about the maniac piano player in the bar in the evening time.. She plays like a cross between Schuman and Micheal Schumacher. If she only slowed down it would be enjoyable. She plays so fast that one in ten notes are off so it takes away from what she is trying to achieve. But a very nice place in a nice location with nice people.. What more could you want!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am Platinum member of SPG, but this hotel is a shame for the SPG Group. Very high prices, lousy service. Upgradede to a Cabana room i was very dispappointed. Small and old unpractical room and a very old television with a few programs and very bad picture and this for nearly 400 SGD per day. If you on teh working table, nobody can pass behind. The location is not bad, but this is the onliest positive thing to tell. Even during Football worldchampionship there is no football transmission in the room (even small 2 and 3 star hotels had football in the room. After complaining, not even an answer received. An urgent Fax was lost (received by the hotel, but never forwarded to me). In the lounge, every day the brackfast exactly the same food and not a lot of diffeerent variation. really a hotel where you should never stay, unless you want to pay triple money for less service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I love this hotel; the employees have been working there forever and is always nice to see familiar faces when you check in. I arrived very early in the morning (6 am flight from Zurich) and was pleasantly surprised to find a room ready for me. The only problem I had was with the AC in the room, it leaked overnight and it soaked the carpet in the hallway (took me a while to figure out why my sleepers kept getting wet). Once I reported the problem it was fixed quickly and the follow-up was great. The breakfast buffet is good, for me the highlight were the freshly squeezed juices. Orchard Rd is just 10 min walk or a stop by the metro and the taxi from the airport is less than 20 SGD. And the best of the best- Newton Hawker Centre is 3 min away. If you have time- check out the new Marina Bay Sands- it is a cool building and it offers a great view from the top on a clear day.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Sheraton is located on Scotts Road, next to an MRT station, so you can easily access all of Singapore. With a 15min walk, you will also reach the main shopping street in Singapore 'Orchard Road'. Problem is, that directly next to the hotel is no 711 or any other small shop, so if you want to bring some drinks (prices in the hotel are high), so need to think of this ahead of time and bring from the city. I booked a suite, which was good, as we stayed in Singapore for 17nights. A normal room would have been somewhat small, if you stay for a longer period. The design of the room is rather conservative. A lot of dark would. Something you also find in a lot of hotels in the US. Not my taste, as I like modern design better. Being a SPG PLatinum member I was entitled to use the Executive Lounge, which I did for breakfast. Breakfast selection is limited, but service very friendly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent a week here on business. Room is large with the double bed being two singles pushed together. Breakfast had a good selection but staff were either too quick trying to clear a plate that wasn't finished (for something to do) or totally oblivious to plates stacking up (as too busy talking to each other). However, noise between rooms seems to be a weakness, one can hear baths and showers running in rooms above and to the side often at 1am in the morning. The (old) TV had its sound set very low and the handset control didn't work and the adjustment panel on the TV was screwed shut with a philips screw! Minimal choice of channels. Internet is not free anywhere in hotel and costs S$10 per hour or $21 per day! Newton MRT station is next door (left out of hotel) and Orchard Road a 15 minute walk (right out of hotel). Until the refurbishment is completed other hotels offer more appeal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here in October 2011 for four nights. I figured that for the fancy room rate, the rooms would be exquisite. Obviously not. I've no idea when this property was last renovated, but the rooms are very 1980s. The bathroom is tiny, with a tub you have to climb into to have a shower (no problem with this in cheaper hotels, but for SGD 350?), the television is an old fashioned cathode ray version, with its own fat wooden cabinet taking up too much space, and the carpet is a little unhygienic. Internet connections are steep, and did not work in the conference room or lobby - only the bedroom. Very poor value. The safe in room 820 did not lock, and assistance arrived too slowly to fix it - so I had to spend time craftily hiding valuables and locking my suitcase. The toilet was hard to flush. On the plus side: location, the shower temperature fully adjustable, and the bed was wonderfully comfortable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having just recently stayed in 5 hotels in Sinagpore in 10days. I thought that $500 a night I had to pay would get me an exceptional room with breakfast. Instead I got a standard room which was smaller than anything else I had stayed in plus it looked like it had been decorated by my grandma. It had nice flower prints and no breakie. Got a bar bill added to my final account when asked to see it as I had not used the bar they could not find it. Eventualy the money was taken off me bill The only good things were the curtains blacked out the day giving me a good sleep and the pool was a nice size for getting some laps in. Would recommned staying in the Grand Copthorne Waterfront instead much nicer and cheaper. Also do not be taken in by the taxi mafia the white mercs out the front do not use meters and charge a fortune. So getting a normal meter taxi is hard as the door mafia do not allow them to wait outside.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was very very disappointed by this hotel, considering it is supposed to be high level. It should not be part of the Starwood group anymore. Nice lobby and that' all. The rooms (I have tried too) are old stile, not ancient, just old. No amenities in, not even the hanger for the towel in the bathroom. It is totally not children friendly. The only nice person was a receptionist. We even cancelled the reservation for 1 night on 2 and the day after they were wondering why we were leaving! They didn't take note of our changes. I have booked asking for a crib and when I was there the crib wasn't yet in the room. Then, after one hour, they arrived with a BED, not a crib. During dinner, the waiters spent their time texting messages on their mobile and taking pictures! It was unbeliavable. I think they should train their people better and change totally their rooms, as they do not respect the "supposed" level of the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After so many bad reviews on Tripadvisor, my partner and I were a little bit reluctant to stay at the Sheraton Singapore. We almost cancelled our booking. Eventually, we stayed three nights there and we have to admit that this is a good value for money place. First, it's very convenient, easily accessible from the airport, and very closed to a subway station (Newton). Then, if it's not the last fashionable crazy design boutique hotel you can see in many trendy magazines, this is a very confortable Sheraton hotel. Everything is very easy there. Rooms are OK, just what you need after a long trip from Europe. Ours was very quiet, facing the park on Scotts Road (rooms on the rear face a construction site that might be noisy). Not far from the hotel, there is a wonderful food hawker, with plenty of varieties of food, for a very affordable price. Just cross Scotts Road and go right before Newton Circus (5 min walk from the hotel)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I usually stay at this hotel every time I'm in Singapore as I'm a Platinum member of the SPG program. (The only other property,until next year's opening of the W, is the St. Regis, which, for me, is usually too expensive both dollar and point wise). The pluses, for me, are: 1). convenient location which allows me to take the MRT from the airport to Newton (S$2), which is a 1- minute walk from the hotel. In addition, I can walk to Orchard Road in about 5 minutes. 2). I usually get a suite. 3). The Club Lounge is quite nice and offers a good selection of food for breakfast and evening cocktails. 4). I can stay for points +US$60. (I'd never pay S$300, which is the usual room rate including tax). Minuses: Rooms are fairly small and showing their age. 2). The check-in staff, unlike the wonderful lounge staff, are not the friendliest I've ever come across. Looking forward to the new Westin in Marina Bay, but, unfortunately, it's not due to open until 2014.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for two nights on business. Location is great for shopping and sightseeing, since it is a few blocks from Orchard Road. It also has a metro stop right next door. It is also right next to the Newton Circus Hawker Center, which is a great place to get a good seafood meal cheap. If you're doing business downtown there are closer hotels, but nothing is very far away in a country this small. My business was at Suntec Center, so I had to take the metro and then walk through the usual underground shopping malls to get to work. The Ritz Carlton, Conrad, etc, are walking distance to Suntec but very expensive the days I needed them. This hotel is a bit old and dated, but the rooms were fine and the restaurants have good food (but I would eat at the hawker center for 1/10th the price!). I would definitely stay here again. The highlight of my stay was that the rate Amex got me included 8 pieces of laundry each day, and free drinks for happy hour! Yeah! That's what a business traveler needs!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What this hotel lacks, it makes up by providing exceptional service. I have stayed here a number of times mainly because I am an SPG member. But I have also been impressed by the good service. This time, service was first class. When I booked this hotel, I requested a high-floor room overlooking Scotts Road. In all my previous visits, I was given a room in the back of the hotel. The views from there weren't all that interesting, and faced a construction site. This time, I had a room with an unobstrucive view of the Scotts/Cairnhill skyline and busy Scotts Road traffic. Front desk confirmed on check-in that they had received my requests and were able to accommodate them. Everyone at the hotel was so courteous and helpful, the bellman took my luggage from the taxi and brought it up to my room, and described all the facilities in the hotel and in my room, like he was so proud to be working there. Also, the hotel is so close to the Newton MRT station, which is only a stop away from Orchard Road and is nowhere as crowded as Orchard MRT.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked this hotel for a couple of days' trip with my husband. Got there at 1030ish am, and it took us at least 20 minutes to check-in - no one was at the SPG counter and there was a long line. Upon checkin we were told that our room was not yet ready so we left to get some lunch and came back at 130ish - our room still wasn't ready. We waited at the lounge UNTIL 3PM - seriously, how long does it take to clean a room?!? When we got to our room we were expecting our luggage to be sent up without having to tell them - no luck. Called them to followup. After 10 minutes room service knocked on our door and asked which luggage did we need help sending DOWN. I was dumbfounded - uhhhh we JUST checked-in?? We need our luggage to be sent UP not DOWN! Took them 20 more minutes til we got our luggage. Pretty much wasted our entire day. Plus their suite was just okay - not up to SPG's typical luxurious standards. Hotel building's pretty old I guess. The only great thing about our stay was that the executive lounge had free drinks and finger foods during happy hour.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There's enough on the site to tell you this hotel needs a redo. What does someone considering the Sheraton need to know? 1. Its very close to Newton Circus SMRT station - one stop to Orchard then on to the City, Geylang and Marina. Down hill walk to Orchard road takes 10-15 mins. You could SMRT from Airport but taxi is less than $20. 2. It has all the basics you need but is closer to Holiday Inn than usual Sheraton Towers. 3. If you get deal its value. Spg site offered me $S215 and thats a deal. A friend got a room on Priceline for $US119 in June - thats a deal The rooms are OK but dated. TV not flat screen (not an issue for me), bathroom OK. The buffet breakfast was good including eggs cooked to order etc. It was included in my rate. The pool is big with nice surrounds. Check in was poor. I got stuck behind mainland Chinese trying to work through the issues of haggling down their rate for CNY - give me a break!. Several staff stuck their heads out from the back but it took 15 mins for any to come. They did offer late check out since i arrived around midnight.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I don't really know where all the complaints about this hotel are from! Sure, it's not right in the middle of bars/restaurants. Sure, the rooms don't have flat screens. Sure, the decor isn't inspiring. But it is clean, the service is good, and the rooms are comfy. I liked the location. It wasn't in the noisy hubbub, but it was right next to (literally a 1 minute walk) to a subway station, which can take you anywhere you'd want to go. It's also only a 5 minute walk to the Newton Food Centre. The rooms are very standard Asian Sheraton - not flashy, but clean with comfortable beds and sheets. I don't know why people complain that the decor is boring. It is, but if you want unique decor, go to a boutique hotel, or at least a St. Regis or Four Seasons. I really don't think Sheraton is ever known for having amazing decor. I also didn't find any weird smells, and the construction next door had finished when I was there, so it was very quiet. My one complaint is that the room service food was terrible! Really bland, uninspiring breakfast foods and equally bland desserts.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I just returned from Singapore and stayed at the Sheraton for 4 nights for our 25th Anniversary. While the hotel is nice and within walking distance of all the great shopping and restaurants of Orchard Road, I was extremely disappointed in the service at this property. Although I was upgraded to a suite as a Platinum, this was the ONLY amenity I received (ie., no complimentary breakfast or even a morning newspaper, which I thought was standard!) However, when I checked in I was told that since I was paying a discounted rate, which I booked on the Starwood web site, I was not entitled to the "normal" amenities afforded Platinum members! I have stayed at Starwood properties all over the world and have never been told that you had to book a certain rate in order to get the standard amenties. Ironically, one evening my wife and I were on the elevator and I heard another guest complaining of the same thing. I have no idea what rate you have to book to get a newspaper, but you can be sure that they are losing more than the price of a newspaper by treating guests this way.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Based on some of the previous reviews, I wasn't expecting much. But after staying here for two days, I wonder if I am staying at the same place as all the negative reviewers. My room was well appointed - old world - but well appointed, immaculately clean and in great shape. The staff has been really excellent. Breakfast was very good. The Chinese restaurant very recommended by a native and really good. Laundry was well-done. I have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in KL, The Sheraton in KL, The Meridian in Ankor Wat and the Sheraton in Bangkok - all different styles but the Sheraton Singapore compares favourably. Its 10 minutes walking from Orchard Road....it wasn't that out of the way. It is definitely a 4.5 star hotel - not quite a 5 star but still very good nonetheless and I didn't experience any of the negative things I read in the other reviews. In any case, it was a very nice place for a business trip and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a friend or family. As for the internet access.....it's the same price as any 4-5 star hotel I have stayed at in North America, Europe or Asia in the past year.</p></li>

<li>But after staying here for two days, I wonder if I am staying at the same place as all the negative reviewers.</br></br></li>
<li>My <span style="background-color:#aaffc3" title="p=0.998">room</span> was well appointed - old world - but well appointed, immaculately clean and in great shape.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1" title="p=0.999">staff</span> has been really excellent.</br></br></li>
<li><span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">Breakfast</span> was very good.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.997">Chinese</span> restaurant very recommended by a native and really good.</li>

<li><span style="background-color:#e6194b" title="p=0.978">Laundry</span> was well-done.</br></br></li>
<li>I have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in KL, The Sheraton in KL, The Meridian in Ankor Wat and the Sheraton in Bangkok - all different styles but the Sheraton Singapore compares favourably.</br></br></li>
<li>Its 10 minutes walking from Orchard Road....it wasn't that out of the way.</br></br></li>
<li>It is definitely a 4.5 star hotel - not quite a 5 star but still very good nonetheless and I didn't experience any of the negative things I read in the other reviews.</br></br></li>
<li>In any case, it was a very nice <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.996">place</span> for a business trip and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a friend or family.</br></br></li>
<li>As for the <span style="background-color:#d0d0d0" title="p=0.999">internet</span> access.....it's the same price as any 4-5 star hotel I have stayed at in North America, Europe or Asia in the past year.</li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is located within a 10 minute walk of Orchard Road on Scotts Road. Check in and out was very efficient. The rooms are nice with a comfortable bed and good air conditioning though the hotel is a little old. Breakfast offers a good assortment of fruits, cereals, western and Asian style food but the seating area can be crowded during the week around 7:30 AM. An attendant dressed in white safari hat, white shorts, white shirt, white shoes, white socks and Sam Browne belt efficiently assists in catching a taxi. To catch an early flight, the attendant is also very helpful in scheduling a taxi for you. In rush hour, the hotel was about a 30 minute taxi ride from the airport, with minimal traffic the return trip was close to 20 minutes. My only complaints would be that the water temperature in the bath/shower was not real hot even when turned up to the maximum temperature; it was the same 3 days in a row and that the internet costs about $SGD30 per day. For a business traveler it is well situated close to the subway and the close walk to Orchard Row offers relaxation while walking around viewing shops and people.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We reently spend two nights at the Sheraton Towers Singapore and found it to be a typical, average Sheraton branded hotel - unfortunately. What we did like: The executive lounge was very nicely decorated, the staff friendly and the food/beverage selection very good. The staff is very friendly and helpful, especially the staff at the (very nice) gym was super nice providing us a locker to leave a change of clothes until we left later that night. The location is good with direct access to the subway system, one stop from Orchard Road. What we did not like: The rooms desperately need upgrading, the carpet was worn and dirty, the wooden cabinets had scratches, the entire room was dark, the balcony lights did not work and the TV is a 80´s square box. In my opinion everything needs to be replaced... The breakfast selection is fine, but nothing has any flavour...does not compare to many other Sheraton hotels we stayed at. The public areas are just ok, again in need of an upgrade. In general, for the amount of money they charge, especially in high-demand times, one can stay at significantly better hotels - and next time we will.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has a good location and close to MRT. The hotel room is quite old and should be refurbished. TV is small and outdate. It is a must to change. We are SPG platinum member and we were not offered to upgraded to the best available upon our arrival with the reason our reservation is made through the travel agency. In fact, the hotel did not recognize my SPG status at all. My travel agency has submitted my SPG number together with the reservation but somehow, the hotel advise that nothing has been received. There were lines at the reception counter due to there were only 2 staffs on duty at all times. However, after a long talk and insist, they manage to upgrade me on our last night to a suite room. (??) The hotel also refused to give me points due to the travel agency booking. In Middle East and other continents, I always use travel agency and always get points but not here. The management should have looked and review this policy. We like the location but not the services here. Must be one of the worst Sheraton we had ever been in term of service and room style. In room internet, connection is bad and low signal for wireless access.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Did a quick weekend trip to Singapore from Hong Kong thanks to the low airfares between the two cities while United still runs its 747s. It was one of those whim type of things so I decided to just walk into the Sheraton Towers to get a room for a night or two. The front desk person quoted me a rather obscene 380 SGD for one night, but as it was late at night and I was too tired to try to haggle or try another hotel, I decided to bite the bullet for one night. The room was very unimpressive, I think the Airport Crowne Plaza which I previously thought was overpriced is actually better. The room was obviously clean, as this is Singapore, but I never really felt I got what I paid 380 SGD/night for. The Newton MRT and Food Centre (closed when I was there) are very close which was somewhat redeeming although those were considerations which brought me to the hotel in the first place. I will definitely stay elsewhere next time though. I would be OK with paying even 500+ SGD/night for a hotel room if I felt I got my money's worth, but I never felt that during my stay here. Actually, even the way some of the staff looked at me made me feel a bit uncomfortable at times.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">first time in this hotel and stayed for a week. Hotel is north of orchad road and is a few minutes away from the MRT station. Check in no problems and was well looked after with someone taking my luggage up and showing me the room. Initially the internet won't work and has to called room service. Apparently router needed to be reset. However, there is no wireless service so mobility is restricted with a LAN cable. Tried out the gym a couple of time which is good. Plenty of staff around to provide assistance if it needed to be. Second half of my stay sign up for the executive package where it included access to lounge facilities, free laundry and breakfast room service and plus a few other things I didn't use and cannot remember. In room breakfast is always on time and it is nicely done. And the buffet breakfast is also qutie good. No sure if I will sign up in the future as apart from room service and free laundry, I tend not to use the other goodies. Overall felt that the hotel room needs a bit of upgrade. The TV is still the old type CRT unit. The rate is relatively expensive. So I would not recommend that to a friend, there are better places to stay for leisure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">SPG platinum...not upgraded. If you book a room with two single beds, keep in mind they are very small single beds. As soon as I walked into the room and realized how small the beds were, the lobby called to ask how I liked the room. I think they suspected I wouldn't like how small the beds were (they are single beds, not like two queen beds in the U.S. or in other countries). They moved me to another floor with a king, and facing the garden/pool (even numbered room) versus odd number facing the city. I arrived in SIN at 130A and the cab cost $25SGD...less than I expected. The ride took about 20/25 minutes. Taxis are very very inexpensive. The MRT (Newton) and bus stop are a 1 minute walk away. The breakfast in the exec lounge is great...eggs, breakfast meats, tomato, cereal, pastry, fresh squeezed orange juice. Had dinner at restaurant downstairs and the price was fair and meal was very tasty (had western food - salad/salmon/dessert). No other restaurants around the corner, you'd need to take a cab, but they are really cheap... I would stay here again; it's not the nicest Sheraton in Asia and hasn't been renovated in a long time, but it's good enough. And staff has been very friendly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stay at this property multiple times per year, but only as a way to continue requalifying as a Starwood Platinum guest. When I am in Singapore for more than a night or two I will stay at other places as the pricing is about the same as the Sheraton and there are too many reasons NOT to stay here: 1. Location--OK, the Newton MRT is next door and the Newton Food Center is a short walk away, but that's it. If you want to go anywhere else in town or shop you need to take the MRT there. 2. Old and musty--I understand that the rooms are being remodeled but even in one of the newer rooms there is a musty smell. 3. TV--old TV's and poor channel selection. I would expect at least AXN to be available! 4. Executive lounge food--poor with virtually no selection for either breakfast or evenings. The downstairs restaurant is quite good for breakfast buffet and a much better choice. 5. Staff...while much of the staff, primarily around the bars and restaurants are fantastic, I have found some of the back-office staff and management to be less than stellar. I will continue to stay here, but only until I requalify on my status. As I said, any stay longer than two nights is absolutely going to be somewhere else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I wouldn't stay here voluntarily if it was the last hotel in Singapore. Last time I had problems, this time also. Unfortunately I travel to Singapore for work (love Singapore, hate this hotel). Pro: the pool is OK Cons: DO NOT stay at this hotel if you want twin beds. My partner came with me this time, we like twin beds rather than one shared bed. The twin beds are single beds, but the last time I slept in a bed this small was when I was on an operating table. Go almost no sleep. Husband said it was like being on a rotisserie - you had to wake up to turn over or you would fall out of bed. At the moment (July 2011) the hotel is doing renovation works on the upper floors. Be warned. We were orginally put on the 17th floor. The noise was really bad - pneumatic drilling and sawing and hammering all day. They just put guests there and hope they won't complain. I got 'oh, so sorry for the inconvenience". This is a typical response at this hotel. I had to push hard to get moved, but eventually we moved to the tenth floor. Total disrespect for guests; I can't believe that the hotel thought it was acceptable to expose paying guests to that level of noise. Do yourself a favour, there are countless better hotels in Singapore.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">BADLY DATED AND RUN DOWN is what their own website describes "timeless style and grace". I believe that this hotel was already outdated on the day it opened. The choice of finishes and furniture is distasteful now, and was then. The design and condition of the Front Desk Area is simply appalling. Rooms are small and are badly plagued with mildew. Old fashioned TV sets, bad ones at that. Intermittent Internet service, which comes at a very high price. Bathtubs with shower curtains, no separate showers. Club lounge breakfast and happy hour food is way below standard. A floor-by-floor renovation is ongoing at the hotel. One should make sure to avoid the floor directly below the construction. Come to think of it, should consider avoiding the hotel altogether until it is brought up to 21st century standard. Location is convenient, not far from Orchard Road, and right next to the Newton MRT (subway) station. Staff is adequate. Starwood is thinly spread in Singapore. Since the closing of Le Meridien, it is left only with Sheraton Towers, and recently opened St. Regis. This is not nearly adequate. If one wants to stay at a Starwood hotel, should opt for the St. Regis, which is new, elegant and up-to-date, and which for about a 10% higher (paid) rate is a far better value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel needs to lift its game. I arrived on an overnight flight and was exhausted. I was teaching night classes so needed to get some sleep during the day. Both days i was there I was woken by the housekeeping staff trying to get me out of the room so that they could make the bed. I was incredulous! I had the do not disturb sign on the door. Despite that, on day one they knocked on the door continuously and when i ignored them, they phoned me!! I was so angry, I rang and complained but it obviously had no effect whatsoever because exactly the same thing happened the next day. I phoned and complained to the duty manager, got some pleasantries and then 'so would you like somone to come in and do your room now madam?'. I nearly imploded. Clearly their only concern is to meet their regulation amount of bed-making and no idea of customer comfort. The customer's needs and eccentricities don't matter, the rules do (although I wouldn't imagine that daytime sleeping in a hub of global travel was all that eccentric). My suggestion, put do not disturb on the door and also ring and ask the operator to put a DND on the phone. I wouldn't know if it worked the third day because by then I had moved hotels. Yes Sheraton, when you are working it's the little things that matter - like sleep.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the towers for a week during a business trip during the end of august and the beginning of September 2011. From the time you arrive the valet is very welcoming and friendly, lobby is beautiful and the front desk personnel are excellent. The bell boys are ready to serve you and they don't expect that much tip but their service is worth a nice one. The rooms are nice and clean, however, I was expecting something nicer for the money I paid per night $300.00 sin/ dollars. Breakfast was between 21 and $40 dollars per day and the close restaurant or place to eat was at least a 15 min walk with a 80% humidity waring a suit it didn't feel good. Also, for use of the internet you had to a daily fee of $29.96 Sin. I had to use the dry cleaning service an they charged me $147.00 sin for a couple of dress shirts, some 4 t-shirts, a few pair of socks and a handkerchief. The pool and gym facility were average and clean. They also have a SPA which one of my co-worker used and the service was very good according to her. Security wasn't a concern at any time in Singapore and the people are very educated and friendly. The food at the hotel restaurant is great and everywhere else too. There is a subway station 1/2 a block away from the hotel and taxi,s are everywhere. I'll add photos later.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent several days here as a base while waiting to join our cruise. Our luggage was lost by our airlines and we were very stressed about that - being worried about having nothing to wear on the cruise. We found the hotel's service to be excellent, especially the assistance of the concierge, Xavier, who stayed in contact with the airline and the airport chasing our luggage on our behalf and allowing us to enjoy a bit of a vacation in Singapore rather than spending all of our time chasing our lost luggage. His helpful attitude and assistance reduced the stress and worry caused by the loss of our luggage. The hotel is not Raffles, nor is it the Marina Sands, but it met every expectation we had. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom very nice and spacious, the shower rainhead very refreshing and the room large, clean and comfortable. The hotel is about a 10 min walk from the shopping on Orchard and I enjoyed every bit of it - walking past several colonial homes on Scott which you wouldn't see otherwise. The service made this hotel an excellent experience. It is nice when things proceed flawlessly, but I believe you really see a hotel's service ethic when they are presented with issues to overcome. This hotel performed excellently, recovering from a check in glitch and stepping up on the lost luggage issue.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As my husband is a Starwood ambassador who travels all the time I consider myself a bit of an expert on Starwood hotels and hotels around Asia. I booked this hotel on points with low expectations and almost didn't book it because of the poor reviews. The hotel is much, much better than the reviews! I stayed in a refurbished reviews that can only be described as grand. Anything in the bathroom that can be marble, is (even down to polished marble floors, which are found throughout Asia to my chagrin). The bed is comfy, the executive lounge top notch albeit with a smaller selection than some other Starwood properties, and the lobby is exquisite. If you like marble or orchids you will love this hotel. My biggest grievance is that the pool doesn't take advantage of all of the sunlight. I like sunbathing, and like many other Starwood properties part or all of the pool area is in the shade when the sun is shining, which is all too rare in Singapore with the rainstorms. This isn't something unique to the hotel, but my biggest grievance. Also, upon check in I was given free executive lounge access and Internet in the rooms. Hurrah! I truly believe Internet in the room should be standard at all luxury hotels (the price is really high here otherwise) and lounge access should be granted to anyone booking on points. But that's just me and may not be a fair expectation. Just make sure to ask for a renovated room. You won't be disappointed!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've given this a poor rating because for the amount you pay for this hotel it's an absolute shambles!! Let's start with location, it's not bad.. on Scots road and a good 8 min walk to tube and the main shopping st. Staff, are poorly trained!!! we was staying there for a friends wedding... and on the wedding day, myself and my husband was suppose to travel with the family in the coach which was hired by the bride and groom. We explained this to the reception, that if a coach comes, pls ring us in our room. Instead we heard nothing and had to explain to the receptionist that we did asked someone there to ring us.. and in the end we just had to catch our own taxi!!! Luckily we made it to the church on time! - Staff was completely incompetent! I spoke to the bride and groom what had happened and they too was disgusted by the services as they too had warned the reception staff to contact everyone on the list who was suppose to be on the coach to the church. The room in the Sheraton is a reasonable size, but everything was so old and dingy looking.. the room was dark, though the bed was reasonably comfortable. All in all this was the worst hotel I stayed in Asia, especially the fact that it cost us £230Per night for a absolutely crap service and ugly room! breakfast was ok, nothing spectacular. I stayed here 2 nights for the wedding and had to get out and move to Orchard hotel which was much more modern, nicer and and better value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had to spend a night in Singapore last minute. The hotel had weekend special at spg.com for S$240 including breakfast. I called the spg hotline and was told the front desk would be able to offer me the internet price so instead of trying to book online using an iphone while on the move, I took at axi to the hotel. Surprise, the walk in rate was $300. However, I was welcome to use the business center computer to book online to get the $240 rate, which I did. Once booked, the hotel's computers were updated immediately and I could check-in. This is a old hotel that has very much a share of life experiences of Singaporeans. My friend first got to know his future wife on a first date there many years ago. I attended many university balls there as well in the early 90s. The room I had was decent sized. The bed was very comfortable and consistent with other sheratons in asia. The shower had good pressure and hot water, and had nice amenities (not the Sheraton OEM stuff you get in some of the other hotels). Internet was chargeble, but you could easily get a microsim at the airport for S$20 for your ipad with a 30day validity and 1GB data size. Breakfast was at the lobby coffee house. It had the usual spread, but was not as great compared to some of the other Sheraton like the one in Bangkok or Laguna in Bali. However it was 3 mins walk to the MRT, and just outside of the busy CBD. On the whole, a old hotel, stayable if the rates are good.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here as the St Regis was fully booked. This hotel was something of an icon in the early 1990s - see my photo of it's Wall of Fame at the reception, showing its awards which show it managed to win the Best Hotel Award in 1992-93. The hotel has the distinction of a curved screen CRT TV (with a missing cover for its controls) - this may worth seeing in hyper-modern Singapore. It also has a quaint, economical, shower that will be bettered by most YMCAs. It is about a 10 minute walk from Orchard Road in a drab location along Scotts Road, but it has an MRT station a 3 minute walk away - its saving grace. It has somewhat professional (apparently local, not immigrant - like in many other 4-5 star Orchard Road hotels) front line staff who were professional, courteous and confident - somethning of a gift nowadays when hotels nearby have inept staff or brash, condescending, or matter-of-fact, ones. But I wouldn't sing praises - I got no welcome gift/amenity whatsoever (e.g. upgraded room, welcome fruit basket etc etc) beyond the "late checkout when available". You would survive this hotel - do take it if you get a good deal - you are likely to still find rooms here even if most Orchard Road hotels have run out of non-suite rooms, but if you find a better hotel within a S$50 strike price, you will be glad to have spent that S$50. But if want to reminisce about how hotels looked like in 1990, (it is almost like visiting a museum) stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had completely forgotten about the Sheraton Towers in Singapore when I needed a place to stay for the New Year holiday. My brother-in-law recommended it, and I was quite hesitant at first, thinking I preferred to stay at the Intercontinental instead. The architecture of the outside of the Sheraton Tower is rather dated, and has a distinct '70s appearance. But once I got into the lobby I completely changed my opinion. The space inside is magnificent; acres of marble, soaring ceilings, and a huge glass wall looking out onto a waterfall. Yes, it was also rather '70s in design, but it is very well maintained, and looks just as great as it did when I visited it the hotel back in the mid 1990's for a wedding dinner. This trip we stayed in one of their suites (the Cambridge on the17th floor), and found it to be very well appointed. Breakfast in the ground floor restaurant came with the room, and offered a nice spread that included local favorites as well as more exotic fare such as baked beans and roasted tomatoes (aka, The Full English). I highly recommend the basement Chinese restaurant "Li Bai" for Dim Sum. I'm always on the lookout for good Dim Sum, and this has to be my new favorite in Singapore (also, check out the Dim Sum at "Lei Garden" in Chijmes for another excellent offering). All-in-all, I think this fine hotel has been forgotten in Singapore's craze for all things that are new, and the Sheraton Towers will be one that I will consider staying with in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Been staying here for my business trips ever since the Starwood group closed the Le Meridien on Orchard. As a starwood member, the choice is now either Sheraton or the more unaffordable St Regis. Each trip, I will attempt to look for the best available rate via spg.com or the hotel's direct website. Best rate I've come across is SDG 200++ but this is room only rate (without breakfast) on a weekend. Weekday rate is RM 320++ (you're lucky if sometimes they throw in breakfast). Anyhow, room is basic & comfortable. Reception & housekeeping staff are friendly enough but service staffs at the restaurant (coffee house) are not at all. The hostess does not appear friendly at all & inspite of staying at least 4 nights on each trip, the hostess can't manage a smile of even a friendly hello. We actually stay here at least 3 times a year. Actually come to think of it, only the doorman & concierge recognises us. Having stayed here for the last 2 years, we only discovered that the gym operates on 24 hour basis. Access is only by room key card altough working out at night can be a little creepy as no one is there to assist to turn up the dimmed lights and no towel or water provided. We had to search around for headphones to hook up to the machines for TV /music. The swimming pool right outside the gym is quite small & old fashioned. Not very enticing - in fact we don't see many people at the pool. Car Park is free for guest which is a plus point. Another is the Newton Food Centre which is within walking distance. The MRT stop is right next to the hotel which is very convenient. Overall, it's quite a decent stay but not much value for the weekday rates.</p></li>

<li>Each trip, I will attempt to look for the best available <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">rate</span> via spg.com or the hotel's direct website.</br></br></li>
<li>Best <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">rate</span> I've come across is SDG 200++ but this is room only rate (without breakfast) on a weekend.</li>

<li>Best rate I've come across is SDG 200++ but this is room only rate (without <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">breakfast</span>) on a weekend.</br></br></li>
<li>Weekday <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">rate</span> is RM 320++ (you're lucky if sometimes they throw in breakfast).</li>
<li>Weekday rate is RM 320++ (you're lucky if sometimes they throw in <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.999">breakfast</span>).</br></br></li>
<li>Anyhow, <span style="background-color:#aaffc3" title="p=0.998">room</span> is basic & comfortable.</br></br></li>
<li>Reception & housekeeping staff are friendly enough but <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1" title="p=0.999">service staffs</span> at the restaurant (coffee house) are not at all.</li>
<li>Reception & housekeeping staff are friendly enough but service staffs at the restaurant (<span style="background-color:#f58231" title="p=0.999">coffee</span> house) are not at all.</br></br></li>
<li>The hostess does not appear friendly at all & inspite of staying at least 4 nights on each trip, the hostess can't manage a smile of even a friendly hello.</br></br></li>
<li>We actually stay here at least 3 times a year.</br></br></li>
<li>Actually come to think of it, only the doorman & concierge recognises us.</br></br></li>
<li>Having stayed here for the last 2 years, we only discovered that the gym operates on 24 hour basis.</br></br></li>
<li><span style="background-color:#d0d0d0" title="p=0.673">Access</span> is only by room key card altough working out at night can be a little creepy as no one is there to assist to turn up the dimmed lights and no towel or water provided.</br></br></li>
<li>We had to search around for headphones to hook up to the machines for TV /music.</br></br></li>
<li>The <span style="background-color:#9a6324" title="p=0.972">swimming</span> pool right outside the gym is quite small & old fashioned.</li>

<li>The swimming pool right outside the <span style="background-color:#e6194b" title="p=0.653">gym</span> is quite small & old fashioned.</br></br></li>
<li>Not very enticing - in fact we don't see many people at the pool.</br></br></li>
<li><span style="background-color:#e6beff" title="p=0.998">Car Park</span> is free for guest which is a plus point.</br></br></li>
<li>Another is the Newton <span style="background-color:#bcf60c" title="p=0.942">Food Centre</span> which is within walking distance.</br></br></li>
<li>The MRT stop is right next to the <span style="background-color:#fabebe" title="p=0.997">hotel</span> which is very convenient.</br></br></li>
<li>Overall, it's quite a decent stay but not much <span style="background-color:#fffac8" title="p=0.999">value for</span> the weekday rates.</li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I would rate this hotel five for everything (except location), except I have stayed there several times and it is not always consistent. One consistent quality is the cleanliness, on every one of my stays I have not been able to fault the cleanliness, either in the rooms or the public areas. The service is always at least very good, sometimes excellent. The check-in time is occasionally slow when busy, but the staff is always attentive and ready to assist and they are never impolite. I have stayed in various rooms at this Sheraton, from the standard rooms to the executive floor. Even the standard rooms are reasonably spacious, attractively furnished and usually everything works (if it doesn't, they fix it immediately). The beds are wonderful, so comfortable. A twin bedded room is two double sized beds, each with at least four pillows with extras in the wardrobe. Room service is, well ....room service! With fabulous food everywhere in Singapore, who wants room service? The breakfasts in their buffet restaurant are very Sheraton, very good, plenty of fresh fruit and excellent variety of cheeses and breads make the Continental b'fast good value. The soaring marble walls and the floor to ceiling glass overlooking the waterfall add a touch of the dramatic to this restaurant. Plenty of attentive staff members and everything looks good, crisp white cloths etc. The hotel has a very good outdoor pool - some rooms open directly to the pool area and there are also several luxurious individual cabanas in their own enclave just off the pool area - the cabanas do not have air conditioning. The location in Scotts Road may not suit some, being about a 10 minute walk to Orchard Road, but there is an MRT station right next to the hotel. I really like this hotel for its more restful atmosphere, more friendly than the usual five star hotels in Singapore. I also like the very excellent complimentary fitness centre where they will kit you out for the session if you have forgotten your gear. If you are a regular, they remember your birthday with a card and a cake!</p></li>
