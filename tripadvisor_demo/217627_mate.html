<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The TV system is ridiculous...cannot even get WNBC 4 yet there are 10 spanish language stations. The front desk clerk acted like 'what's wrong with that'...the rate reflects the room size and shouldn't come with an essentially non-working TV. Kudos to Carlos who came up and tried to fix it...but his version of 'fixed' is the choce of channels and fuzziness you get.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Okay, this place was TERRIBLE! I can sleep anywhere and I couldn't sleep there! Hard bed, questionable bedding, VERY small, not clean. This is a hotel that people live in. People were coming and going all night... usually I'd say who cares but the wall are paper thin. I really hated it.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel has had a really good restoration. Room price is great for New York. But, if you are claustrophobic it's not for you. The halls are very narrow and the room is very small. There was one full bed and nightstand with room at the bottom for the bed for your luggage. Bath was small but brand new with tile and fake marble. If you are just there to sleep and clean up it's a good choice. p.s. there's a great late night deli around the corner on Broadway.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent one night at this hotel and had the worst experience. I booked a single room with a private bath and woke in the middle of the night with my bed full of bedbugs. I was transferred to a tiny room with no bathroom, still full of insects. Of course, although I spent the night in a room cheaper than the one I had paid for, the hotel staff did not give me any reimbursement or solution. I would only recommend this hotel if you are fond of sleeping with bedbugs!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The rooms are very small, almost shockingly so. But they are very clean and adequate for someone who is out and about in the city. The hotel is very close to two separate subway lines and just a few stops away from all the main tourist areas. The neighborhood itself is very nice, with shops and restaurants. The staff was fine. They brought us a new hairdryer when ours blew out, but otherwise our interaction with them was at a minimum. I would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you like bedbugs, you'll like this hotel. I paid $250 a night for a hotel that had bedbugs, a renovation going on, broken bed light, outlets that didn't work, and a filthy carpet. For a vacation damper, stay at the SmellNord. I knew I would get a small room looking out onto a shaft, as that is what you get in New York City, but the filth, bedbugs and construction were unacceptable. PS Take the toilet paper roll off the dispenser if you like to remain seated while going to the bathroom.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Belnord one night. It was cheap for NY so I didn't expect 5 star accommodation. It's true the room was minuscule, the aircon growled and burped all night, and the bathroom was down the hall. But my bed was comfortable and clean, and the hotel staff gave useful advice when I needed it. A porter carried some of my stuff up to the 4th floor. While I wouldn't want to commit myself to a lifetime at the Belnord, I thought it gave me basically what I needed, a roof over my head and clean bed-linen</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It looks it's hit or miss with this place, but unfortunately I was hit. I thought I had escaped unscathed until I returned home and have been dealing with bug bites for the last week. My buddy who stayed in the next bed over is apparently fine. It's too bad, because the location and price were great, and I am generally fine staying in a hotel without all the amenities. I would stay again in the same area, but pay a little more for a safer hotel. It can happen anywhere, but doesn't seem to be a fluke at this place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was under construction when we got there. My boyfriend and I went to nyc for 3days and stayed at the belnord. It was very clean and everyone including maids were very helpful and friendly. Our 1st room was on the 2nd floor but the air conditioning wasn't working properly. They quickly upgraded us to a larger room with a private bath. The location of this hotel is excellent. The only down fall was our new room was on the 5th floor but it was really nice and really clean. I would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I went for my birthday in October. In short the hotel rooms are small, but it is NY and we had room for bags on the floor and to get to the bathroom. The bathroom was very clean and had full tub with shower head, nice newly redone. The rooms also had hard wod floor not carpet so it was easy to tell it was clean. Over all this place will give you your own bathroom and a nice clean bed to sleep in, and in a great location with a subway station one block away so really it is everything you need from a hotel in NYC.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from my first trip to NYC...we stayed at the Belnord and it was excellent. If you are looking for a simple, clean hotel to shower & sleep, you can't go wrong staying here. And, it's in a great location a block from the subway station which takes you to Times Square in 10 mins or less. The only caution I have is the size of the rooms. Not for the claustrophobic :) The room we stayed in was about 8' x 10', plus a bathroom, so you don't want to spend too much time there. But it was clean, and tidy, and had all the basics.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When I read all the bugs stories in the reviews after my stay was booked I was horrified. So maybe I just got lucky and got a bugless room but I found the Belnord was a great budget hotel. Ive been to a lot of hotels of the same category in NY and the Belnord was definitely the best one. The hotel was modern, the room looked pretty new and was very clean. There were plenty of bathrooms in the hallway and they were all sparkling. The location is fine too, close to a subway station and Central park. I would definitely recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am a low maintenance traveler. This is a low cost hotel. What that means is don't expect any frills. This hotel is very clean, located in a good neighborhood, restaurants nearby, and close to the subway. The rooms are very small. We had a double bedroom and it was very small with a shared bathroom. The bathrooms were very clean and we never had to wait for them. There is no elevator. If you need service or want someone to wait on you this is not the place. However, if you are looking for a low cost, clean place to sleep then this is a good choice.</p></li>

Hallways could use some sound abatement. Rolling wheels on wood make quite a rattling sound at 3:00AM. Bath tubs are extremely slippery and without grab rails, a lawsuit waiting to happen. Do not ask front desk personnel to arrange for transportation to local airports! I was charged $50.00 to be taken from the hotel to LaGuardia. It only cost me $32.00 to travel from LaGuardia to the hotel. Demand a standard New York taxi and accept nothing else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was great - after worrying what it would be like after reading the reviews on here, we were pleased with our choice. So close to the subway. lots of shops & eateries, so easy to get around. The room was smallish, but big enough for us and our bags with ample storarge. It was clean. The plastic sheets around the bed were a bit annoying, but it did not ruin our stay by any means. The hotel is well equipped with internet, phones, vending machines if needed and I thought the staff were very helpful if needed. Would recommend this hotel - no problem. Is lovely to stay up near Central Park too.</p></li>

Since we are walkers everything seemed closed from there plus on Sunday that part of Broadway is shut down for a street market where I did most of my gift shopping for the year, at yummy vendor food and ran into some very nice locals.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Got stuck in NY with the ash cloud and this was recommended on Expedia. Fortunately for us they only had 1 night available because it was an awful hotel. The staff couldn't be bothered to speak to you, the room was so small it was shocking and the bathroom was just about big enough to get into. Dinghy and dark room with no coffee/tea facilities and no room to move. Yes it was quite reasonable but I would not stay there again. The only positive was that it was a nice neighbour hood, although you did have to walk quite a distance to get to anywhere which we didn't mind. Sorry, but could have been better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I can't say I had any bad feelings when I left this hotel. It was fine. The location one block away from the metro was very convenient. The neighborhood is safe and nice. The hotel is clean. Can't say about the noise, because I slept with earplugs. However, when I walked into the room for the first time, I burst out laughing at how small the room was. And I didn't even notice at first the narrow slits of the closet and the door to the private bathroom. I am uploading a picture of the bathroom for everyone to judge for themselves... There is no restaurant in the hotel, so no breakfast or anything like that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros: very clean, and modern. Cons: 1) There are mice in the rooms! If you like mice, no problem. I was woken up by squeaking on one night, and the unmistakeable pitter patter of mice (we get mice occ in our house, so I know what I'm hearing!) I told the staff.....they said "there are no mice in our hotel". Interestingly, I found a mousetrap under the nightstand, which I was told that all rooms have as a precaution. 2) small room 3) Staff were the rudest I have ever seen...and I've stayed in quite a number of hotels. Price however, not bad for a NYC hotel, which is located off Broadway. But as the old saying goes "you get what you pay for".</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our hotel selection was based almost solely on the reviews we read on Trip Advisor. The Belnord Hotel lived up to expectations. For the money, it was the best deal we have found in Manhattan. The rooms were clean and quiet and the location was safe. For the money we were not expecting a large room. Having visited Manhattan several times from Phoenix we know the amount you pay seems to proportionate to the room size. Therefore, for a nightly fee of less than $100 we knew the room would be small. One word of advice to the management; could you install hooks on the walls and in the bathroom so we can hang our stuff on? Otherwise, very satisfied.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stated here for one night after visiting New York on business. Great location, near to subway station and Central Park. Checked in immediately, friendly staff. Rooms clean and tidy, but very small, wasn't bothered by that though as we only wanted it to sleep in and the beds are comfortable. Rest of the time was doing the usual sightseeing so Â£130 for 1 night is steep but you won't get much cheaper in NYC unless you want to stay in a hostel or the Bronx! Lots of lovely restaurants along Columbus Avenue worth walking down in the evening. Safe luggage room for our last day as we didn't fly home until late evening. Definitely recommend this hotel!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I loved this place. I thought it was clean, and modern and the price was right. I figured the rooms would be small, and they were. But seriously, how much room does one need? The neighborhood is awesome and unless you are looking for a Planet Hollywood within arms reach, you won't be disappointed. The train is also right around the corner. And they provide free wifi to boot. I wish all hotels had hardwood floors, it just seems cleaner. I will and have recommended this to all my friends. If you need the stereotypical Time Sq. hotel with a mini bar and room service, this isn't for you. But if you just need a nice clean place to rest your head, I found this to be perfect.</p></li>

Ok the room was cold but the blancets in NY are cheep so that was no problem. The room was nice and cosy, tiny but comfortable! The bathroom was spotless and our sheats and towels were changed everyday! The area was nice and everything worked nicely at the hotel. They are renovating it at the moiment so there were workmen running about in the mornings but that did not bother us. So after the renovation it will be a lovely place to stay. The subway was just 2 minutes walk aroud the corner and lots of pubs and restaurants! We will be there again!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a great location - 2 minutes from subway and less than 10 minutes walk to central park. However it is under construction at present and it looks pretty terrible. we had no idea they were doing renovations when we booked and were pretty disappointed in it. we were on the 4th floor which doesn't have an elevator stop so we had to go up to the 5th floor and walk down a flight of stairs. There were exposed electrical wires hanging out of the walls in the hallways. Constant noise from the power tools being used. The reception people were pretty rude at times. not a good experience, but the rooms that have been renovated looked pretty good, so may be okay when all the work is done.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Place was clean, very very nice for the price -updated - would stay there again - no bed bugs. We were very comfortable- however beware of PARKING recommendations - this incident reported by another traveler was EXACTLY what happened to us - "...must use the public parking garage one block away. The hotel clerk claimed we would get 25% off of the $40 parking rate in fact we only got $5 off. The parking attendant pretends to not underrstand english whenever we asked about our entire $10 discount." Cheaper garages are closer - do NOT go with hotel parking recommendation - something FISHY going on. A little noisy at times but the rooms were so nice - if it weren't for the parking incident I would hardily recommend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is one of the worst budget hotels I've ever stayed in. Although the location is really good, just one block away from the subway and walking distance to 24/7grocery stores and Central Park, it isn't worth the money, even if you need to go cheap. The pricy tiny rooms are really COLD and the heater makes a very loud noise which makes it almost impossible to get some good sleep after a long day walking around the city, I know you only use the room for sleeping in, but even this was too much to ask for at this place. Another thing that makes the stay here even worse is the very unfriendly staff, it seemed to us they were there not to be bothered at all. I would definitely not stay there again and not recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We read mixed reviews about this hotel and was hesitant to book. The location was the really the only reason we did book. We had our fingers crossed that we hadnt made a mistake. We were pleasantly surprised! Very clean hotel and rooms. There was never a wait for the shared bathrooms and they were also very clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. GREAT location. Step out of the hotel and you are ready to walk anywhere! The Park is like 3 blocks away, Museum of Natural History is close too. CVS drugstore across the street. Great eateries and shopping all over. It was nice to take in the excitement of the city and come back to a quiet, neighborhood. We had a very comfortable stay and would stay again. The price cant be beat!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed 3 nights at the Belnord hotel when I was visiting NYC in April 2011. The rooms including bathroom was clean, but extremely small and noisy. There was no room for a suitcase, and the bathroom was so small that when seated at the toilet it would have been possible to drink water from the tap. Not suitable for large people. The walls must have been made from cardboard or something similar, because there is absolutely no sound insulation between the room and the hallway/neighbour rooms. In addition the ventilation was extremely noisy, which altogether kept me awake during night. The staff at the reception wasnÂ´t unfriendly, but they seemed rather uninterested. The housekeepers were noisy and increased the noise problem.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for 6 nights for the New York Marathon. The hotel is located in a nice quite area of city on the upper west side 3 blocks from Central Park. Subway station 1 block away.The reception staff were not very friendly no "good morning" or "have a nice day" even. Some of them their English was not great! The hotel is clean,quite and the bed was comfortable. The room size maybe a problem, my room was small but as I was staying on my own it was ok. If two people were staying it would be very tight for space. There are no tea or coffee makeing facilities. Coffee machine behind reception. Value for money? Well it cost me 1000 Euro for 6 nights so make your own mind up. For me it was the best value I could find in New York.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found this place online 2 days prior to visiting NYC as we ran into an unexpected need for a hotel. The hotel is perfectly situated between Amsterdam and Broadway on 87th Street within walking distance of some great restaurants and bars as well as shopping and, of course, the metro line. The rooms were small...I mean small with a small bathroom, but everything was very clean. As you don't visit NYC to stay in your hotel room, it was a perfect place to throw down the bags and get some rest at night. Beds were comfy, TV worked fine...no complaints. The service was fine. One drawback and only because we had a lot of luggage...no elevator. But a little exercise never hurt anyone! Save money for other expensive NYC stuff...great place!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great base for trip to New York, very close to subway. Perfect for morning runs in Central Park. Plenty of restaurants around for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Stayed in room with bathroom on an excellent rate. Friendly staff. Hotel was spotlessly clean throughout. Expected room to be smaller having read other reviews, but had a standard double bed (a bit bouncy, but comfortable enough), wardrobe, mirror, TV, ensuite with shower, loads of hot water. No tea / coffee facilities, but plenty of options outside hotel. Luggage store (free) was handy for late flight. The only negative we could find was the noisy air conditioning units, which disturbed us at night (from the room below). Would recommend friends and family to stay here, but bring ear-plugs!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotels in Manhattan are an absolute rip off and what to do but to stay in a clean BOX (for hobbits) for the night in a quiet and safe spot Uptown! Reception do warn you that the rooms will be small to avoid you complaining! And yes, you're not disappointed when you find your room door scrapes your comfy double bed when literally fills the room. Hmm, where to put my bags, in the shower tray doubling as a Japanese bath tub? And be careful not to roll out of bed and in to the toilet! The flatscreen tv on the wall is great, except you can knock it off the wall as you walk round the bed! However, you'll sleep well here and you'll even get 'free' wireless internet if you ask for an access code every 24 hours. Unfortunately guys, this is the best you'll get for the money in Manhattan.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here from 26th-30th December with my girlfriend. The room was reasonably priced for the time of year ($150 a night, compared with $100 for a private room at a youth hostel!). The private bathroom was small, with occasionally tempremental hot water, but clean. There were no bed bugs, and the room was cleaned every day, even when we left late late morning. There was no view, but then as others have said if you are staying in New York you are not going to be staying in your hotel room all the time. The room was on the ground floor, so we weren't affected by the lack of an elevator. Staff were competent and helpful. Heating/air con worked fine. I'm puzzled by how the reviews for this hotel can be so mixed! Personally I would recommend it as a great place to stay for a budget conscious couple.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were allowed to check in almost four hours early - which was a godsend, because we didn't want to lug our luggage around all day. The hotel looked clean and recently renovated (which is apparently the case) and there most certainly IS an elevator now. Our room was spotless and decently appointed with modern decor... but WOW, was it small! This was the third budget hotel I've stayed in in NYC, and this room was an order of magnitude smaller than the next smallest room. It was about the size of an interior bunk-bed cabin in an old cruise ship. I could hardly use the toilet as my knees bumped into the sink in the bathroom! Still, it was quiet and provided a great jumping off point for a jazz club (Smoke) and the American Museum of Natural History. I can't complain... but make sure you can stand the small rooms!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel reservation made and deposit paid to Ratestogo. On arrival at the hotel, they said they did not have a reservation for me. They then found the reservation but didn't have a room available for me. Without too much discussion a room was found for me, but they couldn't honour the rates I had been quoted. We then renegotiated rates. On receiving credit card statement, I found that they pushed through an extra transaction for about $90 without my knowledge. I am advised by my credit card company that hotels can "finalise" the account up to 90 days after checking out and the hotel claims the receptionist made an error, so I can't claim a refund. At the time the extra transactioon was processed I was staying in the hotel, so asking my authority would not have been a problem if the charge had been acceptable to me.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Any hotel with such a great location must be fairly bad to be priced so cheaply.... and Belnord is. The bad bits: the disgusting stench of stale smoke the tiny room the view of a brick wall (ha ha) the unhelpful (and noisy) staff charging $5 per bag to hold our luggage after check out the carpets and bedding looked a hundred years old, plenty of dust in there! The ok bits (good would be going a bit far as they're actually expected in most normal hotels!): The toilets were cleaned reguarly and always smelt nice The hotel itself seemed fairly clean We didnt have bed bugs So if you just want the room to sleep in and can handle feeling a little bit grubby and unglamorous for your stay then it is fine. We had no major complaints as there was nothing essentially wrong with it. However next time i think i would prefer to pay a little bit extra to stay somewhere less dingy!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found the Belnord to be good value for money. The room we had was extremely small, but that didn't matter to us since we were in New York to experience the city, not hang out in our hotel room. We'd leave at about 9 or 10 each morning and return at 10 or 11 at night. The bathroom on our floor (shared, across the hall) was immaculately clean at all times, and had brand new fixtures. Our room itself had older carpets and furnishings, but it was clean. The service was good, and the staff were accommodating. The location was the best thing about the hotel. We were in a very safe, really nice Upper West Side neighbourhood near Central Park. It was very close to good restaurants and shops, and had easy access to the subway. There is a good drop-off laundry service right next door to the Belnord. We found it very useful. They wash, dry, and fold for you, and charge reasonable rates.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I travelled with my 2 very young kids and parents, so we had to take two rooms: a double and a quadruple. The rooms in general are small, but were very clean and pretty new, with flat screen TV on the wall and new bathrooms as well. The big problem of the quadruple room was there is not place to hang the clothes on (no closet, no cupboard, nothing), so it was not comfortable from that perspective. There was no crib at the hotel either (one of my kids is 1). The location of the hotel is very convenient with metro station, restaurants, CVS, etc. around. The car can be parked on the street quiet easily. One of the staff at the front desk was not very polite when dealing with a couple of issues. Value: it was very good, I think it is very difficult to get a similar hotel at that price in Manhattan. Summary: very good hotel for the money you spend. Definitely I would go back if travelling with my wife alone, but not with the complete family.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Despite reading awful reviews on this place my boyfriend and i decided to give it the benefit of the doubt - what a mistake!! We could barely get out bags in the door of the room it was that small! The bed had the grottiest sheet on which was stained so we used our sleeping bag liners instead. The bathroom could barely fit one person in let alone two and it had the smallest bath ive ever seen i dont think you could even call it a bath! The staff on reception were rude (apart from 1 girl) and would not give change for using THEIR washine machines they made us walk down to the shop. Once we had walked down to the shop and put our washine in the machine we realised they were so tight that all the machines worked on a COLD WASH ONLY and so our washing came back out dirty and im not joking!! We paid Â£250 for 3 nights stay here and i would never ever go back or recommend it to anyone. The only good thing is that it is central and just off broadway.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I just completed a 4 day trip to New York, which included 3 nights at the Belnord. I will start by saying I would stay here again without thinking about it. The hotel was very clean, was in a very safe and quiet part of town and had easy access to the subway (1 block away from the 1 train - 3.5 from B&D I think). We were 2.5 blocks from Central Park which was very nice. There is also plenty of restaurants and shopping close by. The staff was nice the whole time and we did need their help a couple times. The internet access was fast and easy to connect to. The only bad thing I could find is that rooms were small, very small, and an earlier comparison to a cruise ship was fairly accurate. There was a bed, two night stands, a little table and chair, a closet and a bathroom. The closet was nice sized for a travel closet, held all of our clothes fine. The bathroom was also very small, but had a tub, toilet and sink, so what else do you need?</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ok, let's be frank here, the Belnord is NOT the Waldorf-Astoria or the Plaza.My wife and I usually stay in properties closer to Times Square but $450+ per night prices post-Thanksgiving just were not in the budget. I'd read a few reviews of this hotel prior to booking and had a few reservations about my reservations but those were pretty much erased upon arrival. The Belnord is in a very nice "Upper West Side" location and super convenient to the subway and bus*. ONLY WARNING: NO ELEVATORS! Suitcases up narrow stairs to fifth floor was our exercise for the weekend!! Our (private bath) room was "cozy" but fine as we were only there to lay our heads. (You're in New York! You don't stay in your rooms to watch TV!) Neighhood has several decent small restaurants and a full-service CVS Pharmacy is a block away. *Bus M86 is cross-town (through Central Park) and drops you right beside Metropolitan Museum of Art. We would stay there again if prices mid-town were out-of-budget.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location The location on this hotel is excellent, its about 10 min walk (if that) from Time Square. If you walk down broadway there are many shops to keep you entertained as your walking down. Room Very basic, No bugs, double bed, small storage cupboard, dressing table, Tv, air con, Small but "VERY" clean bathroom. No safe! Hotel I found the hotel basic but it was perfect for somewhere to crash down of a night, Although i was very disappointed with the service we recieved during our stay. Maids where friendly, as i later found, they had stolen shoes and a bag , that i's left in my room. We complained and they did nothing to compensate. I stay at this hotel AT YOUR OWN RISK,and take your passports out with you wherever you go. Tips on staying in New york * Walk everywhere IF POSS * If going during winter, take Extra warm clothes and layers. *Tax and Tips will be added to eveything *If getting Taxi's just get the yellow cabs Hope this review has helped, thanx for your time!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Super clean, TINY room in a safe area with great staff. Cannot stress how small the rooms are, door brushed the bed when entering the room. Grandma's house was always clean & welcoming, but no frills. The internet on the computers available at the hotel is horrible, don't waste your time or money. I don't know about the wifi, I left my laptop at home since the website said they had a computer room. There was a tiny little bit of mold at the very top of the shower but I could tell it had been cleaned up. I've got mild allergies and didn't have any problems but it could be an issue for some. Other than that the room was just as expected/described, clean and small. Comfy bed, small storage/closet area, tiny but private bathroom. The walls are thin, I could hear movement in the morning but the cleaning staff honored my Do Not Disturb sign and stopped chatting when they got near my end of the hall. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone looking to save money & willing to go without the luxuries.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here mostly because our son and daughter in law live on the next street over and their appartment is too small to comfortably accomodate all of us. The Belnord was recently renovated and a fine job they did. Everything was fresh and very clean. First let me make it clear that this is a boutique hotel in a pre war structure so the rooms are small and I wouldn't recommend it for a family. That being said it was just right for my wife and I. If you travel with a lot of luggage - there isn't a whole lot of space for it in the room. Staff and housekeeping were friendly and eager to help us find our way in the city. We arrived prior to check in time but were able to store our luggage and go have lunch at Shake Shack our favorite burger place in the city. The hotel is centrally located in a nice neighborhood, only 3 blocks west of Central Park and the subway, with many fine eateries. (Good Enough to Eat - recommend for breakfast, Bagel Basket, and Arties Deli to name just a few). Price wise it's a little pricey but within NYC limits.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">my husband and I stayed here for three days and two nights. although the room was quite small for two people, it was not really a big deal for me because it was nevertheless comfortable and we were usually out the whole day, we really only needed a place and bed to sleep at at night. The location was great, it was a few seconds walk to Broadway Street where you can easily spot various shops and restaurants. It is likewise a few minutes (or even seconds, depending on your pacing) to a Subway station which can take you to Times Square via the 50th Avenue. It is likewise very very close to the Central Park, I even just walked my way back to the hotel when I visited Central Park. Moreover, the hotel offers free WiFi service, all you have to do is ask the front desk people. The hotel is excellent and I would recommend this to anyone who is lookin for a place to stay in new york city. there is definitely a big chance that I would check in this hotel on my next visit to new york. (never mind the not so friendly front desk people, doesnt really matter, the hotel was already fine enough)</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked on line at Expedia (which was a mistake because they lack a competent customer service department). When I opened the door to the room I couldn't fit my suitcase inside. The lumpy, dirty, double sized bed took up the entire room. There was about two feet around the bed. The bathroom shower stall did not have a shower curtain. There was a flat screen TV on the wall. There was no closet or anywhere to hang a coat. I saw the room and returned the key to the desk saying that what I booked on line was not what was in that room. They said no problem just call Expedia. I called Expedia and they said to call back during the week when the hotel manager was there. I called back to Expedia durign the week and spent over an hour on the phone explaining the situation. They called the hotel which said that I did stay there. Expedia had notes in their computer log that I called them right after I left the hotel. However, Expedia will not back me up and the Belnord will not refund my money. The staff at the Belnord also lied to Expedia about the name of the hotel manager. Don't stay here!!!!!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is one of the most reasonably priced hotels that we found. We got the room with its own bathroom. It was pretty quiet & the area is safe. The room is very small. There was little room from the edges of the bed to the walls and the TV was on a stand hanging from the ceiling. We didn't see any bugs, though. There are no elevators in the hotel so we had to walk up 5 floors (that's where they put us) everytime we came in and out of the room. BUT it met our needs and it was well within our budget. So we got to spend more money on food, gifts, etc. And we were out and about most of the time. We really only came back to shower & sleep. The customer service that we received from the helpdesk was not good. But they did hold our luggage after checkout for a few hours while we went out to eat. It took us about 10-15 minutes to get to time square from the time we left our hotel door to the time we got to time sq. So if you plan to spend lots of time in the room (which I hope you don't if you are on a personal vacation because there are lots of things to do), then you may get frustrated with the small space and poor customer service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here at the end of September for 4 nights and had no problems what so ever. The rooms are extremely small and I mean all you can fit in the room is the bed, its the smallest room I have ever seen. However it was very clean and modern, the maids came in every day with new sheets and towels and tidied the room. Most of the hotel staff were friendly and helpfull, but there were some that were ignorant and would look the road you were on, but I suppose you can get that anywhere. The hotel is in a great location, not right in the heart of manhattan but only a 2min sub ride away from time square and the nearest station is only one block up from the hotel, you can also walk to central park from the hotel, which is fab. There is also lots of places close by to eat, the city diner on broadway just a block from the hotel does a fab breakfast, and a brilliant little irish pub called "the Parlour" is situated across the road. All in all if your looking for somewhere purely to put your head down, and dont plan spending to much time in your room, for a really good price and a good location, I think the Blenord is the place for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was by far the nastiest hotel I have ever stayed in. I rated it a one, however, it is not even deserving of that. The room I booked was so small that basically all that COULD fit in it was a bed. To watch the TV, you would have to put your head at an uncomfortable angle, as it was suspended from the ceiling. There was long black hair in the bed, and the room smelled of what I do not know. I complained and was upgraded to the "best room available". This room was somewhat better, but on the way to the room I spotted a cockroach crawling up the wall. I brought the manager to see the roach, and he did not seem to care. In the room, there were stained towels on the bed, and again the long black hair. There was no elevator, and the carpets looked like they should have be replaced years ago. There were holes in the floors, which I assumed had something to do with the repairs. We checked our bags at checkout, and they charged $5.00 to hold them, and there was no bellman to carry bags. I cancelled the rest of the reservation, and by the end of it all my friend and I renamed the hotel to Hotel Hellnord. I wouldn't leave an animal in such a place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and my boyfriend were there for a April week-end. The check-in wasn't to be made untill 2h00pm but they had a room where we could leave our luggages and a washroom that we could use for the time being, which was appreciated. The staff was okay. Nothing special, respectful and neutral. The rooms were a little small but then again, you're in New York! You're not going to spend your days in the room. ;-) The bathrooms were -very- clean. They sure did a great job! As for the bedbugs mentionned in the other posts, there wasn't any in our bed. And I'm guessing that even the best hotels got them... so there you go. No worries about it. The high point of this place is it's location. Next to Central Park and to a Metro lane. It's only a walk away from the Metropolitain Museum of art. And not to mention that Broadway is a couple of streets after with some good restaurants. (I highly reccomend "City Dinner" on Broadway and the 90th avenue which offer a 24hour casual restaurant service! Very appreciated after you've seen a musical!:-) ) Other than that, we enjoyed our little stay. It is perfect for budget-minded travellers and for young couples who happens to also be budget-minded. ;-)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Yes, the rooms are small and the reception is not very friendly but my main concern is cleaness because I am very allergic (asma and sinusitis). This hotel was recently renovated, has new hardwood floors in the rooms and hallways (this is good because I hate hotels with smelly old carpets!). And is very clean! No mold or smoke smell, no old curtains. The rooms are very clean, didnÂ´t see any mouse or rat trap. Shower with hot and strong water, air conditioning works well and didn't find it noisy. The double bed is small, then choose a room with two beds if you need more space. The location is not central, but it is a nice family neighborhood and very quiet, with excellent shops and restaurants nearby - recommend Ollies (Chinese fast food), Good Enough to Eat and Sarabeth's (these two for breakfast), Carmine's (large portions Italian dinner). The subway station is very close (line 1). Try to ask for room 303 because it is a little bigger, has a small hallway at the entrance, a small closet, desk and chair.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A friend and I decided to check out some music at a restaurant near 88th and Columbus so we thought staying at the Belnord would be convenient....an easy walk back to the hotel at the end of the evening...which it was. But after reading all the complaints about the small rooms, I decided to go ahead and get the 'suite' that has two beds rather than the regular room. This worked out pretty well. Our room, 103, was on the first floor. It was long and skinny, but there was enough room. And it was clean. The bathroom door does hit the sink, but no big deal. One complaint would be the ice maker....it was right outside the room and was pretty noisy when it was being used....at 4 in the morning.... The complaints about the staff may be true depending upon your demands.....they are not really an outgoing bunch. But that being said, they were reasonably attentive to us when we asked questions and when we wanted to store our luggage for some time after checkout. They have a locked room downstairs for storing luggage...and that worked out well So the suite cost about an extra 50 bucks or so, but it was worth it. Total for the room with tax was $226. If I had a business or a pleasure to this area of NYC again, I would consider staying here (...but not too close to the ice maker).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Where to start â€“ just avoid this hotel. The outside looks okay, but on arrival you will realise this is not worth the money. The staff are extremely rude and unhelpful, but you could look past that if the hotel was at least clean. The rooms are awful and filthy, with dirty un-cleaned carpets and even filthier bed sheets. The beds are tiny with hard mattresses that are covered with PLASTIC sheets. These sheets are extremely uncomfy and very noisy when you move. All the pipes in the bathroom were sticking out loose from the wall, ie. Shower head hung off the wall, taps spun round on the ends of the pipes and mould grew round the edges of the bath. All halls are filthy and absolutely stink of smoke â€“ the room was meant to be non-smoking, but all they did was spray overpowering sickly air freshener around. The room was literally 2 single beds and no room to move. We had to look through our suitcases on the bed as nowhere to unpack. When we went to checkout we asked if we could leave our luggage for a few hours â€“ we were told they CHARGE!!! to store luggage in a room that anyone could access. We hastily left and will never book a room with them again. It is quite close to a tube station, but not on the express â€“ stay either a few blocks higher or lower these are better for the express.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As someone who tends to go the cheapest hotel/hostel I can find, often ending up with some absolute dives, I was pleasantly surprised with one of the cheapest rooms in NYC! I'm quite used to sharing bathroom facilities, so having our own bathroom was a bonus in itself. Yes, admittedly the rooms are small, but ultimately, who needs space to walk around in anyway? Perhaps if you are planning on spending a bit of time in the room reading etc, you may feel like you require something bigger, but as a simple base, Belnord hits all the right spots. We had a cleaning service every day that we were there (4 nights) and found it to be most satisfactory, and we definitely had no qualms about leaving valuables in the room. Location of the hotel is good, a 2minute walk to the nearest subway, which takes you to Times Square in about 10 mins. Central park is a couple of blocks away, lovely to walk through in the morning! Also, on Sundays a couple of blocks away (76th between Columbus and Amsterdam) there was an incredible flea market which I highly recommend! I've seen a few people comment on the reception staff, have to say i had no problems with them, although we didn't make any enquiries, so perhaps this is why! To sum up, i would most definitely stay here again, and recommend it to friends, feel free to ask any questions!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">From the outside the hotel did not look bad, we were a party of 4. The room I was given looked like the carpet was not cleaned for months, the telephone initially did not work but then it was fixed after having an argument with the night porter who was telling me I did not know how to use the phone. There was no remote control for the TV despite asking for one. Worst of all one person in our party found a bed bug on her pillow, when complaining another women complained that she had many bed bugs in her bed and she was bitten in many places. After all that I did not bother about telling them the air conditioning did not work. We left the hotel in a taxi booked by them (the best part of the visit, both taxi and leaving the hotel). We have since found out that this problem has been going on for some time without the hotel doing anything to resolve this, I think they should be forced to close and then be fumigated before they are permitted to reopen. I know hotels can easily get this problem due to different people staying there and taking appropriate action to resolve the problem is acceptable but it is not acceptable to carry on without resolving this problem. I have had to spray my case and contents and put all clothes in the wash in order to prevent anything getting into my home (I should not have to do this). This is not a fake review it is totally factual. To sum it up, I would not recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room was so small, you had to go outside to change your mind! Seriously, it was small, with the least possible space to maneuver. And the closet was so small, with a shelf near the bottom, that I couldn't hang up my bag--which was all I'd brought. At least the small bed (double, too small for me and the wife) was not nearly firm enough. And if you're claustrophopic, look forward to that teeny-tiny bathroom. On the other hand, the dinky TV on the wall didn't work properly; not only were the colors all weird and dark, but, strangely, the pictures did not fit on the screen. This place was good for one thing: a roof over one's head to go sleepy-bye. It was quiet at night where we were. And not inexpensive. Staff were friendly; cooperative people at the front desk (tho we didn't ask for anything). Appalling, just appalling, that you have to PAY for coffee/tea in the lobby. You'd think that the economy had already tanked, big-time. It's just a darned good thing we didn't need to spend time in our room. Sheesh! The best thing about the place was the location--easy access to subway, eateries, Central Park. This is the kind of place you stay when you don't have $300 to plunk down per night, and there's nothing else available. It may well be that comparatively speaking, this hotel was okay, perhaps even good; but can't really say since haven't spent time in other low-end places. Outside of NY, though, this would be termed a total ripoff.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Me and my boyfriend stayed at Belnord from the 19th - 23rd December 2007, we booked Belnord through Expedia, we choose this hotel purely on price, as it was an absolute bargin copared to the other prices, we worked out it was about Â£30 a night!!! After looking into the hotel we saw it was in a very good location but then started reading reviews about bed bugs and rude staff we began to worry!........ BUT..... upon arrival (quite late at night and with the flu) we found the man at reception to be extremely friendly and helpful. Must admit when we saw the room we did laugh as it was quite small, just enough rom to walk around the bed with a bedside table a tv and a small cupboard..... as our trip was or only 4 days all we required really was a bed to sleep in at night and this is what we got. The room was very clean and was cleaned and had the sheets and towels changed everyday. And concerning the bedbugs..... we did not see one for the entire stay. On our floor there were about 5 bathrooms and toilet rooms, almost enough for one to every room, there was always a bathroom free when you needed and they were very clean. On one ocassion the radiator dial snapped off, went down to reception and th "fix it" guy came up literally staight away and sorted it out!!!! Get the subway everywhere from 86th, just down the road, save your money on taxis and eat at the Olive Garden in Times Square!!!!! We think this hotel has been given a pretty hard time considering how cheap it was... you get what you pay for!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel in excellent location! there is a subway station that gets you to all the main attractions less than a minute away!. The room was extremely clean which is really important to me as i have a dust allergie and i had no problems at all, the laminate floors helped a lot too. The room was very small but all you need for a place to rest your head and hand your clothes although i would take some extra hangers if you are going for more than a few days. The decor was nice and simple and I must say the bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds i have ever slept in! I think it was new. So great for a buget hotel. But my main gripe was the staff on reception, most of them where fine but one in particular was extremely rude and even turned round and told us too "phone yourself" when i asked her to call an excursion company about booking a tour! we tried but had no luck and had to work out the pay phone, eventually another guy came on reception and we asked him and he was fine. So expect to fend for your self and have to ask a few times at the least if you want any help! Also the air conditioning was rather noisy even when off so if your a light sleeper i'd take some ear plugs. Apart from my last 2 comments i would recommend this hotel if you want to do New York on a budget. Also for any vegan/veggie travellers there was an absolutely gorgeous vegan restaurant only 5 min walk away called the Peace Cafe great value and delicious lattes and desserts. Otherwise hot and crusties it just 5 mins and does amazing pizza.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked a room through travelocity for January 26th at the Belnord Hotel. However, my flight into NYC was cancelled because JFK was closed due to a snowstorm. I could not get into NYC on any other flights, neither bus nor train (Amtrak). I called travelocity and explained I had to cancel my reservation even though it was less than 24 hours notice and I asked if I could get a refund. I was told that I would have to send an e-mail to the manager of the Belnord hotel with this request. I e-mailed the manager at the address I was given right away, got no response, and then tried e-mailing again a few days later but still got no response. I've put in multiple calls to the hotel but I'm always told that it's only the manager who can deal with these types of issues (ie deciding whether or not a refund might be in order) but even when I've called between 9am-4pm, the manager is never available and the front desk gives various excuses such as that she's already gone for the day, that she's sick or that her whereabouts are generally unknown. I had planned on staying at the Belnord when I reschedule my trip to NYC but now I've decided to find a different hotel that at least addresses cutsomer concerns/requests instead of ignoring them completely. If the manager had at least e-mailed or called and said that it was not possible to give me a refund, I would be much more satisfied. Instead, I have gotten no response at all! This behavior is simply rude and unfriendly and seems quite dishonest as well. This has been a very disappointing experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel for nearly 2 months to do some travelling around New York and other areas, i stayed here from the 26th of Febuary to the 7th of April, i stayed in two different rooms because i made 2 seperate reservations (because i was staying longer than 28 days), and both rooms were perfect. There were no bedbugs. The rooms were cleaned every single day by friendly maids, every member of staff here are friendly and kind. The location is amazing, the subway is literally 40 steps away! Its on the same block as the hotel, the subway train "1, 2 and 3" line, which takes you from the hotel, through times sqaure, all the way downtown to the world trade site. The hotel is in a very safe area, in my whole 2 months i did not have any trouble at all, the hotel is right on broadway! I beleive its one of the safest areas in the city (upper west side on broadway). I was very pleased to find a lobby with a fast computer with the internet, and some vending machines, the internet is nice and cheap to use. Bathrooms were always empty when i wanted to use them, there were 5 bathrooms to each floor, all the bathrooms are spotlessly clean, and they are cleaned daily by the maids. In the whole time i was there, the bathrooms were always empty so you can have hot showers or baths anytime you wish. All the rooms have TV's with many stations, and a phone, and icebox to keep your items cold if needed. There are no bedbugs here. I am very impressed with this hotel, and i will always stay there again when i go back to New York, it really is an amazing city! Matthew Holland</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had read the rooms were small, but I was in no way prepared for just how small they were. Our regular sized bed was up against the wall, the foot of the bed was about two feet from the wall and the other side of the bed was about three feet from a wall. We literally could not maneuver around the room to walk with our luggage in it. The bathroom was so small I was claustrophobic, you had to reach under the sink for the toilet paper! The walls were paper thin. After finding out I could not use my cell phone in my room, I knew we could not stay there the second night we had planned to. I stood out in the rain at night to make some necessary phone calls, including one to Expedia to tell them I would be checking out the next morning because I found the hotel unacceptable. They said fine, I would get my money back on the second night. I checked out early the next morning telling the front desk staff I was leaving, giving them my keys and looking over the charges from the previous night. When home and calling Expedia to get money back for the second night is when the real nightmare began. This hotel lied to Expedia, first by saying I didn't check out at all and then saying I checked out two hours late!! The hotel had no intention of giving back any money. After two days and a total of four hours on the phone, including my calling the hotel back three times myself, I was told by Expedia I wasn't getting any money returned because of what the hotel was saying. This is a totally dishonest hotel, for that reason alone I hope that people will not give them business. They blatantly lied!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">New York rooms are expensive and as has been stated by others, this hotel offers some of the cheapest non hostel type rooms around so expectations weren't high. First impressions were favourable. Location was great and even the view over the piles of basins and toilets from a refurbishment didn't seem too bad so long as you kept the blinds down. We had en-suite facilities but there were plenty of communal bathrooms which were kept clean and were never in use when we walked past them. All was well until our third night when I was roused by a rustling noise on the bedside table. When the light went on we found an unopened packet of crisps had been gnawed into and there was a smattering of crisps on the top of the unit. Further investigation showed a mouse under some bags in the corner of the room which disappeared when it was disturbed. The night receptionist initially said that he could not move us as there were no free rooms but conceeded under pressure and we were given a miniscule room with less than two feet of space on either side of the bed. The mattress was covered with plastic and then only one thin sheet which led to a very uncomfortable night and the air conditioning unit was so noisy that all chance of sleep was lost. To top it all ,we saw in the morning that the clothes cupboard was equipped with it's very own bait box so obviously rodents are not an uncommom site in the Belnord's rooms. Having said all of this, we did have a great stay in New York (THANK YOU, KEVIN ) . Just be aware that if you were concerned by the reports of the bed bugs there are other more terrifying creatures lurking in the fabric of this establishment.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Well we read the reviews and we didn't pay any attention because we were attracted by the price and location. We've just come back and guess what....there were bedbugs. I'm sitting here right now with about 30+ bites on my body (very itchy and annoying). I've washed all our bedding and vacuumed the bed, plus we are airing the whole apartment. And not forgetting to wash every single piece of clothing we took with us!! The location is fantastic and so is the area the hotel is situated in (safe and very NY). The rooms were really small and there wasn't a view. The staircase is narrow and hot, and if you live on the top floors it's a long way up after a long day of sightseeing. The rooms are cleaned regularly but the airconditioning makes for very artificial living. On the first day we checked the bed for bedbugs.....found none of course. We didn't really research the signs of bedbugs and one of them is little blood stains on the sheets and covers. We found those every day and we never thought anything of it. They also charge you $5 per piece of luggage that you store the day that you leave. It's a little good money earn because you have to check out by 12. Our flight wasn't until late afternoon so we had only booked a car to take us in the early afternoon. We were advised to this by a cabby who told us traffic is murder on the way to the airport. A good car company to book your car, reasonable rates JFK $46 + $4.5 for toll - -- Final word, don't book this hotel no matter what, it isn't worth the money. Remember BEDBUGS are a pain and not at all fun. Think 30+ and growing bites of mosquitoes and then you are getting close to what it's like.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'll start with the good thing first: the location. It's near a subway and alongside Broadway, and it takes about 20 minutes to get to Times Square from the moment you leave your room. Now for the bad things. (a) The rooms are TINY. I stayed in 3 separate rooms over 2 weeks (after taking trips to Chicago and Washington DC during my stay) and all are tiny; the rooms I had one double bed, one beside table and a few poles to hang your clothes on. (One had a tiny toilet instead.) The room is big enough to put the double bed with about 1.5 feet to spare on either side of the bed. (b) The counter staff are incompetent and very rude. They lost our reservation for the second leg of the trip and were patronising, unhelpful and contemptuous. They would claim that 'your reservation is not on the system' and repeatedly ask, "What website did you book it on?", and when we couldn't immediately remember they repeated themselves as though we were slow 3-year-olds. This is a service industry, but they don't recognise that or choose not to bother. (c) Interestingly, every 2 or 3 times we passed the counter in the lobby, we'd see a disgruntled customer discovering that his/ her deposit had been conveniently lost by the hotel. Word to the wise: document every single transaction you have with this hotel, or you're going to see your money magically disappear. (d) For the last 4 days of our stay in NYC, we stayed on the 4th floor, and the lift lobby on the 4th floor smelled as though someone had urinated in it, and the smell got progressively worse and had not been dealt with on the day we checked out. You know you have a problem if the NYC subway smells better than your lift lobby.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My mother and I stayed at this hotel from Dec 2-6 2005. Right before we arrived at the hotel we saw the reviews that there were bed bugs and had only hoped that they had taken care of the problem before we checked in. We were totally wrong the first night we were there we found one on the bed and went down to the office and asked for a new room but they acted like they didn't even know they had the bed bugs! I mean after the 10 reviews of people saying they complained about bed bugs how could they not know. So then they offered to give me another room on the 4th floor without a private bathroom eventhough I paid for one with a private bathroom. So when i said they would have to refund the difference they said we'll see what we can do. So before I carried all of our luggage up to the 4th floor since there is no elevator i asked my mom to go up and check the room. When she turned on the light she immidiately found a huge bedbug on the bed and brought it down to the front desk and they still did not offer any assistance. We went to NY on one of the busiest weeks and there were no other vacancies so we were forced to sleep there! We bought a plastic cover for the bed, moved the bed to the middle of the room, and slept with the lights on every night. We felt like we were on "SURVIVOR" taking turns sleeping. The bathroom was clean but the room was run down and there were bed bug egg shells everywhere. Everynight we killed at least 2 that were on the carpet and on the walls. Rude staff who didn't know anything. Nice location but they need to close this hotel down for about a month and exterminate they have an infestation! If i could rate this hotel with no stars i would but that option is not available! Sleep outside with the bugs and save your money, if you are going to stay here!</p></li>
