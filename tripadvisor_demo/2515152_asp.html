It was a very hot day, the AC unit had a screeching noise that would keep you up at night, good thing we brought ear plugs. At least the AC unit was working well. Continental breakfast was a huge disappointment. The biggest spread of nothing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel since we had an early morning flight out of Sea-Tac airport. It's a very basic hotel, but we were able to get a room over night and park our car for a week for $120. The shuttle to and from the airport was on time and their free continental breakfast was awesome with waffles, bagels, cereal, etc. After the trip we got back to our car and it was just as we left it.</p></li>

He gave us suggestions on where to eat, and dropped us off with curbside service, even openinng the door to the restaurant for us. I wish all hotels or any business for that matter, had employees a dedicated to service as he was. I will stay here as long as Darryl is available!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was clean and nice. Staff was good. We stayed here twice - one night each. They provide free continental breakfast which helped. There is also a free shuttle to and from the airport which is 5 minutes from here. And the airport now has a light rail to downtown so that is a very economical way to get to downtown from here. You can take the monorail from there to get to the space needle if needed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Near Seatac with free shuttle. Standard hotel rooms. Free business centre and hot breakfast. Free parking. We had a room at the back of the hotel and it was quite noisy from airplane traffic. Other reviews have said noise was not a problem, so it might depend on where your room is. Staff is very friendly and always asking if there is anything they can do for you. Restaurant on site. Good price for location.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is an old, very average hotel. The only positive about this hotel is that it's minutes from the airport and has a complimentary shuttle. This was the reason we booked this hotel since we had a 6AM flight. However, there is nothing around the hotel and it's 25-30 minutes from downtown Seattle. You need to call the cab from the hotel, and the ride one-way will cost around $45. We took a bus a few times, but it takes an hour to get to Seattle. Do not recommend!</p></li>

We had expected the Best Western to be worse than the nearby Holiday Inn Express down the street, where we had stayed the week before. In fact, it was an equivalent experience and a lower price. We had expected the breakfast to be only coffee and rolls, but there was a better (typical) breakfast buffet in a restaurant room instead. The bus to the airport was fine. The rooms were a bit dated but spacious. Room rate was only $84 plus tax.</p></li>

The restaurant was fine. Nothing special but not over priced and gave a tired traveler a good meal. The pool and hot tub were fun for my son. We got on the shuttle in the morning after a good buffet with eggs, waffles and all that one would need. Staff were polite and friendly. For the price it seemed a very good deal indeed. I would stay there again when travelling.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband & I stayed at the Executel in Seattle for 2 nights in July. Although it rained most of the time we found the staff and the shuttle drivers to be most friendly and helpful. We needed to stay near the airport so we didn't get to explore as much as we wanted to. The shuttle driver Leon was most helpful in advising us about what to do to get downtown, He took us back to the airport and told us how to use the train to downtown. We did go a few times but either it rained or we ran out of time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">All, if not most of the hotels along the International Blvd. strip cater to those who are going to catch a flight or have just arrived from elsewhere, so they are "one night stays". The breakfast was free, although nothing fancy. They run constant shuttle service to the airport which is what you are looking for. Staff is indifferent, but basically efficient. This hotel has several wings which tend to be a confusing layout and I believe there is only one elevator. Good value for the purpose intended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">WE had a reservation at the Red Roof Inn before our cruise. It was so disgusting that we said we need to sleep in our car or try to find another hotel. It was mid night and lucky enough Best Western had a room it was thirty dollars more but it was worth not feeling like you had cooties on you. Last year we tried the extended stay before the cruise and it was so gross. Finally we found a place that is clean, good parking area, nice breakfast, pretty room. We will stay here from now on before taking a cruise.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was a nice stay for the night. The airport shuttle was timely and we got here soon enough. It's relatively far away from the airport, but is fast enough. The elevator is old and slow, even if we just wanted to go down one level. There is only one elevator. The rooms are average size and average quality. We did not visit the pool or other facilities due to our late arrival. The breakfast was very nice and was open for a very long time. There are shuttles every half hour. It's a place that we might return to.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here at both ends of a recent trip. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable. I would have rated this higher but we had dinner on our return after a long day. We arrived at the entrance and it took over 10 minutes to seat us. Once we were seated we waited about another 10 minutes to be served. Our dinner took about 1/2 hour to come. We spent a total of about 1 hour and 20 minutes on a meal that should have been 40 minutes at most. There are no other restaurants close by or we would have left. Very disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Best Western Airport Executel the night before we had to catch our plane to go home. The staff were great, except don't let an employee at the desk tell you that catching the 7:00 am shuttle bus to catch a 8:15 am flight is plenty of time! The shuttle bus will also take you to nearby restaurants and then pick you up, but we didn't have to use that service since we walked to a restaurant called The Bull Pen. The room was clean, quiet and the bed comfortable. The staff courteous. Took about 10 minutes to get to the Airport via the Hotel's shuttle bus.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed one night with an early morning flight. The free shuttle to the airport was great, and I was even able to enjoy the free breakfast before I left, as it started early. Apart from the free ride to the airport, my party used the shuttle to get us to the train into town, and we just had to call for a pickup when we were ready to come back. It was nice to be able to leave the car behind. Darryl the shuttle bus driver was very friendly and helpful, as were the front desk staff. Great value. Nice pool. Very comfortable and clean.

Two blocks up the street was a Safeway where we stocked up on wine and sodas for the cruise. Hot tub and pool were refreshing and clean.

There is a nice computer room where you can print your boarding passes etc. There is no fast food or convenience stores located anywhere near the hotel. The hotel does have its own restaurant prices not that bad.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for two nights both before and after our Alaska cruise. The hotel is clean and comfortable and the staff was very helpful and accommodating. They offer a shuttle service to and from the airport and will also take you and pick you up from local restaurants or the light rail that takes you into downtown Seattle. They also helped us secure transportation to and from the hotel to the cruise port. Complimentary continental breakfast is included with waffles, toasted items, cereal, and beverages. Computers are available in the business center. We would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We always have great service at the Executel Park&Fly. Prompt shuttle service to and from, always courteous and friendly. It seems the Executel is doing something right, the parking lots are always full! Our past two trips have been very early in the morning so we missed the breakfast but the coffee in the lobby really helped, sure beat the coffee in the rooms. Our latest trip and flight out was later, so we enjoyed the breakfast hosted by Catherine. One thing however, please relay to guests parking overnight, please tell them to park within the designated white lines in the rear parking lot!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I always stay at BW Executel and find the staff to be very kind and helpful. It has occurred to me that the staff members must be quite happy to be working there so the management seems to be doing something right. The complementary breakfast is excellent and the pool/ hot tub are a great way to relax while traveling. The only reason I did not give it the highest ranking is that the shuttle service from the airport is not always very convenient and I have waited for quite a long time on a few occasions. On the way to the airport, it is perfect. I really feel comfortable at this hotel and would recommend it to anyone.</p></li>

In fact, an entire wing of the hotel was without hot water. We were given no apologies and a rude response from the staff. After complaining at length, we were begrudgingly offered a puny $15 discount on our room, which didn't begin to compensate for the lack of hot water, which should be an absolute basic!

The rooms aren't fancy, and I wish the linens were nicer, but the consistent positives have led me to make standing reservations at the Executel rather than play roulette with priceline - which I did for 2 years prior. Here's what I appreciate. Free parking. Free Wifi that's fast enough to stream movies. Free breakfast in the morning and simple dinners with bar service available at night. The king rooms are nicely sized. I wish the outlets were built into the bedside lamps, but other than that - it's a good stay. A very good value for the money.</p></li>

The beds were comfortable, the towels fluffy & soft even the restaurant had a good stir fry which was a surprise. The staff apologized over & over for the time it took to get my meal, everyone ordering at once. If planes taking off bother you, ask for a room near the front of the hotel.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Best Western the night before we flew out of Seatac. We left our car in the lot and paid the Park n' Fly rate. We came home a week later to a shattered rear car window. When asked about the last time something like this had happened, I was told, " Not for quite a while, at least a week". If I had seen that on trip advisor, I would have chosen a different hotel. The management was compassionate and, far too easily, found duct tape and plastic to secure the window. No other efforts were made on our behalf. Our stay at the Best Western turned out to be much more expensive than the cost of the room. Stay only if you don't plan to park in the lot overnight.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here prior to an early morning flight. Although the room was clean, it was cluttered and dark. The room picture posted does NOT look like the room we stayed in. The hallways were dark as well and on the night we were there, there was a lot of noise. Fortunately, no plane noise could be heard at any time. The breakfast was very heavy on carbohydrates; waffles, pastries, toast, cereal. For gluten free diets, not many options except eggs which were rubbery, flavorless discs. Check-in/out were unremarkable - I would have preferred more professional attire from the staff rather than a cotton t-shirt (female). I wouldn't stay here again as there are too many other options in the Seatac area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This would be our seventh or eight stay here using the Park, Stay and Fly. This time we booked two rooms again for our group based on previous experience. This property does not disappoint, it is clean, comfortable, and quiet in spite of being close to airport. My room was graciously upgraded to a King Room. That was an unexpected bonus. The free breakfast is really a Deluxe breakfast, not missing anything to get you on your way.. The shuttle to and from the airport is easy and could accommodate the 6 of us very easily. The pick up was fast and within 15 minutes of the call. We recommend the BW Executel every time we have a chance as an excellent hotel choice for transiting or going off on a holiday.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel, they let me come and check in at 9am when I was just off a cruise ship. The room was large, clean, comfortable. The staff helped with getting me a rental car, bus info, restaurants, etc. Then, in the morning I had to leave at 4am and the shuttle bus was on time and courteous. Even dropped me off at ticketing. I could not have asked for more. Although I didn't use it there was a gym, pool, and am breakfast! I highly recommend this hotel. It is located near the airport so I needed a rental car to go downtown, but this was not a problem at all. There was a car rental within walking distance to the hotel. Also, they have a room with computers and internet. Fabulous!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Upon arriving at SEA-TAC I called the hotel to get shuttle information - I was rudely told to hold. After several minutes I hung up and redialed. It was answered and hung up abruptly. I called again and was placed on hold before I could say a word. I waited for 4 minutes (I timed it). When no one came back online, I hung up and redialed and finally got a real person. The Front Desk clerk, Lena, was not friendly, welcoming or patient when I asked how to meet the shuttle. When I arrived at the hotel, she was sullen, unwelcoming and gave off a very negative impression. The room was decent, clean and comfortable. Good customer service was sorely lacking. With so many hotels to choose from, I probably won't stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this hotel when we needed to catch an early morning flight from seattle. Even though I had read the trip advisor's (mainly) good reports, I was a little hesitant as the hotel pictures made it look a little run down. This hotel turned out to be a real gem. The two girls at the front desk were very friendly and helped out with giving us a quiet room and helping us get to a good restaurant. The room was clean with modern decor and my husband claimed it was one of the better sleeps he has had. They have a pool and hot tub that actually work and are a nice temperature. The wake up call and shuttle to the airport was flawless. We parked our car in their lot and when we returned they picked us up and we just went to the lot and got our car and drove off. Very easy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Check-in was quick and staff were helpful in answering questions. We stayed in a room with a King bed that also included a desk and chair with ottoman. The room & bathroom were updated and clean overall (other than a water stain on the ceiling near the window). The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was well stocked with necessities. The A/C unit was noisy when running, but wasn't really an issue when sleeping at night since it cooled off enough not to really be necessary then. The breakfast that was included was better than I expected (when compared to a traditional continental). There was more of a variety of food items and they were restocked in a timely manner. The free hotel shuttle offered great access to the LightRail to take into Seattle. I would stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked at this hotel for the Stay, Park and Fly. We've booked here before, and there was always free parking while we were away at least for the first week with a marginal charge per day for the second week, if you booked the night before you left on vacation and the night you returned. We didn't know that the policy had changed. There is a charge for parking per day, which we found out when we came back. The front desk person really did try to make us feel better by giving us a discounted rate and room upgrade for the return overnight stay, and she truly did make us feel better somehow without apologizing! Overall, I would stay here again, but would research it better and not assume that everything remains the same. Hotel is clean, front staff and restaurant staff are friendly.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Traveling for business I searched Trip Advisor reviews for hotels in the Seattle area. I decided on the Best Western Executel. The room was comfortable not too small-roomy enough. The drinks at the bar were very reasonably priced. The food was good. The room and facilities were clean. The bed was comfortable. The staff was very nice. This Best Western was an excellent value and one of the better priced hotels in the area. Also, if you're looking for the best deal on car rentals in the area check out Fox Rent A Car. It's a regional company and much better priced than the others, especially during peak times of the year. They also provide free transportation to and from the airport. It's just down the road from the Best Western. I am forever grateful to everyone who writes reviews in Trip Advisor---THANK YOU.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We picked this hotel based on a cheap price we were able to get on Priceline.com and on the TripAdvisor rating. It was a good place to stay a night. The pool was good and the hot tub was nice too. I really loved the breakfast that was complimentary with our stay. There was lots of space for people to sit. The only recommendation that I would give is to avoid any rooms facing the street. The windows and patio doors aren't very sound-proof, so you could hear the road traffic . It wasn't really an issue for me personally as I sleep with earplugs but it could be a big issue for people that are sensitive to sound at night. The other benefit to staying here is that you can park your vehicle here while you are away for a week on your holidays. I would consider staying here if I should ever fly out of Sea-Tac Airport.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is quite close to the airport and very conveniently located to the Fox car rental. Both the airport and Fox have free airport shuttles. This hotel is not really close to any attractions or eateries other than a little steakhouse/bar and IHOP, and an on-site restaurant with limited hours. It's located about 25 minutes from Seattle and 20 minutes from Tacoma which we found convenient but could be annoying if you were expecting to be in or near either city. The hotel is fairly old but it's well maintained and clean. The rooms are comfortable and do well for business or leisure travel. Certainly fair value for the money. The staff were very pleasant at the hotel and the breakfast was excellent with DIY waffles! We enjoyed our stay but would probably pick somewhere else if we were going solely for pleasure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had asked for a handicap room after having had hip replacement surgery and they took very good care of me. The room was very clean and equipped with microwave, refrigerator and TV. Nice big bathroom and comfortable bed. I was at the end of the hall and heard nothing at any time. Was able to rest comfortably. The flight on US Airways was just the opposite. I needed to come home a day early due to illness and had already paid $629.00 roundtrip and they told me about the $150.00 extra charge but didn't advise me of the Add'l $207.00 they charged me for what they claimed the ticket cost would have been on that day. This isn't the first time they've ripped me off either. I hope I never have to use them again. Cost me $986.00 to go to Seattle and come home a day early, I had already paid for my ticket. They are a bunch of rip-offs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The room was very nice and blankets were very nice. There was a spare blanket in the room cool. Also shuttle schedule with Nelson Shuttle Service at [--] was excellent. I used the spare blanket very clean for a Best Western 5 stars on clean rooms. Also a very good cleaning staff in are room. One suggest is wish they would put two spare Blankets in the rooms someday. Since the room had two queen beds. The indoor pool was great with Hot tub. Also staff is very friendly and helpful. Also, had to verify with celebrity what pier for Nelson Shuttle service since Best Western wrote down the wrong pier information from pier 91 to Pier 66. I am glad i change this information since Best Western wrote down the wrong pier information for the driver. Other than that a good place to stay from the Airport Seattle. I would stay there again. Nice food near by too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here on a visit to Seattle. The plus for us was free shuttle to the Light Rail system and the airport. The shuttle and drivers were awesome. The left the hotel every half-hour (make a reservation, they'll look for you before leaving) but pick you up whenever you call. It's about a 10 minute ride to the airport. The light rail to downtown ran very often, was clean and quiet. I think it took about 30 minutes to get to downtown. The room was fine - pool great (and almost no one used it -don't worry there is a camera watching from the desk) - wireless access or complimentary computer access - breakfast was fine. We were told later that this is not an area to be walking in after dark - not a problem for me - I'd rather be swimming. A very helpful clerk even printed our boarding passes for us when we couldn't get the printer in the computer room to work.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here while picking up my sister from the airport. The lobby looks very nice. The hallways made me feel like i was walking into a very old appartment buliding walls had smears of all kinds. Doors to rooms look like they could be broke into very easily. The layout of the room was kind of strange. You can't really see the TV from the bed. The bed was very comfortable. The restaurant was very good! I was expecting small portions because of the price but they give you plenty. Plus the gentleman working there was great! Very helpful and friendly! The breakfast was okay. Nothing special. Lady at the front desk didn't greet me when I walked in or smile at all while I was checking in. Didn't seem like she cared much and just wated to go home. One thing I did find very helpful was an extra blanket in the dresser. The internet also worked great! Overall the stay was alright.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel near the airport because it had a pool and fitness room. The rate is good and the room was comfortable and clean, no problems there. The free breakfast is nice and there was a wide selection of different foods available. However, the fitness room and pool leave something to be desired. The fitness room is the walk thru area before you reach the pool or exit the pool, so the floor was wet, the kids played on the machines (that is an issue with the parents and not the hotel), the room was a balmy 80 degrees and there was no fan. The TV has no remote and the channel can't be changed and there are no anti-spetic wipes for the machines. Most people would not be bothered by any of these issues, but for the die-hard exerciser (like me), it was a touch disappointing. If you don't exercise, then this is a great hotel and I really recommend it for the close proximity to SEATAC.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had stayed in a more upscale hotel near the airport last October but it's summer rates were way too high for our budget. I found this on a hotel site and it was a great value for the money. It was very clean, updated, lots of snowy towels, great mattress, there was a pool, it was relatively quiet, and there was a great full hot breakfast that started at 5 a.m. The shuttle starts at 3:30 a.m. so early flights are no problem. The service at the desk and in the shuttle was top notch. We ate dinner in the Boulevard Cafe (attached) and it was a pleasant surprise. Given the very limited menu and low prices, our expectations were accordingly low, and my husband is a professional cook. However, the food was excellent with large portions. This is good, because there are no other restaurants within walking distance. We will definitely stay here if we have an early flight. It's the best deal going.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 nights and found this place to be wonderful. Family of 5 accomodated well. Staff are great, Jacquie was just super. Great breakfast, best we have had while travelling the States. Shuttle bus is always available and the drivers are fantastic and very helpful - Dennys, IHOP and Safeway just up the road and we were dropped off and collected once we rang. Rooms clean and indoor pool, gym and internet access is a bonus. Had troubles flying out to Chicago for early morning flight and the staff welcomed us back to our old room until our flight left after lunch. Plane noise is minimal along with traffic as you are about 10 mins from airport. We also caught the light rail into the city to sight see and returned back to airport to be collected by hotel shuttle. Only 2 complaints - sheets smelt of bleach- very strong , but as least they were clean and also no laundry available onsite.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I would recommend this location as it was very economical, the staff was friendly and the transportation staff were very supportive, and knowledgeable. Recommendations from one of the drivers (James) and a couple of others seemed to be very knowlegeable regarding the many sites to visit, locations to get your choice cuisines, and where to play in Seattle, WA. The shuttle driver, James recommended a wonderful little seafood restaurant, dropped us off at the location and we celebrated our anniversary in a place that had a very nice ambiance. We enjoyed the very coordial staff, their patience with those of us that were trying to get adjusted to an unfamilar place. Rooms were clean, bed was good, the restaurant served a good variety on their breakfast menu. It was a plus to have a refrigerator in the room, would liked to have had a microwave in the room, next time, the large TV was also nice. Enjoyed the pool and jacuzzi, and had a very relaxing stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A typical OLD dilapidated Best Western; OK for 1 night, maybe”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place is basically an old dump, very typical of many old Best Western hotels and not at all like a newer Holiday Inn Express or Hampton Inn, if you want something to compare to. The rooms have been modernized to an extent, as have the bathrooms, however the overall feel to the place is very much 1970s. Sound insulation is NOT good, at least it was not good in my room, and overhead jet noise was very noticeable. Fortunately, there is not all that much activity at the SeaTac airport between the hours of about midnight and 5 am. The breakfast was ordinary. I waited quite a while for the free airport shuttle on arrival even though I was told that it was already on its way when I called. I had no problems with the personnel and everyone was reasonably friendly. The wireless internet worked well. Would I stay here again? If my stay was only going to be for 8 hours or so, yes. If I was going to be in the hotel for a whole day or more, the answer is a definite NO.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay at this hotel was as travellers in transit heading to Syracuse. The staff went above and beyond to make our last night a memorable one. We opted to travel from Syracuse to Seattle as an affordable means to make it to Vancouver for the winter Olympics. The night we stayed at the hotel was the night of the Canada- USA hockey game (not the gold medal game but the first round game). We were able to watch the game with our family and the kids had a blast in the pool. When travelling in transit I am always frazzled trying to sort out the clothes, the tickets, what to keep on hand, etc. The staff made it very easy and with the helpful shuttle service added to our overall positive experience. In future we will consider doing the same trip in order to save on travel costs to Vancouver. As I mentioned in the title a great hotel if you are heading to Seatac, can't see it being a convenient spot if you want to visit Seattle from there. Thanks to the awesome staff!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for several nights while we toured around seattle. We got an excellent rate and it meet all our expectations. The kids loved the pool, which we spent way more time in then planned. The breakfast was good lots of selection and the kids loved the make your own waffle. My only complaint would be the sausage gravy and biscuits which were some super extra salty concoction, but easy enough to avoid with the other selections that were available. The rooms were reasonable quiet, minimal plane or traffic noise. The air conditioner below the window was louder that we are use to, so we just had to remember to turn the air conditioning unit to sleep and the fan on low at night. I would not hesitate to stay here again, This is a fairly basic hotel with a few extras, and excellent value that we found unbeatable. If you book online directly with Best Western, they will beat any online price by 10%, you just have to send them an email with a link to the lower price.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I should start by pointing out that my stay was while they were renovating the main entry, which created a whole bunch of headaches. Upon arrival there was no where to park for check-in, so I was forced to double park and risk a ticket. After I checked in and started looking for a permanent parking spot, I discovered there were none to be found. Ended up circling the lot for 15 minutes until I was lucky enough to spot someone leaving. The room was small and lacked a real desk, which made getting any work done almost impossible. Finally, when my neighbor turned out their shower (which I could hear) I discovered that the water pressure made my room shake (note: from the midwest and never experienced and earthquake before, that's what I thought it was at first). It quieted down from there, and I was able to get a decent rest before heading to the airport the following morning. However, there are plenty of other discount hotels around Sea-Tac. I'll be trying one of them next time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Had to go for Family Business from Hawaii to Orlando- Stopped at a layover in Seattle on Alaska Air to spend the night and break up the long flight time. We stayed at this Best Western on the way out and then opted for it again on the way back. It was more economical than the others in the airport area and had free shuttle service to and from the Airport. The kingsize bed was very comfy and the Shower was nice becuase it had SPA-like dispensors for the shampoo, soap and conditioner- (I hate those teeny tiny bottles) There is Free Wi-FI and a small gym and pool spa area. There is a fridge and coffee/tea maker in the room. We were surprised to see a large number of cable channels were also free. Another perk was the free breakfast area. (the Make your waffle machine was fun) and there are all sorts of goodies to have along with free coffee teas and juices. There is however no regular resturaunt or one close by. You would need to take the shuttle or have a rental car. This hotel is great as an overnight stay between planes.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We used this hotel recently and once in the past when flying in and out of Seattle. They offer a park and fly option, very good free breakfast, shuttle service, and are far enough from the airport not to be noisy. The desk staff have been welcoming and friendly on all occasions. Physically, this hotel is rather dated and the rooms nothing special. One of the toasters in the breakfast area was not working due to a missing handle and was still in this condition when we returned two weeks later. The shuttle driver we had when we returned was very friendly and helpful with our luggage. For a nice tip, he put all the luggage (we had a lot) on the cart and took it to our room and unloaded it. The room and bathroom were very clean. I would not want to stay on the bottom floor as we were able to walk right in the side door off the parking lot without needing to use our key. This was in the morning. It was locked the night before, but still doesn't seem like a good idea to have access to the hallway and therefore rooms that easily.</p></li>

The food in the cafe takes forever and the femare the worst servers I have ever encountered. Chris complained about the chef and other employees in front of customers. Norma smacked her lips and rolled her eyes when I asked for hot water. There is no microwave access. Staff has an issue with warming up food and booking rooms. Apparently, the staff likes to pick and choose who they rent rooms to because we were told they had no rooms, but when we called the 800 number, we found that there were rooms available. Staff is overly concerned about towels, silverware, cups, blankets and other things. Unfortunately, they tend to believe that everyone wants their rags. We don't! I was offended by this kind of behavior. Furthermore, people were talking about Norma and Chris’s horrible service in the pool area. Everyone agreed that this was not a place to return to. The pool caused rashes on our skin. Do not use the restaurant, very unpleasant older ladies.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I went to Seattle for businesss, naturally taking my wife. I noted some minor poor reviews regarding the Executel on researching hotels close to Seatac, but we always had good luck at Best Western hotels. We could not have been more pleased. The hotel itself was quite clean and inviting. The room was really nice and the TV had more than 12 stations. It seems that the hotel may have been renovated and the entire experience was more than satisfactory. We used the computer room and found it fully stocked and we were able to get boarding passes for the return flight and check email with no problem. The staff was friendly and went out of their way to accomodate us. The on site restaurant is more than adequate. The bill of fare was varied and the food outstanding. There is a complimentary morning continental breakfast that is deceiving. It is not strictly a continental breakfast, but not quite a full hot breakfast. It was very good.

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have stayed here before, doing a sleep/park and fly package. That time we parked for 12 nights and were charged what we were quoted online. It was fine. This time we parked for 14 nights prior to staying there. We were charged an additional $40 over what we were quoted for parking. APPARENTLY they have a 7 night package and a 14 night sleep and fly package. Funny, but it stated that no where on the website. When I mentioned this the staff shrugged me off. In fact, the staff were not very friendly or helpful. So we ended up paying $170 PULS taxes for 1 night plus parking. Pretty steep I think for an average airport hotel, particulalry when most are offering great deals these days. The room was clean and comfortable, but the walls are paper thin and I heard people walking and showering above us before very early flights. Also, what's with the selling of cheap white hotel towels? Found that rather tacky. We are Best Western rewards members, but we are very disappointed with the service at this one. We will not return. Next time we'll find another hotel that doesn't sneak in hidden charges at check-out.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I only have good things to say about this motel! I wanted a clean, comfortable and affordable place to stay overnight between flights out of SEA, and I got just that at the BW Executel. I thought my room was wonderful. It was a pretty large room with a king size bed, and I had the sense that it had recently been renovated. The contemporary furnishings in the room reminded me more of a Hilton or Marriott hotel, rather than a Best Western. The bed was so comfortable, with an ample supply of pillows, and I had a very restful nights sleep. The room included free wi-fi access, a refrigerator, nice new television, a great work space, and a clean, large bathroom. It was also very quiet. No noise from other rooms or from the exterior. There was a nice breakfast bar in the morning and a complimentary USA Today newspaper. Although the motel is located about 2 miles from the airport, it was easy to get there with the complimentary hotel shuttle that departed every 30 minutes. I paid less than $100 for this room for my overnight stay which I felt was a bargain. Based on this experience, I would absolutely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Best Western Executel one night as we had a connecting flight at 5am the next morning. When picked up at the airport by the free shuttle, we were so pleased with the service and the humor our driver displayed. Wonderful trip to the hotel. Check in was a breeze, and the front desk staff was kind and funny. The hotel is quite a maze...got lost twice! The lounge serves a small but good menu, and the woman tending the bar was great. The room was clean, the bed was comfy, dipped a bit to much in the middle, but we were only sleeping for 4 hours so it didnt matter at all. Only complaint, we asked for a 2am wakeup call,....that didnt come! Good thing Hubby has a natural clock in his head. There is also an alarm clock for backup in the room, but every clock seems to be different so setting them can be hit and miss for me. In the morning, our shuttle driver was there, right on time, and confessed that it was he that forgot out wakeup call, he felt very bad about it, gave us a breakfast basket for the road and took us right to the door where we needed to check in at the airport. He was forgiven! All in all, a great place to stay, and we will do it again next time in Seattle!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Executel is a typical airport style hotel/motel property, so if that fits your traveling style, you will probably get what you expect, and may even be pleasantly surprised, as I was. I stayed here both pre and post cruise, so had two different rooms, and each time they were both very clean and tastefully done, having been newly remodeled. The were fairly large too. The breakfast wasn’t gourmet but was enough to get you going and last until lunch, although heavy on the starch (waffles, biscuits & gravy, toast). Boiled eggs and apples/bananas were served too. The staff were really helpful giving all sorts of information. They recommended and reserved a restaurant (providing free shuttle van) that was located right on the waterfront, making for a perfect Seattle setting on our last night. The only fault is that the hallways desperately need to be remodeled. On the first stay, when walking to my room down the drab, tattered carpet, scratched up hallway, I was very apprehensive of what the room would be like. But as mentioned, my fears were unfounded once I opened the door. Would I stay there again? If I need a decent place at a decent price, I wouldn’t hesitate to go there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I am a Best Western Rewards client - always stay at BW whenever I travel because the rooms are always clean, the staff usually helpful, and the facilities are centrally located and well kept. This hotel is none of the above. In the first place, the premises are old, the furniture is worn, the carpets are dirty and the walls are dingy. That could be forgiven were it not for the fact that the staff is unhelpful, with the exception of one shuttle driver and one new receptionist. Examples: there are no instructions posted in the computer room about operating the printer or informing a guest how to log in, which means one has to ask the front desk and if there is only one person there, well, tough luck. When one asks for assistance, the staff behaves as if they are either annoyed or clueless or both. The rooms have been updated but the walls are horridly thin. I asked for a "quiet room" and could still hear normal conversations down the hallway! Finally, guests are not informed that if they want a shuttle to the airport., they must make a reservation! My entire stay there would have been comical if not so horridly inadequate compared with normal Best Western reputation for quality and service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I chose this hotel for a stay&fly prior to our 2 week trip to California and Mexico. I booked online and was quoted a very good price. When we checked out there was some confusion on the price. I ended up paying more than the quote (granted it was only a couple dollars more). When I filled out the survey sent by the hotel I mentioned the issue. I received a very nice note from the property manager, Elizabeth Trudeau, along with a credit for the overcharge amount. I appreciated her quick response and the credit. Without going into great detail it had to do with the amount of taxes paid. As for the property itself, we found the room to be very clean and comfortable. We were able to use the wireless internet which was very convenient. In the morning we at a quick (free) breakfast before boarding the shuttle. We did reserve this the night before. The shuttle was on time. We did see a couple come out just after he pulled away and he went back for them. Upon our return, James picked us up from the airport and drove us right up to our car which was waiting safe and sound. He was very personable and efficient at his job. I would not hesitate to stay at this property again and recommend it to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed with friends for a week in September for a convention over that weekend. We loved the hotel overall; breakfast was wonderful (especially the biscuits and gravy), the restaurant had good food for dinner, front desk staff was very helpful about passing on bus schedule information to the best of their knowledge and the shuttle drivers were absolutely wonderful to talk to and joke with each ride (since the four of us went back and forth from the airport several times that week). The room was very clean, only one minor maintenance issue that has probably been solved by now - the smoke detector was hanging loose like someone had tried to get up and take the battery out.

Only had one minor issue with housekeeping in the last two days we were there, and that was one of my friend's energy drinks went missing, and another friend's washcloth went missing. The cloth was a completely different fabric and look than the ones at the hotel, and was buried deep within her bathroom/soap items. Overall, I would suggest this hotel. Quiet, clean, friendly staff, nothing too big to worry about and close to the airport with free shuttle service and a cheap bus ride into the city center.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We selected this hotel because we wanted a lower cost, but safe place to stay in order to catch a very early flight out of SeaTac the next day. For this purpose, we seek motels or hotels close to the airport with a gas station nearby for fueling the rental car and an informal dining place for refueling ourselves. We try to stay in the $70 to $90 a range for these one night stands. Arriving at check in, we found ample free parking on site, but a long line tour group checking in. As soon as the front desk person noticed I was not with the group, she opened a new position and efficiently checked me in. We borrowed a hotel luggage cart to take our stuff to our room. After we got everything repacked for our flight scheduled for 0630 the next day, we drove a few blocks North to eat at Dave's Diner, a Route 66 themed, old style family diner with a good selection of comfort food. Stuffed, we drove South and filled up the car too. Then back to the hotel to catch some shut eye before our 0415 alarm would go off. The hotel also has a restaurant on site, but we did not try it out on this trip. Up early, fast checkout, and we had our car efficiently checked back in at AVIS, got through Security before the lines formed and sat down to a leisurely coffee and bagel. Best Western Microtel met our needs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was pleasantly surprised on my recent business trip to Seattle. I stayed at the Best Western Airport Executel Hotel in Seattle. While this hotel does not look like much on the outside, the interior paints a completely different picture. The check-in was very quick and efficient. The Front Desk staff were polite and professional and answered all questions with ease. The rooms are very clean and feature white linens. They don't have flat screen televisions but that is a minor issue to me. If you're an aviation fan like me, you can also get good views of aircraft that have just taken off from Seattle Airport. The breakfast was outstanding and a little bit more than the standard Best Western breakfast. The restaurant on-site provides good food at a reasonable price. If you're looking for a hotel that provides good quality and value for your travel needs whether it's a night before a flight or a meeting at a nearby hotel, I would come back to the Best Western. They also have a great swimming pool inside to relax at the end of a long day. I also loved that you can park your car for free while staying there. I can't stand having to pay to park at a hotel. The only downside is that there aren't many things located in the vicinity of the hotel but that's very much the case for most of the airport hotels.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Used there Stay, Park and Fly Package”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here on May 9th for one night prior to flying out of SEA TAC. We used there 7 day stay park and fly. Stay 1 night and park your car for 7 days while you were away. Much cheaper then airport parking. When we pulled up I was a little nervous as the front part of the hotel was ripped apart. Looked like they were getting ready to start renos. We booked here as they offer a stay park package, free 24 hour shuttle and indoor pool. Upon arrival we found out the pool was closed, my son was very disappointed as this was one of the main reasons we booked here. Room was very clean. beds was comfortable. Front desk staff on check in were very friendly and efficent. We checked out on May 10th at 3am. We had a very early flight. The gentlemen checking us out was very rude and snappy with us. He tried to charge my cedit card a second time even though I pre paid on line. I had to go through my suite cases to get the proof which I had already provided at check in. We did use the shuttle to get us to the airport. The shuttle driver was amazing. Very friendly. He went out of his way to ensure we knew were to be picked up from on our return. Thanks so much to him for his great service. When we arrived back at SEA TAC the same shuttle driver picked us up. He was amazing and very helpful with his directions to get us back ont he freeway home again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel room was nice it is small not a lot of move around room but very clean and comfortable. The bed was great not lumps clean and fresh pillows the carpet was clean and the bathroom was clean. Small single cup coffee maker nice touch and the dispenser for soap and shampoo my children loved! We did not get a chance to checkout the pool but we saw a few people relaxing in the jacuzzi.... looked relaxing. We took the suttle service from the airport to the hotel and to the train to go downtown the next day. The shutlle drivers where nice and they drop you right in front of the train station and will pick you up from there if you call once you get there. The food was good at the hotel we ate dinner there our first night there the fired shimp were very good and the pizza we had with the articokes minus the bacon was excellent! Service was nice and friendly and you can just charge it to your room that worked out since I was using the same credit card. Breakfast was average nothing fancy biscuts and gravy boiled eggs one morning and fried eggs the next waffels every morning cereal oatmeal juices and coffee and toast no donuts or rolls during our three nights stay. Free internet service in room or in lobby. I would stay there again just for the price used my AAA discount the only reason I wouldnot stay here is if I needed to be closer to downtown.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We drove down from Vancouver to fly out of Seattle for our trip to Turks & Caicos, so we decided to stay the night before so we could do a park & fly package. It was a great deal and saved us so much money over parking at the airport. We had a first floor room with a patio door, which was great. There's only a few of these. The hotel was clean and comfortable. Check-in was easy, and service was friendly. I did hear some guests upstairs showering and walking around early in the morning, but I'm a light sleeper I guess, as my husband heard nothing. They have a rather nice little indoor pool and hottub with glass windows and a patio (for summer). We didn't have time to swim, but it looked clean and inviting. The hotel included breakfast which was buffet style and quite good. They even had a waffle maker, which my husband enjoyed. The shuttle ran every 15 minutes, so we booked the time the night before. It wasn't crowded. On our return we called for a shuttle and it was there in about 10 minutes. Our vehicle was just fine. It was parked right next to the hotel, so it's quite a busy area. If you don't leave any valuables in iy you should be fine. All in all it was a great choice for an airport park & fly hotel, and we'd absolutely stay again if we once again fly out of Seattle. This is the second Best Western we stayed at since since Dec. and I am liking the chain so far.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here on September 15th 2008. I booked a "reverse park & stay" meaning that we parked our vehicle in the hotel lot and flew out of Sea-Tac airport, when we returned to Sea-Tac, we stayed a night at the hotel. All of the hotels in the area offer these deals, I suggest that you consider other hotels before staying here. When we arrived at the hotel after 10 nights in Hawaii we checked into our room. My wife immediately noticed that the toilet seat was dirty. I reported this to the front desk and they moved us to a different room. When I went out to check on my vehicle I discovered that it had been broken into sometime while we were away. Nothing was taken, but there was about $1000 damage. I reported this to the hotel front desk person and he seemed indifferent. After looking around at thier long term parking area it became clear to my why my vehicle was not safe there. Thier parking area sits lower than the main street outside, so there is no line of sight into the parking lot from the roadway. Also the area is very poorly lit - a fact I could not have known when I first parked there in the daytime. If staying at one of these park & stay hotels be sure to have a good look around at the parking lot first. This hotel was not very impressive at all, which is unfortunate because I have always relied on the Best Western name when I see one in an unfamiliar town. I will not stay at this property again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were traveling with my father, who has some issues and difficultly traveling. Jennifer checked us in and made arrangements for a rollaway bed. Immediately after getting to our room we had a problem---caused by one of us---that made the room undesirable. I went to the desk and talked to Jennifer and explained the situation. She immediately moved us to another room, moved the rollaway for us, and made sure we were settled in the new room. This was done in the most pleasant fashion with no indication of irritation. The facility was older and a bit tired, but quite acceptable. The internet did have some problems, until I connected to a different router, after which it worked well. Their restaurant converts to a breakfast buffet in the morning. It had a good variety, and the staff was quite attentive. I requested hot chocolate, and they said there was none, but if I could wait a few minutes they would make some. Less than five minutes later, they had a dispenser with hot chocolate out. As we were staying in the hotel a few days later, we asked if we could leave a few items and pick them up on our return. Again, they cheerfully issued claim tags and accommodated us. SeaTac is only a few minutes away, and a Safeway is convenient for stocking up on traveling supplies. We picked it for its location and price. I wouldn't have rated this hotel Excellent if not for superior service and great breakfast. We'd gladly stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for a night based on the impressive tripadviser reviews and I was very pleased with the choice. PROS: The hotel shuttle promptly picked me up from Sea-Tac after I called the hotel. The shuttle driver was very polite and offered to drive me to additional places (i.e. restaurants) during my stay for free. My room was very clean, spacious, modern, and comfy. There is a business center with three computers for internet access, in addition to Wi-Fi in the rooms. The pool was clean and the jacuzzi was warm, however, the sauna was down. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful, and the complimentary continental breakfast was good and complete. It included biscuits and gravy, hard-boiled eggs, selection of toasts (with great raisin bread), yogurt, cereal, waffles, milk, orange juice, bananas, teas, coffee, and a couple other things. The hotel is also within a 5-10 minute walk of a Safeway/ small shopping center with a nearby Subway. A liquor store and I-Hop are also within close walking distance. You can also take the shuttle to the airport and catch the metro to downtown Seattle for $5 round-trip. The trip downtown via metro takes about 45 minutes. CON: The only that disappointed me about this hotel was that it advertised a "fitness center" as an amenity. In reality, there were two elliptical machines and a stair stepper... no weights are provided. CONCLUSION: So, in all, this hotel is a great value and I absolutely would recommend it to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We highly recommend the Best Western Airport Executel in Seattle Washington located two miles from the SeaTac airport. This is a very clean, very reasonably price, quiet, nonsmoking older hotel with lots of extras. The shuttle arrived very quickly after being called. We were quickly checked in by Elizabeth, who answered all our questions, and checked on the arrangements the hotel had made for our shuttle to Pier 91 the next morning. (Also reasonably priced) Our friends went to downtown, and we stayed to take care of some business via fax from the hotel. We dined in the hotel restaurant which had excellent service. Our friends came back bragging about the wonderful Ivars clam chowder they had. Well we had that too in the Executel restaurant, and it was delicious. I do not recommend the fish and chips (probably a Texan thing), but everything else was great. The complimentary breakfast was better than your average hotel breakfast. There was a nice place for us to play “42” in the atrium overlooking the indoor pool. Every staff person we met was very friendly and helpful. We stayed there in 2008 and enjoyed the upgrades they have made. I didn’t even have to sanitize the remote. They have a cover that fits over it, which was a nice surprise. We will definitely stay there again when we are in Seattle. We had asked for a handicapped room, but when we saw how far away it was (I use a walker) they gave us 108A which is a regular Queen. I had no problems. Check it out the hotel at: http://tinyurl.com/3kp7pxe</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was the perfect way to round out a trip or to get it started. Location was excellent, a mere 10 minutes from SEA-TAC Airport, even better with their free airport shuttle. Their rooms were in excellent condition with soft towels, moderately firm pillows, extra blankets, and springy mattresses. The bathroom was very spacious and a good selection of coffee and teas in the room to choose from. The room has a nice roomy feel with the nice soft carpets while the hotel replaced the traditional bottles of shampoo and conditioners with a wall mounted dispenser for shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Breakfast was nice with a added degree of excellence in providing muffins and juice in the lobby for extra early morning travelers. Parking lots are pretty well lit and close to the rooms. Only 2 minor details prevented my stay from being an over the top experience: lack of parking space and the fitness room. I hope that in the near future they can expand the number of parking spaces that they have because at times, it becomes a competition to try and find spaces to park. The fitness room only had three machines which consisted of 2 stationary bikes and a treadmill. Due to its close proximity to the indoor swimming pool, it was extremely humid and smelled heavily of chlorine. I recommend that they get a couple more different types of workout machines and to better ventilate and air condition the fitness room. Other than that, excellent hotel, excellent stay. The hotel carried the Best Western brand extremely well and I would definitely stay there again in the future.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here recently at the start and end of our vacation. The first stay went perfect. Shuttle from the airport was quick and the driver was very friendly filling us in about possible places for dinner and where he could take us etc. The hotel is older, but our room was clean and had everything we needed. Free internet is always a plus. We ate dinner at the restaurant on site and although it wasn't outstanding, it was ok and was priced adequately. The menu was fairly limited though. The continental breakfast was nice. It was probably one of the better complimentary ones I've seen. Unfortunately, our second trip didn't work out quite as well. We were picked up promptly at the airport. However, when we arrived at the hotel at midnight. We discovered that there were no rooms with hot water. There was another guest at the front desk who was very upset and the desk clerk was completly overwhelmed with what to do. Fortunately the shuttle driver stepped in and tried to get everything under control - he is really an asset to this hotel, but unfortunately I forgot his name. He suggested taking us to a nearby hotel, with the same owner, where we would be much happier. I am very grateful that he was around as I don't think we would have gotten much satisfaction from the front desk attendant. I think good customer service would have been to give a courtesy call to those of us with reservations giving us a heads up before we arrived. Phone numbers are required when making reservations. There are so many choices of hotels when flying in and out of seatac not sure I would risk this one again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The term 'Executel' is not helpful. I've stayed at many executive level hotels in Canada and the US - this does not fit in that category. While general cleanliness was not a problem, the overall impression was shabby, dated and in much need of renovation. We took 2 rooms for our party of 6: 2 adults and 4 kids, two of whom have special needs. Because of the special needs situation, we booked (a month in advance) one of the rooms with a rollaway so each person would have a bed. This was confirmed by phone a week before the trip. On arrival the desk clerk gave us our keys indicating which room had the rollaway. Getting to the room we discovered there was was space for a rollaway, but it was not in the room. A call to the desk got the reassurance that cots were only brought to the rooms after check in - it would be there soon. We went out for supper and on return called again to inquire when the rollaway would be delivered. "Very soon" we were assured. Took the kids to the pool and on returning to the room it was time to put them to bed so called again to ask about the cot. The rude and dismissive night manager told me it was far too late to ask for one, they were only available on a first come first served basis but he could bring some pillows so I could sleep on the floor. I don't expect hotels to fully appreciate or attempt to accommodate the challenges of traveling with special needs kids, but I do expect some degree of truth and courtesy when making a very common, basic request. I am certain this review will attract the classic management promise of a deeply fulfilling experience for my next stay. Given the level of competition in the area, that hardly seems likely.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “What a Gal Natasha is!!!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Reservations were made for a two queen bed handicapped room for 7 nights. We arrived and were presented with a one queen bed, in a very small handicapped room. No other options. My husband is on oxygen 24/7 and requires night mask, etc, so the night was not good. We decided to check out, and upon arrival at the desk, Natasha asked how our stay was, and I told her I was unhappy. She let me vent and then in the sweetest voice, said, "Didn't they tell you about room 180". At that point I thought it might be a bar and was ready to go. I was exhausted from a long drive, no sleep and the thought of moving all this equipment luggage, enough for a week, alone, again, was nothing I was looking forward to. I was whisked away to room 180 which was a dream come true, large enough for all his medical equipment, and room to walk around, a walk in tub, which was all we really needed insofar as help in the bathroom and we were in heaven. Our trip was unexpected, a death in the family, and to find someone who took the time to listen and help was a miracle. You have a gem in Natasha. I would recommend that you check with people who ask for handicapped rooms if the walk in shower is adequate for the handicapped needs. Also if the people who answer the phones could slow down. Many times we were calling on cell phones to make reservations and the road noise makes understanding difficult and they rattle off the name of the hotel very quickly. In one instance, we would have stayed at a Best Western, but were unable to understand the person because of language difficulties. Again Natasha is what every Best Western needs. Compassion, courtesy and knowledge of the property. What a Gal, Natasha.</p></li>
