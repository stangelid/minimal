<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great value, but....... We stayed here for 12 nights. Great location, clean, quiet. Our only caveat is the beds are not exactly luxury quality, so after the first week, our sensitive backs were complaining, but nothing that a good massage and hike up Diamond Head wouldn't cure !</p></li>

We did not go to Hawaii to hang out in our hotel room anyways so for sleeping and relaxing it was ideal. We would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice place to stay with good rates. No complaints!!</p></li>

Arrived that evening to find they had no knowledge of my reservation. No one answered the phone # that I had booked at. Room was very small w/ window AC that groaned all night. Not a place that I'd care to waste alot of my precious time on.Bill in NY</p></li>

I like moist cake, not a moist hotel room. If you need a cheap, centrally located hotel with no amenities and aren't bothered by things like a broken air conditioner, moldy lampshades and gross bedspreads then by all means stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A good place to get some rest We stayed at the Maile Sky Court Hotel for a day, prior to catching a flight to the Big Island the next day. A basic and reasonably clean hotel. The furnishings (carpets, furniture) in the room are quite old but functioning. For the price we paid for, I would say it is reasonable. This hotel is ideal if the intention is just to catch up on sleep after a day out on the beaches of Waikiki.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">"Lovely views - a bit old though" We had a wonderful view of Waikiki beach on the 35th floor. The hotel was quite old and a little cramped but we had a nice time. It is in a great location and has good facilities such as, TGI Fridays underneath it, Internet, a great laundrette, and a gift shop. This hotel is just 10 minutes walk to Waikiki beach and 5 mins from all the fantastic shops!. Loads of great restaurants and friendly staff!</p></li>

This is a good value hotel.The pool was well kept and this hotel is close enough to the beach to walk.The staff was friendly and helpful.The only problem we had was when they put us in a smoking room when we are both allergic to tobacco smoke. They changed our room after a short discussion.Yes, the elevators are slow.If we go back to we will probably stay in a different hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">OK but.... We stayed for a week from Australia. It was nice enough , but the pool bar and staff were very rude and unfriendly to myself and my group, and took a lot of business away from themselves as a result.It was offensive to us as guests there and because of it would never go back or ever recommend the place to anyone. It really was a sour spot in an otherwise fantastic trip to Hawaii. Hawaii we love it and will be back. (just not to that hotel)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Cheap and Cheerful If you want budget accommodation in Waikiki that is clean, not a long walk to the beach this is just fine. We only stayed a couple of nights on the way to another island. The room is small but we were out most of the time, so not an issue. Had no problems with the lifts, never had to wait long. Got a high floor which gave great views of Waikiki at night and enough ocean to make us feel like we were on holiday! It was clean, no bugs and helpful staff.</p></li>

The rooms were very clean, staff were friendly, the place felt safe, walking distance to beach, shops etc - my only complaint would be that i could hear people in the corridor but i've had the same in way more expensive hotels. I thought this place was great value for money and i'd definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stay here, spend teh extra cash on cocktails This hotel is good value for money. I did not understand why people complained. Great location, clean rooms, nice staff and yes elevators are a little slow , but this gave me the chance to chat to other travellers. if you want a pool or a resort holiday DO NOT got there. But , if you are young and want to see Hawaii for the first time and will eb going out lots and meeting new people at teh beach, why oh why would you pay $200 for a room. Just stay here !!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Value for $$ The hotel provided reasonable comfort and tranquility at a very reasonable price. The room (with own bathroom, no breakfast provided) may look small but is just nice to overnight stays. Every morning newspapers are delivered at the door step. No sea view (that's why it is much cheaper). One thing to take note is the lift is kind of obsolete, and you have to be patient for its arrival. Highly recommend those who seeks a little bit more than budget hostel but less luxury than starred hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great value Oue experience at this hotel was fantastic. The rooms were small, but not tiny, but they were clean, as were the bathrooms. The lobby had a friendly atmosphere and staff were very helpful. The hotel is not too far away from the main strip of Waikiki and it is safe to walk. We were on one of the top floors and while the elevators were a little slow and it was sometimes annoying if you had to change elevators, but its not that bad! Overall, this was value for money and we would definitely return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent place to stay We have stayed in this hotel 5 times. The Staff is excellent and the value can not be beat. We have stayed at several other hotels in Honolulu and Waikiki and would put this hotel up against any of them. The suites are huge, and the rooms are always very clean. There are no balconies, but all the other advantages make up for it. Ohana means family, and that is what you will feel like when you stay here. We liked this hotel MUCH better than the Outrigger Reef on the beach. GREAT Value!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great spot... good value! We stayed for 3 nights at the Sky Court (May 27-30, 2006). Got a great deal through Travelocity and were very pleased with the hotel. We found the front-desk staff to be very friendly and courteous. The location was great - only 10 minute walk to the beach, and an easy walk to all Waikiki attractions. The rooms were good too - very clean. The decor is a bit dated, but everything worked just fine. For what you pay at this property, I think it's a great value, and money well spent. I will return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good enough hotel for a place to sleep There was nothing fancy about this hotel but it served it's purpose well. A place to sleep while exploring Oahu. It was clean and the staff were helpful. Vit's Hawaiian Steakhouse at the hotel was good and was not overpriced. The only complaint about the hotel was the extremely slow elevators, but in the hotel's defense, there was work being done on the elevators. it is close enough to walk to downtown shopping and also a short walk to the beach. For the price, this is a good deal.</p></li>

We have stayed here several times in the past and never saw a roach but this time I think we made up for the last 4 stays..... They must have a problem on a certain floor or two. Aside from that we like the location, people and the price. Our last stay however caused me to upgrade to a better hotel for this year and pay a bigger bill, I guess the rooms are only syuppose to be for two.... people that is.</p></li>

Room was clean, roomy compared to others I have stayed at. Included complimentary continental breakfast or you can use $4 coupons at the restaurant downstairs. Nice perk! The price was excellent. Friendly staff. I wish they had had a microwave in the room but it was great to have a mini fridge. The pool is very small for the size of the hotel. They have a hot tub. Nice location! I would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

Hotel is only a 5 minute walk to the beach through Fort DeRussy Park. Stayed on the 29th floor and what an ocean view! Have read reports that the elevators take forever. Not bad actually. They did overbook the hotel-to-parking ratio and parking was scarce. We were asked to park 4 blocks down at another Ohana Hotel.Was only inconvenienced as torrential rains made the walk back soggy. Other than that a real nice place!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Place To Stay!!! This hotel was nice and cozy. I like the way the shower curtain went around in a angle. After flying for 6 hours I was very tired when I arrived. The staff was very helpful and full of smiles. Just a sight for sore eyes when you are dead tired. I would agree about the elevator being slow. For some reason I had to swipe my key in the elevator a couple of times before it finally stopped on my floor. Other than that the stay was excellent and the room was spotless. It is a excellent deal for the money. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Value for Budget Travellers We were after a budget holiday but wanted to enjoy a famous location. After reading the reveiws we weren't sure we shouldn't have paid extra for better accomodation. However the Ohana Sky Court exceeded our expectations. We didn't have to wait long for lifts, the happy hour was extended and we were within walking distance to beaches, shops and resturants. This was a good thing as the meals are HUGE and we liked walking off the extra calories. I highly recommend this hotel. We are from Australia and thoroughly enjoyed our trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A pleasant stay it was It is always a pleasure to return to the Maile. It is in a convenient location in the Waikiki beach area. The employees are very courteous and helpful.The room was okay, basic with nice view of Ala Wai canal and the mountains.As a military retiree, it was convenient to go to the Hale Koa hotel and Fort DeRussy Chapel. There are also many shopping places within walking distance.The room was relatively smal - fine for a single traveler, though.They did have the bath amenities - shampoo, etc.There is a respectable restaurant adjacent to the hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel for the price I have been to Hawaii 14 times mainly staying in the Ohana east. It was alot more money than this hotel. This hotel room was a bit smaller, but was very comfortable and very clean. I would not be afraid to stay there again on my next visit. The Hotel staff were very friendly and very accomodating. The tgif restarant was excellent, great burgers and food. the sun deck was big and you could always find the sun to tan. The pool bar made really good mai tais and lava flows. We were there Jan.28th to Feb.19th except for three days we went to Maui.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Maile Sky Court No Ka Oi My family stayed in the Maile Sky court this weekend for a company Christmas party. It was very nice being in Waikiki and the Maile Sky Court added to making it a wonderful stay. We had a mountain view, the room was clean and the employees were very sweet and full of aloha. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to feel comfortable without staying in a huge hotel where you have to walk forever to get to the front desk! The pool and soak pool looked very inviting but not enough time to jump in. Make Castle Resort hotels a place to stay! Mahalo.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Value This hotel was a 3rd option in a air hotel package. We did not have high expectations as the package was a very reasonable price. We were up graded to a room with a microwave. The room was small but clean and adequate. No balconey but we were out of the room most of the time. The pool area is basic but again quite acceptable for the price. Location is also very convenient. The restaurant TG Fridays which is connected to the hotel was also excellent. I suggest sitting at the bar and having a meal and a drink their. If you are on a budget this hotel is the one to stay at.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fond memories are just memories My wife and I stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky Court several years ago during an Oahu stay. Then the only complaint was slow elevators. This time, though the staff was as friendly as before, the housekeeping was poor, bedding uncomfortable and the slow elevator problem was compounded by some out of service.There used to be a TGI Friday's attached on the ground floor. It is now closed, due to re-open as a Steak House of some type.This hotel is no longer an Ohana property. Now managed by Castle, we have decided we won't be using this hotel for future stays.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Budget prices with small rooms and slow elevators Just returned from a 10 night stay at this Hotel in Waikiki. The positives of this hotel include nice and helpful staff, quiet rooms, clean rooms, very nice spa, and relatively good location. The elevators are the worst feature. They are extremely slow and hot with no fans or AC. For most of our stay at least one was not working and at times two of them. The rooms are very small with the hardest bed I have ever tried to sleep on. We bought an air mattress to put on top of the bed in order to sleep. We did enjoy our trip but wouldn't stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Smallest room ever This room was 14x11, seriously, I measured it. I've never stayed in a room that was less than 200 square feet! The bed was terrible; hard and lumpy. The bathtub was about three quarters the size of a regular tub. The only thing about the room that was nice was the view from the 35th floor. Other than that, this place is absolutely horrible and all the rumors are true. I think most Ohana Hotels are pretty bad, but this is by far, the worst in the chain. Oh, forgot to mention, they charge $18/night for parking. You're better off parking at the public garage down Kuhio for $10/night.</p></li>

Clean tidy room with airconditioning, iron and safe. Rooms are a good size with a small bathroom for showering and shaving etc.You can walk everywhere from here it's great exercise. Your room keycard also can be used for free trolley transport around Honolulu.On level 5 there is a bar and a pool. The bar may have some locals who visit but they provide a relaxed atmosphere and lots of happiness and fun. I met a lot of great people in there who were always up for a chat.Reception is 24 hours and friendly.Great time</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">great for budget travelers This hotel was well beyond what I thought it would be for a small budget minded person...My wife and I expected a run down hotel with not much to go with it..but we were pleasantly surprised... The room was very nice with a refrigeraor...color tv with remote.. hair dryer...etc... Although small the bathroom was quite nice. The rooms were kept very clean and the free morning newspaper was an added bonus. The staff was very helpful and security was great.. The wife and I celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary here and we were quite happy with everything... no complaints from us..THANKS !!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Tiny, but cheap This is an economical property with clean, but tiny rooms. The rooms were very cramped for my wife and I. It reminded us of a stereotypical Motel 6 type of property with low end rooms and small beds. If one only wishes to sleep and not really view anything from the windows, the windows could not be open except for about 2 inches, it might work for you. However, my wife and I will not be staying here again since there are many other economical properties with nicer, more open rooms, even within the Ohana chain. The one item we did really like about this hotel was the TGI Firday's located at its base.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hang Loose and less! In trying to save some money, we stayed here. Room was VERY small, but frig was nice. TGI Fridays in the lobby was GREAT! HOWEVER - the water quit every day we were there. We are not just talking 15 seconds....10-15 minutes. Twice in the middle of showers, once just washing sand off face. And it was not just in the AM. So who knows? When approaching the staff...they were confused, then approached again the 2nd time - could have cared less? Definitely a Hang Loose place? Location wasn't too bad. About 3-4 blocks to beach. Next time - I would pay the extra and stay nicer and on beach...wasn't worth the little I saved</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is a great deal! this hotel is quite the deal if you are looking for an economy place to stay. You have to keep in mind that our rate was about 50 bucks a night from an internet site. The room was far from a five star hotel but reasonalbe nonetheless. The room was clean, the staff friendly, and the hotel is a reasonable walk form everything. They have a roof-top pool and hot tub as well as a little bar that we enjoyed. We had a red-eye flight home at the end of our stay and the hotel provided a complementary room for us to shower and change before we left. Also, the TGI Fridays in the lobby is always running awesome specials.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not bad at all For $60 a night on Travelocity, this hotel is a great deal. We had an ocean view room on the 23rd floor, and sometimes took the express elevator to the 26th and walked down to our floor. The room was clean and comfortable, and the shower was awesome (lots of instant hot water and good water pressure). We didn't bother renting a car, and just walked or took the bus everywhere. The location is very convenient as downtown Waikiki and Ala Moana Center are within walking distance, and buses that go to the airport run by just outside. I would stay here again without hesitation... and hope to do so before it turns into a condotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved it 100% All the way from England on a buget and found this budget hotel to be fantastic. Ok the rooms are alot smaller than normal USA standards, they are more the size of Spanish hotel rooms, but when you're in Hawaii the last place you spend alot of time is in your room. The staff were friendly and the location was excellent. Situated at one end of Kuhio Ave you are within walking distance of all the attractions of Waikiki. The designer shops, the souvenier shops, the out door market plus many more. Also ideally situated close to numerous bus stops. All in all this was the best holiday I have had and would return to this hotel in a second.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Good, Budget Property I was pleasantly surprised with the level of good customer service I received during my stay. The room was well made up every day. Although the hotel is starting to show it's age, the rooms are clean even if they are basic. Clean linens-no nasty surprises anywhere. The way I saw it, the more I saved in a modest hotel, the more resources I had left for activities and future trips. Mind you, this is not a four star, but at the same time it is not the motel from Vacancy either. I enjoyed my stay. I could see the ocean from my 43rd story room. I felt safe and the staff was very accomodating. Stay here if you want to save money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Decent Hotel for a bargain Went to HNL last week and stayed at the Ohana Maile for 5 days along Kuhio.. was pleasantly surprised at the location as it was walking distance to the nice malls and beach. Our room was clean and they changed the towels regarly and the bathroom was clean too. Nice view of the city from our room at the 18th. The concern of the elevators too slow did not bother us as the longest we have to wait for one was 30 seconds. Central location and very accessible to the beach.For its price (we got it for about 60bux a pop), will definitly recommend Ohana for those travellers who want a decent place but at an affordable Oahu price.</p></li>

The room was small but clean and the housekeeping staff was very nice. Checking in/out was quick and easy! The only negative feedback I can give is about the elevators. I know this has been mentioned in a few other reviews but they were very slow. I have to say we took the stairs the majority of the time. Thankfully we were only on the 7th floor! And if you rent a car, the parking spaces are REALLY small. We usually had to pull out and then load or unload. But all in all it was a very nice stay and we鈥檒l definitely stay there again!!</p></li>

If I had had the money I would have left and book at any other Honolulu hotel; I am sure anything is better than Castle Maile. Even though our room was non-smoking it reeked of it; I had to call housekeeping for some deodorizing preparation, which made it a bit better. Carpets are so badly stained I never took my shoes off while standing. Walls haven't seen paint in a while. In our room the card entry system did not work, so we had to request a new set of cards every time we were going in. Elevators are terribly slow. There is not one single good thing I can say about this hotel. I would not choose it again even if they gave it for free.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Decent cheap place in Waikiki If you are looking for basic, rock bottom accommodations in Waikiki, you could do worse than the Ohana Maile Sky court. It's conveniently located to most of the shopping and dining in Waikiki, and not too far (about 4 blocks walk) from the beach. The rooms are adequate size and functional. Because this place is a skyscraper, you will need to use the elevators, and they could be better - i.e. more of them, and they could be faster. Parking was OK and fairly priced for Waikiki, and there were several decent restaurants nearby, including an excellent Thai place. It's a basic room, but as such, it's fine - just don't expect much in the way of luxury.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good value Hotel was good value. Clean. Great view (if you have ocean view room). I didn't wait more than one minute for elevators (were pretty quick). Just make sure you take your Cell phone with you so you don't pay 99cents per call. My Att and T-mobile cells worked fine there. Also, take tea/coffee bags with you so you don't pay $2 per bag. Although the hotel is 3 blocks from the ocean, it is not where the action is. The beach where the action is (waikiki beach) is actually about 10 blocks from the hotel. This was the only thing I didn't like. But it was only 10 minute walk and the walk is on the main street (kaukala) so there was pleanty to see on the way.The staff was not bad also.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">excellent budget choice I stayed at the Skycourt for two weeks in August and found it to exceed my expectations . Budget accomodations in Hawaii can be pretty grim , but the Skycourt offers a clean , well run and friendly hotel that is probably as good as you will find for the money . Rooms are small but well appointed and well maintained . The elevators can be slow but this was a problem for me only once in two weeks . The location is very central and it is possible to walk anywhere from Kapiolani Park to Ala Moana . Busses are right there . And the high rise design puts most rooms above the traffic noise and provides even many of the least expensive rooms with an excellent view . I will return .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Maile Sky Court - Good Service and Amenities for the Price I wasn't expecting much other than a location close to Waikiki's beach, but was pleasantly surprised when I checked in to the hotel. I was provided a clean room with a nice view of the coast and found the bar and restaurant in the hotel to be very good. The staff is very friendly, particularly the bar's bartenders, and the guests are from all walks of life which can make even a short stay here pleasant and interesting. I was here only 2 days and made friends with the bartenders (Shauna Lee and Matt I believe) and some of the hotel guests. Overall it was a very nice stay for the price and location. Only complaint is that the elevator is ridiculously slow.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Its OK, nothing more Stayed here as part of a cruise package. Only stayed here one night and that was enough. The rooms were decorated from late 70's-early 80's. The bed was like a taco and the shower drain didn't work so we had to wedge the shower sticky mat under the drain to let the water drain out. The elevators were extremely slow as everyone has noted. The room was quiet, the scenery was nice from our window and those were the major pluses. I would have been disappointed if we had a week long stay here. All and all, our stay was over before it began so the negatives were bearable. If you are staying here for a night or two or on a budget, I would recommend but if you are looking for a nicer room, keep looking.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not bad at all The Ohana Maile Sky Court is definitely a great value. It's ranked a two star hotel but the staff makes you feel like you're staying in a 5 star. The only complaint I have is that the elevators are sooooooooo slow!!! It takes 10+ minutes to get to your room from the lobby. It's a great place to stay at if you really want to explore the island of Oahu and spend very little time in a hotel. It's only a couple of blocks from the beach and only a few minutes walk to the International Market Place and the Ala Moana Shopping Mall. This hotel is also conveniently located on the same street (Kuhio) as the happening night time activities. You won't be disappointed if you are there to have a good time and keep an open mind!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice Hotel - Especially for the money Nice hotel especially for the money paid. Room I stayed in was $89. Small room but great room and very clean. Great location on the edge of Wakikki (about a 10 to 15 minute walk to the main beach) but still plenty of activity around the hotel and conveniently right on the bus line. Excellent staff from front desk to security to housekeeping to check-out. Nice security feature was having to use your room card to get to the room floors. Walking distance to many restaurants and shops and TGI Friday's on the 1st floor. Larger hotel so plenty of people around - some extra elevators would be nice but never had to wait more to 3 or 4 minutes even at peak times. Nice pool area particularly the whirpool.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You don't get what you don't pay for Cheap, somewhat troublesome, yet adequate hotel. Stayed 1 night in October 2004. Room was old, sparcely furnished, yet clean. No balconies on any rooms, but a great view of the city from the 23 rd floor windows. The elevators were slow and the hotel room had a strong sewer oder. But I opened the window and ran the fan and after a while I got used to it. Pool was OK. Lobby was tiny. Kind of a long walk to the beach. This is the hotel for starving college kids and families on a budget. Not bad, but you could do better for a little more money. Upgrading to the Ohana Waikiki West is a good idea, if you can afford it. I probably won't stay here again but would still recommend it to people on a very tight vacation budget.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great for the price We loved our stay at the Ohana Maile Sky Court. For US$89 a night we got a clean and relatively spacious air conditioned room with a bar fridge, bath and shower. Because it is a huge hotel, many of the rooms (including ours) have a view of Waikiki beach and the city. The service was friendly, personable and helpful. In contrast to some of the other reviewers, we had no problem with the lifts.The reason it is cheaper than other Waikiki hotels is that it is a 15 minute walk from the beach and the carpet is old. Neither of these factors bothered us in the slightest. Don't bother going to the hotel pool. It is tiny and in the shade most of the time. The hotel bar also looked like a bit of a dive, but if cheap drinks are what you are after, it could be worth investigating!</p></li>

I am not a hard person to please, but these rooms were really small and the service was average. They are kind and courteous at check in but thats about all the service you are going to get. When asking for directions they expect you to know how to spell the hawaiian street names??? Hotel is old and a little run down. Most of the hotels are showing their age in waikiki, but you shouldnt have to settle for it. Alot of older hotels are rennovating their premises, so do your research and find a better hotel. Yes, it served its purpose, but sleeping and showering in a nice place would be cool too, wouldnt it?pro: hawaiian airlines check in kiosk on premisescon: close but still a walk to the better part of waikiki beach</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice for the price Upon arrival I was welcomed with a friendly Aloha. Upon check inI asked about the different rooms, I was given 2 keys and told to select which room I wanted, one would be a upgrade. I looked at both rooms, for the small upgrade charge I choose the Oceanview kitchenette Suite, it is twice the size as the regular kitchenett. My room had a great view of Diamond Head Mountain, the beach and the cities on the mountain.Hotel is close to shopping, restaurants. Walking distance to beach is about a 10 minute walk.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Cheap and Basic We stayed at the Sky Court 2/7  2/8 (pro bowl week) and then moved on to the Aqua Waikiki Wave. We wanted to check out both hotels and we specifically wanted a cheap place the first night since we would be arriving late. I would definitely categorize the Sky Court as a budget hotel. We paid $95 per night (taxes/fees included) for a Standard room and booked via the internet. The reviews I read were all accurate. The rooms were small and neat in appearance. They had window air conditioners, refrigerator, complimentary use of the safe, and only a few TV channels. The bed spread and blanket were very old and dirty, so we just used the sheets. The staff was friendly and helpful and the location was good. I was relatively satisfied with our stay, however, I'm not sure if we would stay here again. The condition of the bedding really bothered me.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good price for the location We stayed there from 11/9/06 to 11/13/06. Our room smelt mildew when we first arrived. Then we made sure the shower curtain was opened and air dried everyday. The smell reduced to almost not noticeable. The bathroom was kind of small. The room size was reasonable. The bed was comfortable. We got a good view to the canal. At peak time, such as 8-10 AM and 5-8 PM, the elevators could take forever to come. The staff even blocked one elevator to deliver towels/supplies everyday in the afternoon peak time. It made the situation worse. The parking lot is very small. Don't expect to find a parking space if you come back late, e.g. 9 PM. When we were there, the jacuzzi was broken. It only provided cold water! The location of the hotel is good. It is not too far from the main street  Waikiki. For the price  location, it is not a bad choice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">better than I expected Having read reviews on this site, I selected this hotel as probably being the best rated cheap bed in Waikiki. I expected it to be clean, small, and basic. I wasn't disappointed. The room contained a hairdryer and iron which was a real surprise - often you don't get that in a bigger hotel - and ok toiletries if you needed to use them. Bed was firm but not uncomfortable. A refrigerator was very useful for the snacks, water etc you can pick up at the ABC store across the road. Staff were friendly, check in was simple, and I had no charges for things I didn't know about. Everything was clearly labeled if using it cost extra. Easy walking distance of everything and easy to find as its one of the taller hotels! There was a TV and game console, although why anyone would want one in Waikiki is beyond me....Would certainly go back if I'm on a budget.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Strictly not for couples / honeymooners.. I stayed there in the hotel with my wife, our first trip to Hawaii after marriage.I booked through a popular airline' s vacation package just because of the low price, for which I had to repent later once I entered the room. Our room was in 12th floor. It was smelly and absolutely not looking pleasant. The bed spread was the cheapest which I've seen in my life, among all hotels visited.If you are lookin' for a hotel JUST to keep your luggages, go for it.. worth it! If you are going Hawaii to enjoy including your stay, avoid this hotel first. Please spend little more money and book a nice hotel.I really wanted to write so much of my bad experiences in the hotel but can't waste time on it.. lot of people here wrote a lot bad and good about it and it's totally true. Don't believe that it's bang for buck or the comment it's awesome.. That's all i can say!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good value, clean room, nice staff, no problems My wife and I stayed at this hotel from 3/9 to 3/22. On my budget, the low price allowed me to stay in beautiful Hawaii longer than I could have at a fancier hotel. It also allowed me to plan more activities. We went to the Audobon Center, the Don Ho Dinner Show, a day trip to Kauai, a full day fishing charter, Sea Life Park, the Zoo, and the Polynesian Cultural Center. We spent three times as much on activities and restaurants as we did on our hotel. We never saw a crawling insect in the hotel despite my wife leaving the windows open at night. The little extras cost extra, but they told us up front, so we didn't use the services that we didn't want to pay for. They did not charge us for the daily newspaper, the elevators were sometimes slow, but tolerable, parking was not a problem. Bottom line: I'll trade luxury in for fun any day, and I'll be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Beware of the extra costs The hotel itself was OK. The rooms were small, but at least they were clean. We booked a package with an on-line service that included both hotel and flight, so we got a good deal on the hotel. But, beware of the additional costs. Not only do you have to pay $15/day for parking in a garage that is always full, they also charge $2/day for coffee packets in the room and $3/day for use of the in-room safe. The parking attendant messed up our parking pass and tried to charge me an additional $15 when I checked out. However, I talked to the manager of the hotel and she straigtened everything out. They did accommodate our request for a late check-out, but that also costs us an additional $50. It was OK for a value hotel. I will probably stay somewhere else if I ever go back to Honolulu. If you decide to stay at this hotel, just beware of all the extra charges that can add up fast.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent deal for the price I don't think you can find any better place to stay in Honolulu than Ohana Maile Sky Court for the price. I paid about $60 per night including taxes. Here are a few thoughts:1. The room was small (especially the bathroom) but adequate. We stayed on the 20th and got a partial view of the ocean.2. The wait for elevator was always less than 5 minutes. Some people may find this a long wait but it was ok for me since I expected worse. I think some other reviews were just exaggerated. 3. Parking may be a problem but it was ok. There are limited parking spots in the garage. One night we came back at around 10:30pm and it was full. The attendant told us to wait a little and a car came out a few minutes later. The $10 parking fee was not bad considering it is within walking distance to the beach and all the shops.Again, for $60 a night, you can't ask for more. I am very happy with my stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great for the price I stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky Court in Honolulu from January 7, 2006 to January 15, 2006. I thoroughly enjoyed the trip, and the hotel was great as well. It was a great price, I booked it through Expedia and got the hotel and the flight as a package. It wasn't a fancy hotel, but considering that I wasn't in it much, just to shower and sleep, it definitely served the purpose of the room.Some of the other reviews I read complained about the elevators, but I didn't have any problems with them. There were a couple of times when I waited maybe 2 minutes, but it's a big hotel and I was on vacation, so it didn't matter anyway.the hotel room was always cleaned when I wanted it to be, the staff was super friendly, and there is a ton of restaurants all around the area, so there was no problem finding somewhere to eat.If I ever get the chance to go to Hawaii again, I will definitely stay at this hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good Value, Great Views We stayed here for 5 days in May. It was not our first hotel, we had booked at the Ohana Royal Islander. However, after one night we couldn't take the noise from the traffic. We went for a walk and ended up here. It was the same rate as the other hotel, but 100 X cleaner and quieter. We were on the 34th floor and had a beautiful view of the city and partial ocean. The rooms were extremely clean. The elevators seemed slow, but honestly I don't think we ever waited more than 4 or 5 minutes. We enjoyed the location, a little off the path of all the other hotels but still close enough to walk anywhere. My only complaint is that our room was considered a kitchenette. However, there was only a few cracked plates and some dirty silverware in a sticky cupboard, a small fridge and smaller sink. If you had been planning to make use of the kitchenette (which we were not), it would have been quite frustrating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's OK We got a very good deal on this hotel, with air from SFO, through Pleasant Holidays. When we arrived we found the room to be pretty basic, but fairly clean. My wife did the routine bed bug search and, finding none, we settled in ( I've never really had much confidence in our bug detection abilities, but it makes us feel better). The first morning, I awoke early and saw a cockroach scurry under the dresser, but that was the only bad bug experience and I suspect roaches are found in a lot of Honolulu hotels. Still, cleanliness took a hit because of this .The location is excellent, only a couple of blocks from the beach through a nice park. Security was not a problem. The staff were friendly and the pool and hot tub were all right. There is a bar next to the pool which is kind of a dive, but with good happy hour prices and a nice restaurant attached to the lobby.If the price was real good, we would probably go back .</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Don't Expect Paradise From the outside, the Ohana resembles every other hotel in the neighborhood. The inside however, is less predictable. When we checked in, we were given a room with a handicapped bathroom and requested another room. After a few conversations with different people, we were upgraded to a room with a kitchenette. Sounded nice, but the overall atmosphere was the same. The room had little ventilation, the bathroom had none (careful if you're the gaseous type). The size was medium to small, ideal for a couple at most. Location is not a big issue because most of the hotels are within walking distance to the action. The pool was the size of a big bath tub. You will spend lots of time waiting for the elevator, although they have an express elevator. Customer service was friendly. They charge you to park in their garage. Would I book here again? No, I'd search for something better, but it was good for the price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good deal for the money I paid This is not a five star hotel. It is off the beaten path but for $57.00 a night, I was pleased. It was very clean, neat and sized just right for two. I had asked for a high floor and got 15 out of 24 floors. I wasn't pleased about that, but no worry. The TV channel selection was pitiful. The parking is convenient but expensive and can get crowded since many people do park illegally. I was unable to find that free public parking that was bragged about. The desk staff was hit and miss on being knowledgable. One day, we hit the jackpot with a kind gentleman at the desk calling and making dinner reservations for us. This might not be a big deal to a lot of people but it made us feel very special. We were here only three nights and found most attractions within walking distance. If I were in Waikiki to earnestly vacation, I would pick someplace else. But if you just need a bed, this is a good deal.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Modest, nice hotel We stayed in the Ohana Maile Sky Court for only 3 nights and it was good. Rooms are not very big, but we only slept there so we didn't care. It's a very tall building (40+ stories) with annoying elevators which take forever. But, we had an ocean view (they upgraded us for free when we arrived) on the 37th floor which was beatiful. It's within walking distance to the beach (5-10 min walk). It's also on the bus line so you can use the bus to get to Pearl Harbor (allow plenty of time) or Diamond Head. The bathroom was a little small but fine and in good working order. The water pressure in the shower was great. The staff was all very nice and helpful, especially the travel info guy who helps you with maps, etc. There's a pool on the 5th floor roof which we never used. If you are looking for someplace to just sleep, this is perfect. If you are looking for a fancy resort, this may not be the place. We'd stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Issues with Security We found overall the hotel was much nicer than we expected- we chose this hotel as a result of a package and were uneasy because it was only 2 star. But as per the other reviews we did find the rooms and hotel overall were very clean. Also, a bonus was that it had free wireless which you could access from the nice open lobby.One big concern, however, should be the elevators..they are very slow so if you run into a problem and need security you could be waiting for a long time- which defeats the purpose of having security. We actually had a man try to break into our room so this is why we ran into a problem with security- that said we recommend that you ensure you use the deadbolt and latch on your door if you choose to stay here. We did end up leaving the hotel the next morning though b/c of this concern. Now instead of just wondering whether a two star is clean enough..another concern is that is it secure enough??Hope this helps-</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Most impressed Before departing from New Zealand for our 10 day holiday in Waikiki we read the reviews of this hotel and can quite honestly say we were a little worried.Much to our surprise we found it to be a great hotel our room was fairly large had a kitchenette was clean well maintained and serviced daily. We had a corner room on the 20th floor with great views of the town and ocean.The bathroom was on the small size with the shower over a low sided bath, provided was a rubber non slip mat which impressed me greatly as I have a slight mobility problem and this took away any fear of slipping when getting into the bath.The lifts that everyone complained about were not a problem our longest wait would have only been a couple of minutes. I suggest that if you want a great place to stay at an affordable cost then this is the place for you. Its location is great and bus stops are almost at your doorstep and there are heaps of good eating places very handy.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic place to stay in Honolulu We stayed here from 12/20 - 1/7 and 1/15. We had a oceanview room and were very pleased. For $68 per night, this is a great find near Waikiki.Pros: It was very clean and neat. The fridge and microwave helped cut down on food costs. The bathroom was small, but very clean and adequate for two people. The desk staff and housekeeping were very good, helpful. Lots of eating choices close by, good recommendations from hotel staff (use the coupons and publications that are everywhere to save money). The beach is a short walk through a really nice park. It's less crowded than the center of Waikiki. Cons: No lanai, and the windows only open a few inches. The pool is clean, but very unattractive surroundings, just a cement slab - this could and should be improved. The bar is very small, dark and drab - another improvement needed. The elevators can be slow at peak times, but nothing more than you would expect from such a large, tall hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fnatastic Value Stayed 5 nights here from June 19th,so close to Fort de Rusy end of Waikiki beach so a lot fewer people in the water here.A much shorter walk than I had imagined and all the local buses within 30 metres.A big plus was the bus being empty due to the pick up point.Access to everything was great,I almost missed out going to the Kahala Mall thinking oh yes just another mall BUT it was great and I got lots of bargains,,,Waikiki can be expensive and the same old tourist things everywhere.However having said that there is plenty to do and see.I really only used the pink shuttle because I enjoyed the view along Wakiki beach.I used the bus for all other destinations except for the one day circle island tour by E Noa which was excellent value.I feel like I can easily find my way around Oahu now after only 5 days and as I travelled alone I found most people would talk to me and the locals were very friendly.I also felt safer than in many cities.Can't wait to go again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">hated every minute!!! There were 3 of me and my friends staying one night and it was terrible! Checking in was okay! We were told of getting 2 queen size beds. Then when we went up to the room and we got a room that had 2 twin size beds. And the rooms were so small! I mean very small, I have never seen a small Hotel room before! You only had room to walk to your bed and bathroom...if you had two people in the room the other person would need to sit down while the other is walking to or from the restroom. So you can imagine the 3 of us! The decorating was in the 80's decorations still! And it made me feel like i'm in a time war zone of some sort! Just if your going to Hawaii to enjoy Hawaii do not go there! But if your going there to pick up some chics that are walking down Waikiki in their glass slipper...then it will be fine to do what u got to do and leave (if your wondering what I'm talking about, walk down waikiki at night and you will understand)!!! Get my point! Terrible stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location and price I stayed here when I came to town with a conference and on a very tight budget. The room was clean and within walking distance to the conference center and everything in Waikiki. The pool was tiny but the jacuzzi was huge. There's also a bar next to the jacuzzi with a very friendly bartender. The TGI Fridays on the first floor was convenient for breakfast. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Some friends of mine were stranded when their lodging fell through on Valentine's Day (the busiest day of the year for Waikiki/Honolulu hotels) and the Ohana staff was able to find them a place to stay. The concierge also arranged a tour to Hanauma Bay so that we would be able to go snorkeling and make it back in time for conference proceedings. And to top it all off, they stored my luggage on my last day so that I could check out and continue treking around Waikiki. They also had shower and changing facilities so that people wouldn't have to fly home sandy from the beach.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great value for its price, excellent location Great value for its price, excellent location on a couple of minutes walk from Wakiki and around the corner from finest designer stores like Dior, LV and Prada (which is an indication of the great location). Don't pay any attention on the BS about the elevators, no hassle whatsoever! When we read the reviews we expected bad stuff, totally untrue! Rooms are small but super clean, personnel is very helpful, cleaning ladies absolutely sweet and willing to make your stay as pleasant as possible. But it is all about expectations: you are not paying for a Hilton, if you pay a budget price and go with expecting 5 star amenities of course you are disappointed. Typical hill billy reviews, anyone who has travelled will know that this is a great place to stay for a great budget on a top location. Would definitely recommend it! Go for the ocean view (any of the rooms ending on 04 on the 15th floor and up), beautiful view that in itself will make you happy!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Price  My mum and I stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky in September 05 and we had an excellent stay (excellent package deal). The hotel is very clean. I agree the rooms are small, but you spend so much time outside shopping, eating and sightseeing that you are only at the hotel to sleep. The staff are friendly, although the check-in counter can be quite busy (we arrived at lunchtime and had about a 20min wait). This hotel is in a great position as you are opposite Fort DeRussy park and if you get a high floor with ocean view you get perfect views!! We loved going for a walk in the evenings as you can do a big loop of Waikiki from the hotel. You have an ABC store opposite the hotel which is handy for small snacks, drinks etc...... You also have a bus stop about 100 meters down the road and the stop has buses that go everywhere (to Ala Moana, around the island for $2.5US, they even go as far as Pearl Harbour and Pearlridge shopping centre). I would definitely go back again and stay at this hotel!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Better than expected..... I went to Waikiki for a wedding and needed a cheap place to stay that was close to all of the fun. The Sky Court gave my husband and I just that. The rooms are a bit on the small side and the decor be updated by a few decades, but the price and the fact that the room was clean made up for it. I initially booked a kitchenette with a queen bed through yahoo travel. However, when we got to the room it had 2 twin beds! My husband and I are newleyweds......we didn't like that too much! I asked at front desk and they tried to change it...but they were completely sold out. She explained to me that the internet company puts in a request for that particular room. We switched rooms on our third night though. Because of this, I would suggest that you book directly through the hotel. The location of the hotel was convenient to all of the fun in the area, and our room was quiet at night to get a good night's sleep. Random Things: Elevators are slow at times; parking is $15 a day.We would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">New Management: Bad Experiences! This hotel recently changed management. I reserved a room for friends through the new management's website...a good rate for Waikiki. But when we arrived, we had to wait more than 30 minutes for the reservations office to send the reservation information to the hotel. Why they couldn't check us in and resolve this issue later is beyond me. And why did it take so long because the reservation had been made and confirmed on their own website? No apology from management; we had to wait at the front desk. When we were finally allowed to check in and get keys, my friends found that their room had not been updated despite higher prices. Still had the late 80s decor. And, the bathroom had not been cleaned properly. We asked housekeeping to resolve the bathroom issue with no success. My friends checked out within an hour. Again, no apology from management. Clearly, we got what we paid for and learned that it's better to pay a little more and get better service and better (and cleaner) accommodations in Waikiki.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Terrible Room, Shabby Hotel The room smelled like heavy cheap perfume and there was a technician working in it when we opened the door. The window only opened about 6 inches so we never did get rid of the awful smell. The phone did not work which we reported when checking out, but all they did was apologize for it. The only good thing about the place is the large hot tub outside next to the stamp-size pool and a seedy bar in which three people hang out at any given time. This hotel is directly linked to the airport info desk so for travelers coming in with no reservation it is easy to book directly from baggage claim at the Honolulu airport. At 5:30 AM in the hotel lobby, a prostitute was looking for her Appointment. Would not stay there agian. The whole place is in desperate need of renovation. The eighth floor hall rug was duct-taped to the floor at the the elevators, only one of which seemed to work. Staff at front desk friendly, but not very helpful. One redeeming feature besides the hot tub, is the hotel is near a very good Thai restaurant.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Better than Expected Stayed here because we got a great deal. Had another couple with us. Actually, I stayed at this hotel approximately 25 years ago. It is still a good choice. Yes, the elevators can be slow. But here are a few advantages. Though small, many of the rooms have great views. We stayed on the 10th floor and still had an ocean view. The higher floors have less traffic noise. Most important, the place is clean! Staff very friendly and accomodating. Keoni by Keo's restaurant is a short walk with a great 2.99 breakfast deal (and highly recommended for dinner). Being a walk from the beach also favors slightly lower restaurant prices in the area. TGIF's is located in the hotel. Skip the happy hour, drinks are weak. Convenient parking garage. Another great feature if you plan to leave Waikiki alot is easy access out! Saves time in traffic. If you don't plan to live in your room and a short walk to the beach is no bother, than this is the place to stay. As a former travel agent, I recommend this hotel to those who want a good place to sleep.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel for the money!! We stayed at the Sky Court in Aug 06 and it was a great overall experience. The price was unbeatable (~$49 a night) and only about a 10 minute to the heart of Waikiki. We've been to Oahu several times and this hotel was a lot better than the previous higher star hotels at a fraction of the price. Pros - Great price, clean and comfortable rooms for 2 people, quiet area since it is located at the end of the strip (right behind NikeTown and Gucci), lots of nearby street parking (just be patient and read what days/hrs they do the street cleaning because your car will get towed!!), very helpful and friendly hotel staff, Dollar Rent a Car and several restaurants and fast food places located within blocks of the hotel.Cons - The pool is tiny and not really worth going to when you've got Waikiki Beach a few minutes away, the shower/tub didn't drain very well but then again what hotel shower/tub drains very wellIn summary, if you're on a budget and just need a clean, quiet place to stay in a pretty good location then this is the hotel for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Would Not Recommend Hot tub was always broken, I believe it worked the first day we were there, then one other night, but it was colder than the pool/ocean. Elevators were EXTREMELY SLOW, sometimes people had to wait 15+ minutes for an elevator. We stayed on the 9th floor and usually took the stairs, as we were afraid if the elevators did come to the lobby to take us up, we could easily get stuck in them. After staying a week, we asked if we could have a few extra hours in our room before checking out, we had a late flight, they weren't negotiable on that at all. Wireless internet was available only in the lobby, and like the elevators/hot tub, it rarely worked, and when it did work, it cut out constantly. Singing onto the internet every 30 seconds gets very annoying.We were supposed to have a kitchenette, but our room had a small fridge and coffe maker. The TV got about 15 channels, one channel played Adam Sandler's The Longest Yard 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which is great if you have no memory or are a huge Sandler fanI would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Basic, clean, bearable If you are looking for a good buget property that's a short walk to the beach and shopping, this is one worth considering. It lives up to its billing as Sky Tower at over 40+ floors. This is by no means a full service hotel, so if you need room service and white glove attention don't come here. If you are on your honeymoon, don't come here. If you are traveling frugally or with family and are just looking for a clean hotel with friendly service, then this should be just your place. Rooms are small and basic, yet clean and serviceable. The rooms are also equipped with safes and free wifi (not bad). There's a TGIFriday's next to the main lobby which is open late for that quick nightcap. Or they have a bar on the pool level (5th floor) that has $1.75 drinks at happy hour (best deal in the area). The pool is not Olympic size but it was clean. The heater was down at the time so it was ice cold. The jacuzzi next to it was the remedy. Large enough for at least 10 people with strong jets hit the spot. The staff was also friendly and accommodating.All in all not a bad experience if you are coming with the right expectations.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel - no balcony tho I stayed at this property in June 2004 for an extended period of three weeks. I asked for a non smoking room upon check in, and because I was staying three weeks, they gave me a kitchenette on level 43. A corner room faceing the ocean/Hilton Hawaiian Village and city of Honolulu. This place has a hotel feel, a nice concierge desk with friendly staff, a nice little pool bar and a fair sized pool and spa. That pool area is pretty hot in the Hawaiian sun, not much shade or lanscaping/palm trees etc. My room was quiet, pretty good sized - but I was travelling alone - and it was a kitchenette after all. Everything was clean, but watch the extra costs, like daily newspapers and your coffee/tea etc. (buy a small jar at a nearby ABC store) The elevator service seemed okay considering, (but the upper floor users had to change elevators to go to the pool area). I usually stay at the more expensive Ohana Waikiki Tower, on Lewers street, and that has slow elevators and suffers from street noise due to its location. The only thing I missed at the Maile Sky Court, was a nice little lanai (balcony) to sit out on at night. For the money, it's not all that bad!! Aloha.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not worth a nickel. First, I should point out that we bid for this hotel on Priceline. Although I had a good idea I would land at the Ohana, I figured it was worth a shot. I only needed a one night's stay.The only thing impressive about the Ohana was the fact that it's outside appearance, and even that was only because of its size. Upon entry, you could see the real I was traveling with my wife and three kids, and usually we fit comfortably into a room with double beds. However, despite the Ohana's size, the claimed not to have a room with double beds. Instead, they put us in a room with a queen size bed. I wasn't that worried, until I saw the size of the room.The room, at best, was 12 feet by 14 feet. It was by far, the smallest hotel room I have ever stayed in. It certainly wasn't large enough to accomodate my family comfortable. My kids ended up sleeping on the floors since it was impossible to squeeze a rollaway bed into the room. The furniture was cheap, there was no good view, and the mini-fridge wasn't cold enough to keep a candy bar from melting.I certainly made a mistake on this booking, don't make the same mistake. Find another hotel, and if you're bidding on priceline, don't settle for a 2 star in Honolulu.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You get what you pay for!!!! We stayed on the 19th floor. The elevator requires you to swipe your hotel key to go up to your room and it's a very touchy system you have to swipe it right otherwise it won't work - very annoying! Coming down the elevators is no problem as you don't need to use your room key. Room was neat in appearance but rundown and in need of a major remodeling job! Outdated! There was rust in the bathroom by the sink. Bed bugs - blood on sheets!!! Eventhough the room was cleaned everyday didn't seem to make a difference - the bugs where still there! Been back 2 days and still itching from the nasty bugs! Next time I'll pay more and stay elswhere in Honolulu! Hotel staff were nice. Hawaiian Airline check in station in the lobby is very helpful. I know this is a budget hotel however I've stayed at much better ones in the past! We booked this hotel based on mostly positive reviews from travelers on this site.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Absolutely fine!!! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Skycourt from the 9th to the 23rd July. We were slightly anxious at first because we knew it was a budget hotel however, we had nothing to worry about. The rooms are not small, they are an adequate size - and after all, you're in Hawaii, the room is merely a place to sleep!!! The bathroom was clean and the shower was nice and powerful. Our room was also serviced every day. Many people have mentioned a problem with the elevators, again we found no problem here - nothing a little patience wouldn't solve! The staff were very friendly, the front desk staff happily helped me when we accidentally lost our room key! The staff at the information desk are also very friendly, they always said hi and asked how our day had been, they were also very informative about the island and how to get around. The outrigger activities desk is a great way to organise trips to things like Pearl Harbour and again our assistant, Glen, was friendly and helpful. We travelled through 4 airports, on 3 planes for 18 hours over a distance of some 8,000 miles, I would be more than happy to do this again if I were staying at the Skycourt! As for Oahu itself - awesome! Make sure you visit Lanakai Beach - its off the beaten track but totally worth it! Also, the Cheesecake Factory is a must, order the steak!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Basic but comfy When we arrived we were automatically given our room key. We had pre-paid our room and was readily available. When we got to our room we realized it was a basic room, it consisted of of a queen bed and a tv and dresser. the room is really small. The view wasnt that great. We had the view of the hotel being built across the street. We asked to be moved to a bed w/ 2 beds and they upgraded us for free and they told us to pack our bags and that they would move our bags to the new room. We left for the day and we arrived back at the hotel they gave us our new keys. This room was much bigger, it had a partial view of the ocean, 2 single beds, a/c, table w/ 2 chairs, microwave, sink, small refrigerator and lots and lots of windows. the bathroom was much bigger and also had a big window. We had a problem w/ the water draining in the tub, but we called the front desk and they sent someone right away to fix the problem. The a/c worked great. The front desk was always nice and we didnt have any problems with them. The only problem that we had were that the elevators were slow. But we were on vacation and we werent in a hurry to get anywhere so that really didnt bother us. All in all, if your looking for somewhere basic to sleep and take a shower, then this is a good place. its not too far from waikiki. Its about a 10 minute walk to the beach. I woudnt mind staying here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Average hotel fairly priced My husband and I attended a conference in July and stayed 9 nights at the Sky Court. We did get a very good package price from Expedia so we were willing to overlook any minor problems we might encounter. I had read many reviews about problems with the elevators. The only problem we encountered was the touchy system requiring your room key to be swiped when going up to your room. We did not find the elevators to be extremely slow as has been posted in numerous other reviews. The room itself was extremely small and we had no view or balcony. We didn't intend to be in the room much so we made the best of it. The bathroom was about the size of a closet. Housekeeping was fine. The bar by the pool was fun and had a good happy hour with cheap drinks. The TGI Fridays downstairs was convenient for breakfast and late-night snacks. The activities people in the lobby were very helpful for planning things to see and do. Parking was rather expensive ($15/day) and tight. Location was good... within walking distance to the convention center, the beach, shopping, and restaurants. Overall, the Sky Court is an average hotel that is fairly priced for what it is. We are planning another trip to Honolulu next year and will be taking our children so we will be staying at a hotel with larger rooms that can accomodate our family next time, but for the budget traveler who just needs a clean place to shower and sleep, Sky Court is fine.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">About average My wife and I stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky Court for the last week of January.We walked in our room and based on the reviews here on this site, knew our room and bathroom would be small. So, no real surprise. Maybe a 10x11 size room for the bed, desk and tv with an additional 8x2 entry way (including the open closet and safe). The room and bathrom was clean and the staff kept it that way for the entire week.The bed was very stiff and unforgiving.Parking cost $13 a day but we did not run into any problems of finding a parking spot late at night. I think that may be due to the fact that there weren't a lot of people there in Waikiki for the last week of January. The parking slots are small, so keep that in mind if you're going to rent an SUV or minivan.The front desk staff was professional, but not outwardly friendly.Yes, the elevators are slow, but you're in Hawaii and do you really need to get there that quickly?While maps show this hotel to be on the edge of Waikiki, it is a very short walk to the strip of Waikiki and it is only a block from Niketown and a couple of blocks from Tiffanys. Pretty much everything is within a short walking distance.The pool is very small and you'd be better off going to the beach as there aren't a lot of chairs to relax on at the (5th floor) pool.Becauseof the uncomfortable bed, we couldn't get a good night sleep and that would prevent me from returning because we accepted the hotel based on the thinking that it's just a place to sleep.Hope this helps.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good Value My impressions of Maile Sky Court.The room was a bit on the small side but was more than adequate. Very clean and tidy. The maids are sweethearts and are very friendly.The hotel is centrally located to any place you would want to get to. Many nice restaurants within a 3 minute walk from the hotel. The beach is a 5 minute walk away.The pool is small but the hot tub whirl pool is very large. The deck area is very large, and there will never be a problem getting a deck lounger. It's true you might have to move your deck chairs around to keep out of the shadows as the day progresses, but only if you start in the wrong place. There is a very large area where you will get the sun the entire day without ever moving.The pool bar is cozy. Drinks are very reasonable, but they don't serve any kind of food except for chips. Two of the three bartenders are a tad moody and don't seem too happy to be there but overall a nice place.They also have two computers downstairs to access the internet for a fee. A bit expensive but there are other internet cafes close also that are cheaper.The only complaint i had was the elevators and the key access cards. Very good idea for security but a bit cumbersome to use. You couldn't go up to your floor without using the card to activate the keypad. A couple of times i had to take the elevator up to the top floor because i couldn't get the card accepted and wasn't able to punch in my floor # untill on the way back down. I wasn't the only one with that problem and it was a running joke for anyone getting on the elevator.Overall i give it a thumbs up. Good price for a clean hotel centrally located to everything.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Its okay if you know what you are getting This hotel is BASIC, its like a 40 story motel 6 except they include nicer soap/shampoo and it has a bigger lobby. That said, it is in Waikiki so if you pay $100 its not bad (or less than $60 like me). I must say I got a great deal on this hotel with a package through a big Hawaii travel agency (intials; P.H.) but if I would have paid anywhere near the rack rate I would have felt burned.First this place is not near the beach, so expect a 5-10min walk to get there. Parking is $$ but I did manage to find free street parking my entire stay within a couple blocks.Rooms have a safe (charge), coffee (free first day only), newer mini-fridge in my room, iron/board, newer wall A/C and free wifi in the lobby. That is where the ammenaties stop. No blow-dryer.The room was VERY clean, carpet and bed where relatively new (but very economic). Furniture was very tired, 80s laminate with some chips/water stains and the 19 TV was older with poor reception. Bathroom was also very clean, new grout and no mold at all.Other reviews are right in that the rooms are very small and the elevators are slow, stopping at many floors each time and often 1 or 2 of the 3 that may go to your floors are broken.At the price I paid, this place may have gotten 4 stars for overall value if it were not for the elevator being slow/broken and the water preasure was very poor. Also the pool is small, like 20' by 20' at most.Also Vit's steakhouse on the ground floor didn't seem bad, the $3.98 sunrise breakfast did the job for 3 mornings in a row seeing as egg n' things down the street seems to outgrown its own reputation and priced itself out.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Place! This place is great! Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1. It's one of the first hotel stops from the airport if you take the shuttle bus.2. You can easily walk to the popular beach attractions (Duke's, the beach, shopping, restaurants, etc) within 10 mins (nice walk too).3. There is a Fridays restaurant right downstairs. They have a nice/inexpensive breakfast.4. There is a safe in the room, which I didn't get charged the $3/day for.5. Check in/check out was a breeze. 6. If you have a later flight, they will hold your luggage, and they have a hospitality suite where you can shower/freshen up before your flight home.7. They have a place in the lobby where you can book excursions, dinner reservations, etc. 8. There are about 3 grocery (small) stores within a block on the Sky Court.9. The view is nice! You can see the ocean (sort of) from most rooms.10. I had a small (but big enough for 1-2 people) room, with a bathtub, fridge, COLD A/C, TV, etc.11. There is one wall that is totally mirrors in the room. Good for checking out your outfit before you head out. 12. Room was super clean. Housekeeping was great!13. Hotel is quiet.14. Newspaper at your door every morning.15. You have to put in your room key to use the elevator. Nice security feature....but a bit of a pain when there are 4-6 stops. 16. Bed was comfortable!17. Information desk was very helpful. Gave tips on which tours to avoid, which bars are good on which nights, etc. Cons:1. SLOW elevators!2. The hallways (while you are waiting for the elevators) are a bit hot.3. It's $1 to call local (not too bad).4. The room's decor was a bit dated..but really...for $60-70/night...who cares???</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">SO SO... just a place to sleep When we arrived at the hotel the front desk staff wasn't friendly and had a hard time to communicate with us in proper hotel staff manner. She was easily confused. We got a kitchenette room with queen size bed on 16th floor. Everything was clean and organized. Nice view, mostly city view and some ocean. Bathroom is quite small but was ok for two people. Everything worked in normal condition including air-conditioning. Room amenities were what we need except they didn't have q-tips, cotton balls, or shower caps like other hotels do. Our room has hair dryer, safe, iron and iron board, hangers, microwave, fridge, dishes and utensils. Once in awhile we hear some noise through the pipes in the wall or ceiling - not sure but the sound wasn't very pleasant! The shower head provide inconsistant flow of very hot or very cold water. Overall the hotel is quite old and need remodeling. Elevators are always crowded with people. I didn't bother to go to the pool or jacuzzi because they were really small. There was a bar on the same floor with the pool. Laundry facility was nice and convenient ($1.50 to wash and $1.25 to dry). Parking was convenient at $13/day ($15/day after Nov. 1st) There were some security guards walking around making sure. Our housekeeping ladies were very friendly. They don't do a very good job at straighting things out in our room. They only do the bed, change the garbage, leave you with some more shampoos or soaps and that's about all they do! BUT, you get what you pay for, really. I would not recommend this hotel for anyone who's looking for a bargain hotel because I truly think you can find better deals than this one.</p></li>

<li>There was a bar on the same floor with the pool.</br></br></li>

<li>They only do the bed, change the garbage, leave you with some <span style="background-color:#e6194b">more</span> <span style="background-color:#e6194b">shampoos</span> or soaps and that's about all they do!</br></br></li>
<li>BUT, you get what you pay for, really.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Never again!!! We booked though yourvacationcenter.com... it was our honeymoon but we had a budget to stay under but it was not that small of a budget... the travel agent really sold us on this place even though we wanted to stay at RQ waikiki beach. so we took her word for it and accepted the room... when we got there it was about 4pm. they said that our room was not ready yet and wouldnt be for another hour and a half... mind you check in is supposed to be at 3pm. so my husband and i figured we'd go cruise waikiki for a little bit maybe go grab a bite to eat. 2 hours later we return to the hotel and eveything is supposedly set. we wait about 15 mins to get onto an elevator (which by the way was broken for the rest of our stay), we get to our room, only to find the maid still creaning and doing a halfa** job none the less...at this point we were too tired. we just sat in the room and waited. The room smelled very wet and musty, the AC barely worked so it was a bit humid in there. the bed had some stains on the sheet and so did the bath towels. when you try and get service they dont give it to you, but when you dont want it ( for example maid service) they come into your room anyway! I put up the do not disturb sign cause i never trust maid service especially not at cockroach hotels like that one, but regardless we found that while we were away one day a maid STILL entered our room and threw away papers that i have been saving since our first day there... i called the front desk PO'd and they did nothing to help the situation. so i have no clippings to put in our wedding journal.... at check out they had the never to ask me if i would like to book a future stay...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice Hotel We just spent 7 nights at the Ohana Maile Sky Court.December 23 through December 30, 2004. My husband and I stayed there 19 years ago for our 1 year anniv. and this time we went back with our 2 boys. It is an inexpensive hotel and located in a nice spot. We were upgraded to an ocean view room on the 40th. floor for an extra $10 a day. It was worth it. They were going to put us on the 10th. originally. The boy's rooms were also moved up to the 40th, but no charge because it was the same... standard room. Yes the rooms are small, but your not in Hawaii to stay in a hotel room. Just a place to sleep. The rooms were CLEAN and housekeeping kept them clean. The staff was very nice and helpful. Maitenence came right up when we had a problem w/the safe and fixed it right away. There is a parking garage and it is $10 a day. In and out as much as you would like. I wouldn't recommend getting in too late because it is on a first come first service basis. We always had a parking place. We got in by 7 or 8p.m. There is a TGIFridays at the hotel and they serve breakfast which is resonable and good. We were happy with the hotel and we would return. Oh, as for the elevators, they weren't too bad. One time there was only 1 elevator working for the upper floors. But they were fixed the same day. There are 6 elevators, 3 for Floors 5 throught 25 and 3 elevators for floors, 2,3, and 26 through 44. It was nice to go back to a place that you've stayed at before, especially after 19 yrs. Shopping has changed there, More upscale stores. I would definately recommend this hotel. It's not the Ritz or the Hilton, but then again you are not paying for the Ritz or Hilton. Very economical. Hope this review has helped. Thanks.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a pleasant stay Like a lot of other people, we read reviews from others who had stayed at the Ohana Maile Sky Court before we left. All I have to say is, don't believe everything you read. Some people will make it sound worse than it is. We read that the elevators are slow. It wasn't bad at all. I have lived in a condo with an elevator that was a lot worse. The window did only open 4 and since the window was pretty low it's probably a good idea. If the window opened all the way, I'd be nervous standing close to it considering we were on the 23rd floor. The pool and jacuzzi were small but it was adequate for a quick soak if you don't feel like walking to the beach. The room was small but we found that it was sufficient for two people. It is an older hotel and could use some upgrading but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. We knew we were only going to be there to shower and sleep so it didn't bother us. The TV signal was not the greatest, we had problems with the outlet in the washroom once in awhile when we tried to plug in the hair dryer, and the bed was a queen size but you could actually feel the springs. We read about bed bugs but I didn't see any. Overall, everything was tolerable. I do have good memories from this hotel but I think next time we'll spend a little more and stay at a place that is a little nicer and closer to the beach. For what we paid I think it's good value for your money. For anyone who is looking for a hotel in this price range, I highly recommend it. The bad experiences you read about I'm sure are isolated incidences.To also mention, the front desk clerks were friendly, the cleaning lady was really nice, and the people at the information desk were more than helpful.</p></li>
