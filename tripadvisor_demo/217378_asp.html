We loved our room with 2 walls of it that were glass looking out over the bay area. We had wine and cheese waiting on us as we arrived. This hotel is perfect for couples. The lobby was breath taking. This is our second favorite Wyndham resort the first being Key West.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Old Doral The Wyndam took over the Doral in Miami Beach and they really need to update the rooms as well as the facilities. The elevators are painfully slow. The rooms are worn. The windows need to be replaced. It is a small boutique style hotel on the ocean. Beautiful poolside. Cabana crew could use a lesson in hospitality. On the whole it is very average for the area. Great potential. Needs a facelift.</p></li>

The hotel was OK with friendly staff and large rooms, but a bit worn-out and outdated in style. As a Swede I like to walk everywhere, and the distance to the art deco-district was acceptable, even for my 70 year old mother-in-law. But the next time we will stay some blocks south of this hotel, closer to restaurants and shopping.</p></li>

This was the dirtiest - most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed in. $600 per night - what a waste.Great location. This hotel must have been great back in the day when it was the Doral. The views were awesome - but you couldn't get past the crappy service, old, filthy accomodations, and staff that don't even speak (broken) english.Take a pass on this one.</p></li>

Front desk was not welcoming, every single amenity was individually priced (and overpriced-paid $38 to fax a 6 page document from a fax that only sent one page at a time and $55 to park our car which was mandatory valet) and the room and facility looked like it had it's hey-day in the late 80's or 90's. I would not recommend this hotel. Was really disappointed and felt it was far too expensive for the value.</p></li>

There seems to have been some effort at renorvation. Our room was clean and kept clean during our stay. We went to the restaurant for the special Valentine's Day dinner. They did an excellent job. Join Wyndham by Request. You get free internet, wine, beer or soda on arrival and such goodies as nuts and water. All in all, they did much better than we anticipated.</p></li>

I was supposed to stay here for five nights but I did for two and went to the Fontainebleau Hilton Resort (which was BEAutiful and when I walked into the room there I was plesantly surprised.) This hotel needs a major renovation especailly the rooms (they are so old and run down). If you've got the money, stay at the fontainebleau instead.</p></li>

We had reserved a hotel with the promise of free internet access, free phone calls, late check-out and other ByRequest Amenities. We were very disappointed to receive none of the promised amenities. In addition, our non-smoking room stunk of old smoke and we had to wait in a long line to obtain a new room. Otherwise, the hotel was fine.</p></li>

Given all the negative reviews on the site (and other places) I was weary of the hotel but it was exactly what I was looking for. The hotel was beautiful especially the pool area. The daily resort fee gets you snacks poolside which were hand delivered by the very friendly pool staff. The drinks and food at the poolside bar were great and expensive but everything in Miami is expensive so it's wasn't a surprise. I would definitely consider staying here again.</p></li>

It has not been well maintained and was a disappointment from start to finish. It is a marginally acceptable hotel at best. Fire alrms went off four times one night and the staff responded in a deplorable fashion. It turned out to be a false alarm. However, had it been a real fire, lives would have been in real jeporady. Save your money, save your time, save yourself the headache and go some where, go anywhere else and you will be glad that you did.</p></li>

The front desk staff was very pleasant and accommodating. The rooms were very clean and attractive, the halls looked freshly painted and carpeted. The dining room is lovely and the wait staff attentive and friendly. The pool and beach area are well maintained. There are newer and more luxurious hotels in Miami Beach but we did not find it nearly as bad as some of the earlier reviews indicated. We travel often and this hotel isn't the best I've seen but it's hardly the worst.</p></li>

They dont have a free parking area, only other choice is to park several blocks away offsite. Their business center was not very friendly- I used their computer for 2 minutes and they charged me $13 for the privilage. You also have to pay for internet. Lets not forget about the mysterious $10 resort fee and 1.00 resort tax. For the pricing, the hotel did not offer the luxury one would expect in that price range. A bit disappointed. I probably would not stay there again.</p></li>

Rooms were very old and dated. Furntire was worn, stained, etc. Hotel and rooms all had a musty/moldy smell. The service was terrible, they were not able to accommodate simple requests and when they did, they got it wrong. Finally, do not expect business services. If you need to send faxes or print documents stay somewhere else, faxes (if they are ableto print them which is a big if) cost a dollar per page and print jobs cost $1.35 per page.</p></li>

The hotel is beautiful particularly the lobby and pool.The rooms were very clean and nice and the service was vey consistent and pleasant. The pool was amazing and we loved the upper sun lounge deck where you had a great view of the beach and ocean. Daily we took nice walks on the beach which was easily accessible through the pool area. The hotel is located within walking distance of the shops and bars from the via the beach boardwalk.We highly recommend this hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">very happy very relaxing Stayed for 4 days, found the hotel clean and the staff was great very friendly. only 1 restaurant to eat at at night In hotel wasn't bad. But went to south beach for night life and dinner 2 out of 3 nights. Pool was ice cold so we never went in it either did most of the other guests. if you want to relax and kick back it's perfect place to stay. me and my wife both read books all day on the beach and had lunch at the seabreeze restaurant. I enjoyed my stay and would recomend it to friends. Only recomendation for the hotel would be a little tlc in around pool rest/bar area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great hotel, great experience. We had a great time. We had seen some negative reviews before going, but most of them seemed to be from Spring breakers who were unhappy that the hotel doesn't sit in the middle of Southbeach's club district. We thought the hotel was great. Close enough to Southbeach to take a quick drive down there, and far enough away to give some seclusion. Beautiful old style hotel... not unlike some we've stayed in in Europe. Very good service, good food, nice pool deck, sits right on the beach, and only about 2 blocks from the boardwalk. We highly recommend it, and we'll be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Overall Impressive We stayed here for 7 nights in July after staying in Orlando for a week. Overall we were very impressed, the rooms were large and very clean with nice views. The location on the beach was lovely though too far to walk to south beach. The service at the pool was good and the staff and drinks at the pool bar great. The concierge was very friendly, helped us out when we wanted to book a baseball game. The biggest plus for this hotel was the evening meals served in the restaurant. The food and the service were absolutely top class we ate here on the first and last night and it was fabulous.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Avoid this dump What a dump. Complete choas when i arrived at 2pm. No rooms ready and i had to change for a meeting at 4pm. They assured me and the droves of others waiting that we would have rooms by 4pm -- LIARS. I made a huge fuss and at 4.30 I got my upgraded suite. Everything is old and faded -- rugs bedding, bathroom. For $250 per night I expected something a little above the Super 8 Motel but it was not to be. The price of food and drink is way above average $8 for a can of beer and 15 for a martini. I live in NYC and I dont pay those prices. If I ever come back to this conference, I shall certainly not stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great stay A great quality hotel and good value for money with the discounted rate available from Airline Network.We were given a choice of floors, and we selected the 14th, which looked one way out to sea and the other back into the city - breathtaking. The facilities are good, as is the food. Room service baked and decorated a cake especially for a surprise for my girlfriend, and the manager came up shortly afterwards to ensure everything was OK.Only drawback is that there is little in close proximity in terms of night-life and restaurants - though a cab ride can fix this, of course. For the luxurary and the price, it's a good trade-off.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not so good not so bad. I spent one night with my g-friend on 07/16 our second time in a year for weddings. The rate was great for the area but this property is old. I would say it鈥檚 a great family value for those looking to stay on south beach without the high prices. They have a large pool with cabana rentals available. The food can be pricey and not so good. The breakfast buffet is good though. The rooms are spacious but the comforters and pillows need upgrading. They have been slowly updating the hotel but they should have sank more money into it and made it more contemporary. It has a well-kept older facility feel to it. Boring but not a rip off.</p></li>

Although, the entrance is beautiful with excellent banquet facilities, the actual rooms are gross. The bed spreads were so old and stained that you didn't even want to touch them. The bathrooms haven't been refurbished in years. The carpet was filthy. The shower didn't drain and I had water up to my knees in less than 2 minutes while taking my shower. The bathroom is not well lit. The television didn't even come in clear. There was no ethernet cord and the Wi-Fi connection is expensive. The business center had a minimum of $13.00 computer usage fee. Compared to other hotels with a minimum average of $5.00.</p></li>

The bed wasn't even made, and when my wife wanted to sit down on the couch she was welcomed by some seamen on the couch! As soon as we saw that, we checked out right away.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Clean comfortable friendly attractive facility I stayed there as part of The Annual Review of Pathology given by the University of Miami. I remember it as The Doral. When I checked in I was immediately impressed by the efficiency and friendliness of the staff and how beautiful the renovations looked. They then told me it hadn't been recently renovated but would soon be. The room was very nice and very comfortable and so so quiet. A great sanctuary in the middle of a fast paced area. It had an almost old world European charm with a tropical motif. Other course participants (we are physicians) also told me they liked it a lot. Excellent value as well. Craig Novy</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Infested rooms, to begin with... I will never go back! Our first room - we woke, and there were small insects (bed bugs?) all over the table and night stand. We asked for another room, and they gave us one three floors away... more bugs. If that isn't disgusting enough... We were there for a conference. They lost stuff we had shipped to the hotel. It was never found. Lastly - we had dinner in the Ocean Room or whatever it is called. After waiting an hour and 1/2, our steaks came out undercooked, as did our lobster tails. The rooms were smallish, the service was bad. Hair in the shower drain. I could go on and on, but I would rather forget the whole experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Definitely Not Top Notch! Stayed one night here and that was enough. Room cleanliness was definitely in question. Stuff stuck on the carpet that needed to be cleaned or replaced. Tile walls and backsplashes needed to be wiped down and the bathroom floor had not been swept or mopped since way before we were there! The hotel has updated some fixtures and soft goods but need to do a major overhaul. Quaint touches are nice to keep but old slimy bathroom facuets and poor caulking are a definite don't.Watch out for the extra resort fee if just staying overnight and don't assume the parking fee is added to the hotel bill - it's an extra charge of $22.00 per day when you are about to leave!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Seabreeze Bar and Grill mmmmm I really felt comfortable during a one week stay in Mid December 2006 when the weather wasn't the best. The hotel had everything I needed. My room did not have a view of the beach; but was very spacious and comfortable. I was there to attend a conference by myself; but quickly found friendly conversation at the beach bar and grill ' Seabreeze'. The staff were knowledgeable and humorous. The food was delicous and the portion size would put a truck stop restaurant to shame. I appreciate the art deco look of this recently renovated classic hotel. Cheers to David, Antonio, Zinna and Luther. I am looking forward to returning in 2007. Hoping for more sun this time.</p></li>

They made all attempte to make sure we were happy with our room. It was an excellent view we had a view of the ocean and pool. The staff at the Pool Bar were very friendly and made sure you had a great time. The Bar/resturant inside had some issues the food was cold and the bar did not make sure you always had a drink. At times you were looking for someone to make you a drink. The rooms were clean. The valet staff were on top of everything, you did not have to wait long for your car to be brought around. We will stay there again.....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If The Price is Right...DO IT! I recieved an awesome deal on priceling that included hotel and airfare for $389 for 3 night 4 days. At the price how could I give this hotel a bad rap. The rooms are nice,you either have a partical ocean view or full city view or visa versa. The 2 Resturants in the hotel do a nice job to make you feel first class but you pay the price literally. Lobby has a nice reniassance welcome touch to it. The pool is nice but nothing special. The beach was beautiful. If You Are Looking For a Resort type Atmosphere with music playing , acivities going on- You will not find it here, if you are looking for a laid back relaxing hotel and the price is right this is a great hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pleasant Surprise I was very concerned after reading the reviews how my stay at this hotel would be. I found myself pleasantly surprised. Check-in was very fast. The room was spacious and the beds were comfortable. The bathroom includes two sinks, one inside and outside. There was a lot of closet space. The lighting in the room could be improved. True, the valet is expensive and beware of the RESORT FEE AND RESORT FEE TAX. But I found the staff to be courteous and the pool was clean. Travelers, remember that staying on Miami Beach is usually not cheap, and even some of the really expensive hotels on the beach do no provide excellent service. But for the price we paid, we were more than satisfied.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Place with History The Wyndham is a great hotel with lots of history. The decor is definitely period - from the Heyday of Miami Beach, but it is well maintained. The guest rooms are large by Miami Beach current standards and spotless. The meeting space and event staff are wonderful. Event space has character and elegance (great windows, chandeliers and draperies) you do not find with the newer hotels (No plain square windowless meeting rooms with carpet on the walls and annoying fluorescent lights here) Some of the lesser paid staff could benefit from a strong lesson in customer relations, but that seems to be a common problem in South Florida. The managemet staff I encountered was fabulous.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a good time. We stayed at the Wyndham a few weeks ago and had a very good time. The room was clean, not huge but certainly enough. We had an ocean view which I highly recommend. It is right on the beach and has a great pool. The food was very good a little pricy but ok. A few suggestions, one if you can bring some bottled water or sodas, we wound up spending $25 for two bottles of water and three diet cokes. Also there is construction right next door and it gets pretty loud during the day. The lounges right on the beach are great. I have never had problems with rude staff when we travel, same here, we had friendly service wherever we were. We would go back. Make sure and check out the art deco district.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wyndham just ok! I thought the Wyndham was comfortable but nothing special. We were in a junior suite and it was quite large with many closets. The beds were comfortable enough, but not spectacular. The pool area is very nice and comfortable - great lounge chairs. I did not swim but enjoyed sitting down there. The only downside there is you can't see the beach from the pool area. We had a $10 latte at the poolside bar/restaurant and it was simply horrible! The food was also just average and the service was incredibly slow.When in South Beach, go walk through the Delano at night - walk through the lobby, all the way out to the pool bar. We were there around midnight on Saturday night and it was totally happening!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very nice stay As a member of the Wyndham by request program, I stay mainly at the wyndham on any of my trips. This hotel in particular was very nice. It was a corner room with a very beautiful ocean view. Very spacious and the bathroom was a reasonable size. Enjoyed the sunrise and the sunset.I found out that most hotels in Miami charge a resort fee and they also all charge you for parking because there is no parking available. So those fees where fine. It was very convinent for Us and we went in and ou as we pleased. The pool is open 24hours so that was great. very quick acess to the beach which i loved and the beach was not as crowded as was south beach.overall this is a great clean hotel and the staff are just great. I would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Enjoyed stay ast Wyndham My new wife and I spent our honeymoon at Miami Beach and at the Wyndham Miami Beach Resort. We found the stay to be a pleasurably with only a few notable exceptions. One was the shortage of wash clothes left in the room and the other was the hidden costs for using the pool and workout room, which neither of us used. An $11 service charge per day for those facilities is unnecessary and it should be included in the cost of the reservations. Other than that fact that we had to take taxis or buses to get around, the stay was commendable. And we owe a special gratitute to the bellhop named Derek? He was exceptionally helpful in suggesting places to see, to eat and to get around. I hate I missed him before we left. We'll be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">a very bad experience I really had a terrible experience. I was staying in the hotel to attend a confrence. The conference started at 8:30 everyday, so i needed a good night sleep. The problem was they had wedding parties going to midnight and later. I could hear the boom of bass the whole time. When i called for some help with this matter i was told not to worry the party would stop soon. I dont think changing floors would have made adifference. We were on the fifth floor and there were parties on the top and lower floors. Also,the rooms and the hotel as a whole ,did not fit the criteria for being rated so well in my opinion. The bathroom was not clean, and small. The building is dated. My suggestion is you find another hotel. Also you are far from lincoln rd.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">only w/ hotwire booked through hotwire (select 3.5 star hotel in miami beach and you're likely to get this place) and paid about 1/2 the going rate which is why i'd rate my stay as okay.there's a nice facade, but the building is dated, as are the rooms. the beds were not so great. the pancakes at the breakfast buffet were barely edible (hardened from sitting in the chafing dish for so long).there is a decent pool and beach access.the reality is this: miami beach is expensive and you're not going to find a bargain. so if you can get this place at a discounted rate, it'll be fine (but not great). i wouldn't pay full price though.one tip: instead of paying $22/day for valet parking, there's a muni-meter lot at 48th  collins, free btwn 6pm and 8am, something like $1/hr otherwise.</p></li>

Rooms are a bit run-down as other mentioned. We are assigned to a room so close to the elevator and couldn't sleep all night due to its noise and had to move out to another room further down.One of my colleague in a different room said his room has coach roaches. Welcome to the roach motel.We tried the pool, better in the morning because in the afternoon, the bottom has plenty of trash, ugh.We also are Wyndham By Request member and learned we can't even get free Internet access requested here because this hotel is not participating, duh! Have to pay for Internet access, and wireless access is not even working properly most of the time. Would I stay here again for this price, no.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">close to the beach, far from the action I stayed at the Wyndham miami beach for 2 nights with a couple of my friends. It is located close to very chic miami beach resorts which is pretty cool considering the deal you are getting. It is right on the beach and has a nice pool area. I ate lunch at the bar near the pool and the waiters/bartenders were super friendly. The beds in the room were average, but everything else about the room was nice. My few complaints: the noise from the local construction was very distracting and interupted pool-side relaxation; the food is overpriced and since there is nothing within walking distance, you either eat there or take a cab. If you are looking for crazy south beach fun, this is not for you. If you want a hotel out of the way, but close to the beach, i would definitely stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great Honeymoon getaway I looked all over for a hotel and saw so many bad reviews of all hotels online. Anyway, my new husband and I wanted to spend a couple extra days in Miami after our honeymoon cruise. We chose this hotel b/c it was away from the noise of southbeach (40 minute walk, $10 cab). We were very very pleased. It has a great pool (24 hours a day with free towels) and beach access. The bar outback is nice too. Also, if you don't want internet, you are not charged for it like a lot of other places do. The concierge desk was very helpful as well. Also, our room was the exact one pictured on the website. We got the Junior? suite for 169/night and it was huge...w/ ~four closets. I would definitely recommend this if you want to find a nice hotel near everything, but quiet and with beach access. (we stayed 3 nights)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Do Not Stay At This Hotel. Ripoff!!! Do not even think about making a reservation at Wyndham Miami Beach Resort !! We made a reservation but had to cancel months in advance. Guess what? Wyndham bills your credit card as of the day you make the reservationnot upon date you are subject to cancellation fees. In addition, the reservations department cannot refund your money even with a valid cancellation number. The only way to get your money back is to contact the accounting department at the property Monday thru Friday during their working hours. I have never heard of a reservations system that takes your money but cannot refund it. We finally had to dispute the charge through American Express to get the charge removed. This place is a total scam. I cannot repeat this enough...Do Not Give This Company Your Credit Card Number!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stay away I have just returned from Miami. We stayed at the Wyndham Miami Beach resort. It advertises itself on being a luxury 4 star hotel. Sadly this is not the case. It is probably the worst hotel we have ever stayed in. The staff are rude, we had 2 false fire alarms at night, the rooms are dirty and the walls paper thin. A vacant room next to us- the radio alarm went off at full sound at 2.3-am in the morning- it took three phone calls and over an hour before someone bothered to come to switch it off.I had read the poor reviews on this site before we went but thought wrongly that it would be ok. If you are thinking about staying here...DO NOT!! Change to the nearby hotel Eden Roc which is recently renovated and very stylish. The best thing that could happen to the Wyndham is for a bulldozer to knock it down....it really is that bad!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just Awful I really didn't think i'd ever feel as strongly as to write a scathing review, but i had a really disappointing start to our honeymoon here.The food in the hotel restaurant was awful and very bad value (It cost more than at the 5 star hotel we stayed at on the way home), the room was not clean. I look back now and wish i had made a complaint but too late now. the Pool was ok but dated. Generally bad value all round.However i would say this was no reflection on the service, although i was annoyed that gratuity was added i feel that i should be able to make that judgement. It was also a fantastic Location (just $8 from Lincoln road and all the restaurants which was a relief after tasting their food).I had joined the 'By request Scheme' which gave us a late check out and a few other bonuses. If i hadn't done that it would have been a truly awful 3 nights.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">really nice! Stayed over labor day weekend. South beach hotels are usually expensive or old. This hotel was really nice, with large bedrooms. It looked brand new and the food at the pool was very reasonably priced. So were the drinks. The beach area is beautiful, but the hotel is not within walking distance of much. It's sort of on the outskirts of the boardwalk and lincoln road. The workout room is old and pretty much useless, but for the price and size of the rooms, you can't beat it. And they quoted me a price of $169 a night over the Christmas holidays. It's worth it!! Believe me, I'm really picky about everything, and I had no complaints. Oh yeah, don't rent a car. It's cheaper to just take a taxi everywhere, because the hotel charges $18.00 a day to park, and everywhere you drive they'll charge for parking, if you can even find a parking space!! We're not used to that in Atlanta.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Best Ever! I was in desperate need of a vacation, so I looked at the specials through Travel Zoo. This hotel was part of a special promotion and I booked it immediately. After booking, I read the reviews and got totally scared, but decided to stick with my choice. I am so glad I did. I got an ocean-view room that was clean and well appointed. The pool was wonderful, the restaurants in the hotel were great and the location fabulous. A quick trip down Collins Avenue on the H or S bus which stopped right outside the hotel zipped down to South Beach. But the people at the hotel really made my stay the best. The bartenders (Zinna, Elke, David) at the Seabreeze were a bright, fun group. The front desk staff were very professional and answered any questions I had. I don't understand where all the bad reviews come from. Perhaps those who gave negative reviews just expected more; I don't know. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not aging well, but a great stay! I used to go here as a kid when it was called the Doral. I went back for a couple of days with my kids. My cousin, who is a South Florida resident, came to visit us with her own son and commented. Isn't it funny that we are now hanging out with our kids in the same pool we used to hang out in?We were there during a hurricane watch. The staff handled everything wonderfully and kept us all calm. The bartender, who's name I can't remeber was very nice and generous with his drinks. The valet were efficent, as well as the front desk.The lobby is still breathtaking, but the rooms have seen better days. Our window was leaking from all the rain, but I just put a towel under it. The bathrooms could use some remodeling too.No problems with the elevators at all.Maybe this hotel has sentimental value to me, but I would totally recommend it. Its very freeway accessable and a short drive to South Beach!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wilma made us stay longer We had reserved the room for one night through a third party site. we ended up having to stay an extra two nights due to the storm. The hotel provided food and water while here and we were one of the first hotels to get power back on Tuesday morning. I never had a problem with the staff and the beach was clean. The hotel does charge an extra $10 a day for resort fee and even chraged us this for the day the hurricane hit. All together it was a pleasant stay and the room was clean and not large but for the price we paid compared to other rooms of the same size in the area it was good. Also, we did have to take a cab the entire trip but we chose to do it rather than risk driving after drinking the entire trip. It is about an $8 ride to south beach and the cabs are readily available. We stay at Wyndhams alot and this one was about the standard as others. I would stay here again and the staff was friendly.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just okay Our wives sent three of us to Miami Beach for a guys weekend golf etc...the hotel is on the North Side of Miami Beach Pennisula...the Boat show had just ended (this may be a good hotel for boat show just for location)...we stayed in a suite which had two queen beds and pull out couch room was generally clean but very dated. Bathroom was passable for three guys but my wife would have complained.Pool area was passable we did not swim as it was too cold....ate breakfast at the restaurant and it was good food a bit expensive at $20 a piece.Bar was way overpriced $9 for a Corona....all bills include 18% gratuity.As others have noted there is nothing around except other hotels and high rise condos I have to think that there are as expensive or less expensive hotels closer to the Action of Miami Beach. There is a Publix supermarket a mile further North but otherwise you are stuck going hotel to hotel to go to restaurant or bar....</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wyndham should do better. My husband attended a large event for which the Wyndham served as the overflow hotel. This hotel is badly in need of renovation (especially the rooms). It has some wonderful old floors and elevators that are easily overlooked b/c the hotel is not in tip top shape and the decor is dated. Our experience with room service was great. Food was just OK for the price, but the staff was the best we incountered during our stay. Valet service is worth mentioning if only because it is the worst I have ever encountered. Twice we called down from our room to have the car ready and twice we went downstairs only to have to ask them to bring the car around and wait about 10 minutes. Pool area is large and functional, could be spruced up a bit  stretch of beach is quiet, clean and nice. I wouldn't consider this a resort since there is really not much focus on service or ammenities. I expected a whole lot more from a Wydham property.</p></li>

The hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service. It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from the hotel to go home. The pool is luxurious. Our kids are 1 and 3 and they enjoyed it. The pool attendants were wonderful. The waitress even came into the pool with a tray of ice cream for the kids to have. My wife had a day at the Spa she said she had a great time she look great when she came back to us. Restaurants were to die for. Are kids still drink milk in a bottle and they like it warm, no worries we just called room service and they were more then happy to help. I can not say enough about the service and all the worker we came in contact with. The room was very spacious and relaxing we realy never want to leave but the kids want the pool and the beach.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pleasantly surprised After reading some of these reviews, I was afraid I had made a mistake in booking this hotel, but we were pleasantly surprised. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The public areas were bright, clean, tasteful, and in good repair. Our guest room was spacious, clean, and generally in good repair, with the exception of a couple of cracked tiles in the bathroom. My brother was traveling with a broken leg, but found the hotel easy to navigate. We were also able to borrow a wheelchair from the hotel for longer ventures. This area is strictly hotels and condos, so the only restaurants in the area within walking distance are those associated with the hotels, but there are plenty to choose from. Also, be aware that the price for the same item may vary greatly within the hotel. The price for a 20 oz. bottled soft drink was $3.27 in one shop and just over $2.00 in another.My only criticism is that the concierge was not very helpful when we asked for tour suggestions.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A wonderful bargain and great hotel and service I went for a friends' getaway at the hotel for 3 nights. We were all pleasantly surprised, especially given some of the less than stellar reviews. While the proporty is certainly older than some of the shiny new towers in Miami Beach, this is a well-cared for and clean property with a GREAT location. From the valet service, check-in and bellmen the service was friendly and thorough.The rooms were good, the pool, beach and exercise facilities were great. The spa, though a bit pricey, has wonderful attendants and top of the line service.We only used one of the lounges/restaurants at the property during our stay. It was expensive including the service charge and gratuity, BUT the food was great and the bartender was both friendly and generous.Because we had a rental car, we found the location very flexible and a short drive from many attractions and activities.We will definitely stay her again for great service at a bargain price for the area.</p></li>

You definitely feel luxurious walking into the lobby. The customer service is spectacular. My family felt welcomed right from the start. It is a wonderful hotel and the staff is fantastic from the moment you walk through the door. The concierge is welcoming, the check-in desk is amazingly friendly and all other members of staff smile and greet you as you walk around the hotel. The rooms are stunning. One of the few hotels in Miami Beach that offer such spacious room with economical prices. Special thanks to the staff at the Seabreez Bar  Grill (by the pool) the food is wonderful and the service is outstanding. Our waiter was a gentleman by the name of Revy. Our kids are 16 and 12 and love their stay here. The pool attendants were wonderful, passing out orange wedges and popsicles. We just left last week and are making plans to reserve again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Dissapointing A dissapointing Experience.1) As I am entering my hotel room, I was shocked to find brown dirt smeared on the toilet seat of the room. For their credit, house keeping cleaned up the mess quickly, but it made for a terrible first impression.2) Parking for $18 a day, your better off parking your car for $10 in a public parking spot.3) Normal pool and the beach front infront of the hotel is managed by a seperate company, so your resort fee does not cover any services on the beach. In other words, your paying money just to swim in the pool.4) Terrible restaurants. You are better off eating elswhere, food is over priced with small portions.5) Rude service. When checking out, they over charged me for items I did not consume from the room snacks. While trying to resolve the issue in a mild mannered way, they kept inferring that I am hiding something and were very rude in the way they dealt with this issue.6) Do your math, it turns out you get better value for money going to another higher star hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not impressed at all! In Irish brochures this hotel has a 4 star rating, I would give it a 2 star. We stayed here on our honeymoon and thankfully we only had a couple of days here after spending 10 days in Orlando.  We found the hotel to be old and like the previous reviewer said the bathroom is dated, toilet constantly clogged and the rooms need to be renovated. The walls are paper thin and after spending the first night beside the elevator shaft we were livid. We called reception numerous times the following morning and we were told we could not be moved, they weren't helpful at all. After tears from me my husband finally went down to speak to the Mgr and after practically begging her she finally moved us.  There are no shops, bars or restaurants in the vicinity, everything is a cab ride away. We ate in the restaurant the first night and its over priced and not that nice at all.  The staff on reception aren't that friendly, apart from Jose (I think). He was very pleasant and friendly to deal with. The bellboys were also very helpful.I would not go back to this hotel (even if it was for free) or recommend it to anyone. What a way to end our honeymoon!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Christmas in Miami Beach My husband and I booked this as a package on a last minute travel site. We read these reviews AFTER booking and were a bit nervous in arriving. We fortunately had a great experience! Our room on the 10th floor was big and clean and non-smoking. we had a side view - not facing the construction - and could see the ocean from our room. We didn't experience any rudeness on the part of staff - and we were there Christmas Eve and Christmas day, when the majority of staff don't want to work! the Pool was nice, but mostly in the shade by afternoon. the beach is clean and the fitness center is great! The bus stop is right outside the hotel so you don't need a car - eliminates the parking fee and valet hassle. Multiple buses run to South Beach and North to Bal Harbor as well as the night owl (11pm to 5am if you want to party) - we felt safe on the bus and actually picked up some local tips on where to go... We also didn't pay the resort fee people mentioned - maybe it was wrapped in to our package deal and we didn't notice. Bathroom and towels were clean and quite large. I'd go back if I got another deal - I wouldn't, however, pay the posted $440/night rate.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Disappointing I am sad to say my family and I did not really love this place.Luckily the rest of Miami / Miami Beach did impress me and compensated for the issues I had with the hotel as a first time visitor. I am a sun lover - the x 2 sky scrapers that are now positioned to the side of this hotel basically steal the sun for what is about 2 hours each day. This is so disappointing. In my opinion this hotel will not survive, the staff look pretty cheesed off and the decor and general appearance of the hotel is tired and old.I think this was a great hotel about 15 years ago, before those two huge towers were errected and when the furnishings could be classed as new.Staff try hard, our check in was fine, the concierge is good, very knowledgable, some of the breakfast staff are also good.The valet parking is about the best thing - fast and only $20 per day, the only way to go in my opinion.The hotel is out of Southbeach on 49th, bearing mind the art deco district is 7th to 15th Avenue - you are a long way out - and the Lincoln area is also too far to walk.With this hotel you need to drive everywhere, if I were doing Miami Beach again I would not stay here, I would stay closer to the downtown area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Above and beyond my greatest expectations When we walked into the lobby, we were amazed by how beautiful it was. We were greeted by the front desk manager and she was very welcoming and helpful regarding our check in. She was able to get us into our room immediately even though check in was at 3:00 p.m. The busboys were helpful with our bags. Our room faced the Bay . It was clean and comfortable and we had more than enough room for both of us. The concierge services are just amazing. They provided us with great information and also gave us directions to our destinations and suggestions for things to do. They made reservations for our daily sightseeing trips. The restaurants have great food. The breakfast buffet was fabulous and definitely worth the price. Having lunch outside by the pool with a view of Miami beach was awesome and the food was great. Eating dinner and having a view of Miami beach at sunset was worth it. This restaurant had amazing staff and food.After dinner, we sat at the bar and had drinks and appetizers. The bar staff was very friendly and the drinks were awesome. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. I have already started to plan my next vacation in Miami and going back to this Hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wow! I just got back from a 2 week stay at the Wyndham Miami Beach Resort and I loved it! Although $18 a day for valet parking was a bit expensive (especially when they take about 5 mins every time to retrieve your car) I cannot complain too much as we only paid $99 a night for the room, which was ocean facing with a king size bed! During our stay was the 4th of July weekend, which meant the hotel, got really busy and space at the pool was all gone by 10.30. Also the room service was busy during this time and at one point our order was 15 mins late not really anything to complain about, but they gave it to us for free when I called to see how much longer it would be! The hotel looks exactly like the pictures on the website, although it only had 1 restaurant open at dinner (the lobby lounge) even though the website, and in-room info pack stated the hibiscus court and bistro were also open. Overall I cannot fault it, 5 star service (especially the oranges by the pool which were a nice touch) for 3 star prices (拢127 a night after parking and resort fees, for an ocean facing room booked on hotel website. I got a special rate as I joined their byrequest program online for free!). I would definitely recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Love the resort...great for women travelers! I stayed at this hotel for a weekend preceding a cruise. This hotel was great in all aspects. The service was great, as well as the room amenities. The room we had overlooked the bay and was decorated nicely. It had great floor to ceiling windows. The bathroom was emaculate and had two sinks which is very rare to find. The room also had a walk-in closet, which was great for all our clothing. The phone in the room was a cordless phone which made it easy to move around.The food at the grille and in the restuarants was also good. However, there was a standard 17% gratuity already added to all bills at the hotel. There is also a $10.00 per day resort fee which was additional. The mango daqairi's and fuzzy navel are the best I ever had and the bar near the pool and grill. I would highly recommend this hotel, especially for women because of the conveniences and security. It is on Collins street about 6-8 blocks from the famous South Beach, but we took a cab ride for about $7.00. I must not forget to tell that this is a wonderful beachfront property. There is access from the resort. I will definately recommend this my clients traveling to the Miami area or just want a great weekend getaway!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">HATED IT!!! This was one of the worst experiences I have had at a hotel. The service was painfully bad and you had to pay for the room immediately upon making a reservation. I am a Wyndham member and expected to have a couple of waters and a small snack when I checked in. Instead I checked into a smelly, dirty room with waters in the mini bar that you pay $4 for. I went to the desk to inquire about my waters and was told that I was not a member as well as given a large attitude. C'mon - this is a free membership, why would I lie???? Especially when you can sign up AT the hotel! Come to find out, they had my name spelled wrong (and trust me, it's not a difficult name) so I was assured that everything was settled and I would receive a delivery to my room. Needless to say, it never happened. Upon checking out, I was honest about my dissatisfaction and asked if they could comp a 2 waters off my bill and was told no, they would TRY to make it up during my next stay. I politely reminded them there would not be another stay with this lack of service. The man shrugged and walked away. Trust me, there are BEAUTIFUL hotels that are much nicer, better service and for the same price much closer to South Beach. Save your hard earned money and give it to a hotel that will treat you right!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">nice stay at miami beach My best friend and I just got back from a weekend getaway at Miami Beach. We both work in the hospitality industry. Due to that reason, we are a little picky on hotels we stay at. I can tell you the hotel is not as bad as the others saying. My best friend (travel agent) booked the hotel and we prepaid everything in advance. We didn鈥檛 have car, but $22 parking is better than $40 parking in NYC. We arrived after 9pm on Friday and got upgraded to a Jr. Suite. The room is very spacious, tons of closet space. The bed is comfortable, everything is very clean. We went running on the beach the next morning. Best morning run ever. We had lunch at the restaurant near the pool. Pretty basic menu. The beach is nice, clear water. We can see our own feet in the water, I am sure you can鈥檛 do that in New Jersey. By the way, the hotel doesn鈥檛 own the beach, why blame the hotel for a dirty beach?? We went to the hotel restaurant for dinner on our last night. Food was so so, but service was great. Over all, I think the hotel itself is average, but the service is excellent. I would like to thanks Brett (manager at the Bistro), Luciana (our server) and Juan (concierge) for such great service. You guys made our weekend trip such a pleasant experience. Hope to see you soon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not all that great Looked wonderful on website but for the money I paid for it I would suggest another hotel. For a 3 star hotel it could do ALOT better.Book the vacation package for 4 days 3 nights right off the Wyndham Vacations website, but was told by the staff at the hotel that my free ByRequest membership wasn't valid because Wyndham went through a third party company to book the vacation. I can understand that for the airfare but for hotel reservations I figure Wyndham would take care of that themselves. I guess not. That was a ripoff. I just wanted my high speed access which was free to ByRequest members. Other issue was that our first room we were given was not cleaned properly because there was hair all over the bed and in the bathroom. Called and complained and was given a better room with view but not without getting some grief from the front desk. Asked about transportation options to South Beach was encountered with some unfriendly hotel employees who were not so helpful. This is all on a Monday afternoon when it isn't that busy!Food was sooo overly expensive and just average.Not everyone at the hotel was unfriendly. There some exceptions but overall nothing too great to rave about. Resort quality hotel it is not. Next time I am staying in one of the other hotels along the strip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Gritty Gritty - Bang Bang! Yes - Booking our business meetings in this rundown piece of Miami's past was a Huge Mistake. This would pass for an old tourist hotel - but for the business traveler it is sub-standard. The Team working our meetings were great -- set and reset the rooms to accommodate our needs. Really tried to give the service needed - but the facility did not give them much to work with for their efforts.The comfort of our conference attendees was more than they could accommodate:No temperature control on the meeting rooms - freezing or hotMildew stench in the ballroomsNo security at front desk - just gave out new guest room keys without checking your name or IDNo lock on our meeting room - MIramar NorthDirty Rooms reported by several attendees - hair in bath, slow running drains, dirty tubs, broken faucets.Fraudulent charges on the room bills - others charging to the rooms and wrongly charged parking when there was no car.Did I mention Ants - and worse -- staff returning home with bed bug bites.The food was good - but heavy. The pool looked nice -- didn't get there......For the money - I am so sure you could do better for a meeting hotel. Leave this one to the 200 15 yr olds from Argentina celebrating their Quincentara who took over the elevators during our stay and ran the halls half the night.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pretty good but not worth the money I was very concerned after reading all the reviews as to what to expect when I arrived but it turned out ok. I attended the fitness conference held 11/12 - 11/16. When I arrived I was greeting promptly and curteously by the front desk staff. I had a room on the 7th floor. The room and bathroom were clean. There was a large amount of closet space. The curtains, rug, and paint were in needed of some attention but overall ok. I had breakfast one morning in the restaurant which was excellent. The server was very polite. While pricey, I did not need to eat lunch. I took the bus to Lincoln Road for dinner. It's pretty easy to get around using public transportation and would recommend not renting a car if you are only there for a few days. $2 one-way gets you to South Beach. I have to compliment the maid service. She was always aware when I left the room in the morning and made sure I have everything I needed. Room was always cleaned promptly. I like the fact they do not change the sheets everyday unless you ask. It's good for the environment and completely unnecessary for the most part. The Pool restaurant was ok but did not have a large selection to pick from. Prices were reasonable. Pool area was nice. Overall, hotel was ok. However, it's not worth the money even with the conference rate.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just horrible The place is a dump. The only reasons why it's called a resort are the exorbitant price, kitsch decor and pompous staff.The room keys didn't work, the bathroom door was completely broken, the air in the room was awfully stale and nothing could be done about it -- the windows are screwed shut. The beds were old, soft, squeaky and smelly, if you have back problems, definitely stay away. There was dust everywhere and you couldn't see the ocean because of the dirty windows.The staff was polite, but unhelpful; we've been lied to our face several times, in particular about late checkout availability (it's free until 2pm upon request).Valet parking is decent, but it is required, at $22/night. Pick a time when they are not busy, too. The valets will literally throw your luggage in the trunk of your car.Honestly, spending time in a well kept motel or a Holiday Inn Express at 1/8th the price would have been a much better deal overall.Stay out of Miami Beach in general -- the service and quality are pretty bad everywhere, both at hotels and restaurants. Instead, drive up to Ft. Lauderdale, there are much better properties there, which are less expensive and are located at the same beach and ocean.Miami Beach is the US capital of bad service and Miami Beach Resort and Spa is unquestionably one of the reasons why it is so.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A very pleasant experience!!! Stayed here March 7th through the 11th.My girlfriend and I were looking for a quiet get a way from the 13 degree weather in NY. The rooms were spacious, and the oceanview from the 10th floor was spectacular! Some of the reviews posted comment on the decor being out of date. I guess that could be the case, but it all depends on what you are looking for. The room was clean, spacious, and satisfied our needs. The hotel is beautiful, and the staff accommodating. The heated pool is huge, but only good from about 10 AM to 1PM, as the sun is blocked by nearby hotels / condos. You then have to move to the beach. The beach is private and clean. It will cost you $10 for a lounge chair. The food was quite delicious, but very pricey. A cheeseburger is $12, and breakfast for 2 runs close to $50. The breakfast buffet is really good, but 4 days of a $50 breakfast for 2 is a bit much. You have to take a taxi to get to south beach (around $15) or to anywhere you wanted to go. There is nowhere to walk to for stores or resturants close by. The weight room is sufficient, and the massages were amazing. Drinks / beer was pricey, more so than it had to be (mixed drink is $10). Bottom line... we would stay at this hotel again. However, if returning to south beach again, I would book a hotel directly in south beach, where all the action is.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfect stay at Wyndham Miami Beach Just came back last night from 11 days at the Wyndham Miami Beach Resort and had a great time. the hotel is not cheap but after making a few calls, we got a one bedroom suite for $198 a night, the suite had a huge living area with appropriate furniture, sofa couch and TV , separate bedroom with 2 double beds, 2 full bath rooms 2 extra vanities and sinks outside each bathroom and 3 walk in closets, we love it. We have a child and was provided a playpen instead of a crib and after a couple of calls , a full size crib was provided, the air conditioner had a small leak and rattling sound and that was fixed, within half an hour. My point is that even when things go wrong as the ofter can , they were great with costumer service and took care of it, quickly. Pool service was better than in any other hotel I have stayed in Miami, Valet parking was quicly and very helpfull. ( Yes it is $18 a day but all other hotels in that area charge the same and more and are not as nice, believe me.THe location was great for us, we had a rental car and used it to go ut to eat and for day trips. In my opinion the South beach area and the blocks around it are not family oriented at all, Lots of topless sunbathing, and people that I would not want to be around with.Beach chairs are free and umbrellas $15 once again a bargain for that area.I highly recomend it this place.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Could have been somewhere else Stayed at MBRS during 6/9/07 through 6/12/07.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not as bad as the previous reviews... Hi there,We stayed for a cheap, quick 4 night break in the sun.We did get an upgraded room facing the ocean which was nice. Room was of a pretty good size and the bathroom not bad either. Lots of space to stash things away. However, they mentioned that will be refurbishing the hotel and the rooms would be in need of a lick of paint and some new bedding and so on as it's a bit dated now.Concierge and restaurant staff always helpful when asked. We did have 1 breakfast, which seemed pretty over priced, but then breakfasts often are in hotels. Around the pool was nice, it wasn't the height of season so didn't feel to crammed in. We didn't use the beach, but nice to have it just there. There's a few other hotels just along the way so the beach might get a bit busier at times.You are a bit out of the way, can't really just walk anywhere to pick up a few bits or get some food. However, you can catch the S bus from just outside to get into South Beach which is the cheap way of doing things. We also caught the bus up to Aventura mall for some shopping, which although seemed to take 45 mins for $1.50 was pretty good value. Overall, the hotel is definitely looking a bit worn around the edges but I think for the money if you can get a cheap deal then it's not so bad. You're paying for what you get here basically and it's really no worse than some of the cheap cheap South Beach hotels.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A good experience I had read lots of reviews on here and I was really scared to go there but, becuase it was a family event taking place at this location I decided to stay with everyone. I arrived and I was really surprised. The valet when I arrived was really very courteous Wesley I thought was always pleasant and outstanding but, so were all the other guys. We checked in and the front desk staff were also pleasant no problems at all. I actually got my room early and although I had not seen my room decided then to add an extra night to our stay which I would have needed to stay in Miami anyway. I know, risky since I had not seen the room and I had read such bad reviews. Anyway, we got to the room and it was nothing like I expected it was much better than the reviews read previous to travel. Our room was clean and smelt clean and had good daytime light. I do agree the lighting in the night can be improved however especially for reading. The rooms had great storage space walkin closet and all plus lots of drawer space and extra space to hang clothing.Our view although not of the beach was nice especially at night. We had a good time and my cousins wedding turned out really beautiful and the services they provided for that was top class and really that is all that mattered to us. Our entire family had an enjoyable stay. We had about 10-12 rooms and no one in our family complained so I think that sums it up to a great experience!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Incredible Stay--Atmosphere, Attraction and Hospitality In One Package I had a great time at the Miami Beach Resort and Sap. The beach is immediately behind the hotel; the actual property leading up to the beach is beautiful. There is a casual bar and grill 鈥?and two swimming pools adjacent to the beach; plenty of lounge chairs for relaxation and sunbathing. Palm trees and foliage surround the property. The hotel has several restaurants; one, open until 11 AM serving breakfast, offers a spectacular buffet. The rooms are roomy and attractive and the lobby and surrounding decor in the hotel boasts a touch of grandeur without pretension. There are several shops on property and a full-service spa for those inclined to indulge in shopping, relaxation or exercise. For others attending to business, the hotel has a user-friendly business center. The hotel's staff is superlative, going out of their way to assist guests. Housekeeping and the concierge merit special accolades. I walked along the beach, going for miles, but the interesting area is within sight of the hotel's property. The hotel property is in a prime location, centrally located on Miami Beach, within an easy commute to South Beach and downtown Miami. Overall, my stay was an excellent and enjoyable experience that I would highly recommend. The value is incredible. I would expect to pay much more for the services, atmosphere and accommodations at the Miami Resort and Spa. Highly recommended.</p></li>

Once you have visited places such as Thailand and Bali, there is no comparison with this excuse for a resort. An empty bar fridge was placed in our room the first night. They promised to sort it out. The next day a full, locked bar fridge with a nifty little window was added to our suite. We requested that we get the key to unlock it. No they told us there are NO keys to the bar fridges. ( Why bother putting them in your room then?). No key was forthcoming for 4 days.The location is also a problem. Getting anywhere is either a very long walk or an expensive taxi ride.The cherry on the top was our last day when one of the porters said: where do you think I am going to put all this luggage? ( We had asked them to store it from checkout time, 11.00 am to 13h00 that day.) Overheard from an American woman was: Did you see that mans' face? Its the longest face I have ever seen.Luckily this bad experience of American service was made up by Royal Carribean - Superb!Get your entire staff on a trip so that they can find out what service is really about!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Welcome to Miami.... The hotel is easy to find and is very well represented by it's staff. We booked a night on a casino cruise through the reception and they were very helpful and cheery, and patient with our accents! The guy who took us and our bags up to the room was very informative and began telling us all the things we could do there without us even asking, which was great. I joined the By Request service via the internet after reading about it on here, and it worked well there was free drinks and munchies waiting for us and we had a great view out of our room of both the ocean and the river. It was a very nice hotel to stop at and I would definately stay either here or try another Wyndham hotel again. It wasnt too close to South Beach as someone else stated but a short taxi ride would solve that, and there was always a taxi waiting for us outside. The valet parking was quite expensive ($18 per night) but the room was great, the air con was very refreshing and much needed. Word of warning (not to put you off) watch out for the sharks just off the beach, not just here but anywhere in Miami beach, we went swimming on our last day here just in front of the hotel and we noticed a shark (about 8ft) hanging around just behind us, which looking back is a great story to tell people but be careful, although some of the local guys there said they were harmless and are very common !!! But if you're coming to Miami Beach regardless of the wildlife this is a top place to stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Not worth the price I stayed at this resort November 13-16 for a fitness conference. The hotel was very busy during this time; I believe there was also a wedding there that weekend. The hotel was not prepared to handle this kind of traffic, apparently. First thing I noticed going into the elevator is that the elevator certificate was expired over three months ago. Not a comforting thought, but I didn't think too much about it. Then the room - the bathroom was old and truly outdated. The room smelled okay. Whatever, its just a place to sleep. We had asked for a fridge from the front desk. One never came, so we called down for one. No big deal. Then the tv didn't work, so we called down again and they sent a guy up. The second night I looked up while showering to notice black mold all over the ceiling of the bathroom. Also, ants were marching their way across the bathroom sink. We tried to call downstairs and the phone just rang and rang and rang. The hotel was getting overwhelmed by all the people. This was also evident by the disgusting state of all the conference and ballrooms. The pool and outside areas were beautiful. The gym was crappy and old. Didn't get a chance to experience the spa. Looked like it was under construction. While checking out I mentioned the mold/ants and they offered me two free nights in a nicer room to make up for it. I didn't expect anything, so that was nice of them. Yeah, well, it would have been nice, except that the promised vouchers for the free nights were never sent to me!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice stay at the Wyndham Just came back from a 4 night stay at the Wyndham Miami Beach. I was a bit wary of staying here after all the bad reviews I read. However, I was pleasantly suprised by the Wyndham. The rooms were clean, the staff was very courteous and helpful, and the valet brought our car promptly...everything that others complained about were not issues for us during our stay. The location was also perfect for us because it wasn't in the heart of SOBE, but close enough for us to go to every night for dinner and drinks via $10-12 taxi ride. The food at the poolside bar/ restaurant was really good, of course it was pricey, but expected since hotel food is always pricey. Although I didn't enjoy paying the resort fee, I wasn't extremely bothered by it since all the other hotels in the area charge the same thing. The fitness center was nice and large. It seems that the Wyndham does have a pattern of overcharging for things at checkout, based on the other reviews I have read, they charged us for 4 days of parking, when we only parked for 1 day, but this was promptly remedied without any complaints or rudeness. The pictures on it's website do a good job of reflecting the hotel. Our bathroom light also went out and they fixed it right away. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Wyndham and didn't have the same negative experiences that others have had. Some of the negativity may stem from expecting too much or paying higher prices (we got a good rate through Expedia, about $100/ night), or the hotel is not consistent with it's service and cleanliness.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Watch out for resort feees There are good and bad things about this hotel. Here's what you need to know:The Good - the bedding is great, the room was clean and the staff are really wonderful and helpful and the food at the Seabreeze restaurant at the pool was really tasty.The Bad - There was construction on both sides of the hotel when we were there Monday and Tuesday (March 20/21, 2006)They charge a resort fee of $10 plus $1.30c tax which really upset me given that I booked an Expedia package through Wyndham Vacations.They have an ontime check in guarantee of 4pm, we arrived at 3.30pm with a baby and were left waiting until 5pm, despite the fact we were told that we'd be called on our cell at 4pm.The property has a nice setting looking out on the beach, but the decor needs a serious update!! Also there's a board walk that starts at the entrace of the Miami public beach a couple of doors down, its not that far away but makes life with a stroller a little difficult. Also the hotel has a number of steps inside which meant we constantly had to carry the stroller to get to the pool.For the money I thought this was pretty poor value overall. A flight from Newark and three nights here cost us $1700. (We were told by Wyndham reps that a seat was required for our 4 month old baby on board the flight, tho Continental said that was not true.)Not sure who to believe here, but anyway.I'd recommend checking out the nearby Eden Roc hotel, they have a superb property with a great restaurant that looks into the ocean. Don't know how they are on price, but shop around.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very Nice for the price. Great Service and Beach Access. I travel frequently and enjoy writing reviews which can be helpful to other travelers. Overall this was a very nice resort and our experience was very pleasant. I bought a one night stay prior to going on a cruise through Hotwire and I got a great deal on the room. I also noticed similar pricing directly from the hotels web site. The service, restaurants and bars where very nice and much better than had I expected them to be. The pool area was very nice with live entertainment and a poolside bar. Beach access was close and convenient. The hotel it鈥檚 self is an older hotel which has been restored. The lobby is ornate and decorated with many very nice antiques. The only thing I didn鈥檛 like about the entire experience was the paint job in our hotel room. The room was clean but it looked like the walls hadn鈥檛 been painted in years. Given the attention that the rest of the hotel had received, I was surprised that paint on the walls of our room where so old and scuffed up. I鈥檝e traveled enough not to let an old paint job ruin my day off and I had a great time at this resort. Some things that I didn鈥檛 expect were:1) My Hotwire purchase did not include a resort fee and was only for the hotel room it鈥檚 self. No problem as the fee was only $10 and was well worth it. 2)Drinks were reasonably priced but food was just a little on the expensive side very similar to staying at any major resort. The food was excellent and worth a little more.Over all this is a great resort and I鈥檓 looking forward to returning in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Worst Hotel Experience ever! Took me about 10 minutes waiting for someone to take our luggage out from our car.Went to the restaurant for lunch and took them half an our to prepare 3 cheeseburgers...and to then tell us that they've ran out the fish and chips that one of us had ordered !The beach was very dirty and not maintained at all.Of the 5 elevators that this hotel has, only ONE was working. To go down the lobby from the 16th. floor took us more than half an hour, and that is because I asked a maid if she could please tell us where the service elevator was so we could go down.At 11.30 PM the Fire Alarm went off and we all had to evacuate our rooms and go down the very narrow stairs 16 floors! We later found out that it had been a false alarm.My daughter who was in a room in the 15th. floor runned down in her pijamas and left her room card/key in the room. When asked the people at the front desk to please give her another card/key and/or open his room door, they DEMANDED to see an ID from her. Everything was locked in her room. They did'nt mind that I was her father and we both have the same last name or that was I who was paying the bills, They wanted to se HER PHOTO ID because the room was booked to her name!!!. So there she was in her pijamas in the hotel lobby in the middle of the night. I had to talk to several people untill someone there suggested that a security guard could come with us upstairs, open my daughter's room and then show him her ID with Photo.I'm 58 years old and have stayed in many hotelsin my lifeandt this was by far the worst experience I've had so far.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Know what you're getting before you book Just got back from 4 nights at the hotel where my high school reunion was held. I'm a Miami Beach native and only stayed in the hotel for convenience to the event. Overall, not sure if their standard price is worth it. (I found lower rates than what I originally booked.) PROS: Staff was very friendly, the bay view from the high floor was beautiful, and the room was large. Jet ski rentals just steps from the property. Got free Miami Herald and New York Times every day. CONS: The hotel needs a lot of work, and my room clearly needed to be repainted and repaired. There was also no light in the shower, and there is no safe in the room, although there are safety deposit boxes in the lobby. I was also surprised that there was no CNN in the room, but 4 or 5 sports channels. If you are just looking to relax by the pool and beach, be warned that there is construction at the properties on both sides of this hotel, which was very loud in the mornings and afternoons. There was also a loud truck doing some kind of work on the beach. NOTE: This place is part of hotel row, so there are no eating/shopping options within walking distance. You'd have to walk about 8 blocks to 41st street and then across the bridge to find anything. That means if you don't have a car, and don't want to walk, you're stuck paying the high prices on the property. However, if you do have a car (parking is very expensive), you have in  out privileges and have the ability to call ahead to have your car waiting for you when you get downstairs. The staff was usually good about this.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great place to stay on a budget! Read the previous reviews of the hotel and booked it a few weeks in advance. We got a superb rate and also a resort credit to use while we were there. Got in super late due to a delayed flight but had no problems checking in. If you have heavy bags be prepared to carry them up the grand stairs in front of the hotel- no ramps! We got a room on the 4th floor and although the hallway did not smell the greatest our room was fine. It was not one of the renovated one's and the decor was a bit outdated. Room was very spacious and had plenty of room to put our stuff and spread out. The only complaint would be the paper thin walls. We might as well have shared a room with our neighbors- they could hear us cough and we heard them screaming at each other at 3am. Other than that, the resort is spectacular. The pool area is great, the chairs are super comfortable. Beach access is steps away and the view is beautiful. We ate the buffet breakfast one morning in the dining room and it was outstanding. We also had drinks and snacks at the pool/beach bar and the service was great (drinks were a little weak.) All of the employees were very nice and always helpful. We called to book the reservation and asked about the location- they said we were a short walk from the South Beach craziness and restaurants-- not true. The resort is on Collins Ave but a good 10-15 blocks from South Beach and not a safe route to walk. A cab down to Ocean Blvd runs about 10-12 bucks so it's not bad, The only thing around the resort are condos and construction so there is nothing else close to the resort that you can walk to.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Run Down...Go Elsewhere I'd give this a 1 star rating, but there were some pluses. My room did overlook the ocean, which was great. The view was awesome. And the beach access couldn't be easier. That's about it for pluses. You could get both of those (ocean view and beach access) at MUCH better hotels closer to the action of South Beach. I echo what the last reviewer said as he was dead on. The rooms do look like a grandma decorated them. Everything in the room looks old. He's right, stained comforters, carpet and chairs made me not want to even sit down. Again, to echo what the last reviewer said, if you value cleanliness and comfort in a hotel room, don't stay here! It is misleading because the web site makes it look like a posh hotel, and it's anything but. The toilet barely worked...Had to press it a couple of times before it flushed, and my phone didn't work at all. The one near my bed wasn't even plugged in, and it could not be because there was no jack. Nice prop. The one in the bathroom could receive calls, but you couldn't dial out because the number were broken. The room and closets smelled of mildew, and the location was not the best. It's about a 10 min drive from where you want to be in South Beach. Pool is nice, but you loose sun at about 3pm because the hotels block it out. Front staff is very unfriendly unless you speak Spanish. I had problems with my bill all weekend, and I had to keep going down there so they'd fix it. They were rude even though they were in the wrong. Way too expensive for what you're getting. Trust me, it's and old and worn out hotel. There are heaps more hotels to stay at that are better in South Beach.</p></li>

<li>Front <span style="background-color:#ffd8b1" title="p=0.999">staff</span> is very unfriendly unless you speak Spanish.</br></br></li>
<li>I had problems with my bill all weekend, and I had to keep going down there so they'd fix it.</br></br></li>
<li>They were rude even though they were in the wrong.</br></br></li>
<li>Way too expensive for what you're getting.</br></br></li>
<li>Trust me, it's and old and worn out hotel.</br></br></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great beach, very decent hotel My wife and I stayed here over the weekend in late March, and had a very nice time. The hotel itself is fine - there's some elegance to it, and the public spaces are clean and nice enough. It's close to being a luxury property but doesn't quite make it -- it's hard to put your finger on it, but the rooms and lobby seem just a touch run down. Gym was much better than the average hotel gym. Pool area was clean and decent with lots of chairs, and the poolside Seabreeze restaurant was very solid. Best part of the property without a doubt was the beach, which was not only relatively uncrowded (due to the fact that there's no other resorts immediately adjacent to it), but very pretty - long stretches of white sand, and great views up and down the beach of the colorful condos and resorts. The resort is located a few miles north of South Beach and the only other name resorts in the area (about 300 yards away) are the Eden Roc and the Fountainbleu - both of which have more and better restaurants than the Wyndham. Definitely plan on leaving the resort for dinner - while the dinner restaurant (in the lounge) is charming, the menu is very limited and not that creative. Aquatica at the Eden Roc was very good with really nice seafood selections. Note: if you haven't joined Wyndham by Request, do so. We checked in and were upgraded to a 2 room suite in a corner room just for being avid members - in addition to a welcome basket of amenities that are part of our profile. They also allowed us to keep the second room until 6 PM so we had a place to shower. It's stuff like this that make's Wyndham's loyalty program one of my favorites.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Worst Experience Ever-AVOID AT ALL COSTS This hotel is not what it seems. When I looked up the hotel online the pictures were very deceiving. They only showed pictures of the best areas. When we arrived we were greeted by the valet which is the only way to park there and they charge $22 a day. The valet was not vey polite and there was no bell service outside. The front desk staff was polite but not professional. We asked the bellman in the lobby for help with a luggage cart and he said he was busy and that we could take the luggage cart up and bring it back down. I believe he was the only bellman working for an 18 story hotel. We finally get to the room and the room smelled like mold and smoke and the bedding was old and faded. There was a used glass laying on the floor, the roll of toilet paper was almost gone, and there were also stains on the walls. We were running late for an event so we left and returned at around 12:30am. We go back to the room and get into bed and we immediately started itching and started getting bitten by bed bugs. We called down to the front desk and asked for a manager. She told us to old on while she tried to find another room but she put us on hold and never came back. At this point we were fed up and decided to leave at almost 2am. On the way out we stopped at the desk and complained and asked for a refund but they refused and the girl at the desk had a horrible attitude. We had already called down for the car to be pulled around 20 minutes prior and still had to wait another 15-20 minutes outside. The valet staff this time was also rude. I would never stay at this hotel again. I have had 10 times better service and quality at hotels cheaper. It is not what it seems.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Little Shabby, Little Chic I just returned from a three night stay at the Miami Beach Resort  Spa for a professional conference. The hotel employee who took my reservation honored the specially negotiated group rate a couple of weeks before my arrival, although the group rate deadline had expired. I was pleased at the nice gesture, until I visited the hotel's web site and learned that I could have done slightly better on the rate by booking online instead! It certainly pays to do a bit of web surfing before calling the hotel directly for reservations. When I arrived at 1:30 in the morning, the desk clerk changed my room to a corner room with a great view (nice!). The room had recently been painted, and there were new linens to give the room a lift. The room was generally clean, but there were major water/mildew spots underneath the sink.It is clear that hotel management is trying to keep things presentable without investing too much money. The carpeting is old and dated with wild floral patterns on each guest floor and in the conference rooms. The knobs on the closet doors in the guest rooms look like they date to the 1950s. There are major cables and wires visible underneath the guest desks. This hotel, I am sure, was once a major showplace, as evidenced by the marble in the lobby and elegant crystal chandeliers. It has seen better days, though, and needs major updating.On a positive note, the staff is very friendly. The desk staff is wonderful, and the waiters at the Hibiscus Court (wonderful breakfast spot) are a delight. Also, as someone who enjoys her newspapers, I greatly enjoyed getting a complimentary copy of the Miami Herald AND the New York Times delivered outside my door early every morning.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Will never stay here again...EVER In Miami for the first time for a wedding. The bride suggested this hotel as a more reasonably priced option for accomodations. I will NEVER come here again and even considered changing hotels. However, since we were in town for only 3 nights, with most time spent with family and friends for wedding activities decided not to. Especially since we'd have to pay rack rates anywhere else with such last minute notice.PROS: - Close to the wedding ceremony and reception location- Cheap (you totally get what you pay for though)- Food wasn't too bad. We had breakfast one morning and lunch at the Seabreeze cafeCONS:- Quite remote. No place to even walk to if you wanted a cup of coffee or snack elsewhere. We had to eat at the hotel or jump in a cab to go to Lincoln road or Ocean drive. Cab cost us around $15 each way- Horrible service. After long delays getting in we finally arrived exhausted around 10:30pm. At least 5 staff members watched me try to drag my heavy suitcase upstairs to the reception area. Only when I got to the top did they ask me if I needed help with the bags. Generally, found the staff to be very aloof and not at all helpful.- Accomodations were appalling. The room needed major renovations. The carpet was filthy and the bed was hardly inviting at all. Seriously, the worst pillows I've ever slept on - old and flat. Mattress was hard as a rock. Bathroom was dark and dank and the sink and tiles needed replacing.- Pool was old and dated. Didn't even want to jump in with my swimsuit or even laze out by the pool.Even though we saved some money at this place, it totally wasn't worth it. I felt stressed and uncomfortable the entire time I was there - didn't feel like it was a vacation at all.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Awful experience I am staying at the Miami Beach Resort and Spa for a conference. My husband is coming to meet me at the end of the conference, and we are staying to enjoy the weekend in Miami. Originally our plan was to stay at the conference hotel, but we are moving as soon as the conference is over. The accommodations here are below par, and the service is worse! It began with the check-in process. I was told although I reserved a king bed with a bay view, they only had double beds available. In order to get a king bed, they downgraded me to a partial water view. It is partial because there is a construction high-rise site blocking the water. There was no apology or explanation as to why they didn't have the room I booked available, and then I had to wait 3 hours before my room was ready. They knew they had a conference coming in of about 400 people, yet rooms weren't ready for hours. In checking with the front desk periodically on the status of my room, I asked to speak to a manager who was incensed that I wasn't happy that my room had been changed and that I was waiting hours for it. From her behavior, I realized why the other front desk staffers weren't friendly or accommodating - they have no example or reason to be. The pictures on the website are misleading. The room is very outdated, and you can't depend on hot water when taking a shower. Also, when I ordered room service for dinner, I began my order saying that I'd like some lobster bisque. The voice on the other end interrupted me asking, By some lobster bisque, do you mean one bowl or three bowls? What exactly do you want? Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend staying here. There are plenty of other places to stay with friendlier staff and superior accommodations for around the same price point. Being stuck here for four days is certainly a disappointment.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Mixed results Our experience was really a mixed bag. Check-in started off fine - the initial impression of the outside and the lobby is very good. The rooms, however, are VERY tired. We had a problem getting a suitable room - our original suite had the wrong bed type, so we spent some time trying to find an alternative. The agent that helped us was very helpful, but I had to suggest the possible solutions to him. If I hadn't worked in hotels for 16 years, I might not have known what to ask. In the process, we saw 2 other rooms - worn furniture, an outlet cover dangling from the wall, dirty carpet, etc.Housekeeping as a whole seems to suffer. Some crumbs that my son dropped on the floor after check-in on Thursday were still there on Sunday. I had to carefully police my youngest poolside as she kept finding used straws and cigarette butts. And this was first thing in the morning, when you would think the trash would not have had time to accumulate yet.The front desk and driveway were overwhelmed at times as the hotel was very busy. Just an observation - this can happen at any hotel really.Room service - we used it for breakfast all 3 mornings. Food on days 1 and 2 was excellent. On day 3, the potatoes were not fresh at all. We ordered the same thing all 3 days. Time to receive food and come pick up the table was very good. The servers were all very nice and professional as well.The blackberry mojitos at the bar are awesome!The pool itself is very nice, and the kiddie pool is nice for families. You are also very close to the beach, which was nice and clean, though not maintained by the hotel.The hotel was a Wyndham, which then turned into a LXR resort, whose parent company is now in the process of merging with Hilton. I think through all this upheaval, things are taking some time to get into place. Hopefully, the rooms will be renovated or at least touched up soon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The best of the best for discerning clientel I just got back about a week ago from a function that my company held at the Wyndham Miami Beach Resort. My firm, one of the most respected law firms in the country, always puts a great deal of effort in to the selection process when determining the location of our retreats. The last few years, for instance, were held at the Biltmore, a Ritz Carlton, and a Four Seasons. This hotel surpassed my expectations ten fold. The facilities, staff, and location are all superb. My flawless stay led me to do some research on the resort's history- and as indicated in previous reviews, the hotel began as the legendary Doral on the Ocean in Miami Beach's golden era. The hotel continues to attract some of the world's most discriminating clientel, and the exclusivity of this hotel which underwent a recent merger with Wyndham makes your stay very exciting. Beautifully decorated formal public areas and guest rooms are second to none, as they were conceived by the renowned Tom Lee- famous for decorating homes and hangouts of the world's elite. Apparantly, the hotel is home to one of the most valuable collections of furniture and furnishings in America, which is easy to believe when you meander the property gazing at the artwork, statuary, crystal lighting, and other details. Also got to enjoy the cabanas, pool, and beach. Consistent with the rest of the property, they were all wonderful.You are sure to love your room, as all feature floor to ceiling windows that span the width of the room and showcase waterviews from all rooms- yes ALL rooms. The appointments and subtle touches that abound are sure to make an impression.Overall, you are sure to enjoy your stay at the Wyndham Miami Beach Resort (aka Doral). The property is beyond what you can possibly imagine, enhanced by a caring, trained staff ready to make your stay most memorable. I would not write a review if I was not entirely impressed. You, too, will find your stay most satisfying! -Sy</p></li>
