<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The location was great, close to restuarants and just enough off of the Miracle Mile that you don't feel under the swarm. Parking is $42 a night, well within the market price for downtown chicago, but an amount that will need to factor into your budget.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Went for the weekend with my 78 year old mom and my husband. We needed a suite hotel and this fit the bill. The free breakfast was very good. Not gourmet, but lots of healthy options. The 24 hour coffee bar in the lobby was also a great perk. The room was nice and having a large refrigerator was great. If I needed a suite, I would stay again. Also, good location.</p></li>

Comfortable and exceptionally clean rooms. Definitely would recommend this hotel and we will stay at this location again. Harry Caray's is across the street, great Chicago retaurant.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I selected this hotel based largely on the overwhelmingly positive reviews on TripAdvisor. I think that maybe my expectations were a little too high. Don't get me wrong: we had a positive experience and paid a great weekend rate. However, i was not overwhelmed by the experience. We found it to be typical of any other Residence Inn. The location is great. The staff was friendly at front desk. Staff was almost non-existent in the breakfast buffet. Again, positive experience but not memorable!</p></li>

We did like having the lobby not at ground level as we could sit around safely and look down at the streets. Their was also a great Eisteins Bagle Restaurant that you can access without going outside! My kids only comment is they wished there would have been Disney Channel or Nick on the TV!</p></li>

Staff were great, friendly and helpful and the breakfast, although simple, was just what we needed to get our day off to a good start.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed in quite a few hotels downtown Chicago but this is definitely one of my most pleasant stays. The rooms are clean and new, but what really took me back was the friendliness of the staff. Every time you see a staff member, they ask you how your stay is going and how your room is and if they can do anything, even if they just run into you in the elevator! The hot breakfast was as good as any breakfast diner in Chicago and the hearth room is comfortable and inviting. I would definitely stay here again!</p></li>

The customer service of the staff was 5 star- incredibly friendly! The rooms were updated and modern and very clean. The housekeeper kept everything clean and stocked and even folded our clothes and lined up our shoes. The location was great- every restaurant and just a few blocks to State Street shopping and also Michigan Ave. Also right next to the river. Millenium Park was also an easy walk.

She worked harder than any waitress I've seen, yet probably rarely gets tips. We tipped her - I hope others will remember to do this too, those folks certainly deserve it. Do NOT get this hotel with PriceLine. They quoted one rate on the internet and when we called them 2 minutes later, they jacked that rate up by $40.00. Do not use them!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our first time at this Residence Inn and our weekend stay was great. We know the area well. We love all the action in the River North section of town. The room was large with a bedroom, sitting room and kitchen. It was super clean with all the amenities. We had five people in the sitting room for a visit and we could have held 5 more. The price was very reasonable (even though Chicago rates are getting pretty high). A great quality to price ratio. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful without getting "in your face". We'll definitely be back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have gone to Chicago many times. The trip before this one, I stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker and as far as comparisons goes, this hotel is just as good if not better. It is located a short walk from the Mag. Mile and the Chicago nightlife/resturants (Harry Carey's and Ruth's Chris are right across the street). The hotel staff was very friendly and the rooms are great (I had the King Studio Suite). The best part was that I had a nice kitchen for when I was entertaining *guests*. If you are looking for exceptional service with a good price, this is the place to stay</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from 3 nights in this hotel with my sisters. We went for an Oprah taping, which was a 10 minute taxi ride from the hotel. The hotel is in an excellent location, with lots of restaurants in walking distance (Harry Caray's Steakhouse is across the street). The room was very clean and comfortable. Stainless appliances in the well-stocked kitchen. Breakfast was included and was one of the best ones I've had - waffles (which Isme, the friendly server made for us), eggs, sausage, potatoes alond with muffins, cereal, fruit and yogurt. Would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We travel to Chicago every year for a convention. The hotel in which we usually stay was full so we picked this instead. We were not disappointed. The staff was friendly, the rooms were clean, and the location is great. We had to use the services of Colleen, the night engineer, after one of us got very sick in the bathroom. She handled the problem with professionalism and tact. No review of this hotel would be complete without mentioning the breakfast hostess. She is attentive, cheerful, and readily admits that she loves all of her guests. You'll leave breakfast with a smile on your face.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Amazing! That is the only word I can think of to describe the friendliness and professionalism of Ismeta. My daugther fell in love with her in just the few days we were there. She always wanted to make sure we were taken care of at breakfast. The one morning she knew we were travelling and got us cereal to go. The facilities are very clean. Pool and hot tub are a little small, but nice view from the 27th floor. Location is extremely convenient to nearly anything you would want to do. I highly recommend this hotel if you are travelling with family and want to be close to River North / Magnificent Mile area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a fairly standard Residence Inn in terms of decor (which isn't always the nicest), but it was relatively up to date and very clean. It was better than all other Residence Inns I've stayed. I had a large suite which is rare in such a big city, for the cost. Had a great corner room view, and its very close to everything downtown. I don't think you can do better at the 200$ price point. Like most Residence Inns, there isn't room service, but you do have a small little store downstairs with snacks and a full kitchen in the room. They had an evening happy hour with free beer (just pitchers of Miller light) and buffet type food.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I went to Chicago for game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals and stayed at the Residence Inn Downtown/River North. We stayed for 4 nights and it was a perfect spot. Breakfast (which is included) was hot and plentiful every morning. Staff was always friendly and helpful. Cleaning of the room was great. My only complaint (and this is not of the hotel) is the hotel is located around the corner from the fire hall and we did hear alot of sirens. However we did not hear any noise from within the hotel. Great restaurants and shopping all within walking distance. We only took a cab to the hockey game. Can't go wrong with this choice</p></li>

We enjoyed our one night stay and checked out he next day at 11 or so. Gave the card to the clerk and asked if everything is okay with our check out...he said "you're all set". To our dismay, the hotel charged us for both nights and proceed to send us an invoice indicating that we have checked out at 12:59 the second day.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My sister-in-law, two nieces and I had a fabulous stay at the Residence Inn on N Dearborn in Chicago (building is shared with SpringHill Suites)! The entire staff (front desk, housekeeping, bell desk, "Gatehouse" buffet... EVERYONE) was friendly - always greeted us with a smile and very willing to go out of their way to assist us. The rooms were clean and well maintained (hotel appears to be new), the breakfast buffet offered a HUGE variety of hot and cold items, and the evening cocktail hours and dinners exceeded expectations. Our room was pleasantly quiet - didn't hear hallway traffic or neighbors. I've traveled extensively for business - this is one of the best experiences I've ever had!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Everything was great overall. We rode the Megabus to Chicago to attend a concert, so our trip was very short. But location-wise, this hotel was perfect for us. A quick cab ride from Union Station (maybe even walk-able in the the summer) and a quick cab ride to the club. The room (basic studio w/ king bed) was clean and spacious - large enough for 4 people to hang out comfortably! Wi Fi was free, as was the breakfast, always a nice bonus. Breakfast had a nice mix of hot choices (make your own waffle, eggs, etc) and grab n go choices (bagels, yogurt, fruit, cereal). The service & staff were all nice and very helpful. I was extremely impressed with what we got for the price - outstanding value!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We usually stay at Residence Inns because we like the convenience of a kitchen, and the fact that they have great breakfasts. Those items did not disappoint in this stay. The location is great, within easy walking distance of great restaurants and shopping. Vallet parking is pricey, but so easy. The fitness center was nice and the guest laundry convenient. The minor issues we had included a broken closet door, and the fact that the tv included only basic cable channels with just one movie station. Being February, being able to chose and enjoy a movie in our warm room would have been nice. Otherwise, everything was clean and everyone was friendly, as we have come to expect from Residence Inns.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A very good stay at this Residence Inn. The location is right in the middle of Chicago with plenty of variety for shops, entertainment and culture. The rooms were a step up from the normal Residence Inn quality, more modern and trendy, having been done in the last few years I would guess. Very comfortable and clean, with all the added convenience you get in a RI hotel - fridge, microwave, hobs, etc. We got a great view, but I imagine some of the lower rooms (we were 19th) might just be of the building across. I stayed using rewards points so I can't comment on value for money I'm afraid. The one drawback was that a ton of families seemed to be staying there and breakfast was an absolute madhouse.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived in Chicago and stayed the first night in Hilton Garden Inn and was not impressed at all. The next day we went to Residence Inn and it was the total opposite experience. The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. Even though they were extremly busy they worked fast and efficiently to get everyone to their rooms. The room was spotless and everything was just so cozy and comfortable. The kitchenette is so great to have because Chicago has some great places to eat and you can bring your food back to store and reheat it. The bed was comfortable and the chaise lounge was even better to just kick your feet upon. I would recommend this hotel for the staff, price, location and cleanliness anyday.</p></li>

We are used to stay in Marriott's hotels but this one is really a must. All the staff is helpfull and everybody seems to be happy to work here, the mood is so positive. The room was bright, clean, well exposed ( we had a corner studio) and with all you need to feel "like home" The spa on the roof is fantastic. We like everything execpt we would like to see more channels on TV (Comedy or HGTV are our best and we were a little bit desapointed not to have them !). We really enjoy our stay. The hotel is near from everything (good gospel brunch at 2min, good music in Blue Chicago at 5 min, good restaurant at Keefer's just in front...)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I do not have one bad thing to say about our stay here. Probably the only tthing close to a complaint is the elevators can take a while sometimes. The hotel is centrally located. we took the Blue Line from O'Hara and only walked a few blocks. We were also able to catch the CTA buses close by. Lots of eats close by too. We were here for the marathon and were able to get around town just fine. One exceptional point sounds a bit goofy, but the lady that is in charge of the breakfast here is awesome! there is plenty of good food and she says hi to literally everyone in this busy dining area. The hotel also hosts happy hours regularly with food and beverages. Could very well substitute for a dinner in most cases.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a great location (easy to get to from the 'el') and right in the middle of lots of restaurants, bars, and hotels. All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. People that were staying for longer periods of time seemed to actually know the staff on a first-name basis. The gym facilities were very nice, the room itself was very clean and comfortable, and the food provided was more than decent. There was even a complimentary "social hour" with food, beer, and wine. Probably a feature of all residence inns, my room had a full kitchen (including dishes, cooking utensils and dish soap). Overall, this place was cheaper than anything else I looked at in the area, and was extremely comfortable.</p></li>

Pool, awesome hot tub, fitness room, great laundry and fast elevators!. Hard line and wireless internet too! Great staff service and hospitality and the ladies doing the breakfast and the social are top notch, especially Ismeta! The breakfast is later than most hotels but Ismeta went out of her way to be sure I didn't leave empty handed! The manager's social is pretty basic with salad, crackers, cheese, cold cuts, chicken salad and once they even had lasagna, but the staff was great! The TV channel selection is the absolute pits but the rooms are very nice and fully equipped. The doormen and desk staff are all very helpful and friendly too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for two nights with our 2 1/2 month old and it was great. Our room had plenty of space to spread out in, great furniture and lighting, and free wired and wireless internet. Everything was very clean and it was great to have a kitchen to use for dinners. The staff was so friendly and helpful and the hot breakfast (eggs, sausage, potatoes, oatmeal plus all the normal continental stuff) was a nice perk. The pool is on the 27th floor and has great views over the city, they also have a nice exercise room up there and a laundry facility. The only thing I would warn about is that it's about a 10-15 minute walk to get to Michigan Ave, which for us with a baby made it difficult to get out and shop a lot. Overall a great hotel!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I took my husband to Chicago for his birthday. I chose Residence Inn because of the reviews on tripadvisor, the location and of course the price! We definitely were not disappointed. The rooms were spacious, the breakfast was amazing, there were several restaurants and bars within walking distance and the staff was very helpful. We were provided with information on restaurants, bars and sight-seeing activities from the front desk. We even ordered pizza and had it delivered using one of the computers in the lobby (free internet) after a night out (we ordered online because the front desk informed us that we would get a discount). We had an unbelievable time in Chicago and couldn't have asked for a better place than Residence Inn!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed one night with 3 kids (13, 13, 11) and our dog. We got two interconnecting rooms because anything else was just too small. The rooms are modern well fitted. The staff were great, especially the lady that makes the waffles in the breakfast room, she's great. My only issues were (1) $100 fee for dog, where typically it is only $75 atna Residence Inn, and (2) the hotel is not as close to Navy Pier as we expected. Turns out that we decided to drive to Willis Tower and Navt Pier because it was a bit far to walk and no good public transport options as far as we could see with quick research. A better prepared travel may know better... But still I would be tempted to stay closer to Navy Pier next time.. Fun there for the kids.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent our 25th anniversary the past weekend in this fabulous hotel. You can tell the staff has been trained on customer service. EVERYONE from the desk clerks to the guy running the vacuum in the hall stops what they're doing when you pass, smile, and greet you with SINCERITY, not some fake sense of having to. When they discovered it was our anniversary they upgraded us to a corner/king room. Typical of Marriott, the beds were comfortable and pillows just as good as home. I've NEVER stayed at a hotel like this that you thought you had NO neighbors as there was no sound travel whatsoever. The hotel was spotless and looked VERY recently renovated. The management and staff of this property should be very proud of what they've built.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay this past weekend was our second at this hotel. We selected it last year based upon its excellect ratings by prior guests, and it lived up to its reviews. It is rated similarly to hotels for which you would pay a much higher price. I echo other reviewers, the staff makes a big difference --- from the time you pull up and are greeted by the doorman to your checkout when the front desk staff asks when they will get to see you again, and seem to mean it. As has been said, the breakfast is not gourmet, but what a treat to have a hot breakfast included with a big city hotel stay. And the staff insists upon making your waffle for you, and bringing it to your table --- again, just those little touches. They will see us again our next stay in Chicago.</p></li>

We have been treated like Queens by the Residence staff from housekeeping all the way up to the General Manager, Jerry. We fly into O'Hare, hop on the train, walk a couple blocks and we at the hotel. Beyond perfect spot for shopping and dining. We look forward to coming back every year, and so pleased when the GM recognizes us year after year. The Managers reception was the big hit for us this past visit....we played Bingo, ate dinner, and had drinks....all complimentary of staying at the Residence Inn. Our room is immaculate with spectaular views of downtown Chicago. Thanks again Residence Inn....cant wait till next year to return. Joyce and Julie</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I go to Chicago several times a year. We always stay at a Marriott near Michigan Ave. This is by far our new favorite. We have stayed there twice. The rooms are great, with kitchenettes so we can bring in food if we want. They serve breakfast every morning, included in the room price. The woman running the breakfast is so sweet. She greets everyone and treats them like family. I saw her helping a child fix his waffle. She gave us a huge welcome back even though she only saw us once months before. The location is great for us, about 5 short blocks from the red line. Last visit there was a snow storm on our last night there so we checked out the evening social time. We were able to have a simple meal without having to brave the storm. We will return next visit to Chicago.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We wanted to spend a week exploring Chicago for fun, found a good rate for this hotel which had good reviews, and we were not disappointed. The staff was friendly and helpful, the room was nicely appointed, the bed comfortable, and it was quiet except for one night when neighbors had a 2:00 A.M. party (not the hotel's fault). We had a studio type room, with well-supplied kitchen, table with chairs, couch and arm chair, coffee table and bed tables and lamps on both sides of the bed (important for readers like us). The bath had only a shower (with a great shower head), but no tub, but we don't usually use a tub when traveling anyway. There was not a lot of counter space around the sink but there were a drawer and two shelves, and it worked out well. Bountiful breakfasts and good evening "snacks" (really full meals with salad) on week nights.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Residence Inn Chicago Downtown/River North for a week and we were extremely happy with our choice! Had a corner room with a lovely city view, comfortable bed, nice furnishings, always clean, and very quiet! The only minor inconvenience was very limited counter, drawer, and closet space for a room that size (we were in a 'larger' suite). The full breakfast included was wonderful, with a cheerful Bosnian lady making waffles. The evening reception was nice as well...great for a relaxing glass of wine and light snack before heading out for the evening. The staff members were all very cordial and pleasant and greeted us warmly every time we walked thru the hotel. The location is perfect! Close to everything and we easily walked everywhere.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have been to downtown Chicago many times, usually staying at either the Residence Inn near the Magnificent Mile or the Marriott....no more!!! This hotel is wonderful. I had a free certificate from the Marriott Credit Card and even though the stay was free they were beyond friendly and accomdating. I am a Gold Member with Marriott and will not stay anywhere else for business or pleasure. The staff is amazing, its clean, modern, great location and the rooms are outstanding. The hotel is connected to a Springhill Suites as well. The valet staff is very nice as well as the bell hops and the front desk staff went out of their way to assist me. The hotel was very quiet and solid. I recommend this hotel to anyone. I work and live south of the city and we went to town for dinner and drinks and hanging out. I also recommend the restaurant near the Palamor Hotel called Sable, nice place with unique twists on American food.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here 4 nights during a business trip to Chicago. Excellent customer service...all staff we encountered were very friendly and accomodating, from the doormen to the front desk to housekeeping. The one bedroom suite was modernly furnished with couch/chair, desk and dining table. Kitchenette was fully stocked with clean dishes and utensils. Plenty of space for 2 people to spread out and be comfortable. Room was very clean and quiet (other than random "city" noises, sirens, etc). Breakfast was great and included scrambled eggs, waffles, cereal, fruit, etc. There is a CVS about a block away if you want to stock up on snacks, bottled water, wine, etc. Lots of good restaurants nearby also. Great location, within walking distance of Millenium Park, Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier. Didn't need our car during the entire stay, just walked or took taxis. Valet parking was $44 a day. Will stay here again during next visit to Chicago.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel during a business trip. Service was impeccable. Bianca and the other staff members at the front desk were very helpful, friendly and ready to answer any questions with a smile! Located centrally, you're walking distance to everything from great restaurants, shopping and night life. All main attractions and museums are just minutes away. Taxi's are abundant, but since everyting is walking distance, they're rarely needed. All ameneties such as pool, gym, pool and spa are available. Breakfast is included in the rate and complementary drinks are served during the evening. Internet is free. A fully equipped kitchen provides convenience for those who prefer to dine in. A small market area in the main lobby provides any necessities or food items you'd like. The rooms are very affordable and offer a breathtaking view of Chicago downtown. Be sure to reserve a 1 bedroom suite. Leave the curtains open and take in the view!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed at a number of Residence Inns this past year and many other Marriott hotels. I traveled with my family over the holidays to Chicago and Residence Inn with the suite concept is the only way to go. I read some reviews about the lady who works the breakfast area, and all of them had positive things to say. I would completely agree with all the reviews. The lady was extremely personable and very interactive with all the guests. If she could help you in any way, she did. One morning, toward the end of the breakfast time, she went table to table checking on all the patrons and even started to deliver stuff to people. She was amazing. The managers should give her a raise, because I would return to the hotel just because of her treatment of the guests. On my two interations with the front desk staff, they were very cheery and provided for a positive experience. The room was very clean and quiet. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was very impressed with this Residence Inn. Staff was WONDERFUL. From housekeeping who went out of there way to provide us with something they did not have in stock, to the front desk who offered some free candy to my tired young traveling children (traveled from CA with young children), to the hotel manager, Jerry Keyes, who greeted us kindly during one of the free happy hour meals and asked us how our room was. I was impressed because he was right there helping his staff and very cordial to his guests. The room was excellent (room 2005), decorated nicely and very clean. The kids enjoyed the indoor pool on the top floor. The location is outstanding (close to Navy Pier, shopping- if you like to walk- you could definitely walk to Art Institute- we did it with our three kids). Harry Cary's across the street- yummy food. LOTS of food choices. We had a nice time and felt very comfortable here. This experience causes me to lean towards Marriott when I plan travel for my family. Thank you!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was fantastic- clean rooms, walking distance to almost everything, great lobby, but has completely sold us with their amazing and friendly service. From the moment we pulled up, the staff was friendly and accomodating; they went out of their way to make sure we had a great stay. The valet came right up to our car, found someone to help with our bags, and sent us to the front desk, where they made check-in a breeze. Staff had the best reccomendations for dining and nightlife, and woman who handles breakfast for the guests was absolutely amazing. The staff absolutely sells the experience, and because of that alone, we are sure to make this our regular place to stay when visiting Chicago. Would be the perfect place to stay, whether you are staying alone for one night, or for a week with the family. The only single problem was that we and our friends (who were in another room) thought the rooms could get a bit hot/ stuffy, but easily relieved by cracking the window a bit. Great stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My most recent stay at the Residence was with my wife, however, I had previously stayed here on business trips also. The staff is very friendly and helpful and I've never had any cleanliness issues. Dinners are provided by the hotel on weekdays and the breakfast is much better than standard hotel fare. The location of this hotel is hard to beat, it's just north of downtown Chicago and the Chicago River. Access to the El is within walking distance as well as Michigan Avenue. The fitness center and pool are located near the top floor, offering a fantasic view. There is a parking garage attached to the hotel that is only $38 per day, which is cheaper than a lot of other hotels in the area. Since the garage is attached, I wouldn't recommend valeting at this particlar hotel. In-and-out access if provided with the daily fee. The rooms are spacious, as is standard in Residence Inn's. Each room has a small kitchen and living room area. Internet is offered for free on several computers in the lobby area.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently completed an extended stay at the River North Residence Inn. Over the years our family has stayed at a number of Marriott properties and on business I have personally stayed at a bunch of residence inns, for lengthy stays. This hotel was wonderful, from the clean, comfortable rooms and lobby, to the warm attentive staff. Given the length of stay and the location of the hotel we were concerned about noise but given we had a high facing room (recommended), we had no issues (and a nice view of the city). The morning breakfast was great and I have to call special attention to Ismeta, who has received much positive press on Tripadvisor, but is completely well-deserved. She is a wonderful person who made us feel so at home with her warm greeting, wonderful waffles for our daughter, and attentive service (which I have never expected in the morning at a self-service style breakfast. We would definetely return and recommend this hotel for both short and longer stays. A very well run property which deserves special recognition.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was a very good value when you factor in the cost and convenience of breakfast. Great convenient location. 1.5 blocks from the River. 2 blocks to the red line. 3 blocks to the free trolley pick-up to Navy Pier. Walkable location to everywhere, although most hotels in Chicago are pretty convenient. Pros Free hot breakfast. Does not change much day-to-day but it's free and decent! Breakfast staff was awesome. They encourage you to bring some food back for snacks later in the day. Pool was not luxurious, but available nonetheless. As with any Residence Inn, the convenience of home...refrigerator, stove, dishes, etc. Free internet. Worked for us. Cons Limited area to park in front of hotel. Does not have a hotel driveway. You basically park on the street and unload. Not very safe when you have little ones. You really don't need a car in downtown Chicago...public transportation is safe and has multiple options. We took the blue line back to the airport to get a car rental on the second half of our trip to avoid the parking fees.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here to celebrate my daughters and nieces birthdays and do an American Girl trip. Hotel worked well for us, we had two rooms with 5 adults and 4 kids. We booked here for location and the fact that there was a pool. Kids loved the pool, although we adults found it too cold. Rooms were fine, maybe a little on the worn side but very large. Wonderful breakfast was included and we took advantage of it both mornings. What we all found so lovely about this Residence Inn was the staff. They were amazing! The bell hop was so wonderful to us during our entire stay that one of the girls named her new Bitty Baby doll after him and another named her doll after the front desk attendant. My four-year-old niece woke up exceptionally early one morning and the breakfast had not been set up yet, however the staff went to the back and brought her out a bagel and juice. Super sweet at 5:45am!! The older girls like that there were games to play in the lobby, and my sister-in-law and I enjoyed a glass of wine all in a great setting. Found a great rate on the Marriott website, much better then on any of the travel sites.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just back from a wonderful visit to Chicago. Could not fault the Residence Inn in any way, the staff, the room, housekeeping, breakfast, evening meal/drinks reception (Mon-Thur) are all excellent, as is the Hotel's location for access to Clarke/Lake - blue line to O'Hare Airport and also for the sights. Incredibly easy to get around the city on foot from this fantastic hotel. Theater Land and the Magnificent Mile are only a very short distance away. The hotel was in great condition and very clean and tidy. The bed was also very comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. My wife and I were over in Chicago to celebrate my wife's birthday and we were very kindly given a free upgrade to a corner suite that had a lovely view of the city. We were also allowed to check out late as our flight back to Dublin was not until 7:15pm. A fantastic experience from start to finish and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting Chicago. We hope to be back in Chicago some time and we will be staying right here in the Residence Inn Downtown/River North. The gym is a real bonus and has a good view over the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our family of four (15 and 20 yr old kids) stayed here for a long weekend. Loved the location, and of course the standard Residence Inn ammenities of free full breakfast, in-room kitchen. Location is good - about a ten minute walk to Mag Mile, 15 minute walk to Navy Pier. Jewel and Whole Foods and Trader Joes are a five minute walk away. Movie theaters, etc are also in short walking distance. Exercise facility has about 12 machines (treadmill, bikes, eliptical trainer) as well as weights. Pool is small - splashing size. Nice view of city from the facility. We reserved an "extended studio" - larger than a regular studio, and requested a fold up bed. When we arrived, we were told that the hotel cannot provide fold-ups due to fire codes. so we made up a bed for 15 yr old son on the floor (pushing the small kitchen table and two chairs to the corner) using the couch cushion and an extra set of sheets/blankets. Be aware that when the sofa bed is extended, it meets the foot of the regular bed, so we crawled over each other all night when we had to get up. And with my son on the floor as well, there was precious little room to spare !</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Residence Inn, Chicago Downtown, River North, while my husband attended a conference. The hotel is very conveniently located to all public transportation and there are many restaurants within walking distance. The room was spacious, immaculate, with all amenities. All rooms are suites, with a large sleeper couch, arm chair, full kitchen. The full kitchen was a surprise. It had full-sized refrigerator, 2 burner countertop stove, microwave, all utensils. A full, hot breakfast is served daily as well a dinner Monday-Thursday. We expected a few hors d'oeuvres but one night had lasagna, salad, bread, wine or beer, dessert. The next night was chicken Caesar salad with all the other mentioned items. Having both breakfast and dinner would certainly save a family a lot of money! The hotel has an exercise room and indoor pool on the top floor, free access to internet in the lounge/dining area, a very comfortable lobby and helpful staff. It shares an entranceway with Springhill Suites, another Marriott property. I don't think the guests at Springhill have the manager's dinner included in their stay. I would definitely stay at the Residence Inn again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were in Chicago for a writers' conference, and I picked this hotel because we like Residence Inn and got a great AAA rate through the Marriott website. The hotel is located on Dearborn and was about 16 or so blocks from the convention hotel. Even though Chicago was COLD, we walked to the conference every day and didn't mind at all (not that that has anything to do with the hotel itself). However, because we walked to the conference, we were able to see the restaurants and attractions that are all close to the Residence Inn, which made it great. The hotel staff was wonderful in recommending good places to dine (Sullivan's offers a prix fixe for RI guests.) and things to see. The room that we had was a king, and it was very roomy. It was decorated very beautifully, although I question having white covers on the beds. The pillow cases and the quilt, while clean, were a bit dingy, which is what happens when you have everything white.

<li>The hotel is located on Dearborn and was about 16 or so blocks from the convention hotel.</br></br></li>
<li>Even though Chicago was COLD, we walked to the conference every day and didn't mind at all (not that that has anything to do with the hotel itself).</br></br></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Great for families with young children”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 4 nights at the Residence Inn River North in downtown Chicago with our 3 young children. It was a fanastic experience-my son said it was his favourite vacation ever. The hotel is brand new but the employees are definitely not rookies-everyone that we spoke to was polite, helpful and in a cheerful mood. The hotel was very clean. The included breakfast was abundant. The room was spacious and clean. Our children stayed in the living room on the pull-out couch and a cot without complaint. We used the exercise room and pool every day. The pool was a great afternoon activity before dinner when everyone was tired of walking around Chicago. The hotel's location is excellent. You can easily walk to the Magnificent Mile, the river, Millenium Park, the Sears tower and many other attractions. We parked our car and never used it the whole time we were there. There is a kitchen in each room but note that there is only a 2 burner cook top and not an oven. But there is a microwave. The grocery store-Jewel Osco, is within walking distance if you don't want to use the hotel's free grocery delivery service. All in all we had a great time and will definitely stay at the Residence Inn again in Chicago and other cities in the US.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Chicago Residence Inn, River North Downtown is fantastic!! We have nothing but praises to say about our stay there. Having a kitchen in our suite and breakfast ready for us every morning was wonderful. The kitchen helped tremendously with the kids because they were thirsty and hungry all the time. Also, I can't begin to tell you how wonderful it was having breakfast ready and waiting for us in the lobby area. It not only saved on time and trouble finding a place to eat but more so the convenience of it being right in your own hotel. Also, the selection of food was deliciously perfect. I will miss sharing the wonderful breakfast with my family every morning. The breakfast there left us with good memories. But even more I have to mention how the staff throughout the hotel was always so happy and cheerful to see us and help us with every little detail. We always received a cheery "good morning" and "hello" from everyone there. I never experienced so many happy people in one place at one time. Their cheerfulness helped us start and end our days with great happiness. Everything was very clean and well thought through. We would definitely stay again there in Chicago or in other states where they are located in the future.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This new Residence Inn was a great find in downtown Chicago! It is located on Dearborn, which just a short walk to Michigan Avenue and a couple blocks from the red line train station. First of all the hotel is brand new so everything is clean and in great condition. It is not clear on the website, but this is actually one large highrise hotel containing both a Residence Inn and a Spring Hill Suites (less expensive). The lobbies are one floor above street level and when you come out of the elevator the Residence Inn is on the right and the Spring Hill Suites is on the left. Both have their own check in, eating areas, etc with a shared mini-mart in the middle. The decor is modern and inviting. The weekend rate is significantly less than the weekday rate since this is a business hotel and it includes a full hot breakfast buffet which is hard to find in downtown Chicago hotels. This was the nicest Residence Inn kitchen I have seen: stainless steel appliances, granite countertops, etc... Free wireless internet service is also included. The bed is comfortable and there were two large flatscreen TV's. The doormen and breakfast staff were especially friendly. Within a block or so was House of Blues, Hard Rock Cafe, and Ruth Chris Steakhouse.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from a 2 night stay at the Residence Inn North Loop hotel in Chicago. We opted not to rent a car due to the pricey cost to park, and instead walked the city (with the occasional taxi when it was too cold/far). What a great property! Just across the river from all the downtown city sights. This building houses both the Residence Inn as well as the Springfield Suites. The lobby is one floor above street level - check in is separate for each hotel. We had a minor issue with the toilet during our stay and the maintenance man showed up almost instantly and made sure the problem was gone. He was very pleasant and surprisingly quick considering it's a 27 story building. Typical Residence Inn studio room, everything looked well kept. Our kids slept on the pullout sofa and had no complaints, though the studio is a little tight of course with the bed pulled out. Great view of the city out our window. We checked out the pool on the top floor - but didn't use it. Looked great, and surprised that no one was in it considering how many rooms are in the hotel. Breakfast was standard RI fare, with very friendly attendants making waffles on demand and adding chocolate chips to them on request! Would definitely return if we head back to Chicago!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Easy to get to from O Hare on the L. Blue line to Jackson, switch to red line (going north/Howard) and get off at Grand. Emerge from subway, walk couple of blocks and go left on to Dearborn....will be to your right, and its dual sign will be on your right, catty corner to Harry Caray's. Rooms new and well kept. Spacious. CLEAN! Our view of the garage wasn't great but it only has four sides, and someone gets the less city view side! Breakfast buffet is very nice and Ismata is the best. Friendly, hard working, diligent: my guess is that she will need to move up at Marriott--reminds me of my Algebra teacher who ended up running mathematics for an entire district--same hard working, pleasant demeanor. Hotel is in the middle of everything. Easily accessible to Magnificent Mile shopping (according to my credit card and family usage). We ate at Rockits when we first arrived (1/2 block away)...very good. There's a CVS a few blocks away for all the stuff you couldn't bring with you as a carry on....This is a prime example of placement of an excellent hotel in a great spot, in a great city. Try to do the City Running Tour, #1 on Tripadvisor....you can walk/run less than a mile to the BEAN. Then take the running tour. Go see a CUBS game--take red line and exit at Addison. Boom. You are there. Have a great trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked a corner suite and we were given a room on the 20th floor. I can't speak for other rooms, but ours was perfect. We had a great view of the city and the room was spacious and comfortable. The breakfast was great. They had a great variety to choose from. Being our first trip to Chicago, we wanted to eat out a lot but the last night, we had the free dinner. We were really suprised at all they had to offer. Almost wished we would have saved our money and ate there every night and just at lunch when we were out! Staff was really nice. The morning we were leaving, an employee helped us with all of our bags out of the hotel and helped us load all them in the cab. Before he knew the cab was out there, he offered to get us one ready. He was not a bellboy, just an employee working about getting on the elevator until he saw how many bags we had-he then offered to help us out. The ladies in the dining area were all really sweet too checking on us throughout our meals. I am so picky about cleanliness and I can honestly say, I could have eaten off the floors also, I wasn't afraid to get in the shower without my flip flops! We had some problems figuring out transportation around the city and sometimes wondered if we could have got a better location. However, the trade-off wouldn't have been worth it. We had a wonderful stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Residence Inn Chicago River North for 2 nights in Feb. while I had a business meeting. Self parking (at first confusing) turned out to be easy but costly-$40/night for in and out service. Check in was fast, and everyone from the door men and front desk to breakfast attendants were very friendly. We stayed in the King corner suite which was very big and clean. I love having a full size fridg with ice maker, plates, all kinds of glassware and utensils at our disposal. Except for the included breakfast we ate our dinners out and reheated leftovers for lunch. There is a full size coffee maker - if you're staying an extended time and love your coffee bring your favorite brand with filters. No tub but the shower is huge and spotless. Harry Caray's steakhouse is across the street and the House of Blues is just down the block. If you are looking at hotel/suites in downtown Chicago the Springhill Suites is actually in the same building (FYI). The pool looked nice but was loaded with kids on Sat night so didn't go in.. I booked this hotel 6 weeks in advance of our trip and kept checking prices. I ended up saving $100 when I checked online the night before leaving home and the price had dropped so I called the toll free number and they happily gave me the lower price. Great place to stay in Chicago I highly recommend it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I went to Chicago with our two kids ( age 7 and 4) and whenever possible stay at extended stay properties like RI or Homewood Suites etc... We love the extra room and free breakfast/reception I booked the trip for a Mon-Thurs stay and got a rate of $179 including valet parking which in Chicago is pricey. The room type I reserved was a King suite. We arrived and instantly loved the property and the area. The staff greeted us warmly and I was impressed with the lobby area. Our room was ready and immaculate. The king suites have a full kitchen - so great for bringing drinks, snacks, heating or reheating things. The bedroom was separate from the sitting area and has it's own tv. (a must have with kids!). The bathroom was spacious and very clean. We went to breakfast every morning - wide array of food offered and well attended to. It was crowded but that's to be expected. The managers reception were great with full meals provided and free wine/beer/soda. We didn't eat there but took some food back to the room. The staff was amazing -- I did not encounter one person without a smile or who was not willing to help. We have stayed at another RI in Chicago and the Homewood Suites but this was the best hotel of the three and would definitely stay again. ($179 with parking/free breakfast AND dinner in Chicago - best deal I've found in a long time!)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">While this hotel may not be located right in all the hustle and bustle of Michigan Ave., that is actually a good thing. The location still has plenty to offer - Harry Carey's across the street and more restaurants and bar/clubs less than 1/2 block away. One of the major pluses is parking. There is a "green" parking garage attached and we received a discounted rate for being guests of the hotel; every little bit helps in Chicago! We stayed in a "studio suite" which is basically a standard room with a kitchenette. There are only three of us and this was plenty of room. But no division (which I was aware of when I booked) and when the sofa bed was out, manuvering around was tricky. And while this is not solely a problem of the Residence Inn; I wish hotels would realize that whoever sleeps on the sofabed actually needs a good night sleep too - my 11 yro daughter dreads anytime she has to sleep on one. (And no, she's not the Princess of the Pea fame). But I digress. Breakfast is exceptionally busy but the wonderful lady who runs it (as of October 2011) is amazing! The weekday fare is better than the weekend with more variety and time for replenishing. But no matter what she greeted you like you lived there and tried to accomodate any way she could. Lastly, I felt the room was clean for the amount of traffic these rooms see. I would absolutely stay at the Inn again!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My sister and I and our 5 kids decided to spend the night in the city for our spring break adventure. I chose this hotel because I was able to get my employee rate for this particular weekend. I ended up getting 2 king bed studio suites. We were able to get them next to eachother at the end of a hallway, so we felt safe going in and out of the rooms. The rooms were nice enough. Clean and were very comfortable. The kitchen was clean and very modern. We were able to check in early and get settled. The front desk was very friendly, but forgot to explain to me that I needed my key to work the elevator to get to our room as well as to get back down to the lobby. No big deal, my kids figured it out for me! We tried to go swimming later that afternoon, but some kid decided to poop in the pool, so they had to close it for 4 hours. Although it's hard to get upset in a situation like that, some guy gave the poor maint guy a hard time. Oh well, can't control everything. The breakfast Sunday morning was a little busy, but they did good keeping the food coming and cleaning off the tables. They probably could have used another couple waffle makers, but everyone was patient and all was ok. The parking was very convenient and I felt safe going from the garage directly into the hotel. All in all, the hotel was very nice and met my expectations and I would definitely stay again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked a room for this hotel and got a great online rate. Since the rate was so low I did not expect much from this hotel and was worried because I turned down a popular (but expensive) 4 star hotel to stay here...I was completely wrong. First off this is a brand new hotel which means new sheets,furniture,kitchen,bathroom,lobby etc. The rooms were extremely clean, spacious, and impressive. I went during the middle of the week so not only did I receive a free hot breakfeast buffet in the morning, but a free dinner buffet at night,and to be honest the selection and food was excellent. The hotel also had free wifi in lobby and room, and also a free business center in case you forgot your laptop. They have an exercise room, pool and hot tub on the top floor overlooking the city (perfect after a long day). The one aspect of the hotel that stood out the most was the amazing service and friendliness of the employees. Each morning I was greeted, when I came back they welcomed me,when I needed help they knew exactly where everything was, when I needed extra towels and sheets it came to the door in less than 2 minutes!! This hotel makes most marriot hotels I stayed in seem like 2 star hotels.Each hotel I stay in I can find at lest one con (even if it is minor) but this hotel was 100% perfect! I will only stay at this hotel in Chicago, even if the rate is double of what I paid.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here with my husband for 3 nights from 24 October. Couldn't fault it. Had a one bedroom suite on 15th floor. None of problems others may have mentioned, wifi was excellent and free, lifts fast and as we were high up our situation was above the parking garage so had a reasonable view. This was the fifth Marriott we have stayed in over the last five weeks of a 12 destination trip in USA: three Courtyards and two Residences! Overall prefer the Residences as they give you the option to prepare meals which is something of a change when you're travelling around a lot.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I traveled to Chicago for our honeymoon. I was reluctant to stay at a Residence Inn because it wasn't the "feel" I was looking for. I thought I wanted an eclectic place with the Downtown Chicago feel. I have to say, I'm happy I didn't get my way. The entire staff from the bellman to the Managers were always so happy to see us return after a day out. It really made us feel special and welcome. Everyone at the hotel was so friendly and helpful....I'd love to name them all, but it would take too long! I will say this, Ismeta, the hostess at the breakfasts every morning is an amazing woman!! I agree with the person who said, she does NOT get paid enough!! We tipped her and I recommend that if you stay here, you do the same! Another person who was of great help and very friendly is Mike P, a bellman at the hotel! The entire front desk staff was friendly and helpful with helping us get around town and finding places to eat! (Lou Malnati's was a great recommendation!) The only complaint I have is the fire station around the corner....lots of 2:30 AM calls, but like the other traveler said, inside the hotel was quiet. We had a smaller suite, as we booked through expedia, I didn't care for the bathroom being right next to the bed, but because of booking we weren't able to upgrade. Having the kitchen was great and I have to say I'll stay here again when we visit Chicago. We took cabs and public transit but were able to walk to so many different places. Navy Pier and Michigan Ave were well within walking distance.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed for 4 night with my 10 year old son. We had a studio suite which was more than adequate, with a view of Harry Caray's for my son the Cub fan! The location was an easy walk from the orange line (from the airport), red line (to Wrigley), and Clark #22 bus line to get you almost anywhere else. I recommend this hotel for location alone. The Spring Hill Suites is actually attached and in the same lobby; our room was one door away from the Spring Hill. If you don't need a full suite / with kitchen, I think their rates are usually a little cheaper and you get the top notch location anyway. It was VERY crowded the weekend we stayed. One negative was that the elevators, as a result, seemed quite slow, and when we got one, it was inevitably crowded. The breakfasts were also quite crowded, it was hard to find a seat. Breakfast was just ok; i could have done with more variety of fresh fruit, and the bagels were kind of sweet and stale for a jersey girl. But it was certainly adequate for us, the coffee was good and my son loved the fresh made waffles. There was a big thunderstorm one night and the power was out for a bit. I received an email later apologizing for the inconvenience, which was a nice touch. Evidently some folks were without AC but we luckily weren't, at least that we noticed. Overall we enjoyed our stay, Chicago is an amazing city and so easy to get around. We never took a cab once. With kids, I recommend Ed Debevics, we also ordered pizza from Giordanos which was delivered right to the room. It was a great time!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I guess if I was with my family, for the price and location, this hotel can't be beat. However, as a business traveler (and self-proclaimed hotel snob), I will be going elsewhere (back to the Hyatt/Westin/Renaissance). Now, I'm not a big Marriott fan to begin with (I think the rooms tend to be old and dated), but I stayed here because everything else was sold out, and my company has a special rate with Marriotts. A special rate that went from $200 per night for 2 nights, to $219 when I said I would be only staying one night. Not sure what that was about; check in clerk barely gave me eye contact until she handed me the key. Not very polite and seemed put out at every dealing I had with her. Manager's reception was poor...cold french fries and chicken fingers. I feel bad for the families who were using this for their dinner. Manager was very friendly and perky, but no one else cracked a smile, except one quick one from the "beer pourer" when I had a lot of foam in my beer that she poured from a pitcher. Are you getting the picture? Many restaurant choices throughout the nearby area. Room was generally clean, except the shower that had a huge dirt stain on the shower floor--caked into the plastic. I'd rather pay for my internet, beer, hors' d ourvers, and stay in an inconvenient place than come back here...horribly disappointed, especially after all the great comments. Think twice before staying here, especially if you are a frequent business traveler (so much for my eliteness at Marriott--means nothing here-thought I would at least get a clean shower).</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a weekend trip to Chicago where we stayed at the Residence Inn Marriott. This hotel was newly updated with everything you needed for a great cost. We saw a show at the House of Blue which was a walk-able distance from our hotel. There were ample amount of restaurants, bars, shops, etc from the hotel as well. This hotel is in the heart of the city and very close to the river. The famous Harry Carey's restaurant/bar is directly across the street, which we went to twice! There is an Einstein Brother's Bagel's next door as well, which was convenient for snacks/coffee. All the rooms were suite style with a modern kitchen, sofa and chair, flat screen TV, bed and bath. The kitchen was not fully equipped, but had everything that was needed for a week: glasses, plates, bowls, wine glasses, pitchers, can opener, tupperware, etc. The continental breakfast was open early and was great!! They had multiple varieties of warm drinks (which were good while being in Chicago in Nov!) such as coffee, tea, hot chocolate, etc. There was a waffle machine (popular for the kids!), muffins, bagels, cereal, eggs, bacon, etc. This was one of the top free continental breakfasts we've had. The staff was friendly and helpful. They helped us with directions, getting taxi's, restaurant/bar suggestions, etc. One of the best things they did for us is be honest on what was a walk-able distance for us from the hotel versus needing a taxi. For the value, this was a great hotel. We plan on coming back to Chicago and staying here a second time. I would recommend this to anyone with kids and dogs (they have a pet program)!!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here with four friends. Since the rooms only have one bed and a sofa bed, we booked two rooms. Both rooms were booked on the same reservation, in hopes that we would be given adjacent rooms. The first person to arrive checked in and we were given rooms next door to each other, 904 and 906. Due to delayed flights, two of us arrived at nearly 2am, and picked up the keys for 904. My first thought upon walking in to room 904 was that it didn't look much like the pictures I'd seen on the website. But I was exhausted and just wanted a few hours of sleep before breakfast. The next morning I saw room 906, that my other friends were in. It was substantially larger, had more furniture, and looked exactly like the photos on the website. We were happy to have rooms next to each other, were only there for three nights, and spent most of our time out exploring, so we didn't complain about the rooms. Had I only booked one room and been given room 904, I wouldn't have realized the difference. But in booking two identical rooms on the same reservation, I expected to be given two identical rooms. It worked out okay for us. Since we only needed to use the sofa bed in one room, we had three people stay in the larger room (906). I don't think there would have been enough room to move around in the room if the sofa bed in 904 had been open. Overall, our experience was pleasant. Breakfast (especially the staff working breakfast) was fantastic. And the location was perfect for us. I would stay here again, if I could be guaranteed to get a room equal to 906. The pictures I've posted are of 904. 906 looks exactly like the rooms pictured on the Residence Inn website.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for 5 days with my 2 teenage sons. Overall, the hotel is nicer/newer/cleaner than other Residence Inns Iâ€™ve stayed at. We stayed in a studio suite, which was large enough for the 3 of us, though by day 5 we were starting to trip over each other. We really enjoyed having a fully equipped kitchen and laundry facilities. The only disappointment was that there isnâ€™t much consistency in the professionalism, helpfulness, and knowledge of the staff. Like many other reviewers have said, Ismeta, who works the breakfast buffet, is beyond amazing. She is warm and friendly and really makes you feel welcome, while somehow managing to keep the busy buffet cleaned and stocked. But on the third morning of my stay I knew she had the day off the minute I walked into the breakfast area. It was less than 30 minutes after they started serving breakfast, and there were dirty tables and counters, they were running out of food, and the two young women working the area were standing around talking to each other. Needless to say, I was glad to see Ismeta on the last morning of my stay. My experience with the front desk staff was similar. At check-in, we waited nearly 20 minutes before anyone even came to the desk to greet us. We asked the gentleman who checked us in for directions on 2 separate occasions. Both times he seeemed annoyed and gave very vague directions, not even telling us street names. On another occasion I asked a young woman at the front desk for directions, and she was very helpful, even going as far as highlighting the route for us on a map. The service (or lack of service) we received from some of the employees certainly wasn't up to Marriott's standards, but because the overall experience was good, I would stay here again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great hotel only one block from the river. It is easy to walk everywhere downtown from here. As a family with dietary restrictions, it was very nice to have the kitchen and be able to avoid eating out. The breakfast here is huge, and it is included. The breakfast room is nicer than most restaurants. We didn't really need another meal after the breakfast here, maybe just a snack or a light dinner in the room in the evening. There is a manager's reception Sun-Thurs, so it is possible that you could just have an apple or something in the afternoon, and be able to avoid eating out completely! The rooms are beautiful here. Our room was on the 26th floor, and it had two big bedrooms and two full bathrooms. The pull out couch was very comfortable for our 13 year old son. Another child could have slept on the cushion that comes off of the pull out couch, because it is a solid cushion, about 5 feet long and 2.5 feet wide. The two bedroom sleeps six people. We loved being on the 26th floor, it was perfect!!! I wouldn't even look into another hotel for the next time! The rooms are available from $119 a night. Our room went for $360 a night. Be aware that this is a pet friendly hotel, but it is smoke-free. We only saw one dog there, and there was no dog smell at all. The ventilation system is really good. There was a slight sewer gas smell in our bathroom. It was coming from under the toilet. They sealed it with caulk while we were there. They said they would fix it from under the toilet after we left. This is a great hotel and I can't imagine any problem that couldn't be taken care of just by asking the friendly staff. This is a great place for families to stay while visiting Chicago. There were lots of kids staying there while we were there, but the rooms were perfectly quiet inside. GREAT hotel!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Strange encounter in the bathroom”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We visited Chicago for a convention and stayed at the Residence Inn for a week. We were four people and booked a 2-bedroom suite with a rather large living area and 2 bathrooms. One bedroom featured a kingsize, the other a queensize bed. The sofabed in the living area was around kingsize. The hotel is quite new, however the interior appears cheap and the bedrooms relatively small. The wardrobes are way too small for four people. We stayed on the 23rd floor and had quite an impressive view. We had an accessible room, the bell was for the hearing impaired, so that it was connected to a flashlight and made noises similar to a fire alarm, which was quite disturbing... After a friendly welcome we however made a strange first encounter in the bathrooms. Apparently the housekeeping staff forgot to clean the toilets before we arrived, or how could someone explain the excrements in the toilet (see picture)? Furthermore we found severe urine stains under the toilet seats, which was quite unappetizing, too. It took the management about half an hour to come to our room. The lady was quite uncomfortable with the situation and promised us a gift basket. The housekeeping cleaned both toiles and the gift basket appeared about two hours later. However the gift basket consisted of a 4 chocolate bars, 2 cheap bottles of wine and some nacho chips, which was not really satisfying. We did not encounter further problems during the rest of our stay. Staff was friendly, wireless internet worked well. Breakfast was redundant and the evening meal edible. The whirlpool had a nice 270Â° city view, but was apparently so full with chlorine, that all of us had a rash after using it. Irrespective of the excrements in the toilet I would stay at different place the next time, as the stay was quite expensive (730$/room/night) and the hotel appeared more like a good hostel.</p></li>
