The hotel is clean enough, nice and location is great, only 5-10 minutes from the closest tube station or few minute walk to Portobello Road in Nothing Hill and Kensington Gardens. In my opinion it's value for the money that also includes a continental breakfast.</p></li>

Its clearly not a 3 star hotel. The toilet in the room was not cleaned! It still had the sh...t of the previous quest!! Everything was dirty and sticky! The bed was propped up with bits of wood! Wrote a complaint to lastminute.com about selling rooms at this hotel. I will never ever stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Although we're quite easy going about hotels, this wasn't what you should expect from a three star hotel! It wasn't clean, the bed was awful (even for England). It was noisy. The breakfast buffet didn't look like a buffet and they'd better can't serve breakfast anymore! The location isn't so good too. It's quite a walk to the tube, and to get into the center of the city you must step over on tube. So, I would say: don't go there!</p></li>

Don't see why in the 21st century there is an expectation that guests will travel several corridors/floors just to get a cup of coffee - I have not experienced that in a hotel for over 20 years. Room smelled a little stale Breakfast was fresh and plentiful - as long as you like bread...staff were very helpful and polite</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed a single night here on business and was pleased with the room, small but clean. Staff seemed helpful - sorted out a iron for me quickly when I asked. What you get for the price seems very good. I know the breakfast is free but it is awful, I'd rather they charge a fiver and get some decent stuff in. The orange juice was incredibly watered down squash and god knows why there was a bowl of cucumber there. Just buy some croissant guys. Overall a good stay and a decent hotel.</p></li>

Was totally accessible, 5 minute walk from Bayswater tube station which took you anywhere you wanted to go in London. Bus stop was a 5 minute walk too. Bayswater is a lovely area to stay in, with plenty of shops & restaurants & a 5 minute walk to Kensington Gardens which is lovely on a nice summers night. Will definately be coming back again next time we come to London.</p></li>

There were also cigarette burns in the desk top. The room was so small we couldn't open our suitcases. Breakfast was the meanest we have seen with thin toast and homebrand cereal and watery tinned fruit. YUK.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel during the Easter break. When walking into the grand reception we thought that we had walked into the wrong hotel! We were very amazed! Check-in was a very quick process, the standard of the room met our expectations as we are not at all picky and it was worth our money. The location of course as others have said is excellent, our room was also facing the beautiful garden! We enjoyed our stay in this hotel and would recommend this to a friend but not someone who is very picky!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I found the man on reception to be friendly and polite, as was I, we had a brief chat and he upgraded me from a single to a double room for no extra charge. It certainly pays to be pleasant. The room was really quite small, but it was clean and tidy, as was the en-suite bathroom. Breakfast was fine, nothing special, but the coffee was good. All in all an excellent budget hotel in the very heart of London, I was very happy with it for the low price I paid and would use it again for an overnight stop in the centre of town.</p></li>

Me and a mate stayed here on 22nd December after a pretty heavy night out in Leicester sqaure. Small rooms, but clean enough. The place looks like one or two converted houses and is loacted in a small sqaure with lots of similar hotels/hotels nearby. At the end of the day, it fit its purpose as a place to crash at the end of a night out, and for Â£30 off lastminute.com (Â£15 each) you can't really go too far wrong.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel in November 2011, and paid for it with a MasterCard. It was the ONLY place I used the card while on vacation to the UK. I was notified today that there was an attempted use of my card at department store in London for $2,600. It could be coincidence. But I am wondering if somehow hotel personnel are stealing card numbers? Given other feedback on this site about mis-billing, and a host of other unsavory behaviors as reported here, I wonder if someone should not report this to the authorities for investigation.</p></li>

Not only is it poorly taken after but they don't have anything! When we wanted a bottle of wine, not a corkscrew was to be found in the place. Poor show for a hotel in such a nice part of London.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel was a disappointment. We were given a room in the basement with a view to the laundry area of the staff. Besides this the room had a really unpleasant smell. Room was very tiny and not very aesthetic. The bathroom was the best part of the room and most important, it was not stinking as the rest of the room. However, there were only handsoap available, no shampoo let alone conditioner. Breakfast was good but really simple and basic one with toasts, coffee, tea, cereals, cheese, jam and honey. I would not call this place a three star hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the hotel for four nights during Christmas and found it very feasible. The location is right in the heart of london with all the food and shops very near by. I do not understand why users are complaining about the staff; to me they were more than helpful. They allowed me an early check in and luggage leaving facility (after checkout) was also provided. The breakfast and its hours were very suitable too. The only thing which I found a bit below expectations was the size of the room;but that was very understandable keeping in mind the accomadation prices in london</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed in this hotel for two nights on a work trip to London in early August 2008. Room was small, but very clean. Bathroom was separate from the room in the corridor, but a private one for this room. Service was ok and internet connection available in the lobby. Breakfast sufficient. I only wish they had had the possibility to leave the luggage in a separate room, not in front of the reception desk. Location is ok on a quiet street just a stroll away from Bayswater underground station. I think in London my stay in this hotel for two nights (total 129 euros) was a fair deal.</p></li>

When we first we walked into the reception we were amazed to find the grand style given to it, it was beyond our expectations. The receptionist was very friendly, did not take long to check us in and gave us all the information necessary. The room was averge, neither was bad or too good, its just fine for a couple nights in London. We enjoyed our stay in this hotel and would recommend this to anyone, and if I ever intend to go back to London, I will definitley reserve at this hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's an average hotel in a very good position in London. The rooms are pretty tiny and for a twin we got just a queen bed to sleep in, which was just right to be placed between the walls (I don't even know how they would make the bed in the morning, there wasn't enough space!). Little bathroom too and no hairdryer. Our room was very close to the lift and it was quite noisy all night long, even in the morning when the customers would start to line up for breakfast. Good position in London though at an affordable price. The hotel is clean and the staff is nice and quick during breakfast.</p></li>

When we reached the hotel we got a room B01 - I couldn't believe that I should go to the basement. We had to sleep in the basement and that room was awful, opposite to the lift, between a room for the staff and the breakfast room and close to a public washroom. There was a window but we could be happy to see some light. Luckily we got another room the next day. But I would recommend to avoid booking that hotel if you don't want to ruin your trip!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Looks very nice on the site, but this is extremely misleading indeed. Cold room and bed. The room featured lots of glazing, but this was only single glazing, hence any heat from the rads escaped through the window. Could not sleep until 3.30 am, the cold came though the mattress, my legs cramped, and now have a dreadful backache. Unhelpful hotel staff did not want to acknowledge the issue. The breakfast was equally disappointing, Cheap Aldi/Lidl cereals on offer. Anaemic looking hard-boiled eggs, and 'orange juice' which was orange cordial watered down. Bread crumbled when tried to butter. Gotta be the worst ever.</p></li>

We had a room overlooking the street which was very loud with traffic (drag racing neighbors with loud radios on the street until 3am). Staff did nothing about complaints when this went on for 3 nights. Room was very small, beds uncomfortable, room was never cleaned execpt for picking up the towels, which had a strange smell. Shower curtain was moldy. The faucets in the room were a joke - had to turn the sink and shower faucets around 2 time before water came out. Elevator was slow, and scary.

When a guest closed their bedroom door the whole place shook! Shocking! On the plus side, the bedsheets were clean and it is close to Hyde park.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For a cheap and cheerfull budget hotel in the heart of London i would recommend this one-ok i admit its not the best room ive ever stayed in but for Â£22.50 b+b per person per night in the center of London what do you expext.The rooms were quite small but they were clean and tidy and the bed gave me a good nights sleep. The hotel is about 3 or 4 mins walk from Bayswater tube staion so is in ideal location to visit Lodons top attractions via the underground I personaly wouldnt worry about all the negative comments on here about the hotel as some people just expect 5* treatment for 2* prices-i will be be booking this hotel again in the future as its a good value buget hotel. karl/rach july 31 08</p></li>

<li>The hotel is about 3 or 4 mins walk from Bayswater tube staion so is in ideal location to visit Lodons top attractions via the underground I personaly wouldnt worry about all the negative comments on here about the hotel as some people just expect 5* treatment for 2* prices-i will be be booking this hotel again in the future as its a good value buget hotel.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed 5 nights at this hotel. I found the property by the web and the price was right and I knew the location. I was expecting a small pokey room, but I was given a twin room on the ground floor with a lovely big window overlooking the park. The bathroom was of an older style, and apart from the shower curtain - which they changed, spotlessly clean. The staff were mostly eastern european, and sometimes language was a problem. But no great hassle. They directed me on the tube, recommended a good laundry, and organised a taxi to Waterloo all with no bother. In a nut shell, I got a clean hotel room - in good location - at a good price. Which is exactly what I wanted. I would probably stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here from 5-7th June for the Rage Factor gig in Finsbury Park. Our room was a decent size (one double bed and a single, even tho we only paid for a double room) and very clean, looked like it had been recently refurbished. Breakfast wasn't great which was a disappointment, just toast (which disappeared like gold dust when it was brought out) and boiled eggs. Oh well, there's a great pub around the corner (Prince Edward) that had a good menu! It was very easy to find in a great location, just round the corner from Bayswater or Queensway; lots of bars, restaurants etc nearby. Only problem with the room was the thin walls; were woken up a few times in the night when the upstairs room flushed their loo. Would stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is a disgrace. I checked into a room that had smoothie spilt in the carpet, and smelt disgusting. Then, the noise from others in the hotel kicked off early evening and you can hear every noise possible from other guests and that is not what I want to hear. In complaining I got nowhere. I had to leave after midnight on the day I checked in due to the noise and the stuffy smelly rooms. I was told it would be no problem to get a refund, I had to deal with the manager the next day. i called the manager twice a day to never get anyone, to not get a reply to my letters, calls, emails. I got response from an endless amount of rude foreigners who worked at the hotel. This place is shameful and I advise people to not waste their money.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel even after the horrible reviews....and some of them are TRUE! We stayed in May 2005 for 3 nights. Our room was alright, very basic. It's what we had expected. But, the door handle to the room was almost falling off, you could actually see through to the hallway!! We didn't bother raising this issue; the staff didn't seem too friendly or professional. (I mean, when the desk clerk doesn't acknowledge your existence for 5 mins. while you're standing there, and only talks on the phone, whilst swearing, it's not too professional). And, what do you expect from a budget hotel?? The decor IS dated, but not too bad. The only thing was the stagnant "old" smell in the hotel was a bit gross. The breakfast was average, but the wait staff were really great.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My partner and I stayed here for three nights while in London visiting friends and sight seeing in Feb 2010. After I spent days searching the net I think we got the cheapest priced hotel for that area and for the price I paid I thought it was fine. The room was small, but I had expected that, it was clean enough, the bathroom looked like it was new and the water was nice and hot. The heating was fine I was never uncomfortable and we both slept very well there. As for breakfast I thought it was good value (again I wasnâ€™t really expecting much after all the comments on Tripadvisor) heaps of toast, cheese and boiled eggs, some canned fruit, tea coffee and juice. If you are just looking for a cheap basic room in a good location then this is the place. I would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If I had read the last 2 reviews, I probably woud have gone elsewhere. But I had already booked and was on the road. This is one of the cheapest hotels in London, even if it is more expensive than the Ramada in Wisconsin. Therefore you can't expect Egyptian cotton sheets and down duvets. It's also a European hotel, meaning it's not as big as the Ramada in Wisconsin. That being said, I found this hotel to be reasonable. My room was clean, and freshly painted. And I didn't experience any bites. I had a bigger problem with other guests than the hotel itself. Someone kept pulling the fire alarm, and the line for breakfast didn't move because other people kept cutting in. I probably wouldn't stay here again because I prefer the Paddington area to Bayswater, but if the location was better for me, I would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I never expected a Ritz or Marriot hotel. The staff in the hotel were very friendly, with a perfect wake-up service, but this was the only thing that was allright. The room was very small, the beds were squeaky, but clean. The bathroom was terrible. Very much demage and after the shower we needed people from the staff to close the showertap. The floor and walls were very noisy (wooden squeaky floors). The most bad experience was the breakfast. Only one dish at the time with 8 slices of toast on ca. 60 people. There was only cheese and marmelade and cornflakes. No fruit and no meats. The breakfaststaff was very rude and not interested in the guests. We took afterwards a breakfast in the town. There is only a coffee and thea-bar in the hotel. My personel rating for this hotel is between 1 and 2 stars and absolutely no 3 stars.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was THE worst hotel I have ever stayed in! Their website says that they have recently renovated; but I just stayed there in Feb. of 2005 and there is nothing newly renovated in the place! The rooms are so tiny that you can barely move, the furniture looks like it was purchased at a garage sale 20 years ago, and (worst of all) the bed linens were filthy. We stayed there on two differnt occasions because it was a layover both coming and going to our final destination, but if we hadn't already reserved the room ahead of time I would have never stayed a second time. In both rooms the bed spreads we covered in stains and holes. The worst was in the second room where there appeared to be a large blood stain. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting the Four Seasons (I have realistic expectations), but this hotel was beyond bad--it wasn't even sanitary!!!!!!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Three stars (first class) rating for this hotel is an absolute joke. We expected little from London hotels as we've been there before and have been exposed to the prices and small rooms. This "Palace" takes the cake, however - TINY rooms, thin walls, below-average breakfast. For the price and the rating, you would expect half-way helpful staff. Our wake-up call the day of our 7 am departure never happened - and the manager had the audacity to be indignant and get mad at us for claiming he never called (what, all three of us in this tiny room went deaf?!). The night manager could not explain how we could make an overseas phone call. He convinced us to take a 35 lb taxi ride to Heathrow when the Heathrow Express would have been half the cost - turned out to be someone's private car. Do not expect 3-star service or 3-star accommodations - you will be sorry you stayed there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at Pembridge Palace Hotel for 6 days. We found the lobby stunning, spacious, modern, with a large sitting area and an average-sized outdoor sitting area. The hotel had a very convenient coffe-shop, for a few hot beverages. With friendly staff and access to internet. The dining room consisted of many seats and had no problems. Our room smelt fresh, it was a good size, coloured TV with satellite, stylish and modern cupboards/drawers. Each of us had been assisted with soap and towels. The bathroom was a satisfying size, but very modern and clean with a shower/bath. The hotel is placed in central london with many close attractions, Queensway (Shopping & Dining), Hyde Park (Beautiful park - I would recommend to visit), and many other sites to view. Overall my wife and I had a pleasing stay at Pembridge Palace Hotel and I would recommend this to all. Definetely A Pleasing Hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The price and location seemed good but it was not worth it. The room was tiny with there not being enough space for 2 people to move around without one going and standing in the toilet. The bed had one flat pillow each a sheet and dirty blanket. The en-suite was also small and you had to walk in sideways past the sink to get in. The walls between the rooms were obviously very thin as you could hear people having a normal conversation in the next room. You can hear people all night, pipes clanking, floorboards squeaking, doors banging. The stairways were disgustingly dirty with months of dust lying around. The one we went down had a broken banister which would have been dangerous for young children. In the morning there was no hot water for a shower and when we mentioned this to reception they seemed very disinterested and suggested we washed in the sink. Not the hotel experience we were really looking for!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked the hotel through expedia, and upon arrival, we were beset with problems. They could not find our reservations, and then ignored us while we sat in the lobby. They were not helpful in any way. They did not try to think of any solutions for us. Finally, we tried the other name in the party (not the person who booked the hotel), and then they realized their mistake. We were not offered any apology and they acted as if it was our fault. Once we got to the hotel room, it was nice enough. The area was in the bayswater area of london, so there were a lot of cheap hotels there and this seemed one of the nicer ones. This is not saying it was anything close to a hilton or even a marriot, but it was nice enough. The other problem with the place was that some guests were very loud some of the nights and were partying in the hallways. The front desk either did not want to or was unable to do anything about it.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel has not been renovated for quite some time. The wallpaper was falling off, the panels very dirty, the elevators are dangerous to use we felt, no hot water in the morning (and that was every morning) in the breakfast room there isn't enough place for guests, they bring 8 pieces of toasted bread once every 10 min. (we were 30 people waiting for bread) and it is the same every morning even if you start at 7 or at 9.30. You also had to wait for coffee cups if you were so lucky there was coffee. This is not a place to stay if you like just a little comfort. But i guess it is ok for backpackers. I do sound very negative but I must tell you I travel a lot all over the world and this place is the worse I have stayed in considering the rate for the room. I stayed there for 5 nights with my daugher. One positiv thing is that it is very close to Bayswater and Quenssway underground and nearly any noise from the street.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Charged for 2nd night before we had even seen the room- which was probably quite smart on their part as we would not have stayed a second night! Tiny hotel room, dirty bed covers, lumpy pillows, REALLY poor mattress- holes on one side and totally sunk on the other! Huge sash windows that do not stay open- had to wedge ours with a chair.. carpet not tacked down by the door which made it hard to open (trust me, you do not want to get trapped in these rooms!) and carpet totally worn out by the window. The room had a balcony (you had to climb out of the window to get to it) which ran all the way along the front first floor- anyone could have opened the window and got in! The rooms had no safe- nor was one offered at reception so we had to take all our possessions with us each day. Plus side: bathrooms ok with fan, wardrobes were quite nice and you could have as much as you wanted for breakfast, but the choice and quality was not great.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My brother and I arrived at the hotel late at night to be greeted by a some what creepy neighborhood. Received a basement room that caught cigarette smoke from an adjacent room which had a porch right outside our window. Electricity sockets had to be traced by following the (tiny) TV cable. Acoustics were just unbearable as noises from all direction bothered our sleep. Management did little to intervene when young school guests smoked and shouted at night. Breakfast was crummy, but that could be expected from the budget (45 pounds a night for a room with two beds). We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights (as we were expecting a couple of pre-ordered packages to arrive at the hotel), planning to spend another night in Liverpool and then returning to a 3rd night in the hotel.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at this hotel for five nights in June. This was our first trip to London. We had heard that the London hotels are small, and this is true of this hotel. We had also read some very bad reviews of this hotel, and were quite skeptical of our stay. When we travel, we usually stay in moderate hotels. Therefore, we were quite pleased with this hotel. The basic facts are that this hotel is a moderate hotel. The rooms are small but were cleaned everyday. The building is old and shows some signs of this age. However, they have updated the window dressings and spreads. The bathroom was very small but very adequate. We did not travel to London to stay in the room. The free breakfast was good. I can't believe some people complain about the breakfast. Every morning there were boiled eggs, sliced cheese, toast, cold cereals, coffee and tea. The staff replenish constantly and the dining room was very bright and clean. I have no complaints with this hotel. I will stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked this hotel via lastminute.com. Firstly the photos which you find on the hotel web site have obviously been taken on a good day. We did not expect the Ritz but as another review reads it is more like a hostel than a hotel. We felt very uncomfortable in the room, it was dull, dusty and very dingy. The carpet was filthy, the beds were disgusting (cleanish sheets) but the thought of the blanket or bedcover any where near my skin made the shiver. I felt itchy the whole time in the room. The paintwork has not had a coat of paint for years, the curtains were dusty and dirty. 3 star rating is a joke. I would not rate this even 2 star. As if the rooms were not bad enough, the continental breakfast was unfit for human consumption. We went down for breakfast, and stayed there long enough to be totally horrified by what we saw. The toast had mould spots, the cheese looked sweaty, the milk was sour. We could not escape quick enough. All in all definately not recommended. Awful place, will never ever go back.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There was a power outage in the hotel that lasted more than 2 days, and the staffs kept on telling us that the problem will be fixed soon but they do not know when. Rooms and hallways were dark, no elevator and worse of all, no water. Then finally they offered us to transfer to another hotel, on the second day. They do not have intentions of transfering us if I did not complain. I reserved and paid for 2 rooms, but then, they only gave us only one room in the hotel where we got transferred. Before we left Pembridge, the staff told us that we already got 2 rooms, but when we got to the hotel where we transferred, they said Pembridge only gave us 1 room. What a money grab. Very unfair !!! It was my girlfriend and my brother's first time in the UK and they had a bad hotel experience. Do not ever patronize this hotel !!! Go to the Duke of Leincester, a few blocks away with almost the same price as Pembridge. Staying at Pembridge is like staying in a filthy hostel. Do not book at this hotel or you will get disappointed.</p></li>

Carpeting old, hole in the ground. The sheets were clean and the bathroom was clean, but no glass for tooth brush, no shower gel or shampoo. Breakfast was very simple but ok - boiled eggs, toast, butter, jam, ... Walls so thin, every time somebody walks by your room they wake you up. I did not believe the horrible reviews I read but I saw for myself they were true. I would rather add 20 pounds per night or so and have a decent hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This March, my husband and I stayed for 3 nights. 3 nights too long. The bathrooms were dirty, shower curtain moldy, no hot water, and bed extremely uncomfortable. That wasn't the worst of it though. After our first night there, I woke up to find myself covered in red bumps all over my arms, ankles, neck and face. At first I thought i got an allergic reason to something, but wasn't sure. That night, we came back to our room, to find little bugs lerking around the headboard. We went down to reception and they switched our room, as you could imagine we were pretty freaked out. After doing some research we soon realized they were BED BUGS (confirmed by my dr, after arriving home). We asked the front desk if they knew what the bugs were-said no, basically completely acting dumb. Apparently, after digging around the internet, I am not the first person this happened to at this specific hotel. The hotel did nothing, and for the rest of my trip I was an itched disfigured mess. WARNING: Do not stay here. It is an awful hotel not suited for anyone!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My sister, mum and i stayed here for two nights over the weekend ( 10-11-2011) and iwe had a room for three, which clearly was meant for two people, the three single beds were pushed together with no walking room between them... in the morning woke up to a horrible smell of gas/toxins coming from the bathroom. We opened the window and went down stairs to reception to investigate. The reception team were not very helpful and kept trying to pass the blame to the management team. We moved rooms , this time a double and a single was given, they hadnt even asked if two of us were prepared to share beds? This time there were no smells from the bathroom, but between the three of us, we were lucky if we had 3 hours sleep, we were on the road side, it was extremely noisy, shouting and screaming through the night. We asked to be refunded for at least one of the nights stay, due to discomfort, the gassy smells and the small room, but were told, we dont do refunds.... absolute disgrace, this should not be described as a three star hotel , no stars at all in our opinions</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Based on that the fact that I was looking for a budget hotel, when I saw 3 stars, I was thankful. However, when I arrived at the door steps of the Hotel, I was very disappointed. We all were. Check in was a quick process yes, however the hallways to the room has this weird smell, not a pleasant one. Got to the room only to see dirty walls, stained sheets, a dusty wardrobe, torn blankets, coarse, discoloured towels that were apparently SUPPOSED to be white and a bed that had a frame that was moving apart. The bathroom was the most presentable part of the room, but that too had little pick ups. Last but not least, along the stairway in the room, there is a hole in the wall, and next to it is a crack as well. Breakfast was not as continental as we expected so we didn't have it. This definitely is a 4 thumbs down and we would not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel. Pembridge Palace, you have a prime location, however you need to have a look at what you are offering to your customers so that you can keep them. Excellent marketing strategy, you definitely caught us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">booked the pembridge hotel the day before we travelled through lastminute.com which cost Â£48.00 for a double room with breakfast. on arrival the room we were allocated was in the basement which is next door to the breakfast room. the room was very tiny and the shower cubicle was full of green mould and some of the lights didnt work. the bedding was of very poor quailty and we both felt it was cold at night. the radiator did not work or they have the heating on a timer which come on in the morning. breakfast was another issue. because the room was next door to the resturant the noise from other guests did cause for an early start!!. when we did go for breakfast we could not find a table so we ended up eating in the room we had been allocated. Quality of breakfast was just ok, but then again for the price we paid i cannot really grumble. location wise is ok short walk to the underground stop, some nice pubs and resturants near by. would i stop at the pembridge hotel again?.. well it served its purpose but when i visit again in feb the pembridge would be a last resort</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for five nights. Okay, it isn't expensive but for this money you can find comparable hotels more in the city center. The room was small, and the bed also. It was noisy, you can hear the neighbours all the time. The staff wasn't friendly, they provided free safes, at the reception desk, but every time you need something out of your locker the staff wasn't polite and helpfull. The're was a breakfust buffet, it was a very bad buffet, in a shabby basement with not enough space for the guests (so go for a very early breakfast) In my opinion they should stop serving breakfast, you can better eat in one of the hundred coffeebars in the morning. And last but not least: the location: the hotel is not very near a tube station. The neighbourhood is not bad but it is boring. To go to the center you must step over on the tube, there is no direct line to the center. Especially in the evening when you might to catch the last tube, that isn't handy. And i've forgotten the star rating: this is absolutely not a three star hotel. More a 1+ or 2 star hotel. But London is an amazing city!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have stayed in many a hotels in London before, and this, I think, was of the better. Yes, the rooms were tiny, but that's the same at most of these tourist hotels, and you usually don't spend too much time in the room anyways. Another minus was the fire alarm. There's no smoking in all rooms, so when people tried to light a cigarette dispite the rules, the alarm went off in the entire hotel. The staff just turned it off. In the end, I think this is a fire hazard in itself, because guests stop responding to the alarm. We just sit and wait for the staff to turn it off. Not good in case of a real fire. But the room was tidy and clean, had ovens which we could adjust ourselves, had a tv with five channels (though reception was so-so). The staff was kind enough. Breakfast was good. Buffet with bread, cereals, juices, milk, jam, coffee and tea. And the kitchen staff were very good at keeping the food coming. The maids were good also. They came in the room every day with fresh towels and tidied the beds. All in all, I had a nice stay at the Pembridge Palace, and I would recommend it to budget travellers.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Have stayed at this hotel many times in the past. Hotel then was great value a little run down but more than adequate for my needs after a late night in the west end namely a comfortable bed and hot water. Now the hotel has had a kind of makeover. Walls and doors have been painted and some of the furnishings have been upgraded. The price has also gone up considerably with very few decent deals being available on the various websites. The hotel is trying to place itself as something in the mid range. Whilst I would probably stay there again I would definitely not stay there with someone I care about as there are better options elsewhere available for the same sort of money. I stayed earlier this week with my cousin so we had a twin room. Around 3 am someone entered our room (although it was locked) and when I shouted they ran away down the corridor. Having got up and re locked the door (jamming a chair behind the door) I went back to sleep. In the morning I reported the incident to the receptionist who briefly feigned interest commenting that it was probably just another guest opening the wrong door!</p></li>

It was clean, every day clean towels. Breakfast was very surprising! Eggs, cereals, muesli, all kinds of brown an white breads, toast, french bread, tea, coffee, juices, milk and very nice cheese!! And of course jam and nice butter. We were very pleased and enjoyed our getting up every morning to have such a good beginning of the day! Yammie....... Okay, not all of the staff members we very happy, you could see it on their faces, and all of them came from Poland we thought, and there English was not so good, but with a friendly face you will meet another friendly face. At least we tried ;-) Our room was just above the entrance and we had a very big window that let a lot of light come in. And we had sunshine and warm weather every single day!! Next year we want to come back, and this time with my husband and our son and daughter.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel for 3 nights as it was advertising a good deal on a website I was looking at - I can see why now! The hotel reception looks lovely - but it is misleading - the whole place needs updating and sprousing up. The staff were miserable and you think these are the people who are going to be making your stay enjoyable for the next few nights! As with the other review, I took one look at the room and wanted to run and hide - through the winding corridors, and the 15 minutes it took to find the room (walk don't trust the lifts!), it was defintly not worth the wait. The room (supposed to be a double but was a twin) was very dated, the walls were damp with the wall paper peeling. The door to the bathroom was at a slant and smaller than my hips so I had to go in sideways - you could shower use the toilet and wash your hands at the same time it was that small - clean, but small. The rooms were only Â£35 a night so i wasn't expecting much, but at the same time, i could of stayed in a travelodge for the same price and enjoyed it much more. In the end we ended up staying in the Thistle Piccadilly which was amazing - but not cheap.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Pembridge with three traveling companions in July. The four of us shared two rooms. My traveling companions really liked the price. We had just completed a ten-day stay in Ghana; the amenities of this London Hotel were a welcome sight. The room space is very tight and we found the halls frequently noisy with conversations and slamming doors of other guests. However. . . . when I got to Gatwick Airport, I discovered that in my rush to get on the shuttle van, I left my mastercard at the hotel desk. Fortunately, I had a hotel card in my purse. A call from the airport confirmed what I feared; my charge card was left behind. The staff member was willing to arrange to have the card mailed to me in the states. I preferred that it be destroyed. My request was honored, and after I arrived home that same staff member was very responsive to my follow-up email inquiries. There is no evidence of the card being misued; I completely trusted that it was indeed destroyed and my credit card company has already replaced it. Upon a budget return to London, I would definitely consider another stay. The location was perfect for connecting with local buses and the tube.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were travelling in Norway and had booked an 8 night stay (Saturday through the following Sunday nights) in this hotel. Our plans changed to leave London for two nights and I contacted Hotels.com to cancel our stay on Friday and Saturday, returning on Sunday night. We were told that this could be done at the hotel upon our arrival. The owner informed me that, with five full days notice, the two night cancellation was not a problem and that we could leave one piece of luggage in the hotel lobby during our absence. We departed on Friday, returning the key card for our room. We returned on Sunday and checked out on Monday. Upon checkout the owner went back on his word and refused to refund us for the two nights we had cencelled. He said that we may be able to get a refund through Hotels.com. We had no time to argue because we had to catch a plane at LHR. I am amazed that this hotel has a three-star rating as the place is unfit for habitation. Check out my pictures and you be the judge. This hotel would surely fail most all requirements of the Canadian Hotel Association Standards in terms of health and safety, services and customer relations. I most strongly discourage people for using this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel for 7 nights - what a major mistake! Arrived in from Australia in the early hours of the mornings to be greeted by a rude member of staff who showed no consideration of getting into a room earlier. I had to leave my bags in the main lobby with 200 other bags where anyone could take what they want. Finally got into my room - what a disgrace! Iron marks embedded into the carpet with as many grease stains than what you would find on a footpath outside. I instantly complained and was told to ring last minute who they ended up ringing the hotel - lastminute were no help at all and was stuck there for 7 days. The bed was rock hard and lumpy - I had to roll a towel up to place under my hip for some comfort. The bathroom had mould in it and the shower curtain was about 10 years old, Not once in 7 mornings did I have even a luke warm shower. Breakfast was OK but they would continually run out of stuff - once it got to close of time for breakfast the staff would turn the lights off with the place still full of guests - quiet funny to see some Italian guy go off his nut and demanded they keep serving. Overall don't even consider this place and suggest never book a hotel for then 1 or 2 nights or you will get stuck there.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My sister, partner and I stayed at this hotel in August 2009. We booked it on the spur of the moment off lastminute.com. We checked the website and as it was awarded 3 stars we were expecting it to be basic but comfortable. We arrived late at night so the building was lit up at the front and with the white pillars made it look really nice. However, that impression was very quickly erased when we entered our rooms. My sister stayed in a single room on the second floor. Her room was tiny! If you're a bit on the tubby side foget it (luckily my sis is petite)! The bed was placed against the window so she was freezing in the night. However, the bathroom wasn't too bad. My boyfriend and I stayed in the "basement." There was a window which was covered by a tatty blind and a filthy net-curtain. We peeled back the top cover on the bed and there was a fluffy leopard-skin blanket. Not the type you can really wash in the washing machine, so god knows how many different bodies it must have come into contact with (urgh). There was a white sheet as well so we just used this. The bathroom was clean and the shower was powerful, but there was mould on the ceiling. If you get the room cheap and don't compare it with other 3 star hotels you've stayed in, then you'll be ok. The hotel could be so much better if the owners spent a bit of time updating the rooms - a paint job, decent curtains, proper blankets, etc.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">On reading some of the reviews of this hotel, I was genuinely worried that I was going to be staying in a dank pit where the overlord manager would sell me to slavery, not allowing me to sleep, eat properly, or, god forbid, watch television. However, when I got there, the only problem I encountered was that I arrived to early and wasnt allowed check in for another hour. When i did check in the staff were quick AND helpful. I suppose if you are ignorant to them, they will respond in kind! As for the room, well, it was small, but what are people expecting for what is a budget hotel. if you want a big spacious room, spend some more money please, and stop posting nonsense on the internet. The room was small, but clean. The bed was comfortable. The room was airy, but had a decent working radiator if it got cold. The bathroom was almost as big as the room, and had a nice powerful shower with hot water. The TVs reception wasnt great, but Ive yet to meet anyone who has travelled to London to watch TV, especially English TV! The breakfast was substandard, but thats purely down to my own tastes. There was plenty bread, fruit, juice, tea and coffee in a clean and well kept dining room. All in all, I cant fault the Pembridge Palace. Good price, good staff, nice rooms. Now if only everyone heeded the no smoking policy (for which there are numerous signs. Fire alarm at 6am isnt pleasent), it would have been perfect.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Worst Hotel ever -and they charged my card 3 times for the pleasure, didn't respond to my complaint!!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here with 3 friends. On arrival we were told the hotel was fully booked and told we had to move to another hotel -inconvenient as we had chosen this one for the location. So we were bundled in someone's car and taken to another hotel. Room was 4beds all pushed next to eachother dirty and dusty. When we went out, we were told to book a taxi through the hotel. It wasn't a licensed cab, when we were picked up the driver got out and jumped back behind the reception desk! At breakfast, there were no plates, one bowl between four of us, so we buttered our toast on the table and shared the two glasses that were provided between four of us. The breakfast room is a load of plastic chairs squashed into one room and everyone sharing tables trying to get a bit of room. We laughed it off and thought at least we had had a cheap night and didn't need to go back there -and a funny story about the disastrous experience! However I found out a couple of days later that my card had been charged 3 times! I got the money back through my bank, but the hotel were very unhelpful and to this day have not got back to me after me sending several complaint letters and calling them. I was simply told that I must have booked 3 rooms. I told them I hadn't, and asked if I had booked 3 rooms why they didn't tell me when I checked in? They said maybe there has been a mistake because my surname is Smith so they could have put other Smiths payments on my card!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “A Hotel To Avoid”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I stayed at this hotel in room G05 and we can say this is one of the worst hotels we've ever stayed at during our travels in Europe or back home in the US. Our ground floor room had worn carpets and a musty smell, as if the rugs had gotten wet and had not properly dried. The bed covers were stained and worn and on my wifes side of the bed, she complained one of the mattress springs seemed to be protruding. One wall next to the bed had small dog or cat foot prints. The room had a small desk but only one electrical outlet and no electrical outlets in the bathroom. There was also no telephone in the room. Wi fi access is avaiable if you are willing to shell out 3 or 6 British pounds an hour while accessing the internet in the hotel lobby. I resorted to using the Wi fi at the Starbucks cafe a few blocks away. I paid for the five pound Starbucks card and had unlimited Wi fi access (as long as the Starbucks was open anyway). One advantage to this hotel is it's relative closeness to Hyde Park, Basewater train station and many restaurants and souvenior shops just a block away. However; my wife and I spent as much time as possible away from the hotel since our room was so depressing. If you have to stay here, I suggest you ask to see the specific room you will be staying in before you pay,( by all means avoid room G05). By the way, you pay in full up front at this hotel, so avoid my mistake and look at the room before you hand over your credit card.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stay in London hotels regularly using a booking agent and couldn't get in where I normally stay when in the Bayswater area, so they offered me the Pembridge Palace. Looks great in the pictures - Nothing like the rooms I saw or stayed in. We arrived very late and the first problem was it was a twin not double as per the booking. A minor inconvenience. but then it got worse. The lights didn't work so we given the only other available room, which was next to the boiler room and the noise kept me awake most of the night. The decor was poor and there was no dressing table or tea making facilities in either of the 2 rooms. Not even glasses for a drink. The TV remote also had it's batteries taped in! The sink didn't have a plug and was blocked it also stank. The shower curtain rail was gaffa taped up and the shower tray was dirty, so we didn't use it. Then breakfast - Ha! A Bowl of hard boiled eggs, some cheese slices, jam & sliced bread. Not even toast. The crockery looked like a mixed selection from a boot sale, mostly chipped & some plastic cutlery. There was no hotel information in the room or even fire instructions. If we had arrived at a normal time we would not stayed on first impression and gone elsewhere (regarless of the fact we had already paid), but it was almost midnight. I would like to know who gave this hotel a 3* rating and anyone who says it was OK, obviously hasn't stayed in a normal hotel. This is my worst ever hotel experience ever!!!!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked a single room for 6 nights. I checked in and went to my room to relax for a little while. The room had a double deadbolt type lock which required a key to lock and unlock the door from inside or out. After an hour or two, I went to leave and realized that the lock did not work from the inside. Therefore, I was trapped. I tried to call the front desk, but the phone was not even wired-in to the jack. I had to yell out the window to get a person's attention, not easy to do, and have them come to the hotel to have maintenance sent up. Maintenance got me out and told me that that room was not supposed to have been assigned. I eventually went through six different singles on the second floor because of more minor issues before I found one that was acceptable, but it still had the bedding from the previous guest. I took the bedding from a previous room and exchanged them so that I had clean sheets and blankets. Also, the bathrooms for the singles are private, but they are in a secondary hallway, and the door probably will not latch making it impossible to lock. The location is good, and I was able to talk the front desk person into storing some sodas that I had bought in their refrigerator that they use to keep drinks for sale. I also could not find a working electric outlet in my room, so I had to charge my portable devices in the lobby. Therefore, I got to know the staff a bit better than I normally would. They were quite nice people, but the building itself is not maintained well.</p></li>

<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 1.000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>The room had a double deadbolt type lock which required a key to lock and unlock the door from inside or out.</br>

<li>After an hour or two, I went to leave and realized that the lock did not work from the inside.</br>

<li>Therefore, I was trapped.</br>

<li>I tried to call the front desk, but the phone was not even wired-in to the jack.</br>
<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 0.992&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>I had to yell out the window to get a person's attention, not easy to do, and have them come to the hotel to have maintenance sent up.</br>
<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 0.896&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>

<li>I eventually went through six different singles on the second floor because of more minor issues before I found one that was acceptable, but it still had the bedding from the previous guest.</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 0.954&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>I took the bedding from a previous room and exchanged them so that I had clean sheets and blankets.</br>

<li>Also, the bathrooms for the singles are private, but they are in a secondary hallway, and the door probably will not latch making it impossible to lock.</br>
<span style="background-color:#bcf60c">ROOMS</span>: 0.996&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>The location is good, and I was able to talk the front desk person into storing some sodas that I had bought in their refrigerator that they use to keep drinks for sale.</br>
<span style="background-color:#ffe119">CHECKIN</span>: 0.963&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp</br></br></li>
<li>I also could not find a working electric outlet in my room, so I had to charge my portable devices in the lobby.</br>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I've stayed in some awful hotels in my time, but this is the worst one...bar none. We paid almost three hundred dollars for a triple room, and when we got there they gave us a tiny room with a lumpy full-sized bed and a twin bed the size of a small cot. The room was dusty and smelly. The bed covers and sheets looked dirty and like they had seen better days. To say that they TV in the room was tiny is an understatment, and it only had 5 channels, which were all snowy. But the worse part was that the room didn't have A/C, and it was stifling the whole time we were there. We had to sleep with the window open to withstand the heat. The beds were lumpy and uncomfortable. The full bed was tilted to one side, and after we checked why, we realized that the mattress was being held in place by cardboard and it had given way. They told us that they couldn't give us another room or transfer us to another hotel. They finally gave us another single room they size of a closet. The room had no bathroom, no lamps, the bed was hard and the curtain was torn. Also, there were no complimentary bottles of shampoo or conditioner, only two old bars of soap that were so old they were stuck to the sink. The shower head kept falling, and the toiled had trouble flushing. The elevators in the hotel are tiny, and the concierges at the front desk act like they wish they were not there. They were not rude, but not friendly either. I will never stay there again even if it was for free. Avoid it at all costs. You can find similar or better accomodations at a hostel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have to admit that after reading the mixed reviews I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I booked this hotel. I booked a double room for 1 night for me and my fiance because we were going the the Kings of Leon concert in Hyde park. When we arrived I handed the receptionist a print out of our reservation and she quickly gave us our room card/key, so book in was quick and easy, when we got to our room we were happy to see we had a triple room with a double bed and a single bed, that we were given for no extra charge, The room was clean and the en-suite bathroom was freshly cleaned and spotless.. It had clean towels and the shower was very powerful. There was a small portable TV that didn't have many channels but was fine. The bed was very comfy and I had a great night sleep with no noise. We were on the 3rd floor and the bars on the window did not bother me at all. The room was clean and tidy and even though is wasn't immaculate and didn't have everything brand new, it was perfectly fine. Breakfast the next day was ok, you had a selection of toast, jam, chocolate spread, eggs,cereal,fruit salad,etc. To me, considering the Â£60 we paid for both of us, I think the hotel was great value, and I'm a bit confused as to why it has such bad reviews, For the price of the rooms your not going to get luxury, and the fact breakfast is included in the price is a bonus, I would definately stay at this hotel again and the location is also excellent. Maybe some of the other rooms are in different condition?, but the room we had, 311, was clean and spacious and fine for our needs.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked through Ratestogo.com at around 49 GBP p/n. Stayed 10 nights. Firstly, the place was so confusing to find at 3am in the morning. Situated on Princes Square opposite Leincester Square. On arrival we checked in and only to find out that there are only non smoking rooms in the hotel when we had booked a smoking room(BUT we smoked outside the room window and no fire alarms went off... LOL). Asked the reception guy if there was internet/wireless internet in the rooms and he said "NO". Anyways turned on my laptop on the 2nd last day to find a FREE WIRELESS CONNECTION. Location was great. Very close to the Bayswater & Queensway Tubes. We had abit of a culture shock when we arrived but being greek we didnt really stand out so nobody really bothered us. Twin Room was tiny. We coulda just as well left our cases in the bathroom or lobby because they hardly fitted in the room. I was thinking to myself the whole time "What if we picked up...where would our ladies fit......????". Bathroom was new and bigger then the actual room(no jokes). Staff were not that friendly. Helpful at times but nobody really goes out of their way to greet you. Breakfast was average but ok for continental I guess. Smoking lobby downstairs was our favourate hang out after breakfast. We moved outta here and went to the Blakemore Hotel nearby. Only then did we realise what a hole this place really was. TINY ROOMS(cases hardly fit), NEW REFURBED BATHROOM(bigger then room), UNFRIENDLY HELPFUL STAFF, GREAT LOCATION, GREAT PRICE!!!! PS: DONT BE FOOLED BY THE HOTEL'S WEBSITE & PHOTOS LIKE WE WERE......expect the worst and it wont be so bad... lol</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was just fine for anyone who just wants to come and go as they please. I would advise people looking for a romantic break not to stay here though, as the rooms are paper thin and you can hear EVERYTHING. Rooms are tiny, but thats something to expect from all London hotels. There is no smoking in any of the rooms so if you are a smoker, you must use the smoking area beside the reception. After reading the reviews we decided to have breakfast elsewhere, so I cannot give an opinion on that. There is no bar in this hotel, although if you feel a thirst, there are tea/coffee making facilities in the reception and bottles of water and soft drinks are sold for 1 pound at the reception. If you are looking for a direct tube in to the centre, go to Notting Hill Gate station, which is only five minutes walk away, past the station, five minutes down the road is the Portobello Market which is well worth a look. No problems here with smelly towels or bed bugs etc, so I guess they have sorted out those problems because everything was clean. If there is one complaint I would make is the cold in the rooms, as the ceilings are so high, they take forever to warm up, we put the heating on full but when we came back from shopping on the first day the room was still freezing, so we put our bags lined up at the door to block the gap at the end of the door and when we came back that evening the room had warmed up. The sheets are very thin, more what I would expect from a spanish hotel where you only need sheets to cover you because of the heat, but this was London in the middle of January, so a proper quilt would not have gone a miss.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had occasion to stay in this hotel for three nights his July. I booked the hotel based upon its desription in a popular website that caters for people looking for rooms at short notice. Upon arrival I was almost in disbielief at what I saw. At first I wonderered if perhaps I had arrived at the wrong place. Certainly this was not a three star hotel as i understand it to be. I found the man on the front desk (I can't name him as I can't be seen to be personally insulting anyone) rude and unpleasent. His maner and attitude to me as I checked in made me feel unwelcome and ill at ease. Once I got to my room, I found myself to be on the ground floor backing onto the patio where guests sat outside to talk and drink etc. This ment I had to keep my curtains drawn almost all the time as a matter of privacy. I also had to keep my window shut at night as the noise was preventing me from sleeping. Not ideal on a hot July night. Upon reporting this problem to the same man at the front desk i again found him rude and unwilling to be of any assistace whatsoever. Indeed he seemed more concerned with his staffing issues than my own comfort. Not what I would expect from a three star hotel. Generally, my room was shabby. It had mould on the ceiling, no tea or coffee making facilities, there were no plugs in the sink or bath and the TV reception was terrible. My stay at this "hotel" was a terrible experience and one which I would not endorse to anyone. There are much nicer places to stay in the Bayswater area for the money. If anyone can suggest a way to enforce a more suitable star rating to this hotel I would be more than happy to hear about it.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Where to start?!?! Booked a double room through lastminute, and to be honest i wasnt expecting much for Â£40. We arrived at around half ten at night, and had to walk a wee bit from paddington station (you can get a tube, but its not that far a distance). There were loads of people hanging about in the street, and there were some really dodgy hotels in the street. My boyfriend and i felt very self conscious, as it was obvious that we were tourists. I would also like to point out, this hotel is NOT in Kensington!!!! it is across the park in Bayswater, which is actually a red light district. The hotel was very quiet, and when we checked in, i had to give my card over to be pre-authorised for Â£50 worth of charges, 'in case there were any damages'. I have never had to do this in any other hotel i have stayed in. We were given a basement room, which was tiny. It was also extremely cold, and there were no spare covers or anything, which resulted in me picking up the cold. It had two single beds, a wardrobe, a small tv and that was it. there was hardly any room to move, but it seemed clean. There were no curtains on the windows, so anyone passing on the relevant street could have seen right in, and we also were woken up very early by the sun shining in!! We were glad to leave, especially as i had read reviews mentioning the bedbugs etc, so we were glad to get up and leave to get to our very nice hotel in Kensington!! I will say, the bathroom was fairly nice, to the point that it didnt look like it belonged to the room (or the hotel!!). We didnt bother to stay for breakfast, as frankly speaking, i wouldnt have eated out of there, so i cant comment on it.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “this hotel is a health hazard and should be closed down immediately”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is a disgusting, dangerous pit. I am appalled that the health and tourism authorities in London have not shut it down, despite the endless complaints from the bedbug-bitten, filth-surrounded, noise-withstanding guests. The number one problem with the Pembridge Palace is that it is completely infested with bedbugs, and believe me, if you have never been attacked by these blood-thirsty insects, you don't want to try the experience, especially while on vacation far from home. This hotel obviously has plenty of them, since there are numerous visitors to this site, including myself, who have been eaten alive there, then suffering days and days of itching and disfigurement. You can complain, but the hotel staff will do NOTHING to remedy the situation but change you to one of the rooms which apparently they know have no bedbugs, which only shifts the problem on to some new unsuspecting victim. How can a place like this be allowed to remain open, can someone tell me? If the bedbug danger isn't enough to keep you away, then how about this? I got trapped in the elevator THREE TIMES during my stay!!! Add to this the incredibly unfriendly staff, war-torn furnishings and carpet, a gross bathroom, dirty towels and jam-packed fire hazard of a breakfast room, and you have a recipe for disaster. I fully expect to see this hotel in the headlines someday due to some sort of catastrophe like a fire, mass poisoning from breakfast or something that has already happened: the dozens and dozens and dozens (maybe hundreds) of guests who have had their health put at risk by the London authorities who, for some reason, refuse to close this dump. Shame on you all, hotel owners, workers and local authorities.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Not a good hotel, even among "tourist class" properties...look elsewhere”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I write this knowing that this was an less expensive by London standards, at about $150/night at the current currency conversion. The hotel may be less expensive than some, but it is not a good value for what you spend. CONS: The mattresses were older than I am (and I'm no spring chicken); you had to sleep in the large crevice left in the mattress by all the guests before you, and endure a night of springs in your vertebrae. The room was EXCEPTIONALLY small - we had to store one of our two suitcases in the bathroom because there was no room for it anywhere else. The hallways are about 15 years overdue for maintenance, and I'm sure there's not a single wooden floor board that does not squeel like a stuck pig when stepped upon. That means you WILL here every footstep made by your upstairs neighbors and those in your hallway. Breakfast was included, but don't expect anything beyond coffee, hardboiled eggs, cold pre-made toast, and cereal. Elevator was a death trap, and an exceedingly slow one at that. It shook, rattled, jerked, and moaned its way at a leisurely pace, and seemed to choose when and where it would respond to a call for a lift according to its own whims. And then there were the pillows. Wow, were these things bad. A sheet of standard office paper is considerably thicker and plusher. There's a sign in each room that says "Please contact the front desk should you desire extra pillows or sheets." I asked for extra pillows, but never received any, nor did I receive any explanation why I didn't get them. PROS: Convenient location to the Tube, some decent restaurants nearby, pretty convenient location to Hyde Park and West-End points of interest. And even if the front desk was unable to deliver on any requests (e.g., extra pillows), they were always very kind to deal with.</p></li>
