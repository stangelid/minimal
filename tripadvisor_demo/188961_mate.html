There's nothing significant to add but I just wanted to reiterate that yet another couple found this to be a truly nice hotel. It is polished to a lovely glow, both the furnishings and the staff. The people who work in this hotel are the nicest and most helpful I have encountered. Hopefully, Hotel 41 will continue to epitomize London style and grace.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Absolutely amazing hotel. Everything about this hotel was perfect. We stayed for 1 night for our anniversary, perfect place to spend it! The service was excellent, from turn down at night, room service to breakfast and papers in the morning! The bathroom was lovely, separate shower and bath. The fire wasnt working which was a shame, this was the only complaint. Definately will be coming back.</p></li>

Staff was very attentive and room was outstanding. Breakfast was very good. Hotel sits adjacent to sister property Reubans, directly across from the Royal Mews @ Buckingham Palace. I would stay here again and recommend to others. Bag of Nails Pub across the way is pretty good for quick bite and a pint.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel 41 deserves the accolades What an amazing experience in London! The hotel reminded me of a Kimpton, very comfy beds and great amenities. The staff (Sofie was great!) did their best to make my stay and my parent's stay fantastic. They couldn't have been warmer and more accommodating. I would definitely select this hotel again while in London--and the location couldn't be more convenient for all tourist activities.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Liked it, and would return. Great hotel and very good location. Free food around the clock -- they keep snacks out all day long. Small, but nicely appointed rooms. The hotel is a boutique with only one floor. Check-in, lounge and dining are all the same general area, which is not the norm. But the service is great. Very individualized attention if you like that sort of thing. We've stayed twice and would probably return again.</p></li>

Right across from the Royal Mews and a short walk to the underground at Victoria Station. Had a few blips getting our luggage delivered as the elevator was out of order, but Rubens elevator was available to us. No wi-fi, but there was a computer in the lounge to use. Loved the snacks and drink availablity especially after theatre. Would definitely stay there again.</p></li>

Rooms are very nice, and include a Bose speaker for your Ipod. The turndown service included soft slippers and robe, lavender pillow spray, chocolates, and a candle. The location is great as well for the London tourist. Highly recommend this hotel. Maybe not for families, but definitely for couples, or families with older children.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Wonderful Stay We were very impressed with this hotel. The staff were extremely helpful, polite and professional. We booked dinner in the Library Restaurant and staff and food were excellent. Rooms are extremely well equipped - everything from an umbrella to a stapler! The turndown service included soft slippers and robe, lavender pillow spray, chocolates, and a candle. We thoroughly enjoyed this whole experience and, despite the cost, will try to visit again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Simply fabulous I'm in the midst of a two night stay at the 41. I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said by other reviewers, but I wanted to throw a positive review out for the 41 as well. The lounge area is incredible - not sure why more guests don't seem to take advantage of it. Staying here is definitely like staying in a private club - it's been a relaxing wind-down to my European trip. When I return to London, I will definitely return to the 41.</p></li>

Unfotunately we were only in London for one night, I would definitely like to stay in this hotel for a longer period.The staff were attentive  friendly  the room was beautiful, if slightly small. The location of the hotel is perfect for sight seeing in London - so close to Buckingham Palace you can see it.I'd definitely recommend staying here for a treat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Jewel In The Crown What a lovely surprise in Victoria. 41 resembles an elegant private club with beautiful furnishings and outstanding service. The rooms are elegant and very thoughtfully fitted. Mine had a huge marble bath with separate shower and a working fireplace. The bed is comfy and has down pillows and high quality linens. Chantal and Andrew were terrific in making it an exceptional experience. Although there's not much around in the area such as restaurants it is a hotel I would recommend to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">ok I dunno, I stay at alot of fine places and decided to stay here on a whim. Normally, you would find me at the Lanesborough, Claridge's, 51 Buck Gate. We booked the conservatory suite for a short 2 night stay. Yeah, I found it relatively inexpensive for a London suite (about 1k a night), but it was cluttered and claustraphobic with only 1 window other than the glass roof.Location is good, lounge is nice, the staff...way over the top. However, as good as they are, I don't think that they can make up what the hotel lacks.</p></li>

Last September we visited London and stayed at Hotel 41, a very nice boutique hotel that was recommended by our friends. We looked on the internet for the best rate and found it on UniqueSmallHotels. This is a very exclusive hotel but it was still affordable thanks to this website.Everything was nice about this hotel, excellent service, good breakfast and a very nice concierge who arranged theatertickets for us. The London underground is close by and so are all the nice shops. This is a hotel you definitely have to see!</p></li>

The rooms were excellent/fantastic, everything that was required to make a stay enjoyable was included. Attention to detail in all things and a level of service which was both practical and yet not suffocating.The lounge was a fantastic place to escape and relax.The location was perfect.You do spend alot of money but hey!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel 41 is GREAT! Staying at Hotel 41 while we were in London was the best decision we ever made. From the moment we stepped onto the property, we were made to feel as if we were the most important people in the world. The entire staff pampered us. They granted our every wish. The best part was being able to completely relax and let someone else tend to our needs...from making us afternoon tea to arranging tickets to the London Eye. Bottom line, if you want true personalized attention, Hotel 41 is the place to stay. Keep in mind, though, it is very expensive.</p></li>

From the moment we arrived the staff were wonderful - they were so welcoming and friendly and the service we received was faultless. It was lovely to be greeted by name on every occasion and nothing was too much trouble for them. I booked this hotel on the back of reviews from Tripadvisor and would have no hesitation in recommending it - somewhere very special and personal and with a standard of service which would be very hard to beat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Super clean and friendly Read the reviews on this site and couldn't agree more. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is that the staff needs a geography lesson. And, the staff needs immersion in the attractions of London, including restaurants. Almost every time we asked for directions, they were wrong. Also, all restaurant recommendations were TERRIBLE. We loved BBar downstairs but, its closed on the weekend. The breakfast was not good. But, I, unlike most on this site, really don't expect a good breakfast at any hotel if it is included in the room rate. Still, great decor, fresh and clean.</p></li>

All around friendly people, the check in staff greeted us with a glass of champagne and allowed us to use their hospitality suite while waiting for our room, which was very helpful! The room was considerably large for London and the rain shower was fantastic. We didn't have time to enjoy breakfast the next morning, due to a very early flight home, so the hotel sent up some early morning coffee on the house. We can definitely recommend this hotel for any trip to London! 100% fantastic service!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved the room but stay away from drinks or food in the lounge The room was one of the best I've stayed at in London, and for the price you can't beat it for a weekend getaway. The only downsides were that the kingsize bed was made of two singles put together in the frame which gave an uncomfortable seam down the centre, and the fireplace was not working and we did not feel like having anyone interupt us to try to fix it.The rooms were top notch, and the service was just as good. the bathrooms have everything you could ever need and are kitted out with plush towels and robes as well as some of the best toiletries I have ever seen in a hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved it! Loved it!! Loved it!!! Think that says it all! We spent 5 glorious nights at 41 and would return without reservation. It's like being a guest in an English estate. The staff is superb!! We arrived from Scotland, by train, on my birthday. As we checked in we were offered a glass of champagne and comfy couch -- this was check-in, if you can imagine!! From that moment on it was heaven. We had dinner in the library and returned to our room to find it covered in red rose pedals -- a red heart on the bed -- a cake, a bouquet of flowers, and red floating candles all over the entire room! Andrew and Frederic were wonderful!! Breakfast each day was so relaxing -- every whim was attended to! Can't wait to return!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Absolutely Loved this Hotel! My wife and I stayed at 41 for our anniversary in July and absolutely loved it! After much research on hotels in the city, I decided to take a chance based partly on the reviews from this site. We were so pleased upon arrival! The location was outstanding, room extremely comforable and cozy, staff so nice, and general feeling in the hotel very, very comfortable. My only concern is the same as another reviewer on this site, and that is the time beverages and snacks actually cost something as opposed to being 'free'. My wife and I were very confused as well, and the hotel should address this. Otherwise, this was a perfect stay in a wonderful city! I would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Be Careful Hotel 41 is a very beautiful property, directly across from the Mews at Bckingham Palace. The property is small with very attentive staffing. BE CAREFUL _ breakfast was 20 pounds which is $40 for cereal, fruit, yogurt, and some cold meats. We were under the impression it was included after reading the reviews and also an article they had on display in the lounge. We brought this to their attention but they staunchly refused to reduce the cost which was disappointing. They told us the article was 'older' I suggested they remove it. The rooms are very expensive and therefore I believe the breakfast should have been included. Check out the Ruben - which is the same building - using different floors, and less expensive.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">None can compare We just returned from a month-long trip and bookended our travels with 2 stays at the 41. What a great ecperience this was. Firstly, the staff are exceptional. Friendly, attentive and loads of fun. From the sassy Chantal to the lovely Daphne and Antoinette, we were well cared for and coddled. The accomodations are well appointed and luxurious. The beds are a dangerous enterprise as they are so comfortable they could hold you hostage. Superb ammenities and wonderful touches such as fresh ice and lemon every evening along with the well stocked and always open pantry to plunder. Meals were superb and again, the staff could not be more efficient or lovely. We now have a new home in London. Thanks again for everything.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Your own London club Looking for a hotel room at the last minute, I was highly influenced by previous TripAdvisor reviews of this property. I have seldom felt quite this comfortable with my eventual choice. 41 is a gem of a place, near to Victoria Station geographically and close to an old school London club in ambience - think Boodle's or White's with a contemporary twist. The staff were, without exception, friendly and efficient. The manager greeted us as we checked in and the receptionist showed us to our room. When we returned from our evening out, we stopped in the Executive Lounge for a nightcap of port from the honour bar and some (complimentary) cheese and fresh fruit. Cheese before bed is supposed to give you nightmares. 41 is a dream.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Truly fabulous Lets get this out of the way...this is not cheap hotel or suitable for the budget minded. What is it, its amazing from the moment you are guided to the door of 41 you are lambasted with class and professionalism from every member of staff treated with total respectand politeness, you feel like your in a club for the select few and you are made to feel like you belong there. The rooms are a delight classy and not all flowery and chinsy like a lot of London hotels. Dinner or breakfast in the lounge is like home from home where you can totally relax from the hustle and bustle of the city with quality food and wine. The pink bubbly is fabulous. This hotel and its staff deserve the highest accolade for quality style and professionalism.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fabulous Hotel We stayed at the 41 for the third time in May of 2006. I cannot say enough good things about the hotel. First and foremost, the personal service that you receive at the 41 is incredible. The staff all remembered our names and were always willing to go that extra mile to help us during our stay. From teaching me how to make a Pimm's cocktail to sprinkling rose petals in our room on our anniversary. They also obtained excellent seats for two shows and made reservations for dinner as needed.The hotel itself is beautiful. More like staying at a private club than a hotel. The lounge is a great place to relax after a busy day (or evening). The rooms are beautiful with their black and white decor.We will definitely be back. As soon as we can.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A bit of style, not a lot of substance This is a small boutique hotel with cozy, chic rooms that is ideal for a weekend visit to London. But if you are looking for a hotel that has all the usual mod cons this isn't it. Hotel 41 relies on the hotel next door (The Ruben) for a lot of its services which makes the hotel incredibly inefficient. Things you take for granted in other hotels are an absolute chore here (and the staff make it feel that way too). The porter has to run from the hotel next door to greet you if he's not too busy and food takes forever to arrive either to your room or in the club lounge. If you just need a nice looking room for a night this fits the bill - otherwise look elsewhere - there are much better alternatives for the same price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We loved every minute Before we even arrived at 41, I'd had numerous communications with Chantal, the resident manager. Our emails had been so warm that I felt my 23 year old daughter and I were arriving in London to meet a friend. We were not disappointed. Chantal was wonderful (including being a surrogate doting mom to me when I arrived at the hotel suffering from food poisoning- she personally brought me chicken soup!) I've never felt more at home in a hotel than at this one. Our suite was perfect, from the heated towel rack and enormous tub in the bathroom, to the overall stunning decor. The beds were comfy and cozy and the room had lots of high tech appointments (tons of light switches!). Breakfasts were plentiful and good. I'd recommend this hotel in a heartbeat.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Exemplary Accommodations  London was the final destination of our trip before returning home to the U.S. This was a casual business trip taken by my wife and I along with two employees. We were met with an attitude of sincere graciousness and hospitality. The hotel staff was friendly and eager to assist no matter the question or challenge we posed to them. The overall atmosphere was top notch and the rooms were outstanding. The private lounge was a very relaxing rallying point for our group that provided for conversation and/or access to high speed internet. I honestly cannot think of a single constructive criticism that would contribute to this company's performance. We will be back and encourage others to enjoy the experience whether in London for business or pleasure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful Staff From the minute we arrived the service was wonderful. Whilst checking in, we were offered a glass of wine and then we were shown our room. Not the biggest room we have stayed in (Paris can beat that hands down) but there was everything we could possibly have needed. Spotless and very comfortable!Within walking distance of Buckingham Palace and theatres it was very nice to just stroll around and not have to look for a taxi. The Victoria theatre was a five minute walk where we saw Billy Elliot.....Fantastic. A stroll home afterwards to a nice cosy lounge and a nightcap! :o) Breakfasts were excellent! No need for lunch as we strolled around sightseeing. It almost felt like we had stayed there before as we felt so welcomed and we will definitely stay there again!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Luxurious stay at Hotel 41 My wife and I stayed at the hotel in May to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. The room was excellent and had the most comfortable beds we have ever slept in. All staff were excellent, friendly and very attentive. They were always willing to assist in any way they could. On our first night's stay we arrived back at the room to find rose petals scattered around the room and bath, together with numerous lit candles. Chocalate covered strawberries had also been provided. These were really lovely touches given that it was our silver wedding anniversary. It just demonstrated how thoughtful and caring they are in looking after their guests. We ate at Reubens Library restaurant next door and were equally well looked after.We would recommend both to anyone.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Ab fab!! If you are thinking about staying at this hotel, stop thinking and just do it because there is no way you will be disappointed! I would agree with a previous reviewer that booking through the hotel website will most likely give you the best deal. There are various tempting packages on offer. We stayed in an executive room and had complimentary wireless internet and english breakfast included. The staff were very attentive and polite, without being stuffy. I was a bit dubious about the compact communal lounge area, but as the hotel doesnot seem to encourage access to non-residents, this area serves its multiple functions very well. I am absolutely besotted with this hotel and thoroughly recommend it to anyone who wants a personalised hotel experience, and not made to feel like just another paying guest.</p></li>

My husband and I stayed here both pre and post cruise when we took our cruise on the Queen Mary 2 this August. From the second we arrived the service was impeccable. We were offered a cold drink, asked if we needed any dinner plans, and were given a hot towel. It was more like a family member greeting us than hotel staff. The room was a delight! (a little small like all european hotels) and one of the best equipped rooms I ever stayed in. There was everything from 2 different types of bath robes to even a pencil sharpener in the desk drawer. The bed was comfortable with 350+ theard count sheets. I can go on and on about the room. Even at turn down, they left a lighted candle in the bathroom and glasses of fresh bottled water at the bed side. If you are discerning clientele this hotel is for you!!</p></li>

Upon arrival they gave us a glass of Champagne and we sat in the lounge while the finshing touches were done to the room. I asked for the 'romantic turndown' to be done for arrival and this was excellent......rose petals all over the room, fire place, more champagne and candles. The room itself was great with a massive bed and the bathroom had a wonderful shower as well as a bath. You get a feeling of real modern luxury with the black and white theme. The hotel is only a 3 minute walk to the tube station and right next door to buckingham palace.We had breakfast in the morning which was included in the package and was again excellent.I would suggest booking directly through the hotel website as they seem to offer the best rates. All in all a great experience and an excellent hotel for couples.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Reviews are Absolutely On Target Our 6 night stay at Hotel 41 in early August was the key to a memorable London trip. I was a first time Tripadvisor user and suspicious that the site had been Amazon'd with phony reviews. Hotel 41 absolutely lives up to the raves. We slept extremely well due to wonderful beds and a quiet location (interior courtyard room for 4 nights and facing the Buckingham Palace Mews for 2) My husband  I still long for the terrific bathrooms and deluge showers. Our 8 year old son was made to feel at home by the caring staff (who indulged him with fresh-made fruit smoothies and happily compared notes on favorite Gameboy games). The spacious common library was a welcome refuge for all of us throughout the day. We found the location (5 minutes walk to Victoria tube) quite convenient. There is no question that we will return again and again to Hotel 41.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Friendly, personalised service If you are looking for service that not only gives you a smile, but surpasses you expectations, this is the place for you. We stayed over Christmas and had a lovely time. The hotel takes well behaved dogs, so we were allowed to share the holiday with our dog. The room was well appointed and spacious. The lounge was a great place to relax by the fire after a day walking around the city. This is a good place for tourists and has some of the best business facilities that I have seen. (Even though it was Christmas, we had to keep in touch with clients). There are excellent transport links close by and if you are travelling with the dog, two of the prettiest parks in London are a short stroll away.We travel to London frequently and have stayed in other 5 star hotels. 41 is the best. We will be returning again, and recommend this property highly.</p></li>

The bathroom was beautiful , the staff genuinely friendly and very knowledgable and all very well groomed.The breakfast room was great, we also had a quick room service meal on our arrival which was wonderful.The location is great just behind Buckingham Palace.It is just what i imagined a British Boutique Hotel to look like.Yes it is exspensive but London is the most exspensive city for hotels at the moment and you have to pay top dollar for anything good in London.It was wet and cold and after a tourism day we got back in our room and did not want to leave to Mr. Chow for dinner.Just great.</p></li>

On arrival we took the lift to the check in desk where we were met by friendly and warm staff.Our room was upgraded free of charge to a split level suite, which was being made ready as we arrived. To pass the time we had afternoon Tea in the lounge, by the fire place accompanied with a couple of glasses of Champagne.Once ready we were shown to our room, which had the wow factor and every possible luxury. The room was clean and had plenty of space including a massive bed and an ensuite bathroom with two showers.In the lounge is a bar which has a range of complimentary drinks and snacks as well as a help yourself honesty system if you wanted something stronger.All in all a great stay and had the feel of a home from home so we will definately be back in the new year to celerbrate something else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderful, cozy rooms at 41 We stayed at Hotel 41 in late September based on reviews from this site and were very pleased with our choice. After long days of touring London, it was such a treat to come home to our wonderful room. The bed, with its fluffy white duvet and pillows, was so comfortable and inviting. Every evening when we'd return to our room, the bed had been turned down, slippers and robes were laid out, and soft classical music was playing on the bedside radio. A floating candle was lit in the bathroom and a tray of canapes was left on the table. It was such a treat and so soothing!The only thing that was possibly a negative for us was how quiet the whole place is. We rarely ran into other guests, even in the executive lounge. This could be a plus for some, but we prefer a little more lively atomosphere. But the rooms were so wonderful (staff great too) that we would stay there again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic Experience! My husband and I stayed for a couple nights in London after our trip to Paris and had a wonderful stay. The staff is very attentive and they tend to your every need. My husband needed a band aid and with in virtually seconds they were at our room with several band aid options!The room was nicely decorated - lots of attention to detail. We had booked the Romance Package and when we got home from a night out our room was sprinkled with rose petals, soft music, massage oil and candles. It was so beautiful and a lovely way to end the evening!You do at times feel more like you are at home rather than in a hotel. The Executive Lounge is a wonderful place to sip a glass of champagne, read a magazine and relax outside of your hotel room.The location was great - we walked most places since the weather was nice. You can virtually get anywhere in just a few minutes via cab.If you are looking for a flawless experience stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Wonderfully Relaxing After a previous slightly disappointing stay we were invited back by the lovely manager, Andrew, so the hotel could prove itself to us. And it did! Our room was beautifully comfortable and elegantly appointed. From the moment we arrived, every member of staff was attentive without going over the top. Andrew made every effort to ensure we enjoyed our stay and another member of staff, Ashley, also deserves mention as being kind and attentive to us. The 'plunder the pantry' idea is wonderful for post-theatre snacks and sitting having a drink in front of the fire in the beautiful library is just superb. The breakfast was superb (go for the buffet, it is brilliant!) and we just had the most relaxing time. I would definitely return here and our previous stay was obviously just a blip. All establishments can have off days, the mark of a manager is how he deals with problems and Andrew dealt with ours perfectly. Stay here if you can, it's worth every penny!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Location! One-night stay while returning from a tour of the UK, with my wife. Due to some sort of problem with Expedia's reservation system (I think they oversold), we were upgraded to a junior suite. Wow! It was two stories (though 6'2 ceilings on the top story), gas fireplace, sitting room, and a super bathroom with separate tub  shower.This location is just a few blocks from Victoria Station in one direction, and Buckingham Palace in the other direction. It's several stories up on a very busy street, so you can hear some street noises.The hotel is very nicely decorated. A feature is a sitting room, which doubles as the reception area and breakfast area. Enjoyable and, again, nicely decorated. It looks like the 15' ceilings allowed rooms to be split into two stories, as for our suite.The street noises and relatively cramped feeling of the hotel (narrow hallways, short ceilings) were the only real drawbacks I noticed. Overall, this is a top-quality hotel in a very desirable location.</p></li>

<li>It was two stories (though 6'2 ceilings on the top story), gas fireplace, sitting room, and a super bathroom with separate tub  shower.This location is just a few blocks from Victoria Station in one direction, and Buckingham Palace in the other direction.</br>

<li>It's several stories up on a very busy street, so you can hear some street noises.The hotel is very nicely decorated.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Fantastic I travel frequently for business, and am always staying in hotels. I can safely say that this hotel is the best I have ever stayed in. The service is very personalised, everyone knows your name, you are made to feel as if you are the most important guest they have ever had staying there. The resident manager, Chantal, takes an interest in each guest, and takes time to chat with you. The rooms are really luxurious, each with its own computer. Strikingly decorated in black and white, someone comes around each evening with an icebucket for any drinks you intend on mixing, as well as to turn down your bed, etc. There is a pantry, which is great for after you have been out or at a show, to come back at midnight and have all this really healthy food in a refrigerator in the lounge. The location is fantastic - directly opposite Buckingham Palace, no less on the boundary of exclusive Belgravia. And the clincher - you will get more bang for your buck here than staying at the Dorchestor or Claridges.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">All the comforts you need Stayed at Hotel 41 end of March, beginning of April 2005. Staff is incredibly helpful and accomodating. Chantal, PJ, Tonya, and Pierre made our stay lovely. Hotel 41 occupies one floor of the Reubens hotel. It is very intimate, quiet and enjoyable. Because this was off peak travel time, I was able to get a room for around $325 a night through Expedia. Usually, the rooms start well over $400. Rooms are elegant and the bathroom is very spacious by European standards. The best part of all is the Executive Lounge. Continental breakfast is included in nightly rate. Later in the evening they also provide cheeses, fruit, ham, bread, nuts and chips. Very easy to make yourself a sandwich if you don't feel like eating out. Easy access to Victoria Underground station. Walking distance to many theaters and attractions. The executive lounge also has a computer station available, free of charge, with internet access. It is rare to find so many extras included in such a distinctive, elegant hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A Hotel to Remember Luxurious and lavish accommodations made our two night hotel stay a memorable one. The welcoming hotel staff, awesome room amenities, and cozy bed helped make our visit to London enjoyable. The extra touches including a complimentary bowl of fruit, bottled water placed at your nighstand in the evening during turndown, night light in bathroom and the whatever whenever button available for our every need contributed to making our stay from great to outstanding. The comfortable and cozy bed provided one of our best night's sleep which was genuinely needed after two weeks in Europe. The location was perfect as our first tour was right across the street at Buckingham Palace. There were restaurants, shops and transportion close by including the tube and Victoria Station. This hotel has made it to the top of our best hotels to stay at and we are looking forward to staying there on our next visit. Although the price is overly expensive, we got our money's worth and will always remember our stay at the Hotel 41.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very poor service for a 5 star hotel This hotel has many positive attributes that you can find by reading other reviews on this site. It is beautiful, has a refined atmosphere, and is in an excellent location. The reason I gave Hotel 41 such a poor review has to do with service. After checking out and arriving back in the United States in late July 2008, my wife realized that she left behind a pair of shorts. We called Hotel 41 staff two times and e-mailed them three times. On three separate occasions in September and early October, staff members e-mailed my wife that the shorts were being sent in the mail from London to the United States. The shorts have not arrived as of early November. Obviously, the shorts are not being sent to us even though three separate assurances were made that the shorts would be sent. I realize this is not monumental, but in general, first class hotels are rated as such because of excellent service (in addition to well above average amenities). Please judge for yourself if this is first class service.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Royal family should stay here. My husband, myself and our 13 year-old daughter stayed here for 4 nights in May, 2004. Our niece and her 13 year-old daughter joined us a day later. We did not arrive till midnight our 1st night, very tired and much needing a bed. We were greeted very warmly and immediately checked into our room. Our room was beautiful. Small, but everything we could want was there. The bathroom was just awesome. The beds were the best we found during our 11 day stay in England. Breakfast was the same everyday and limited, but we found items we liked. The receptionist/concierge , Chantal, was very helpful and very friendly. They say that location is everything, and we believe it. We were a block from the tube station and a block from the palace. We were able to take walks in the evening by the palace, thru the parks and out into the city very easily. The only complaints were that the drink prices were a little high and a complaint from the 13 year-old's that there was no instant messenger service on the computer.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'll never forget London!!!! I visited London for the very first time in March 2008 and only stayed for four days and three nights. I'm soooo thankful I chose to go with a friend's reccomendation and stayed at Hotel 41. The experience was unforgettable and a large part had to do with the fabulous staff whom were all attentive to our every need in a non-smothering way. They were all very cordial and knowledgable about their city, eventhough 70% of them were born and raised in other countries outside of the UK. If we asked them a question that they didn't know the answer to, they told us they would get back to us, and they always did, with the right answer! Not to mention, most the staff is comprised of young people in their early to mid-twenties and yet they were so refined and cordial you would have easily suspected they were long time veterans in the hotel industry. Room service was great, the location is great (right behind Buckingham Palace) and the staff is wonderful!!! My next trip to London will definitely include a stay at Hotel 41.</p></li>

Having read previous reviews before the trip, I wondered if Hotel 41 could be as exceptional as described. I am happy to say that it deserves all the praise and high ratings. The room was as expected, very comfortable and tastefully appointed. The bed was heaven at the end of a long day. I would have liked free internet access in the room, but the business center is very convenient and was always available. The housekeeping staff does a great job of making sure that you'll miss your hotel room once you've returned home.What sets this hotel apart is the staff. They are a superb group that caters to all your needs. Everyone was friendly without feeling forced.The location isn't perfect for late night activities as it's pretty quiet on buckingham palace road after dark. But at the same time, it's probably the safest place you can be in all of London. Everything is just a short walk away and, with Victoria tube station just around the corner, whatever you can't walk to is easily reached by the underground in minutes.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Quintessentially English We stayed at this hotel for only one night, and it was definitely too short an experience! We would have asked to stay another night but unfortunately we had to leave that day.The service and the smiles that you get with it are the characteristics that set this hotel apart. You get the feeling that the staff are really looking out for you, and genuinely want to to make your stay exceptional. There is no austerity nor pretentiousness about the place.We stayed in an executive double, which was small but perfectly formed. The room reflected on the hotel as a whole: quintessentially english but with all modern conveniences and luxuries too. I particularly liked the fact that nothing was stingy - there were more than ample toiletries (Penhaligon's), complimentary snacks etc. We went out after a light tea and returned at midnight starving so plunder the pantry was fantastic for us; the breakfast was also delicious.All in all, this hotel is onto a winner: 5 star facilities and service, in a great location, with a distinctly personal touch!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Appalingly poor service and tiny rooms I haven't written a review for some time, but felt after what i had experienced i should put pen to paper. If you dont mind paying 拢250.00 for a room that is clean, pleasantly decorated and are not looking for anything else then this might be the hotel for you. However if you expect to be able to get out of either side of the bedwhen the curtains are shut, require an edible breakfast and competentstaff, then you will be as bitterly disappointed with this hotel as i was. From the ridiculously laid out room, to no turn down service, to neither of the papers we had requested being delivered in the morningeven after complaining the list goes on and on. But the piece de resistance was being presented with a cold preformed, precooked rubber pancake for breakfast, which i promptly sent back to be returned hot, yet ended up waiting around an hour for a new one before giving up on breakfast entirely. No appology given by any member of staff, who seemed to busy chatting to each other than to their guests.Would i return - not on your nelly!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Faultless! We spent 5 wonderful days in London in August 2008, and Hotel 41 helped make the visit out of this world. The hotel is well situated very close to Buckingham Palace, and an easy walk to Trafalgar Square and on to Covent Garden and the West End. It is also only a couple of minutes walk from Victoria Station.The Hotel is almost invisible from outside (we asked cab drivers to take us to the Rubens Hotel, Hotel 41's sister hotel, which is right next door).You could not be made to feel more welcome. The whatever, whenever button on the room phone reflects the hotel staff's willingness to make your stay as perfect as possible. The rooms are well equipped with iPod docking stations and a series of complimentary extras are offered on the hotel website, including a choice of pillow types.The executive lounge is wonderfully decorated and the larder is stocked with delicious complimentary snacks.Don't get me wrong, the rates at the hotel are by no means the cheapest you will find in London - but if you are looking for that special get-away, you won't go wrong with Hotel 41.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sleeping on a cloud My husband and I recently visited London and stayed at this lovely botique hotel for a return visit. The experience was even better than our first stay, we were welcomed as if we were returning to our home. The staff is wonderfully attentive, without being cloying, a welcome drink is served in the lounge, where you can totally relax by the fire, or use the business center to catch up on e mails etc. The lounge also serves tasty canapes in the early evening. The staff is truly able to obtain a reservation at most any place you wish to dine, or show you wish to see; and it is made clear that it is truly is their pleasure to help you. The location of the hotel puts you in an easy walk or cab ride to everything.The room are lovely always with a delicious fruit tray upon arrival and but the really exceptional features are the beds. It is the best sleep and rest I have ever had while travelling!!!! The sheets and linnens are cloud - like. The baths are exceptional containing everything you need to complete a restful stay. I am looking forward to another return visit</p></li>

Great location, service is a good as you'd expect for this type of hotel - discrete, polite and prompt. Very clean and comfortable.It gets 3 stars from me because it delivers what I expect from a world leading hotel.But, I almost gave the hotel 2 stars because of some little things, for example :Internet access is no longer free. This used to be complementary, but now they charge for it. Not big thing I know, but it was one of the USP's of this hotelThe fire in our room didn't work. House keeping were quick to come  fix it, but she couldn't get it to work. We never heard from anyone else again about it and as far as I know it still doesn't work.You can listen to a wide variety of music through the TV from the hotel jukebox, but for 拢2.99 per CD.The hotel seems to be losing the little things which made it stand out from the competition and some of it feels like penny pinching. When staying in top class hotels ( 拢400+ per night ) I expect some of the services which the big chains charge for are included in the price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A bit disappointed! I was quite disappointed with our stay at Hotel 41. I think what caused this was that the website promises comfort after comfort. Little things like jelly beans and coffee making facilities in the rooms which weren't there to bigger things like not bringing us our champagne that was part of our package or having a non-working fireplace led to an overall feeling of dissatisfaction. The website promises fresh flowers and a DVD player in every room, which we had neither. There was no afternoon tea, which was specifially mentioned in our package. The personal butler who is supposed to see to all your needs was a very nice young man, but obviously wasn't trained on mixing drinks. No CD or DVD library, also high-lighted on the website. The plunder the pantry consisted of some pretzel mix and a couple mini snickers bars set out on a glass plate. Little disappointment after little disappointment led to our being two very unhappy guests.The rooms were gorgeous, and the bathroom was luxurious, but we would never stay there again. They promise a lot, but the only thing they can deliver is very nice rooms.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A most pretentious hotel Was expecting something really special based on reviews on this website but was hugely disappointed. Room was small with poor natural light from window to one side of a huge and ugly piece of furniture containing the TV. It was only just possible to walk round the king sized bed.Also, hardly any wardrobe hanging space due to another large piece of furniture containg a safe. TV reception was poor with inferior Philips LCD picture quality and the whole system was overcomplicated.Bathroom was well kitted out but again was small. My main complaint about the room however was the noise from people moving along the adjacent main corridor and an intermittant but loud plumbing rumble. These noises combined to disturb me throughout the night. The 'executive' lounge is too small to enjoy a quiet drink without being on top of other guests. The receptionists desk is located there further reducing the available space.Most of the books on display are fake which sums up this place.Breakfast however was good. Try staying at the Chancery Court hotel in Holborn as that is really a luxury hotel with decent sized rooms.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Loved this small charming hotel I loved this hotel it was more then I expected. The service was very personal and the staff did everything they could to help you with whatever you needed. There were four of us so we had two rooms the room we had was lovely with a small fireplace and sitting area and a very nice bathroom with everything you could ask for. Our sons room was a little bit smaller but just as nice. Our room was 4101 and our sons was 4102. The little things they did really made it lovely like lighting a floating candle in the bathroom at night when they turned down your bed and speaking of the beds they were the best we had on our 3 week trip from the two pillows each to the big fluffy duvet we slept so well. We stayed for 4 nights - whenever we go back to London this will be our hotel of choice. It is only 28 rooms if you want personal service with alot of charm then this is the place for you. We loved it - you cann't go wrong if you choose this hotel. I booked it after reading the reviews - the people that gave it a bad rating must have stayed at a different hotel then we did. I cann't say enough about this hotel it was excellent.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Best Hotel in London There is a reason why this hotel was voted so high up on the 100 Greatest Hotels in the world. I cant say enough good things about this hotel. My wife and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary and it was a great experience.The best feature of the hotel is the staff. EVERYONE went out of their way to make you feel welcomed. Chantal and Antoinette were exceptional, friendly and responsive to all our needs. The morning breakfast really was great with many things to choose from. The Library is a nice quiet area to relax. Free high speed internet is located in each room and the rooms arer nicely decorated. The room was a tad small but if that is the worst I can say then that is saying something. The hotel restaurant in the connecting hotel the Rubens was a bit pricey so we traveled over to the connecting B Bar. The food and service in the B Bar was absolutely great. The hotel is located near Victoria Station so you can take the Gatwick Express and walk two blocks. The central area to all attractions is a big plus. Again I cant say enough about how truly amazing this hotel is. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for perfection!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Satisfied, not overwhelmed..... I normally stay at the Lanesborough when in London however following great reviews of Hotel 41 on Trip Advisor I thought I would try it.Hmmm, nice enough but I didn't quite see what made others on this site so estatic. The staff were very good which as we all know is a rareity in London. The food in the Library Bar was good but should have been at the fairly high prices. The Superior Room I booked was quite small but nicely furnished. The TV reception was poor and the remote had no backing so the batteries kept slipping out. When I mentioned it the staff quickly brought another but it didn't work either. The TV reception was so poor so it didn't really matter anyway I suppose. We had breakfast in the Hotel 41 (not in the Library Bar which is really another hotel next door / part of the same building) and this involves ordering from the menu which I suppose means it gets cooked next door. The omlette was quite nice and probably had been hot when it started its journey to me but was cool by the time it arrived - not quite 4* service.I may stay here again if on business and want to save 拢100 over the Lanesborough but then again, probably not.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Chantal made our stay!! We stayed for just one night at the hotel and wished we could have stayed longer. Chantal welcomed us on arrival and we were shown our rooms. From the outset we were given the impression that nothing was too much trouble. All the little extras were duly noticed. It's nice to stay at a hotel that isn't impersonal and I can't reccommend this highly enough. We never stay at a hotel twice as we are a bit picky and always find something to moan about, be it the mildew around the bath or the shards of glass left on bathroom floors. I can quite honestly say that I couldn't find anything to complain about. We really enjoyed our trip to London. (If you like peppermint tea try theirs!!) We seriously plundered the pantry on our return from seeing Cirque du Soleil at the Albert Hall, and it was a lovely end to the evening.The Tower of London is well worth a visit and costs 拢14 for adults. Buckingham Palace is open from September and we will return to visit it.Please note ladies that during sale season shops open at 11am!! and 12 noon on Sundays. (Not at 10 as I thought).Chantal if you ever read this....you make the hotel what it is thank you for being so kind to us.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stay here and not anywhere else! Spent one night for my 40th birthday at the wonderful 41 in Victoria (Buckingham Palace Road). Having only 18 rooms means that the service is personal at all times. All staff know, and address you by, your name. Constant supply of fresh towels. A nice selection of fresh fruit in the room too. The bathrooom was stunning with an amazing walk in shower plus full bath with yet another shower. The bed - where do I start? Huge, sumptuous, incredibly comfotable, lovely bed linen. Lovely selection of freshly squeezed juices for breakfast, starbucks coffee, leaf tea and whatever combination of breakfast items you desire. We checked out at 11am but they were happy to look after our bags until later in the day. In fact we returned, exhausted having trawled round London at 6ish. They insisted we sit down and chill out in the lounge for a while and brought us coffee and biscuits for no charge. OK, yes it is expensive at 拢300 a night or thereabouts. But plenty of London hotels charge that amount of money and do not give the kind of service or attention to detail that the 41 gives. 41 is a haven of tranquility just a stones throw from hustle and bustle of central London.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Gorgeous Hotel! This was without doubt the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Not only is it beautifully clean and well looked after, the room was gorgeous and very stylish and the staff are so polite, interested and very keen to be of service. The attention to detail is fantastic and the food is delicious! We stayed there on our wedding night and the following night before flying off on our honeymoon. When we arrived in our room at 1am. The lights were dimmed and lighted candles in lovely red glasses had been placed throughout the room. Petals scattered everywhere, including a heart shape of petals on the bed! Classical music was playing and there was a bottle of veuve clicquot on ice (we booked a sparkle weekend which included a bottle of champagne - I have never known a hotel to serve veuve clicquot as part of a booking deal - what class!). It was a perfect end to a perfect day. We had also booked breakfast as part of our booking deal which they happily served the next day in our room - again room service breakfast, in our experience, has always been extra but not in this case!Even if it is not your wedding night the hotel is fantastic and we would, with out doubt, highly recommend it!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Unbelievable london hotel We stayed here on our wedding night for two nights and had a fantastic experience that we will remember for the rest of our lives.We arrived around 2am after our wedding reception had finished. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the butler/receptionist who congratulated us and took us straight to our room. The room had been decorated with rose petals on the bed and bunches of roses, floating candles everywhere! Very romantic and just what we needed to end a very exciting day.We informed our butler that we were absolutley starving (having eaten very little at the reception) and she quickly put together a tray of goodies (cheese, toast, chocolates, yoghurts etc) and brought it to our room.The bed was the most comfortable bed on the planet! The bathroom equisite - two showers, heated towel rail, large sink, lots of lotions etc.In the morning we were brought breakfast in bed, I was still sleeping, and didn't even notice the butler bringing in our breakfast and placing it on the bed in time for me to wake up. The breakfast is huge and delicious. I really didn't feel like I was in the middle of central london.We would definately stay here again, just need another excuse given that we actually live in London.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our wonderful home away from home We spent 7 wonderful nights at the Hotel 41 the first week in September celebrating our 41st anniversary. The hotel and the staff made our stay better than we could have ever hoped for. Chantal and her staff made for a fun, relaxing stay. After long days of seeing the sights of London it was always a real treat to return the 41. The moment we walked through the private entrance we felt like we returned home, safe and secure. Our room was luxurious comfort with a wonderful bed. The free wireless internet was fast and the flat panel TV was a pleasure to watch. Any request we made were taken care of quickly and always with smiles. The morning breakfasts were a great relaxing way to start each day. Wonderful food and conversations with the staff about what we had planned for the day.We found the location ideal. Close to Victoria Station for the Tube and a block from Buckingham Palace and St. James Park for a walk. We saw Wicked while we were there and the theater was a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Lots of shopping and dinning options close to the hotel.It was by far the best hotel stay we have ever experienced anywhere. We really look forward to our next trip to London so we can stay at the 41 again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Perfection!!! Stayed at the Hotel 41 for the first 3 nights of our European honeymoon and found it to be the best hotel either of us have ever stayed in. You feel as though you're staying at a private club and the service from all staff members was excellent. The room was very nice and a very good size. The bathroom contained both a tub and seperate shower with a huge powerful showerhead (high-end toiletries were also provided). As it was our honeymoon, we were given a welcoming bottle of champagne (Veuve - not the cheap stuff I expected). The hotel's location was very good - 3 minute walk to Victoria tube and the Palace. The breakfast included was a very good continental (cereal, fruit, yogurt, pastires etc.). You can order a full breakfast from the Rubens Hotel (sister hotel attached to 41) kitchen but you'll pay dearly - 15 pounds! We had a dinner in the Library restaurant and high tea in the Lounge of Rubens - both were excellent. We saw the Billy Elliot musical which is playing at a theatre 5 minutes from 41 - it was very good and highly recommended. Elton John wrote the music and was sitting 5 rows behind us on the night we were there. If you would like a small intimate hotel in a great location with great service stay at the 41!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Outstanding hotel..... We stayed here for the weeked in March 2008 to celebrate my birthday - my husband booked this as a surprise and I was definitley not disappointed. The hotel is fabulous and is worthy of its 5 star status. We stayed in an executive king room which was outstanding. They had a birthday cake and champage in the room, with lots of extra little touches such as fresh fruit, bucket of ice, little bowls of olives. There was 3 plasma tv's in the room, including 1 in the bathroom!They really go out there way to make you feel at home. The bed was huge and so comfortable. They turned it down for you at night and left a little bottle of lavendar mist on your pillow. They also put a little card on top of the bed with the next day's weather forecast and left fresh towels in the bathroom twice a day. I cannot say enough about the personal touches. They greet by your name and cannot do enough to ensure you enjoy your stay. They do this very well without making you feel uncomfortable. As expected, the hotel is in a great location. With Buckingham Palace literally being on your doorstep. This is an excellent hotel and surpassed my expectations. I cannot recommend it enough and will definitley go back soon.Book this hotel with confidence. You will not be disappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Beautiful hotel We stayed in this hotel for one night in November and it was fantastic from the second we arrived. The hotel staff were excellent and made us feel welcome and relaxed throughout our stay. I have stayed in 5 star hotels before and have sometimes felt uncomfortable by the snobby attitudes of some of the hotel staff when they know that you have booked the hotel at a discounted rate and are not as wealthy as some of the other guests. That was far from the case in hotel 41. We were given complimentary champagne when we checked in and then taken to a beautiful room overlooking buckingham palace. The room was immaculate and had all mordern facitlites you would expect and more. The shower was incredible! Our breakfast was inluded and we were told we could have it in the room for no extra charge. We simply filled in our breakfast choices and hung it on the door before we went to bed with the time we wanted it to arrive. The next morning it was brought to the room exactly at the time we ordered - delicious! The location of the hotel is perfect, just a few minutes walk from victoria station and the underground. There are also lots of resturants surounding the hotel which offer lots of choice if you want to eat out.  I cannot praise this hotel enough it was well worth the money and was a treat for both of us. I would definately stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Amazing Service, Fabulous English Charm Planning our first trip to London was quite overwhelming. What part of town should we stay in? What amenities are most important? How do you make a choice, easy, count on the Tripadvisor community. If it weren't for Tripadvisor, we would have never found the most amazing hotel. Located on Buckingham Palace Road, we were perfectly situated to see the city. Prior to our arrival, we were contacted by the amazing manager, Chantal. She met every need before and during our stay. Personalized service is what she specializes in. We were greeted by a doorman who knew our names. We were taken up the elevator to a beautiful room with mahogany wood, a fireplace, a library, beverages, snacks and much more. We enjoyed breakfast here each morning. The honor bar was fabulous, although the staff butlers never allowed us to carry a drink to our room! The rooms are beautiful black and white marble. Bowls of apples filled the hallways. Housekeeping and turn down service were impeccable. The rooms are air conditioned (not common in London) which was very important as we experienced more than a week of very warm weather. Every question was always answered, every need was always met from theatre tickets to child care to dinner reservations. The 41 Hotel is truly amazing (recently listed in Travel  Leisure's best 500 hotels in the world).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Very good hotel Stayed here recently for one night, weekend break in London to see Billy Elliot - great location as the Victoria Palace theatre is practically next door.The hotel has a very clubby atmosphere, all the staff were very polite and you really felt as though nothing was too much trouble (the room service button on the telephone in your room is called 'whatever, whenever').Loved the special touches, like complimentary supper and a help-yourself-but-put-it-in-the-honesty-book, and the turn-down service was spectacular, as hotels go - candle lit in the bathroom, tv remote and tv guide open on correct night, slippers and robes laid out, soft music switch on. Very nice indeed!If I had to be picky, I could say that the rooms are a little small, and some of the room service items listed as available for 24 hours were not - but I am being picky, and didn't think to even mention it on checkout.If you go for the pre-theatre dinner at the Old Masters restaurant (attached to the hotel) be aware that it's a carvery only affair, and we did feel a little over dressed. I'd have preferred a more intimate, restaurant meal, but in the end again I had no complaint - the roast rib of beef was superb! I would consider staying at this hotel again. It is a fraction out of the way, being up the wrong side of Buckingham Palace, which meant a few walks down the Mall to a more lively environment, but all in all it's a very good hotel, very smart. Staff make you feel special, and not so expensive either. Recommended!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a gem!! I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The staff were very courteous, friendly and seemed genuinely interested in each guest. They remembered earlier conversations and picked up on them later.We arrived early afternoon  so our room was not ready(checkout is not until noon); we were offered a glass of champagne  were happy to pass a plesant hour in the lounge reading the paapers.We had a room overlooking the palace (and would strongly recommend that you request this). It was pristine and, although the decor was black and whire, it was a warm and inviting room. The lighting system was unfathomable as the bathroom light that we'd turned off when we went to bed was mirculously on the following morning. This is by no means a criticism as the mood lighting was excellent - just an observation and a challenge to crack!Nothing was too much trouble and often the staff outnumbered the guests in the executive lounge .We stayed for the weekend of the concerts in Hyde Park and made full use of the butler's pantry when returning each evening. The spread was superb; meat,cheese, fish and shell fish, followed by fresh fruit. With a large glass of red wine from the honesty bar this made for a perfect end to a perfect evening!The continental breakfast was magnificant; simple but first class in every way.Andrew, the manager, went out of his way to make guests feel welcome, in a quiet gentle way - he never appeared hurried and seemed to be on duty from dawn until midnight!Yes, it is expensive, but it is very special and I will return as soon as funds allow.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Superb hotel and suite 41 is an excellent hotel, offering something different than the larger london hotels. The hotel is entirely set on the 5th Floor of 41 Buckingham Palace Road ( it used to be the grand ballroom for the Ruebens next door).Everthing is based around the Excecutive Lounge which has the feeling of and Gentlemans Club. Breakfast is served, as well as evening drinks, and if you are feeling peckish at any time you can 'raid the pantry'.We had a split level suite, which had a small seeting area downstairs with a desk, chairs and a flat screen TV. This area was overlooked by a small gallery which was the bedroom. The bed was hugely comfortable. There was another flat screen TV in the bedroom.The bathroom was very large. A very good size walk in shower with very good pressure. The jacuzzi bath was wonderfull. Very long, wide, deep and another flat screen TV to watch while you soaked.Staff are attentive, but not intrusive, making the effort to remember names. We had a 'Romantic' Turn Down Service which consisted of a heart made from rose petals on the bed, as well as two roses, bottled water and the next days weather forecast. Also canpes are offered in your room early evening which was a very nice touch.The only fault we had was at breakfast. I had to ask for an English breakfast (rather than being asked for an order) and when it arrived it was pretty much stone cold. They staff were of course extremely apologetic and immediately offered a fresh replacement.Overall this is a superb choice if you want that personal touch, in intermit surroundings.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Both a warm and professional experience My husband and I just stayed at the 41 Hotel in London for four nights and enjoyed a wonderful experience. We usually stay at the Capital but had heard of the many positive attributes of the 41 and wanted a change. The aesthetics encompassing the overall hotel design and culinary skills are admirable. The hotel staff is definately not the usual superficial standard of a large hotel, but that of the stature of a Relais  Chateau style of affiliation. Warm, hard working and knowledgeable, they are professionally trained beyond what we have come to expect nowadays. There are many nice touches such as in the evening, ice and a small tray of olives, lemon/lime slices are left in your room in case you would like to prepare a drink. During turn down service, a floating candle is lit in the bathroom along with some soft jazz playing, a fire turned on in the small gas fireplace and the lights dimmed...not to mention the fantastic bed and plush linens.The only potential drawback if any is the gorgeous but small public area which does not provide any privacy. Also, the plunder the pantry idea is a nice one, however somewhat confusing. The clientele is upscale and relaxed, but most of us were perplexed (and embarassed to ask) about the set up in general. The hotel and food prices are very high and most items in the pantry including water, soft drinks and the like are not gratis as is standard in concierge spaces. Management would be smart to rethink this as it slightly cheapens their overall 5 star service. This is a small but important factor.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It's undeniably the best Hotel 41 the manager and the staff should be praised for such high levels of service they set. Upon booking in we we're provided with true silver service, my wife and I wanted to take the hop on, hop off bus to get acqainted withthe city. Upon mentioning it to one of the staff, this lovely girl immediately organised our tickets and promptly showed us where to meet the bus and main attractions worth visiting.At Hotel 41, they certainly made my wife and I feel welcome and relaxed. The retaurant/library/check-in is very quaint but warm and friendly. Also the breakfast served was fantastic. The rooms were first class and every amenity you could possibly need on a holiday and somethings you thought you didn't need was provided.I also needed to arrange for a suitcase to be sent back to Melbourne as we we're well overweight with our luggage. I organised through reception to have my luggage sent unaccompanied. Again this wasn't too much for the staff, and upon returning to the hotel we we're informed that our luggage had been sent with complete details as to the time and the by whom. Again an amazing quality hotel with first class staff.The location is right opposite Buckingham Palace and just near Victoria Station a great location to get around. I do suggest that when sightseeing to access the hop on, hop off bus it's a great way to get your bearings and make your way around the city.This is one hotel I will definately continue to stay at when visiting London. Also Iwant to thank the staff for making my stay an amazing holiday break and making my wife and I feel very comfortable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A special place We stayed at 41 on a Saturday night for my partner's birthday treat. This is the second time we have been. We couldn't have chosen better- the service is 2nd to none. The staff are wonderful and cannot do enough to help make your stay special.The rooms, whilst not huge, are beautifully decorated and fitted out in black and white- very stylish. Our room had a working fireplace which made it feel so homely.The bathroom has a huge shower above the bath, another separate shower and luxury toiletries which smell gorgeous.We booked the romantic turndown and returned to our room to find flickering candles, rose petals, the fire blazing, massage oil and champagne. Absolute bliss!The breakfast is unbelievable, very tasty and loads of choice. The orange juice is freshly squeezed, the coffee excellent.The location is great, about 3 mins walk from Victoria station and at the front of the hotel, overlooks the Royal Mews. Buckingham Palace is less than 5 mins walk up the road.We had one problem during the night when an extractor fan above our room became faulty and woke us up making a horrendous noise. We contacted reception and within 20 mins it had been fixed. We were offered a glass of champagine each as an apology. As it was 1am we declined, but it was a lovely offer. We also had another apology from Antoinette in the morning. These things happen, and we understand that, but the staff dealt with the problem without fuss.So, in summary, if you are looking for somewhere special, this is the place. Not cheap, but worth the money, it will certainly be the place we go to for a treat, even if it means working overtime!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Brilliant small hotel with the best service anywhere.. My wife and I spent 5 days at 41 in May. We selected this hotel after extensive research and were not disappointed with what we found. We booked through the Unique Small Hotels website which worked fine.The service here is simply outstanding. All the staff are excellent but the Resident Manager, Chantal is brilliant. Not only does she bring a breath of charming energy and efficiency to the place but simply works hard to make you feel really welcome - My wife's birthday occurred while we were there and we came back from dinner to find the room sprinkled with rose petals - a Chantal touch that will bring us back.The hotel is small and clubby but seems to attract a cross section of guests across the age groups - no old gentlemans club feel here - just a nice intimate atmosphere where you feel that you are known after only 1 or 2 days in the placeWe had an Executive King room and yes - I agree with previous reviews that the room, whilst beautifully decorated and with a most comfortable bed (we had no issues with the black and white decor) is slightly on the small side, but the bathroom is great and the plumbing wonderfully effective for England. The Executive Lounge is a great place to end the day after pounding around London and compensates largely for the slightly small room. Breakfast is great and included the room rate, a real benefit. Location is fine - 3 minutes walk from Buckingham Palace and Victoria Station / underground and a beautiful 10-15 minute walk down Birdcage Walk to WestminsterNo - it's not cheap (but where in London is) and it does lack an on site gym, but if you want to stay at a large 5 star monolith then that's where you should be - for us- we would rather be at 41.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The nicest staff at the 41 and true 5 star quality service I travel a lot with my 18 months old daugher and we always stay at 5 star hotels. Because of that, we are used to good treatment and at least something resembling true luxury. I booked the 41 hotel in London through LuxuryLink and got a good deal on our stay, so I expected a somewhat lukewarm approach upon arrival, but my fears were completely ungrounded. Everybody at the hotel was incredibly welcoming and by the third day, I was looking forward to going home (the hotel) in the evening and have a tea at the fireplace. Despite the extra work my little daughter presented the staff with, nobody was ever dismissive or impatient with us; from the wonderful waiters to Uncle Andrew (the resident manager of the hotel, Andrew Gortchacow, who could not have been more perfect in any way - ever so kind and professional, he even went down to the store one night to buy a pacifier for my daughter!), everbody did their absolute best to make my stay with a toddler enjoyable. The food was good, the rooms were lovely, I liked the design and all the late night snacks we were provided with (such as olives and a fruit basket every evening); and, the location is excellent as well, the hotel being practically opposite Buckingham Palace. The hotel did a great job on booking us tours and helpings us with suggestions for sightseeing, and the staff even packed us a free lunch basket when we left for our trip (full of fruits and other snacks, things my daughter preferred to eat). All in all, this is a hotel best suited for people who want luxury but also a relaxed, romantic, super friendly atmosphere, along with a very well trained, accomodating staff. Thank you everyone at the 41 for making my birthday this year truly special - I can hardly wait to go back!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One of the best My wife and I stayed for one night in March (Saturday) and had an excellent stay. First, let me put my star rating in context - it is not my interpretation of how many stars it should have above its door or in a guide book. It is a rating relative to price and expectations. We had high expectations of the hotel and if it had met those expectations, we would have given it 3 stars (i.e. neutral, as expected). I only rate above 3 if the hotel exceeds expectations. The booking was simple and direct through the hotel website. I paid 拢240 for an Exectuive King Room. My wife arrived before me as I was travelling back from a business trip and she was first given a tour or the hotel, some champagne, some fruit and shown to our room. When I arrived I was offered the same experience, declined the tour but accepted the champagne! The room was very nice. Not huge, but as described on the web-site. What the web-site doesn't convey are the little touches that really impress. The quality of the beds, furniture, audio/visual equipment was excellent. Toiletries were also at the 'luxury' end. Style was on the modern side. During our stay the hotel sorted out lunch, dinner and theatre arrangements with ease. All the staff knew our names and room numbers even if we hadn't met that particular member of staff before. All were very polite and helpful.The location is quite good for tourists - very near the Palace, Parks and London Victoria Travel interchange. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is that, since I only stayed for 1 night and spent a lot of time around London, I didn't get to experience the whole of the hotel facilities. On check-out we used the lounge (very nice), and the free internet and printer facilities to check in for our flights. I will definitely be back if I return to London.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Sheer Pleasure We had booked 41 for a birthday weekend. Having stayed at many 5* in London we have been searching for a more personal touch and 41 has it in plenty. From the moment you arrive you are made to feel very special. The black and white decor is perfect for deco lovers. The atmosphere is private club rather than hotel, peaceful and classy.Room stunning, gleaming clean, fabulous bedding of Egyptian Cotton crisp and inviting to say nothing of the comfort of the mattress!Breakfast in the Lounge where every whim can be accomodated with discreet loving service from the gorgeous staff. You are always known by your name and you really feel you are part of the family not just passing through.Every member of staff knows who you are and greets you with the same warmth.Few little negatives, wrong type of room had been allocated, this was soon dealt with but we did feel a little uncomfortable as if we were trying to upgrade ourselves, which was not the case. There was no fruit in the room although this was advertised as being included, this was rectified later when we mentioned it. few other little niggles but not really want to focus on them as the whole experience was so beautiful and if anything is not right it is rectified and apologised for straight away.A wonderful birthday cake was left in our room, such a lovely surprise, we were too full to eat so it was boxed carefully for our journey and put in a lovely hessian bag, wonderful touches like this make for a very special experience.This is not the hotel for you if you like to remain anonymous as the level of interaction may be too much for you but if you love to be pampered and made to feel very special, stay at 41 we will be returning soon, spoilt for other hotels now as they may be lovely but where else would you get the service level!! Go on treat yourself without hesitation!!!</p></li>

<li>You are always known by your name and you really feel you are part of the family not just passing through.Every member of staff knows who you are and greets you with the same warmth.Few little negatives, wrong type of room had been allocated, this was soon dealt with but we did feel a little uncomfortable as if we were trying to upgrade ourselves, which was not the case.</br>

<li>There was no fruit in the room although this was advertised as being included, this was rectified later when we mentioned it.</br>

<li>few other little niggles but not really want to focus on them as the whole experience was so beautiful and if anything is not right it is rectified and apologised for straight away.A wonderful birthday cake was left in our room, such a lovely surprise, we were too full to eat so it was boxed carefully for our journey and put in a lovely hessian bag, wonderful touches like this make for a very special experience.This is not the hotel for you if you like to remain anonymous as the level of interaction may be too much for you but if you love to be pampered and made to feel very special, stay at 41 we will be returning soon, spoilt for other hotels now as they may be lovely but where else would you get the service level!!</br>
