The staff are lovely, the Bellini's are the best (though they'd run out of peach so mine was with kiwi - just as nice). The Doge's Palace is next door but four (very near) and the No 1 & 82 vaperettos stop pretty much outside the door (so do the gondolas). Just book it!</p></li>

The people who work here are all, each and every one, lovely and helpful. It somehow manages to feel homey while not feeling bed and breakfast-y. The details from the front door down to the pillow on your bed are all thoughtful and beautiful. I would recommend anyone stay here</p></li>

This room had a terrace with two lounge chairs and a small table and chairs that overlooked the Grand Canal. We would come back from a day of exploring the islands of Venice and relax with a cocktail under the afternoon sun with the cool breezes off the water massaging away any tiredness. Awesome!

Waking up every morning to see the Santa Maria della Salute is indeed priceless.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed 2 nights at Londra Palace after being pampered on a two week luxury line cruise. I have to say that the pampering continued. Fabulous service, attentive staff and a beautiful room! I stayed in the suite with a wide balcony and truly enjoyed sitting in the chairs watching all the ships go by as well as watching the tourists on the promenade below. Sunsets were amazing and the location was perfect. Another treat is the outside dining area, where you can relax and people watch while enjoying a cocktail before dinner.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is just two "blocks" away from Pza San Marco - close enough to walk, far enough not to be among continuous crowds. Some have complained about noise on the busy street below, we didn't notice this at all despite two sets of French doors opening towards the front of the hotel. Our Deluxe room was not enormous but I loved the way they balanced the feeling of typical Venetian decor with modern updates. The view was amazing. The staff were very helpful. Rooftop terrace a lovely place to bring a drink and watch the sunset.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The londra Palace has the most perfect location facing the lagoon, yet isn't as massively expensive as some of the other water-front hotels. Close to St Mark's square and most other attractions. Our room was very Venetian, very opulent. Venetian hot chocolate is 'to die for'. Give Murano a miss unless you like high pressure selling and have a few hours to be trapped in their sales rooms. The glass-blowing exhibition was good as was looking at the glass itmes on offer but not worth it for the pressure exerted on you to buy something.</p></li>

We need not have worried as the Londra Palace excelled in every respect. We had a junior suite with balcony (recommended) which was very clean and comfortable. The breakfast was adequate, the staff were extremely courteous and helpful. I would heartily recommend the Londra Palace and endorse the earlier comments made by other guests.

Got on the computer and went straight to TripAdvisor for some ideas about hotels. The reviews were very good for this hotel and the price was right so we booked it. We got there and were so pleased! The rooms are not huge but no where in Italy are you going to find "huge" rooms. Great flat screen Tv in the room. The bathroom was marble, beautiful, great shower. Luxurious linens, etc. Concierge was fantastic and the location was perfect! Would definatley stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Since this was my second trip to Venice, I understood that you have to pay more than you would expect because of the location. The hotel far surpassed my expectations. The location was amazing, just steps from San Marco. The room was large, well appointed and well air-conditioned without being overbearing. The bed was comfortable and soft. The bathroom large with a great strong shower. The staff was very helpful and attentive. The free wifi was an unexpected bonus as was the free latte in the afternoon. All in all, I had a wonderful experience and would love to go back again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our travel agent suggested the Londra Palace....great call. It's located right on the Canals just a minute or 2 walk to St. Mark's, Doge's Palace, and Bridge of Sighs. It's a very clean hotel. Staff was really nice. The restaurant was really good (try the mint chocolate chip gelato). Our room was 3rd floor looking out towards the statue and canal. Finally, the price was very reasonable for the quality and location. The only draw back is it seems to be located on the part of th canal where the cruise ships let off, so it got a little congested. That being said, We were extremely pleased.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had stayed at Londra Palace last year in February for my honeymoon. It was our first stop in Italy and Venice and Londra Palace set up an amazing experience. I must say the hotel is amazing and the best hotel that I have stayed at. The staff is extremely courteous and helpful. They even arranged a trip to Murano for us. The breakfast is amazing. The location of the hotel is very good. It is walking distance from St. Marks' square. I want to visit Venice again and will definitely stay at Londra Palace the next time also but I will book a room with water view. Everything about this hotel is wonderful.</p></li>

It was not value for money, very expensive and poor quality breakfast offered (cheap croissants and cotton wool rolls and none of the lovely italian bread we expected) Lunch for example Â£9 for an omelette and Â£3.50 for a small cup of coffee. My bathroom had mould growing around the shower. We got a turn down service on the first night and then they did not bother. On the whole tired and dated and could do with some money spending on the rooms. The only plus points were that it was on the front a few minutes walk from St Marks and the Vaporetto stops.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Hotel Londra Palace is one of those hotels that cannot be overrated. No matter what you think you might experience when booking this hotel, you'll be impressed. I stayed in this hotel with my daughter for her graduation present and it was absolutely amazing. From the welcome champagne, chocolate covered strawberries in the room to the spacious room, awesome breakfast and lovely staff, we couldnt have asked for more. The price was WELL WORTH IT and this is the best way to spend a vacation in Venice. One of the, if not THE, most amazing hotel we stayed in. the staff was so nice and the location could not be better!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I were celebrating our 41st Anniversary and wanted a great experience in Venice -- we had never been there before. We booked the Londra Palace based on reading your reviews. They were absolutely accurate! The hotel has a wonderful location; close to everything. We arrived by water taxi right in front of the hotel. Our room and balcony overlooked the canal -- what a spectacular way to wakeup every morning. The view from the bar and restaurant allow you to watch the world walk by; you could spend hours people watching. The room was great, the people extremely friendly, and the services first class. We would comeback again and again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Let's start with the location . . . right in the heart of Venice, everything minutes away. The room and bathroom are sumptuous, with a heated towel rack in the bathroom, spacious, clean with fresh flowers! Our view was overlooking rooftops and church, no complaints! The staff was very helpful when our prearranged transportation did not show up, making a call for us on departure. The front desk also recommended a quiet little church for Sunday services as a new patriarch was coming to the San Marco Basilica that day. We splurged on this hotel and did not regret it for a moment. Beautiful lounge areas and wonderful breakfast. Afternoon coffee and cookies!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Londra Palace is one of the best hotels in this magnificent city of Venice. We stayed at a spacious Junior Suite on our Valentine`s trip and everything was just magical. We have two little gorgeous balconies - one to the the room and one to the bathroom. The last one is overlooking the old city and the other one is overlooking the Venice Lagoon, and it was very nice to wake up and the first thing you see is the gondolas, San Marco Bell and the other picturesque views. The service was perfect and the breakfast - wonderfull. The location is just the best - a few steps to St. Marc Square. The hotel is a little pricy, but... the memories is priceless, right...</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Londra Palace for two nights to celebrate my birthday and had booked a room with a lagoon view. The room was slightly on the small side, but the view over the lagoon was fantastic. Next time, I'd book a room with a balcony as we spent a lot of time hanging out of the window to take in the view!! The hotel staff were very knowledgable and gave us an excellent recommendation for a restaurant on the night of my birthday -di Forni. They also helped with booking taxis, etc. Breakfast on the hotel terrace was a nice experience and the bar is small but well stocked. The location of the hotel is excellent being just a stone's thrown from San Marco. I would definitely return.</p></li>

The staff, from the front desk to the dining room were friendly, efficient and had a good knowledge of English. We had one dinner in the dining room, delicious but not cheap. The breakfast buffet was outstanding and eggs were readily available. Our room was a junior suite which we did not consider good value. It was definitely on the small side for 500+ euros and the bathroom was only ok. All in all though we would return.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Londra Palace is an great hotel and the pictures online don't do it justice. We had an amazing time and everyone at the hotel was extremely friendly. Nicola at the front desk was especially charming and helpful giving us perfect restaurant choices and always welcoming us by name and quickly taking care of every need and question we had.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived by train from Florence having had an awful experience at the Helvetia&Bristol, so we were not in the mood to take any prisoners. When we were shown to our suite, room 510, what a beautiful room and terrace. Everyone at the hotel was helpful and attentive, the food was great both breakfast and dinner, plus the recommendations of the concierge for restaurants to eat out were perfect. BUT to be able to retreat to our terrace and look over the Grand Canal and the view towards St Marks Sq with a cool drink after all the hustle, queues and people was truly superb. We have travelled a lot and this has got to be one of the best value hotel rooms I have ever stayed in, absolutely magical.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 3 nights. A charming hotel with charming history with friendly and professional staff to compliment it. Hotel faces St. Mark Basin with its front porch lined with water-bus station, water taxi station and a few steps away the gondola station. Less than 5 minutes walking to St Marks Square and Bridge of Sigh. From there u could leisurely stroll towards Rialto Brigde and take the water-bus down the Grand Canal back to the hotel. Could not ask for better location. We booked the junior suite with a balcony facing the basin, view is spectacular. Room is elegantly charming, but for a suite, I visualized bigger space. A perfect choice for couples looking for a romantic experience of Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a very comfortable room, with quality linens and a beautiful bath! The room was dotted with quality antiques and the beds were extremely comfortable. We had a magnificient view of the Grande Canal and we were a 2 minute walk to St Mark's Square. What more could you ask for? Well we indeed had more! A really upscale breakfast offering a very good selection of foods. Also, we received extremely courteous, expert service from the employees of the hotel. Plus the bar is a gem, very upscale and sophisticated! The mojitos they made at the bar, by the way, were the best we have ever had. I would definitely recommend this property and on my return to Venice, I will definitely stay there again. Loved it!</p></li>

Our room was beautitul and overlooked the Grand Canal and the bathroom was awesome. The staff was the best from the front desk clerk to the housekeeper who took very good care of my husand and I. The afternoon tea and coffee with pastries was a wonderful way to end your afternoon around the bar. The bar staff was so friendly and very entertaining the breakfast was Great and enough food to feel an army. I would not hasten to stay again and again. My husband surprised me for my Birthay and what a beautiful treat, Venice and The Hotel Londra was the frosting on the BDay cake, Make sure you have private water taxi from airport to hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were on our honeymoon and spent our last three days in Venice. We wandered by the Londra Palace on our first evening in town and spontaneously made a reservation for our last night. What a treat! The lobby is beautiful and the outdoor restaurant area is airy, romantic and cozy. Though our view of the lagoon was blocked due to restoration of the statue that sits in front of it, our last night in Venice was unforgettable. The walk to St. Mark's Square takes about three minutes and the water bus stops are about 40 yards from the front door. The breakfast buffet the next morning was a treat as well. I had cold cuts, cheeses, champagne and bread. My husband had three bowls of cereal. There was something for everyone!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I have just returned from a brief stay in Venice where we were fortunate enough to stay at this marvelous facility. The room was absolutely perfect, the bathroom sumptuous, and every possible need anticipated. The concierges, especially Walter and Alvise, were incredibly helpful with directions, recommendations, and reservations for dinner, even assisting my husband to find a pharmacy when one was unexpectedly needed. We would always chose to stay here over other places we visited in Venice. It is within walking distance of everything and a 45 minute vapparetto ride from the train station. The service was extraordinary and discreet, and the room was quiet and beautifully decorated. Linda Dwyer, Ct. USA</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">If you booked a room with canal views, you will not be disappointed. Open your window to amazing views of grand canal and rest of Venice lagoon. Hotel's location is perfect. There is also a pier right outside where the taxi boat from the airport stops. The breakfast buffet is very nice with lots of different kinds of fruits and pastries. The area (restaurant) where breakfast is served is very beautifully decorated in mostly white. The rooms are decorated tastefully as well but the wear and tear of time is begining to show. Everything works but you may notice the scratches, chipped paint here and there. I particularly did not like the air condition unit which made too much noise for my liking. I'd return to this hotel if I want to spend this much money next time I'm in Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When I made our reservations, the Hotel Londra Palace was in the TripAdvisor top 5 of Venice hotels. I am not surprised at all that is now #18 (it should be lower.) After spending 3 fantastic nights at the JK Place in Florence (highly recommend that hotel), we were very disappointed when we saw our room at the Londra Palace given the price of the Lagoon View Room. The carpets were worn and the bedspread and drapes looked like they had been in use since 1974. The only positive thing I can say is that the lagoon view was amazing, but that credit goes to Venice, not the hotel. I agree with other reviewers who said that the front desk staff do not go the extra mile in any way. We couldn't wait to check out. I think you could pay less and be much happier at another hotel in Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed six nights in a fifth floor junior suite with a patio/balcony (room 510). The room was very spacious and very well appointed. The bathroom was likewise excellent (two sinks and shower choices with bath). The patio/balcony was good sized and looked out in three directions at the lagoon and up the Grand Canal as well as to the San Zacarello church and beyond. The room was very quiet. Occasional noise distraction as guests use the stairs to get to the rooftop balcony (which is only open part of the day), but this was minor at most. Service was quite good. The restaurant had very good food. Breakfast is cold buffet and quality and variety is excellent (fresh juice, fresh fruits, many pastry options, cereals, hams and cheeses, etc). Dining service is spotty. Sometimes good, sometimes not.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a wonderful 2 nights stay at this hotel in October 2011 whilst travelling on route on the Orient Express train. Our lovely room at the front of the hotel had wnderful views & looked out onto the Lagoon. The staff were very pleasant, bed comfortable, bathroom very nice, lobby very pretty and the evening meal we had in the restaurant, sitting outside was excellent. The hotel is situated in an excellent location if you want to be close to the main square, lagoon, shops etc. Only upset we had was a mosquito in the room and found it very difficult to locate this annoying bug as it was well hidden against the dark brocade wallpaper and drapes in the room. We could only see it when it landed on the white ceiling. There was only one, so I guess we were unlucky and we hadn't packed any repellant this trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Londra Palace in June as part of a trip combining Venice with the Orient Express for our anniversary and found the hotel to be absolutely perfect. The location is fantastic, 2 minutes walk from St Marks and right on the waters edge overlooking the islands and comings and goings of the boats. The terrace is lovely, it's where we had breakfast everyday. Very tastefully laid little tables overlooking the promenade and water. The breakfast is good, lots of choice and plentiful. Our room was super, very clean, comfortable and with a well stocked mini-bar and nice toiletries in the bathroom. The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and polite. The bar is tiny but does some great cocktails which we took out onto the terrace to watch the world go by. I would definitely recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is located two bridges away from the Doge's Palace (about 5 minutes walk). From there you have access to St Marks, etc so it is a great starting point. The gondolas, water taxis and vaporetta's are all available outside the hotel door which again makes it a great location. The breakfast was a very standard continental one. We were most disappointed that the restaurant was not open. Although we had emailed the hotel a number of times prior to our arrival, in none of these was it mentioned that the restaurant was closed. It wasn't until we went down to eat the first night of our stay that we found out. In January a number of nearby restaurants were closed so it made it difficult. We found it easier to eat dinner on the way back to the hotel in the evenings rather than return to the hotel and then go out.</p></li>

I had paid extra for a waterfront view and we were excited to find we had one of the few rooms with a balcony! I loved waking up at night and gazing out at the lagoon and grand canal. We spent a lot of time just sunning and people watching from our place on the 2nd floor, so much activity! Elegantly appointed room and to die for marble bathroom, plus we had several english tv channels when I wanted to check the weather or news, Excellent dinner and breakfast, the wait staff knew us after our first visit and never asked for our hotel room number but once. This hotel is right next to San Marco square and the Bridge of Sighs, easy to find our way back too after wandering the inner city maze of Venice! Miss it already!!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have just spent 4 nights at Hotel Londra which is supurbly situated for the main sights in Venice, a wonderful view and great transport connexions. The quality and condition of the decor is first rate; better in my view than some of the other top class hotels I inspected in Venice which seem to rely too much on their names and can look a little tired. The rooms are all different, have wonderful fabrics and colour schemes, beautiful bathrooms and delightful linen sheets. The food and room service is great and the public areas very tasteful and serene. My only slight complaint was slight over-zealousness on certain room service charges and a slightly official attitude by one or two staff. But overall it is difficult to fault the quality of the product and I really cannot think of another hotel in Venice which matches the experience, at any price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What other reviewers have written about this hotel is true and it is an excellent place to spend a few days while experiencing Venice. The concierge is very helpful, in particular, Alvice. He is above there with the best. His travel, transport and restaurant recommendations were on the dot and went the extra mile to secure reservations for our dinner and lunch requests. The rooms are larger than the standard European hotel rooms. Clean and relatively modern, probably a late 1990s or early 2000 era renovation. Airconditioning in the rooms which is important as not all European hotels provide air-conditions. Nice breakfast spread although eggs have to be ordered separately and not included in the breakfast package. Free internet, which is so rare in Europe. The location cannot be beat as mentioned by other reviewers. I will definitely stay there again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived very late at the Londra Palace so had something light to eat and then headed off to bed. We both woke very earlier with a great feeling of anticipation for when we pulled back the shutters there was the most fantastic sunrise and our view from our window was just out of this world. We felt like kings and queens.We had very high expectations about the Londra palace but these were certainly met and on occasions exceeded along the way. We had a meal on the terrace on the second night which was really memorable with great food, wine and very friendly service. There was a great buzz arond the restaurant as there was a bollywood film being made on the square and the actors were staying here so it was fun doing a little people watching. Venice is the most amazing place we enjoyed every moment of our weekend. I would have no hesitation of recommending the Londra Palace</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just returned from my fabulous 2 week Italian vacation. We started in Venice and stayed at Londra Palace which is in a great location and easy to get to by water taxi from the airport. Our room faced the water and the main walkway below. We were afraid it would be noisy at night with all the people outside, but it was never a problem. We were even able to nap during the day with lots of husle & bustle below....the room was quiet with the windows closed. We loved sitting on the window sill watching all the people below. We also enjoyed sitting on the terrace eating breakfast each morning watching the cruise ships go by. We ate at the hotel restaurant, Do Leoni, which was really good and not as expensive as we thought it would be (well, compared to everything else in Italy). Housekeeping was also very prompt every day so we never had to return to an unclean room. Overall, a very nice experience.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I have been to Venice a number of times - as has my mother. This trip was special - she is in her mid 80s and as her sight deteriorates I doubt she will be able to come again. We had a fabulous room at the Londra Palace - spacious, airy, bright, with a delightul balcony and a fabulous view across the lagoon. Perfect. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom quite luxy with a good shower. The staff were charming and attentive without being in any way patronising. We had a couple of lovely lunches sitting on the terrace in the late October sunshine watching the world go by. We were helped enormously by the wonderful concierges Aldo and Alvise who booked restaurants for us, advised on complicated vaporetto journeys and were generally a fantastic source of information about a city which they know and clearly love. Next time I am in Venice I will definitely come back to this hotel - I don't think you could do better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a fabulous hotel, the location is ideal , close enough to St Marks Square but just enough distance to enjoy the lagoon right infront of the hotel which is fab. As mentioned in a previous note get a water taxi as it saves you struggling with your luggage over 2 bridges however the airport bus is only a 5 minute walk!! The hotel itself is wonderful, the restaurant is gorgeous, the food and service is superb. Our room overlooked the lagoon which was great especially in the morning watching all the cruise ships arriving. Breakfast outside was great but it was a traditional continential style, there was plenty to eat if you like healthy food everyday but some scrabbled egg would have been lovely with my cheese and ham - just abit pricey! Overall, the room - cleaned twice a day (included a weather forecast card in the evening so you could plan your day ahead), service, and food in the hotel was excellent and looking forward to my next trip.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent 4 nights at the Londra Palace on our recent first trip to Italy. The location was perfect for us - a few minutes' walk to St. Mark's Square, close to several vaporetto stops. Definitely opt for a lagoon view room if you stay there. Ours - a junior suite with tiny balcony and two large windows looking out to the island of San Giorgio Maggiore across the lagoon - was like a little jewel box in shades of pink. Nice bathroom. Despite the hordes of tourists below, it was very quiet. Dinner at Do Leoni, the hotel's restaurant, was quite good - as was our included buffet breakfast - juices, coffee and tea, fruits, cheeses, meats, cereals, yogurt, breads, pastries, cookies. Housekeeping was wonderful - nightly turndown service, and fresh towels a couple of times daily. We found the rest of the staff to be very gracious and helpful. The Londra Palace isn't cheap. But it captures the romance of Venice, and I would return there without hesitation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a superb position overlooiking the lagoon with all the traffic that uses it, even the large cruise ships which perhaps should not be allowed so far into Venice. We had a suite overlooking the lagoon with good facilities and a lovely bathroom. It was lovely in the late evening opening the windows and watching all the boats pass by, with a chilled glass of prosecco in our hands. Breakfasts were excellent. We did not eat in the hotel, preferring to use the smaller restaurants in the streets behind. Wonderful fish suppers were on offer everywhere at reasonable prices. The hotel is right by the Vaporetto stop and with a weekend ticket it is so easy to travel up the Grand Canal to wherever you want. It is a short walk to St Mark's Square and if you wander up the side streets you will find many lovely bars and cafes. The complimentary afternoon tea and cakes in the hotel was a lovely surprise. We found the staff very friendly and helpful.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked my Venetian wedding through Kuoni and stayed at the Londra Palace for 7 nights. The hotel upgraded our room from a classic room to a deluxe room with a view of the lagoon. It was fantastic. The staff were brillant and nothing was too much trouble. We where married on 6th August 2009 (we walked through St Marks and everyone clapped). Five mintues later we arrived at Do' Leoni, which is the restaurant attacted to the Hotel. It was perfect for a wedding reception, everything is cream and white and beautiful and the outside dining area was surrounded by flowers. We had a 5 course meal with red and white wine (as much as we wanted) plus bottled water for 75 euros a head, for 17 guest. The meal was the best of the whole trip and my wedding cake was also included in the price. This Hotel made my wedding. Book with them and you will not be disappointed (and I am a glass half empty person!) I even got a going away present. We will be going back....soon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and I have avoided going to Venice as we don't like overcrowded places, especially in the summer months. Due to a cancelled business trip we ended up with a few days off in Venice. We had booked a junior suite at the Londra Palace as it was directly accessible by boat and close to the main sightseeing places. After booking the room we read a few horror stories on this site which made us doubt our decision, especially the remarks about this rude lady manager. We went along regardless and we have to admit that we had a good time at the hotel. Everybody was quite welcoming and helpful. The room was as expected and we enjoyed watching the huge cruise boats sailing into Venice from our little but cute balcony. The biggest disappointment was the breakfast buffet that is quite poor in quality and choice. There is quite a lot of room for improvement in this area. Other than that, we mostly spent our time walking around Venice and discovering its many restaurants.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Londra Palace May 11-13th. We had one of the cheaper rooms on the back of the property, but the room was great. The bathroom was very modern and comfortable. The only bad thing was the bed was very hard, but this was easy to overlook with all the other great features! The staff was very helpful and attentive. Breakfast is great- all sorts of cereals, fresh fruits, meats, breads and cheeses. The location is fantastic- right on the grand canal and a block from St. Mark's. We really enjoyed sitting on the patio with bellinis and watching both the boats in the canal and the people strolling the boulevard. We also ate dinner at the hotel and the food was wonderful - the pumpkin risotto was amazing! Another nice feature is the water bus drops you off almost at the front door of this property so you don't have to wander around the streets of Venice with your luggage looking for your hotel! We loved this hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again on future trips to Venice!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for a night on the 17th Dec. 2006. We were travelling in group of 4 and so we booked two standard room from the hotel website which cost us just 185 Euro per nite. When checking in, we were very fortunate to be upgraded for one room which overlooking the Lagoon. The view was fantastic!! The hotel itself is in great and beautiful location.Here is what we love:- LOCATION Splendid! Infront of the lagoon. 5 min. walk to Piazza San Marco which is the centre of shopping and restaurants ROOM Every room is unique in its decorations. Full of wallpaper and antique furniture. There are no 2 room with similar decorations. The deco is beautiful, romantic and very elegant. The room size is big enough for a Europe hotel. Very spacious. Love the bathroom - its full of marbles and beautiful deco STAFF Staff is very helpful and friendly. Speak very fluent English Breakfast comes with the room - although it is just a simple Italian breakfast with breads, cereal & pastries Will definitely stay here again next time!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just returned from a lovely 4 night stay here.,and we were glad we chose it. The position is wonderful,5 mins from St Marks Sq and on a wide waterfront with views of the canal ,lagoon and churches,handy for boat stops.The busy waterfront quietens down in the evening. We were warmly welcomed by the staff and noticed that there appeared to be many returning guests who were treated like old friends,always a good sign. The room,Junior Suite was decorated in classical italian style,damasks on the walls and crisp white bedlinen, towels changed twice daily. The lobby,dining room ,lounge were in a more modern fresh style but in keeping with the hotel building. Breakfast was good, fresh baked sweet and savoury pastries,bread,yoghurts, cereals,fresh fruit salad,hams and cheeses,all you would want really. We slept quite well, no noise from other rooms . The restaurant meal was again very good and staff attentive. Although Venice in general is very expensive ,If I were to visit again I would choose the Londra Palace for my stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from Venice and as I booked due to this web site I thought I should do my bit and write a review! Our experiance of the hotel was without fault. We had a junior suite over looking the lagoon with a terrace. I would definately recommend booking a terrace than a balcony room, it was lovely any time of day or night to have drinks on the terrace and the view is just wonderful. Suite 416 was not large, bathroom quite small but we thought it was perfect and the large terrace more than made up for the size of the room. Bed was big and comfortable. The hotel also arranged for a private boat for five hours, although not cheap 420 euros, it meant we could hop from Island to Island as we wanted - and get away from the crowds! One thing to be aware of the buffett breakfast does not include anything cooked this costs another 20 euros each! My husband has just peeked over my shoulder and said that I have to mention that the hot chocolate from the hotel is simply mmmmmmmmmmm!! If you stay here I hope you have just as good a time as we did.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose Londra Palace because of good tripadvisor reviews and I was not disappointed, the good experience started with an easy website on which to book, with all offers made clear, then a couple of days before arrival the hotel sent an email requesting details of any information or needs we may have wished(doesn't cost anything but a nice touch). On arrival the staff could not have been more welcoming and indeed all the way through our three day stay all staff(with such excellent English that we felt unworthy) were exactly as attentive as they should have been, i.e. there when you needed them. As the hotel restaurant was closed, the recommendations made for eating out were excellent and tailored to the price one wished to pay. Breakfast was excellent and available until 10.30, the housekeeping service, though never seen, was also excellent. Our room had arguably the best views in Venice and only a few hundred metres to San Marco, also the water taxi jetty is only a few yards away which is important on arrival, this hotel is unlikely to disappoint.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked through Citalia and even though we had done our research it still was above our expectations! We stayed in 3 different hotels in Italy (Venice, Rome and Sorrento) and this was definitely our favourite. It certainly made our visit to Venice something that we will remember forever and makes us want to return. We were spoilt because it was our honeymoon and we therefore had a deluxe room overlooking the lagoon. I particularly enjoyed watching the hustle and bustle from our room and it certainly wasn't noisey on an evening. On our arrival we enjoyed a complimentary free lunch inlcuded wiht our booking and it was absolutely delightful. The breakfast was simple but delicious with plenty of choice. We tried out local restaurants each evening and we weren't disappointed. The room had an amazing view and luxurious decor. The bathroom had marble throughout and it was great to have a choice of shower or bath. Overall, I really would recommend this hotel to anyone. It may be expensive, but the benefits outweigh this and made the start of our honeymoon perfect!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed in the Hotel Londra Palace for four nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel is located within a short walk to St Mark's square and, providing you have a front room, has beautiful views across the laguna and St George's island. We had a suite which is not much larger than a western motel room but quite spacious for two adults. The bed was very comfortable and there was a bath, both necessaties after foot slogging it around Venice. The concierge was extremely helpful in arranging transfers, giving directions and recommending places to eat. The complimentary breakfast was basic but adequate and the pastries were above par. The hotel has WiFi which is adequate for checking emails and general surfing where speed is not paramount. The one disappointment was that the kitchen was being refurbished while we were there so it wasn't possible to eat at the hotel restaurant. As this was off season it is understandable that it was being done at that time but no one had informed us that the restaurant wasn't open until we had gone to eat there. Other than this it was a most pleasent stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at the Londra Palace at the end of September on a short four night break. Booked the hotel as a result of the excellent Tripadvisor reviews and we were not disappointed. The position of the hotel could not be beaten. As many have said it is right next to where the waterbus arrives from the airport and couild not be more convenient. It is a stones throw from St Mark's Square and other major sights which allows you to be there early/late to beat the hordes of other tourists. The hotel itself was very comfortable and the breakfast excellent. Our room was at the rear overlooking rooftops but that was no bad thing...very peaceful. There was free Wi-Fi after getting the password from reception.We particularly enjoyed sitting on the terrace at the front of the hotel mid afternoon enjoying our complimentary tea. We did not eat in the restaurant so cannot comment on quality. Staff we generally friendly and efficient although I sensed the house "style" was to remain a little reserved in the way you might expect in an up-market hotel. I can see how some people might read this as being unfriendly. Just a comment not a criticism!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband & I stayed at the Londra Palace Venice for 2 nights in June 2011. We had a beautiful room on the front of the building with a terrific view of the lagoon. We were only steps away from St Marks Square & Bascilicia. Transport was right outside our front door either by vaporette or water taxi. The hotel was luxurious with murano glass fittings. Our rate included breakfast which could be taken either inside or on the restaurant on the waterfront. While this area is extrememly busy with tourists it is very central to all tourists locations and terrific for transport. The hotel staff were excellent and food great. We did however have difficulty getting toast for breakfast. It seems like warmed up pale bread was the best the hotel could do. We took a vaporette from the train station to the hotel and this was very difficult to negoiate with our rather heavy luggage. I would advise taking a water taxi although that is expensive. We took a water taxi to our cruise ship and this was great. The cost was approx 90 euros and they took our luggage from the hotel to the taxi We would recommend this hotel.especially for location.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">As you can read by the title I've been at Londra Palace in a wonderful suite at the 5th floor, but having seen some of the other rooms, I'm assure all the hotel is at the same standard. My room number was number 508, it has 2 windows on the same side (south facing) with a stunning view on San Giorgio church and Giudecca island. The room is small to be a suite but if you consider where you are it's pretty big and cosy. The bathroom is made all in pink marble has a big bath and shower. The service is excellent, every time you leave the room the housekeeping clean and tidy up everything and prepare the bed for the night. Cleanliness is absolutely flawless. There nothing to improve in a such classy Hotel. I can't say anything about the restaurant I had only breakfast and it was in line with the rest of the hotel, superb. One thing you have to absolutely try is having a Spritz (a typical Venetian cocktail) in the veranda looking the people walking, the canal and San Giorgio church. It's the best way to taste the real Venice I can assure that Londra Palace with its rooms, its service, its location is one of the best 3 Hotel in Venice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on our first trip to Venice. We arrived by train and it was convenient that this property was directly across from a water taxi stop. We saw several other tourist struggling with bags weedling through some narrow streets and warrens of Venice. Hotel was nice, impeccably decorated and helpful staff. Our room was not a canal view but did have a delightful view of the a courtyard plaza. Keep in mind its a smaller hotel so rooms book up quickly. Nice location easy to get around. They will also arrange for a trip to Murano with a glass maker that will pick you up by vaporretto and and whisk you off to Murano for glass making tour. Nice but HIGH PRESSURE sells pitch at end. They make you feel like they did something just for you and then lead you around a showrooms of what you could buy. IF you can avoid the sells pitch it was a great tour and trip . Glass there is good but very pricey compared to more touristy(cheaper) stuff any where else. So if you are not a collector I would pass. Also we heard this section of Venice can flood during the winter but we had no problems however it was pretty chilly.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Good hotel shame about the staff”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The title probably covers most of what I have to say about this hotel. The hotel itself is smart and comfortable. However it is in a bad position, just by the ferry landing for eveyone off the cruise ships. This took people watching, by the thousands, at breakfast, to a new level. Also shame about the scaffold on the statue in front of the hotel, blocking views from first floor junior suites. However that is not the hotels fault and will be down soon. Had a junior suite, comfortable but not large, I am comparing with other countries, so this may be standard for Venice. The room was clean but oh so drab, beige, brown and more beige. Cleaning staff appeared very good, which I cannot say for the general reception desk staff. Not rude or surly, but you did not feel a welcome guest, as in many other hotels, especially when you look at the cost, an arm and a leg plus other body parts. Generally overpriced for what they are offering, even by Venice standards and cost. However do not miss Venice, and find a different hotel, one in a quieter position away from the ferry landing point, even 100 yards further away from St Marks. The restaurant is a different kettle of fish and I am posting seperately on that.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Excellent hotel in a perfect location. Great help and practical advise from Alvitse and Aldo on the front desk - both worthy of their Golden Key status. The room was very well appointed and the bathroom stylish, ours had a great view of a campanile and dome. The bedding was of very fine linen and wonderfully comfortable. During your visit make sure you ask to be taken up to the roof top viewing platform which offers a spectacular view over the whole of Venice. This would make a perfect and private special location to toast your visit.Â  No review would be complete without mentioning the amazing breakfast buffet. Fresh, delicious, gourmet breakfast Â topped off by a freshly made espresso was a perfect indulgent start to the day which easily ruled out the need for lunch and perfect fuel for the hours of walking the maze of tiny streets.Â  Being just metres from the San Zaccaria vaparetto stop made transfers very easy. The public ferry from the airport stops at the door given you a scenic entry via Murano. We were leaving by train and once again the vaparetto left from San Zaccaria to the station. One tip is to buy the 24 hour tourist ticket â‚¬18 allowing time to do the islands and the trip to the station.Â</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Historic Londra Palace -- Unparalleled Service!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">While there maybe properties that are better known, or even older, the historic Londra Palace sets the standard by which other hotels are judged. Situated on the Grand Canal, and a short stroll from Piazza San Marco and its famous basilica, a better location cannot be found. The management team led by Mauro Zanotti seamlessly advises its clientele on all matters of culture and interest in Venice -- from the legendary Harry's Bar to how to shop for Murano glass, to where to obtain concert tickets to many of Venice's renowned musical presentations. With some angst they even warn of the pickpockets which can be legion in Venice. Speaking of which, Hotel Londra Palace was home to Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky while he composed three of four movements of his "Fourth Symphony." Guestroom 106 contains photos and memorabilia honoring the composer. There is little doubt the present management has maintained the warm ambiance and service which was available to Pyotr Ilyich while updating the technology to the internet age. I should mention their in-house restaurant, Do Leoni, replete with Venetian specialties, is superb, and by Venetian standards moderately priced. Don't shortchange yourself, save at least one night to dine at Do Leoni!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Fantastic stay at the Londra Palace”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Londra Palace for three nights in late July to kick off our honeymoon. This was the perfect place to start our holiday in Italy. The location was outstanding, five minutes maximum walk to St Mark's Square and other attractions were very close by. The water taxi journey from the airport to the hotel was a fantastic introduction to Venice and there is a water taxi stop right in front of the Londra Palace. The room was stunning, ask for a lagoon view as we could look out on S.Giorgio Maggiore and Santa Maria della Salute from our mini-balcony. Even though we were at the front of the hotel, it was very peaceful and quiet in the room. Breakfast was a high point as it was served on a picturesque terrace in front of the hotel. There was a buffet breakfast with plenty of choice (salami, cheese, croissants, fruit etc). We did not have an evening meal in the hotel as we wanted to explore Venice, two recommendations are Cantinone Storico in Dorsduro and Acquapazza in the Campo St'Angelo. We found that the staff were excellent and as we were on honeymoon there were freebies (ie. a bottle of Prosecco on arrival). Overall we would highly recommend the Londra Palace for a relaxing stay and a hotel convenient for all the main sites.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We managed to get a great deal at the Londra Palace through our travel agent otherwise is a bit pricey but then what isn't in Venice and I think we would still have been delighted even paying full price. The hotel is extremely well located, looking over the Grand Canal and at most a 5-minute walk to St Marks. We also found it easily accessible from the airport via the Water Bus service that stopped right outside the hotel (San Zaccaria) for 13 euros each. As you would expect there is also a plethora of good restaurants at varying prices within a short walk. We opted for the cheaper city facing room, which was extremely well appointed in particular including a lovely bathroom. The bed and bedding were fantastic, perfect for sleeping off all the food and wine! The buffet breakfast was included in our price (24 euros pp otherwise) and was good quality with fresh fruit, cereals, pastries, meats, cheeses, coffee and tea included. Hot options were also available but at extra cost. Other than breakfast we didnâ€™t make much use of the restaurant but did try the cheese selection one night which was nice and the drinks in the bar seemed comparable to prices elsewhere. All in all we really enjoyed our time at the Londra Palace, the staff and service were all fantastic, and would thoroughly recommend it.</p></li>

They were wonderful.The rooms were about 20 by 20 with excellent bathrooms added...The walls were covered with fabric and the floors had carpet. Room 102 had a beautiful view of the lagoon and St. Georgio. We had wine and other munchies before leaving for each meal. Our first night, we ate at the hotel restaurant. It was as good as any of the other wonderful meals we had that week. Every afternoon, we had a class of wine with munchies in the bar. The setting was perfect, watching the activity outside as people walked toward the San Marco... On the 5th floor, you can take pictures and sit and sip a glass of wine when the weather permits. We got some great pictures as the sun was setting... The rooms are comfortable, with fabric covering the walls and carpet covering the floors...The bathrooms are spacious by Europe standards, with towel heaters, and other additions. The maid service is excellent. We had to leave early our last day and a water taxi was ready to take us to the airport. The hotel obviously has swing... We've stayed at Relais and Chateux all over Europe, and this was a great hotel. Our time in Venice included a half day with a guide and six wonderful dinners...Ristorante Do Leoni at the hotel; Firsch Toscana; Al Covo; Corte Sconte; Da Fiore; and Oiva Nera. I will try to write reviews of these great places in another spot on this website.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">La Serenissima "the Most Serene Republic of Venice" is my wife's & my favourite vacation location. We have stayed in Hotel Londra Palace for the last 5 consecutive years and hope to continue staying there for many more years. It's easy for a hotel & it's staff to shine once but Londra Palace has excelled in all respects for all of our 5 visits. The hotel team, especially the front desk staff are "as good as they come" always willing and able to attend to guests every need / request. Service in all departments of the hotel is professional and cannot be criticised. The rooms are well appointed, spotlessly clean and are varied to suit a range of budgets. There is no doubt that this year the essential restoration works being carried out on the statue of Emanuel II outside the hotel will have clouded some peoples opinions of their stay but it has to be expected that Venice requires ongoing restoration works if it is to survive into the future. The hotel location no more than 500 meters from the San Zaccaria Danieli landing stage makes the transit from airport to hotel front door painless (use a private taxi to put the icing on the cake.) From the hotel all of Venice pans out in easily reachable segments. What we love best about Londra Palace is it's consistent high performance and there is nothing about the hotel we dislike. Dining in the hotel offers excellent food at reasonable prices - yes, you can eat cheaper elsewhere but quality & service will suffer. Roll on our next visit which we've booked already.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband booked the Landa Palace as a romantic birthday weekend for me, so I had no idea what to expect and had never been to Venice. We were met at the airport by a courteous driver who took us by road across the bridge to a waiting water taxi and then on via the canals to the hotel. This made a for stressless start to the weekend and gave me an insight into Venice. The staff at Londra Palace reception were charming and made us very welcome. We were taken up to our suite. This being the Junior suite on the 5th floor. This pretty suite had beams, three windows, king size bed, a huge jacuzzi bath and spectacular views! On the table was a beautiful flower arrangement and complimentory bottle of 'Champagne' Our 'weekend deal' included dinner which we ate outside on the terrace. This was well presented with a good menu and excellent food. Breakfast was plentiful but could have included eggs and a better selection of cheese and meats. The fresh juice and expresso coffee were excellent. The hotel is well situated for all the tourist attactions and we spend our first evening wondering around the many shops, canals and the amazing Piazza St. Marco. We found the hotel staff very helpful friendly and professional - except the bar tender who could have been more attentive. On Sunday we caught the water taxi straight back to the airport. A fast ride across the lagoon ! In all a wonderful weekend made special by the Landra Palace. I would recommend this hotel to those who like small hotels without too many frills and just want to chill out for a weekend.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I have just returned from a fantastic weekend in Venice, the flights given by my mother as a Christmas present. We found great difficulty finding reasonably priced accomodation but which was nice enough for us to celebrate a belated first wedding anniversary travelling for the first time without our 6yr old son. Tripadvisor was most usefull in finding hotels with decent reviews. The Londra Palace was ideally situated a few hundred metres from St. Marks and our room was directly overlooking the Grand Canal. We had a superior double as this was all that was available, but they let us have the room at standard rate for the Sunday night - so worth negotiating. Room was traditionally decorated in plush fabric and bathroom in pink marble although I did find it a shame that in such a beautiful old building that plastic insted of ceramic baths have been installed, and the shower over the bath resulted in a slight flood all over the bathroom floor due to a tiny glass shower door. However the balcony and view made up for it. The greatest disappointment was the breakfast. The only healthy option was the fresh fruit which was delicious, but the cereals, even the museli were all sugar coated with full cream milk. There were cakes, and bread which was rather hard, and the preserves were the most tastless I'd ever had. I did have a boiled egg one morning but was rather dismayed to see that anything hot was an extra supplement !! Venice is a definite must to see. We found out whilst there that we are expecting a baby, so the setting of the Londra Palace was perfect, but very pricey - the 2 nights we stayed cost us 800EUROS !!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Londra Palace is situated at the start of the Grand Canal, very close to the Doges Palace and San Marco Square - a great location with views across the lagoon to San Giorgio Maggiore and Santa Maria. We had two rooms; a junior suite and a deluxe double. Both were well appointed, very comfortable, very clean and the ensuite bathrooms were finished in marble . Each room overlooked the lagoon. The junior suite had a balcony which was perfect for people and boat watching. The staff were friendly and professional. We used the concierge to book restaurants and make travel arrangements to Murano etc. The restaurant staff were equally attentive and friendly. We ate breakfast in the hotel dining room which extended onto a pavement terrace, weather permitting. Breakfast was traditional continental fare - more than ample and very relaxed - delicious fresh fruits, pastries, meats and cheeses. Lunch on the terrace was a great way to watch the world go by. The restaurant recommendations were good with one exception. We had excellent meals at Da Franz and Corte Sconta. Both are seafood only with no menus - you have to listen carefully to the Maitre d ! The locations are a little off the beaten track but worth the effort and the food was superb. The exception was Do Forni - you are quickly led through the first attractive dining room to less impressive 'back rooms'. You are packed in like the proverbial sardine, the waiters are preoccupied with getting you out as quickly as possible to seat the next sitting and the food is at best only average. So, 'Don't Forni'. All in all we had a great break. I did not see or experience any of the negative comments of an earlier reviewer and would not hesitate to recommend Londra Palace.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have travelled to Venice many times, and though the Londra was not cheap it proved to be one of best values we've experienced in Venice. We were a group with diverse needs and the Londra served us perfectly. We travelled with our young children and my elderly mother, and the hotel accommodated all our needs. We arrived very early in the day, yet two of our three rooms were immediately available, providing much needed freshening for all of us. My mother was given a junior suite with a view of the lagoon. Since she needed to take full advantage of the mid-day break, the balcony and view allowed her to rest while enjoying the bustle of Venice. We had connnecting rooms with our kids; we were in a junior suite on the lagoon and our kids in a connecting room with views over the of a square and roofs of Venice. It felt more like an apartment than a hotel room. When our kids needed a break, they could retire there while we enjoyed our room. A few quick comments: - It's in a very convenient (e.g. to S. Marco and Vaporetti) and busy location, but noise was never an issue. The front rooms were like a vault when closed for the evening. - Breakfast was a broad selection in a lovely location. - Venetian hotel staff are not the warmest Italians you will meet, but they did more than we asked without question. They were not put our by having kids in the hotel and provided much assistance to my mother. - Bathrooms, linens, etc. were what you would expect of the highest N American standards. In short, we expected an extraordinary amount from the hotel and in no way were we disappointed. I can't say, in our earlier visits to Venice, this was the case. I'm sure there may be similar or even cheaper hotels with these things to offer, but I have no complaints spending time at the Londra.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were very excited about staying at Londra as we had read many glowing reviews on trip advisor and that it was a member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World group. First off, I must say that the location of this hotel is fantastic and I would consider staying here again for that reason. However there were a few low points/ average experiences had whilst staying here. One experience was when we decided to have a drink at the bar one afternoon, after ordering drinks we requested an ashtray...three times...and it still was not provided. We then noticed that other patrons were provided with complimentary snacks with their drinks It was only after we placed our room key on the table when we started to get some reasonable service. One another day, I requested an iron of which I was informed that they did not have any irons! Although the hotel was reasonably clean the bathroom was very grotty, the back of the bathroom door was full of hair stuck with condensation from previous guests...yuk! Further, you can here toilets flush and showers running all timesof the day and night- very thin walls!! Staff in general are not very attentive, as you would expect for the price you are paying-in particular one time an employee at breakfast started to clean up our table before we had finished and grunted when we said that we were still eating. In summary, if you are staying here for the location you will not be disappointed...however if you are expecting any more you may be questioning if there is a better hotel to stay. One another note, for those who have not been to Venice before we recommend that you spend the extra money and get a water taxi to the hotel and not the water bus. The water bus from the airport was a terrible experience...you feel like you are catlle being transported to the meat market. A water taxi is expensive but makes for a much more pleasent start to your holiday!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of Venice carnival in February and from the moment we left the water taxi and walked into the lobby we knew it was going to be special. The concierge was very welcoming and escorted us to our room followed a few minutes later by the porter with our luggage. He showed us how to operate the climate control and get English channels on TV, small touches but welcome. Our room was a junior suite (312) and was very spacious with a huge bed, dining table and chairs, dressing table and sofa. There is also a mini bar and safe. The en suite was very luxurious with robes and slippers, quality towels (changed twice a day) and cosmetics. There was even an illuminated magnifying mirror (ideal for those who need help applying their make up) Our suite was on the third floor with a small balcony and fantastic views of the lagoon. The public rooms are spotlessly clean and very tastefully decorated. The hotel offers complimentary tea, coffee and cappuccino in the lounges every day between 4:00 and 5:30. Free wi fi is available and they run a free shuttle to Murano. The only obligation is that you watch a demonstration of glass making (amazing) and have a look round the store but there is no pressure to buy anything. You can then wander around Murano at your leisure and get the free boat back. We ate every evening in the hotel restaurant, Do Leoni, which is the subject of a separate review but I would highly reccomend it although expensive. The buffet breakfast included in the room rate is quite sufficient with cereals, breads, pastries, meats, cheeses, fruit, yogurt, cakes and juices but you can order cooked food at extra cost if you so wish. The location of the hotel is perfect being a 3 to 5 minute walk from piazza San Marco and with the San Zaccaria vaporetto stop out front getting around is easy. All in all a fantastic place to stay with excellent service.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Hotel Londra Palace - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When visiting Venice you want to be in the old city where the action is happening. You also don't want to be in some obscure hotel which takes you 3 hours to find trudging up and down stairs and bridges with your luggage. You've probably heard some of the Venetian horror stories of trying to navigate around tight little streets badly marked and numbered. You just don't need that. Londra Palace is on the Grand Canal, visible from the water. Suggest you do as we did and get a Water Taxi transfer to and from the airport. Google online and you'll find a few options - we used Viator and it was great, all worked very well. Airport to the front of the hotel in 15mins. Londra Palance is perfectly located a very short stroll to St Mark's square and becomes your base camp as you explore those easy to reach and very cool sights close by; then as you get more used to Venice and using water buses etc, you venture further out but its always so easy to navigate back to St Marks square and Londra Palace is right there. We stayed in a Deluxe Room with Lagoon view and it was fantastic. Large, spacious, beautifully decked out. I loved everything about the room - the bathroom was especially nice which I always think is an important factor. The staff were professional and courteous the whole time. The manager at reception showed us up to the room and personally explained the amenities of the room, the hotel and workings of breakfast which was a nice touch. Breakfast was brilliantly served in the room and patio on the ground floor in front of the hotel looking towards the Grand Canal. The staff were all very pleasant, warm, welcoming, friendly and helpful. The front desk helped us with making some dinner reservations, pointing out a few must-see things including opening times and dates etc. and giving us a map. I would absolutely recommend Hotel Londra Palace to anyone - in fact I've already done just that to friends going to Venice shortly. You won't go wrong with Londra Palace.</p></li>
