I enjoyed staying here but I don't understand why there isn't free internet like in all other hotels I stayed in during my 3-week vacation. Free internet is available only in lobby downstairs and if you want internet in your room, you have to pay for it. That's a big MINUS. If you have a car, you have choice of vallet parking or self parking.</p></li>

All was fresh & clean, and the view of the bay was an added perk. Every staff person we encountered was friendly & helpful.</p></li>

It can take you to the Bayside Marketplace where you find nice restaurants and shops. However, if I will ever visit Miami again, I will book a hotel in the Art Deco District.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel lived up to its name and expectations! VERY clean and tidy The staff was great, courteous, and friendly. Our room had a great view of the city. The restaurant on the main level was excellent, had a variety of food and drinks. We had a small group and received a decent price for the weekend. The central fire station is located a few blocks down from this hotel. The valet was efficient and always had our car available when we exited the elevator.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Selected this hotel for a group/work event. Working with Domingo in sales was the best part about this. He consistently had suggestions that were perfect. I don't generally plan events for work and so Domingo took the helm and provided the direction needed. The meeting rooms and lodging rooms were very nice. You don't generally go wrong with a Hilton. In this case, it was the staff that made the event run smoothly. Also, the food was far above the standard conference selection.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked AAA Stay and Park. Great rate for a room to accomodate 4 persons. Large room. Very comfortable beds. Fantastic view from 19th floor. Excellent service. Beautiful common areas, lounge, lobby, pool. Stayed post cruise for 1 night only. Wished we had longer to stay. Will always return to Hilton if in Miami. Only negative, which is not fault of Hilton was road construction on Biscayne blvd. Noise never a problem, just navigating the in and out of hotel slight challenge. Car rental agency at location a plus.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 2 days before our cruise out of Miami. The hotel seemed renovated and it was clean and beautiful. We had a room on the 14th floor overlooking downtown Miami. The view was amazing. The room itself was huge compared to other hotels I've stayed at. The only negative would be that they didn't come to make our beds or clean the room, but that didn't ruin our stay at the Hilton. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a hotel close to the Miami port and I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">You may stayed at other modern hotels around the world and you will find it this hotel is a little bit dated. However, I still think this hotel is very nice with the size of the room, lobby area, swimming pool and the gym. We stayed for 2 nights before we board on the cruise ship. Taxi brought us to South Beach and the terminals within 15mins and there will always be taxi. Hotel stuff are very helpful. Room is very clean overall. A little bit pricy but you are staying at Hilton, so you expected to pay a bit more.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 1 night at this Hotel (prior to cruise embarkation the next day). Hotel location is away from the main tourist attractions (Bayside Marketplace, Miami beaches). There are hardly any shops nearby except for a fast-food outlet opposite the hotel. The room was large, clean and quiet. Bed was comfortable. Great view of the port from my room. Free wifi only at the lobby and not in room. Most guests are in T-shirt, shorts and slippers (We are in Miami!) so the feel/atmosphere is different from other Hilton (business) hotel.</p></li>

But I'm happy to say the Miami Hilton met all my needs. Check in was smooth and courteous except after waiting 20 min for an elevator my keys did not work and I was on a high floor. Got a new one and all was fine. I was upgraded to a lovely suite facing the port for only $25 a night and they also gave me free internet. The pool was outstanding and service very good there. I also enjoyed the Lounge and food there. I will stay at this very busy hotel again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a very nice hotel, especially for the price. I was skeptical of the quality because of the great rates. I was pleasantly surprised. Within 5 minutes of arriving, three different employees greeted and welcomed our family . First impressions count. Huge windows with great views. Extremely comfortable beds. Two fast food restaurants across the street. Even though we booked on a discount site, we felt like important guests. Gorgeous pool. We needed extra pillows and towels - to our room in 10 minutes with a smile. This hotel should definately be rated higher.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed there for a business conference and have to say I was less than impressed. Everything was just about average. On-site restaurant was simply okay, surrounding neighborhood was very blah, and the staff was ambivalent. Due to on-site construction, elevator service was horrible. And a lot of construction in the "motor lobby" on the ground floor. Finally, despite the name, it's not really downtown per se, but a 5 minute drive from downtown. Unless you have a rental car, you're at the mercy of taxis to find an interesting neighborhood since this one is so bland.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After reading all the bad reviews I expected a real dump. That was not the case although this is not a hotel you want to book for a special occasion. The rooms are ok. Clean, quiet at night and good beds. Nothing special though. Our room had a balcony that we couldn't use because of all the construction going on. Tools and debris were lying on the balcony. The ongoing construction and the strange location of the lobby doesn't give you the feeling that you're in a 4star hotel. Tip for runners: It's a nice run from the hotel towards Miami Beach (which is only 4k away).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at Miami Hilton for New Years Eve 2011. Great view was the only good thing at this hotel. Rates were too expensive and service was terrible. 4 persons stayed in room but only towels for 3 people. called hotel reception 3 times and no towels were ever delivered. not a good way to start New Years eve having to share towels. Air conditioning noise is horrendous. kept you awake all night. Phone did not work in room. WIFI is not free either. Would never stay here again and maybe not at another Hilton either. Watch out at drive inn restaurant across street - kinda scary for families.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I thought I would be staying downtown but this hotel is about 1 1/2 miles north of the downtown center. The hotel, its rooms and amenities were all very nice. The staff was accommodating and friendly. They did charge for wifi however, which seems unnecessary. Some tips: The parking is very expensive - $35 for valet and $25 for self-park. After paying the first night, i parked on 17th Terrace north of hotel the second night for free. If you are not leaving the hotel early, you pay $1.50 per hour between 7am and 10pm. A quick stroll in the morning up 5 blocks to the tiled Barcardi building is worthwhile.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for a 4 day conference. Construction was happening on the exterior of the hotel. The staff here were more than excellent.

Complimentary coffee, fruit, and bottled water were offered once one exists the elevator in the morning into the lobby. Room was clean, comfortable beds, with excellent view of the bay and downtown. The OMNI trainstation was only a block away. Taking the train toward downtown is free and a five minute ride to the famous Bayside Marketplace --- which is a must do!

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I normally stay in South Beach when I go to Miami, but this time I stayed at the Hilton in Downtown Miami. We got a Bayview room and it came with incredible views of the Miami Skyline. The staff was always friendly and helpful. I even asked a random employee about towels poolside & he was more than happy to help even though it's not technically his job. The only downside is that it is a bit of a hassle to get to the beach compared to staying in South Beach, but I already knew that going into the stay. I also liked that they were dog friendly. I took my Pekingese with me and she loved the beds (slept comfortably) and the floor to ceiling windows.</p></li>

After finally being checked in I was given a room that had some problems. Had to move rooms, but was upgraded to a suite and my room service was comped. Very nicely handled by front desk staff.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a great hotel. Stayed here during re NBA finals. The rooms are really nice and clean and the staff is amazing. Just need to watch out for all the greedy homeless people outside. Looks like the projects are just a few blocks away from the hotel and these folks come at you over and over. Never had a bum get angry and call me names because I didn't give him anything. He forgot I gave him a few dollars the day before. Also DO NOT GO TO THE RALLY'S ACROSS THE STREET. this is the worst joint ever. It tool almost 30 min to make some food an no one else was there other than the homeless people that kept asking to get their cup refilled for them. Sorry diverted from the hotel but it was perfect!!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I spent 2 nights here for a business trip. This is an older hotel but seems to have been renovated fairly recently. One annoyance, the first suite assigned to me was already occupied! Second room was upgrade to huge corner junior suite with nice view thru floor-ceiling windows of Biscayne Bay and cruise ship harbor. Hotel was packed with south american tourists but my corner room was quiet. Location is a little awkward to enter due to road construction. 2 sets of elevators and 2nd floor lobby layout is confusing at first. High parking rates unless you get park & stay AAA rate (I did). Good restaurant. Good Chinese restaurant in Doubletree next door. Room was in good condition and seemed fairly recent renovation.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I travel to Miami on a regular basis and always stay here when the rates are competitive. It is in downtown Miami, so it makes sales calls very convenient for me. The rooms overlooking the bay have fantastic views. The food is decent, nothing great, but Bayside is just a short drive or 20 min. walk in one direction and there are more places to eat in the other direction. The pool area is nice and the water is just two blocks away. It is by no means a South Beach property (thankfully). The staff is very friendly and they always remember me. The only complaint I have is the required $28 per day for parking, but this is Miami and any decent place will charge you for parking. The valet employees are very quick and nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hilton Miami Downtown hotel for 2 nights before joining a cruise and were very happy with the hotel. The room was spacious and bathroom clean with great views over the bay and the breakfast was awesome, the staff throughout the hotel were very polite and helpful. The location was good, very close to the Bayside area and just a $15 ride to Lincoln Rd/South Beach. It did seem that it was full of business people and a couple of seminars taking place but this meant the bar was lively on the evening and the pool area was very quiet during the day so we could soak up the sun with just a couple of other people around :) Overall I would definately recommend this hotel and also stay again if we return to Miami</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Booked over the net (hotels.com)from Australia for a 4 night stay prior to a cruise from Ft Lauderdale. King double requested with views to south or east as well as breakfast and carparking $200 / night. Got a 4th floor room with canyon views. No breakfast or carparking. Location was great 200 yds from Omni station for free Metro Mover + local bus station ($2 one way anywhere on route). $25 taxi from Miami airport. Rooms large and clean. No room safe or fridge - ice down the hall. Paid for newspapers - got 2 out of 4. They just said they ran out. Once coffee machine was used it was not replenished, even after a request to staff. Give it 4 out of 5 for location, but 2 out of 5 for service. Room service trays stayed in corridors for 2 days.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">overall, we are very happy with this hotel. We have a great room, spectacular view. However, we have sought a bit of relaxation in the lounge both nights we have been here. Both nights the same three staff members have been on duty. They seem to have no idea how to run a bar. The service is unbelievably slow. On both nghts we have waited for 20 minutes or more for our drinks. On both nights my husband has had to get up and deliver our orders directly to the bartender. The first night our food orders took forever and tonight I never got my slice of pie and our second round of drinks never arrived. We gave up, paid for the drinks we had and retreated to our comfortable room. We go out and we travel a lot - this service was just plain bizarre.</p></li>

Location is decent- fairly close to real downtown, very close to bus and train terminal for south beach etc. But not much in walking range. Conference setup is typical but decent. Wifi struggles at times, nerd heavy conferences will be rough. Food: seriously excellent snapper, bomb key lime pie. Again conference food just ok though, damn those $16 DOJ muffins Rooms a are good, big tvs, comfy beds, nice setup. Staff were real helpful and friendly, no faults there. Some fun decor and some oldish. Overall really happy with our stay, apart from one crappy bathroom light switch that took all your body weight to activate...</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had great difficulty getting a room in Miami as it was Super Bowl week end and so used some HHonors points to stay here. I was delighted to be upgraded to Executive Level something I don't think Starwood or IC Hotels do when using points. The hotel was full and jumping with lively but good natured Colts fans and had a fantastic atmosphere. In spite of everything, the hotel coped very well and it was great - food, staff, room, lounge all excellent. Being downtown the hotel is a bit lacking in local amenities. Bayside Plaza is a short taxi ride away which is a lot of fun especially on Super Bowl week end and the Metromover is just a block away which gives access to Metrorail. This will get you to Dadeland Mall, a good place for shopping and gifts to take home.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed one night before boarding a cruise ship. As a Hilton gold member, had access to the lounge, and free internet in room. Luckily, due to the fact that internet access is pricey otherwise. Lounge lacked bottles of water! Only option for a hot meal for breakfast was scrambled eggs and bacon; no oatmeal at this location, which I was looking forward to. The toaster was broken as well, with burned out elements. Other food in the lounge was good (fruit, coffee). When we arrived, only option for a meal was at the bar in the lobby. Horrible club sandwich! Cold fat soaked bacon, processed meats, and very expensive. Plus, they tack on an 18% service fee with the meal - 2 drinks and 2 sandwiches came to $64!! Recommendation: eat elsewhere; even room service would probably have been better.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I'm a hhonors Diamond member. Was pre-assigned room number 1630 a large corner room with its own huge private terrace. The floor to ceiling windows and the private terrace made for spectacular views of downtown Miami as well as the cruise port. The staff were all pleasant and helpful, especially Bell services that made several dining recommendations. There's a Tapas bar on the other side of the street about a block to your right. The pool is on the roof just off of the lobby, with a large selection of loungers as well as couples loungers with cushions. The executive lounge had new Dell computers, wifi internet access was available throughout the hotel (including the pool area) -- free for gold and diamond members. Would definitely recommend for a pre/post cruise stay. Great treatment of hhonors members.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I had to spend my last night in Miami, and in Downtown I found this Hilto more convenient than the Hyatt, where I spent a couple of nights ten days before. The parking was just fine: as i already wrote just pick the valet service because a) you don't want to look for a parking in this neighborhood and b) the difference between valet and single entry is risible. The hotel is conveniently located: as you can assume reading the address this hotel is just a block from Bayside Marketplace (biscayne blvd runs parallel to the port) and above all it is 15 minutes drive from south beach. Absolutely nothing to complain about rooms (modern and with huge widescreen tv) and service: the express check out on the phone, in a busy day of meeting and conferences, saved me a lot of time. In downtown Miami I would probably come back here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was on a weeklong business trip and attended a training program. The hotel is very convenient to Enterprise Rental car and very easy to get to the airport and to the South Beach areas for business and fun. Cab ride to South Beach was $15. Beds were very comfortble with excellent creature comforts, towels pillows and bedding and I felt that it was a very comfortable sleeping room. Wireless internet access is $9.95 which isn't bad by most comparisons. The banquet food was fabulous and themed menus were creative and well presented. I loved the shrimp and crab claws. Nice pool area for catching some sun or for a late night swim.. I had a great burger and beer at the lobby bar upon arrival and felt like the staff was very friendly in all departments. I would definitely go back. Great meeting space adn overall a well managed Hilton.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My two daughters and I stayed here for 2 nights after a cruise. I had prepaid for a junior suite and requested a higher floor room with a nice bayview and early check-in if possible. I also told the front desk manager Christopher that it was a special trip as both my daughters had birthdays. When we got to the hotel, around 11a.m, room wasn't ready, but they checked our bags and we went straight to the pool. I was told they would put a rush on getting the room ready and they asked for my cell phone. By 12:30 p.m, I got a call on my cell phone to inform me our room was ready. Beautiful room, gorgeous view. I called to thank Christopher and he even remembered that my girls had birthdays and sent up some treats for them. Thank you so much!! The only thing I found strange was that there was no mini fridge in the room, even for a suite our size.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Hilton for 2 nights after getting of a cruise. The hotel itself was pretty good. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the lobby and bars downstairs were very relaxing and we did spend alot of time there. The room was spacious, but the walls very thin. We were near the lifts and they were noisy all night. The airconditioning in the room was rather loud as well. But the room was clean and bright. Except for the location, we would stay there again. When we travel, we like to walk around the area/city and enjoy the sights. DO NOT walk too far from this Hotel. We should have stayed at South Beach area instead. Downtown did not feel safe at all, and there were alot of unsavoury looks as we did walk 4 blocks from the Hotel. We soon turned around, went back and called a taxi to take us where we wanted to go. The Hotel is good - the location is not.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First of all, this Hilton is OK as a hotel - rooms are all right, service is sort of all right, restaurant and bar are a bit gloomy but all right, and the location is grim but OK if you have to be away from Miami Beach for business. for the price, it's OK, nothing more. Main objection was an absolutely ludicrous bill we received for use of phone in the room - $20 USD flat rate for making a call even when it didn't connect, and about $17USD per minute for international calls. We all know hotel phones are pricey, so we kept the calls short, but even still - the rates aren't advertised anywhere in the room. Coming from Europe, it takes some time to get used to the "rip me off at every corner" culture in the States, but this was just going too far. Really abusive. So the hotel - fine, for the cost, if you have to be downtown, it's an OK choice. Phone - don't go near it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We booked via web and got a fair price last fall. The location is pretty much good. It takes 5-10 minutes to oceans drive with cab or car. At first they took us to an unready room which was disappointing but after a short wait they took us to a really big room with a great harbor scene as an apology to the mess. The rooms are pretty new or renovated recently . Bathroom is clean and wide. The beds are comfortable and big. The breakfast buffet wasn't included in the price but we enjoyed continental breakfast. The rooms have fast internet access even internet tv but we didn't have time to use. The staff were pretty friendly and warm especially the bellboys and front desk officials. Ä±t has an interesting entrance you take a lift to 3 floor above to enter the lobby from the valet service but still not tiring. As a matter of fact if you want to spend a few days in central Miami I say go for it.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We decided to stay at Hilton dowtown after a terrible experience in South Beach, at "Suites on South Beach". Weather was terrible, never so cold in Miami since 1930. We had a wonderful room at 20th floor with 2 walls of windows, overlooking the city. There was a problem with heating system, but it seems it was the first time ever they need it... Anyway the staff had been wonderful and tried immediatly to fix it. Valet parking was very pricy ($ 28) but very efficient. Internet connection free in the lobby, pricy in the rooms, breakfast not included. Nice swimming pool, even if not tried having 32Â°F. The hotel formerly was a Radisson and the struistoric Hilton are better. Heating quite noisy. Anyway if you have a car it takes 3 minutes to go to South Beach and it is better spend money for a good hotel in downtown compared to a fake design hotel in SOBE. Try taptap haitian restaurant for dinner, wonderful.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Nice hotel no real complaints. Thanks to Anthony at the front desk who managed to get us a room with a great view for my partners birthday. Nice bar and restaurant downstairs, great pool and views. The drinks and food are pricey in the hotel, but then again in Miami everything seems to be expensive. There are fast food places to eat right across the street, you would have to drive a few blocks for a good place to eat. Also lots of construction on the streets make sure you plan to leave a bit early especially on the weekend. Close to all - short taxi ride away. I would not recommend strolling at night in the area, during the day very busy and walkable. I would definitly stay again, and it was a great experience overall. One more note parking is 28 per day, and internet 10 bucks for 24 hrs - again something expected in a downtown major city ..no real place to park otherwise, so this may be the only option, or cab it..</p></li>

The view of the bay was incredible, and my bed was very comfortable. A huge group of teenagers were staying in the hotel, and kids were all over the place until late at night...flooding the lobby, elevators, and public space. I finally had to take my drink from the bar to my room as a result of all of the noise and lack of supervision. Kids were in the hallway during the night slamming doors and making noise. I called the front desk, they responded, but little control over the situation. I would hope that there would be a cerfew and expectations of adult supervision in the future as I got little sleep as a result of the noise. Other than the noise and kids, it was a good hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here when I went to visit U of M. I got a great deal online! The hotel is very clean, the staff professional - and the food - simply amazing. Although - taking a tip from a previous poster - dine at the Bistro - 1/2 price on some of the appetizers and reasonably priced sandwiches. What I got was beyond what I expected - I was stuffed to the brim. The room was immaculate (although the hair dryer had a broken attachment). If you can get a good deal...I say go for it. If you're visiting the med school, it's supposedly only 2.5 miles away - but it took me nearly half an hour to deal with the miami traffic - so either familiarize yourself the night before OR leave early enough to address the bumper to bumper traffic. BE WARNED though - self-park is 25 per day in the garage (or pay everytime you pull it out of the garage); valet park is 28 per day (can pull it out as often as you want). Rates are valid as of this posting.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visted this hotel on a Thursday with two other family members. Check in was quick and our bags were brought to the room in a timely manner. The lobby, restautant, bar and pool looked great at this hotel. The rooms and hallways left a little more to be desired. On the way to my room someone had dropped 3 beers on the floor and it was wet and sticky with the cans still there and a wet floor sign in the middle. After staying in Hilton's in Alabama and other states i was expecting more from the Hilton in Miami. The room's didnt look nearly as good as they did in other less known cities. No safe or frig in the rooms. The staff was great. They only give 2 free continental breakfast coupons no matter how many people you book in the room. I didnt like the looks of the free continental breakfast so I ordered room service and it was tasty and arrived quickly. Checkout was quick. I would still stay again now that I know what to expect.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was booked for us through our travel agent - it was near the airport & near the port of Miami where we were leaving on a cruise. Though I found the hotel very pricey (for us) I'm sure you could get a much better rate on line. The room was nice & we sort of had a view of the ocean - the staff was excellent - from the front desk to the valet! We picked up a car through Enterprise at the airport & was allowed to drop it off at the hotel the next day, very convenient, since the cruise line was supplying a shuttle for us to the pier. Since we paid $210 for the night I thought we'd get free parking - we used the valet service for $28 (plus tips) which we found pricey also. We didn't stay there long, it was basically a place to sleep for the night so considering that I thought the $210 for the room & $28 for the parking was VERY high but I really had no complaints about the hotel or the staff. And it is a very lovely place.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When we arrived for a one night stay, (we were catching a cruise ship the next morning) the one bell hop at the entrance did not greet us, or offer to help, or open a door. He seemed to be busy counting his tips. The young man at the check in desk was very helpful but was new, as he sounded so scripted as if he had memorised all his lines. The hotel is old and needs some updating in several areas. We had a snack in the lounge as that's all that was available. It was almost uneatable, but we were hungry. The next day they compt our snack after explaning it all to the front desk people. The Hilton Honors lounge had a very nice breakfast available but it seemed that the superivisor was the only one who took the initiative to clean tables, so was hard to find a clean one. The hotel is near the ski train that will take you right downtown for free. Watch out for the unfortuneates in our society. There is tansit police around but not everywhere.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here one night on business, enjoying the $89/night rate they were advertising on their web site. I would call this a four star hotel that's slightly rough around the edges. Tropical theme, colorful decor. All the staff members I encountered were more than friendly and attentive. Really, very hospitable. My first room was a bit noisy as it was across the hall from the vending machine, so they moved me, gladly, to the 18th floor. And they sent someone up to move me and didn't make me haul my luggage all the way downstairs again. Nice touch. The pool was fine, relaxing for downtown location. I had dinner outside in the nice Miami breeze. The ceviche was terrific. But the wines by the glass selections could be a bit more varied. Kendall Jackson and BV were about it. For such an international city I thought there would be more attention paid to international wines, but that's my thing so... Overall, nice place to stay if you are in town on business.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our stay at the Hilton Downtown Miami was nothing short of perfect. The staff were very friendly from the moment we reached there to the moment we left. I have never come across such friendly staff! We arrived there after a very long flight from Ireland and we were delighted to have such a fast check in and such friendly service. Our room was very comfortable and had a amazing view of the city and of the bay. Definitely worth the money. The breakfast buffet was quiet nice. There was one occasion in which we ordered from the menu, sadly it was a little disappointing because it was overcooked but we were taken care of almost immediately when we complained. The hotel is close to everything. All you need to do is hop on the bus or metromover which is almost outside the door! So it is impossible to complain about that! There were always taxi's at the hotel also that could bring us on a five minute trip to the beach!! Fantastic hotel, keep it up! We will be back for sure. Thanks for a great stay!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Regular Miami traveller here. First time for the Hilton Downtown. The hotel room is well-appointed, clean, and contains the new amenities at Hilton - Lavazza in-room coffee, thick towels, and comfortable bedding. The A/C, as mentioned elsewhere here, is very loud. Can't hear the old-style TV (?) when it comes on. The location is less than optimal - the northern edge of Downtown. I wouldn't venture by foot very far here after dark - not there's much around. There is a couple of small restaurants two blocks north on Biscayne worth a try: Bin 18 and a Sushi bar. Pretty safe if you stay on Biscayne. Also a salad place and sandwich shop just past 19th St (hotel is on 16th). Have not tried the hotel offerings yet. Parking is absurd. $28 in this economy?? You have to be kidding! Indoor Park a block and a half away just off 2nd Ave and 14th St. on your left. You'll see the signs - much, much less expensive. All in all, not bad if you can figure out the parking. Compares well to the Hyatt in the room, although the Hyatt personal service is superior.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stay at hundreds of hotels per year for work. I have a difficult time sleeping at night so requested a room away from the elevator. I reconfirmed this request prior to arrival. However, when I arrived my room as well as my mothers room who is also a very light sleeper is next to an elevator. The staff were unhelpful. I spoke to several managers including Humberto several times. After a very poor nights sleep he offered to refund the points for the rooms. I accepted since the only reason I stayed at this Hilton was for a good nights sleep while starting a family vacation. The elevator dinged all night long keeping up the entire family. While the offer of refunding the points was nice, it would have actually been netter if they followed though on that promise!. After several e-mails they responded they were only refunding a single room. I also copied the Hilton executive team and did not receive a response form them. I will be not be staying at this hotel again and if you want a good nights sleep at a hotel with a friendly staff I recommend you don't either.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed 1 night at this hotel as my wife and I prepared to fly out to the Caribbean the next day for an extended vacation. Check-in was easy, though its a little funky getting to the reception area as you have to take an elevator up a floor, but not a big deal. Had a great internet deal we found on hilton.com for the website, so we were able to stay there for under $65 a night. Room had a great city-view, it was clean, and everything worked properly. We wanted some firmer pillows and they brought them right up. They also gave us concierge access so a continental breakfast was available to us the next morning (not sure if it offered to everyone or to us because we were Hilton Honors members). Breakfast was typical continental, but good. We hung out by pool for a little bit in the morning as well, there were plenty of lounge chairs and pool was clean. They also had a business center with free internet access for guests, so we were able to check our flight info, which was a big help. Great value for the money we spent and not that far from airport. We'd stay there again w/o a 2nd thought.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found a great deal on Expedia and were excited to stay at the Hilton. When we arrived the valet guys seemed like they had nothing better to do than harass us. We checked in and later that night I wanted to have a bath. To my surprise, tge tub filled with green water. We called the front desk and they sent someone up to check. The guy who came said it was the city's problem and left. The manager called and said the water was safe and we explained we did not feel comfortable bathing and brushing our teeth in green water. We asked him for another room and to check it first. We waited an hour and got impatient because it was midnight. We called and they said they had one room but the water was green too. We asked for a discount or something and he said he would drop off some breakfast vouchers. We woke up to no vouchers under our door and had to call and explain a couple more times the situation. What an ordeal. They gave us continental vouchers. What an insult. We confronted them and they gave us a full breakfast. The breakfast was actually the highlight but the service at this hotel was disorganized and rude!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I too saw a number of marginal comments however I stayed at the hotel in the begining of October. I was on the 8th floor. The view was inrcedible. Folks, I travel often and certainly know the difference between hiding quality service and providing quality service. If you are not the type of person who is trying to find something wrong, you will love this place. It is in downtown so you have to cab or drive to Miami beach but you know that upon reservation. I suggest the cab. It cost me 6.00 one way. 10.00 after the tip. So for 20.00 you get a safe way to and from the SOBE area. The rooms are clean and truly comfortable. The complaints you see are not accurate. Now, if you are a person who can find something wrong at any hotel than do not stay here. Because you will complain that the elevators are slow....that the elevators are warm....It will always be something and frankly you would complain if you were given the room for free. If you are complaining about anything in your room, get a life. You are in Miami. Get out and see the beach and the nitelife!!!! Overall, great place, great hotel, great staff. The total package!!!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was great. My girlfriend and I got it for a great price. The room was very nice, as was the bathroom. The room was quite large. The bed was extremely comfortable and the AC worked beautifully. It was very clean. Service was friendly and on top of things. Concierge desk was extremely helpful (leave a tip). Room service was great - they had great 24 hour food - try the conch chowder, the conch fritters, key lime pie - I could keep going, everything was delicious. The restaurant inside the hotel had delicious plates and the breakfast buffet was reasonably priced and delicious. The outdoor pool and patio were awesome and not even that busy. The hotel is a three minute walk to the Metromover which will take you to Bayside in a couple of minutes where there is nightlife, shops, drinks, and restaurants. After 6 nights at South Beach right beside Ocean Drive, this hotel and downtown Miami (particularly Bayside) were a great escape for us. Relaxing versus the 24 hour party going on at South Beach (though that was great as well). This hotel was just great, exactly what you would expect from a Hilton. This hotel was awesome.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">They are doing the best they can with the old building. If low ceilings bother you this is not the place for you. This hotel is best suited for the folks who want a decent place to stay when working in downtown Miami or are going to catch a cruise. We only picked it because we wanted a hotel that would give us the night we needed for our Hilton Honors points. That having been said that have updated the rooms and the corner Jr. Suite is very spacious, had a great view of the bay but lacked a microwave or a mini-refrigerator??? The bathroom was small as well. The pool area was actually a nice surprise as it was spacious and well furnished with a very friendly full service pool bar and grill. This is a very large hotel and very busy with many international guest (we overheard many languages spoken) and eventhough the staff was VERY busy they all had a great attitude and friendly demeanor. The overwhelming number of people just means that everything takes a little longer. I also did not care for the $28/ day parking fee. Im confident that given more time I could have found something more pleasing for the second half of our family vacation.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We did a roundtrip in Florida and stayed here for two nights. Ask bayview and as high as possibele ! We has a great view over the bay (room 1416) The room was clean, large with a very comfortable bed. The sheets and pillows are excellent for a good night sleep. There is no fridge or in-room safe in the room. The bathroom is also really nice, here the towels smells like they should. We did valid parking (max 28 dollar a day), no problem checking in and out, they are fast. Also we tried the breakfast buffet, it was tastfull and complete (20 dollar p.p.) Only free high speed wireless internet in the lounge, not in the rooms (10 dollar extra charge in room) We booked the room by travelagent for 120 dollar, with the extra parking costs the price was still not bad at all. One of the best hotels during our holiday, if there is a next time, we book it again without any doubt . The location,down -town, was oke. There are just a few fast-food eateries near the entrance of the hotel. Things looked not so nice a few blocks further away, so we did not walked around the area. South beach is a 15 minutes drive. We also did some beaching on Key Biscane, loved it.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I liked the comfort of the beds, the flow of water in the shower, and the helpfulness of the staff, but that is pretty much it. Aside from the convenient location to the MetroMover, which was all we needed to get to the bayside station. The hotel needs to seriously upgrade its rooms to be in par with other establishments. It lacks a new television sets. Switching between channels was quite dreadful; the volume was vastly different for every other station. The room was a bit dusty and the coffee station did not have stir sticks. In addition, it did not enough tea bags for two people. With the absents of bath towels in our room, especially after haven already taking a shower, made the experience of drying off a difficult challenge. The area is not safe to walk around with panhandlers lurking around, if the burger king needs security at night, this is a clear indication that you better stay inside and order in. We witnessed an arrest by hotel security staff after a man refused to leave the motor lobby. Btw, when you arrive at the hotel, it is quite confusing where the check in is located (2nd floor). In this case, I would suggest more signage for those arriving at the hotel.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Sexual Harassment,Liars, DO NOT STAY HERE”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Two friends and I (three young women) stayed at this hotel during June of this Summer. During our stay we were sexually harassed by the security guard on duty by the pool. Not only did the three of us feel unsafe but we were scared to stay in the room for fear the guard might have access to our room. The next day after I arrived back in Atlanta, I contacted the hotel and left a message for the manger stating that it was about sexual harassment at the hotel...I never received a call back. So then I contacted Corporate offices, and I was informed that the manager already stated that he sent a apology to me (LIES). The manger (Mr. Pellon) of the hotel did not give an apology, he just said he did to cover his own tracks. I had to chase down an apology. I JUSTreceived an apology on October 3, 2011. I was not even offered anything to attempt to make the situation better, or even a complimentary night at ANOTHER Hilton (because I defiantly won't be going back to the Hilton Miami) to make up for the awful three harassment filled nights we spent at the Hilton Miami. If this harassment has happen to you at this hotel also, please contact me because my attorney will be more than happy to take your case also.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed one night on way to cruise. Booked a 2 queen bed junior suite for 5 people. The 2 queen beds were NOT queen size. They were at most double beds. The room was very large and had a pull-out sofa. But, there were no sheets available and we had to call down to housekeeping at 2am (when we arrived) to get sheets. The poor gentleman who arrived with our sheets had NO idea how to make a bed, he started putting the blanket on the mattress (before the sheets) when I told him he could leave. The room did have windows on 3 sides and a great view. As a Hilton gold member, we went to the concierge level for the continental breakfast. It was NOT good. Extremely runny, undercooked scrambled eggs, bacon, cheap bagels, yogurt, some cereal. I have had much better free continental breakfasts at Holiday Inns. And if you think the reviews about the elevators are exaggerated, they are not. The elevator can take 20-30 minutes to get to your floor and is often filled with people and luggage. We tried to take the stairs, but there is no direct route to the lobby and ended up on a wild goose chase around the building. Ended up riding up and back down to get to the lobby. This was just an OK place to stay for 1 night.</p></li>

Room was very sub-standard for cleanliness...floor looked like it never gets vacuumed. Not the best area at night TV cable kept going out Conference rooms are cold Charge for WiFi unless you have an existing account like AT&T Overall very disappointed for a Hilton...the hotel seemed more like a hotel going out of business.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for 2 nights in Sept 2008, on our way down to Key West. Got a great deal on the room through priceline. Room was great, very large corner room, nice flat panel TV, fridge, the 2 outer walls were basically floor to ceiling windows with amazing views. Service was good, nothing to complain about. Hotel is clean and nicely decorated. Now the things that ticked us off, and I know some of this isn't the fault of the hotel. When I booked the hotel, the hotel info said that parking was available, it was not stated that I would have to pay $28 to park, so when we went out for the day and came back $28, and when we left to go to Bayside $28, and then when we checked out another $28, now my great deal wasn't so great anymore. To further my aggravation, the hotel information stated that a continental breakfast buffet was included, however when we went down the dining area and got the kids some food and sat down to eat is when we were informed that the breakfast was not included, since we were already sitting and eating it was a little too late to get up and leave, add another $60 to the bill and my deal is now no deal. I could have spent less in the end and stayed somewhere else. I know that the hotel had recently changed ownership but they should have had the hotel information changed with the various booking agents.</p></li>

<li>When I booked the hotel, the hotel info said that parking was available, it was not stated that I would have to pay $28 to park, so when we went out for the day and came back $28, and when we left to go to Bayside $28, and then when we checked out another $28, now my great deal wasn't so great anymore.</br>

<li>To further my aggravation, the hotel information stated that a continental breakfast buffet was included, however when we went down the dining area and got the kids some food and sat down to eat is when we were informed that the breakfast was not included, since we were already sitting and eating it was a little too late to get up and leave, add another $60 to the bill and my deal is now no deal.</br>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I travel about every week for business and stay in the Hilton/Hilton chain for the points and usually my stays are fine there. This was my first and last time at the Hilton downtown Miami. Where do I start? Checking was fine and the room view was outstanding...that's the good. Valet service is god awful. There Is a dedicated attendant in a booth working but she doesn't pick up her phone...what's the point. Then when I got my car 10 minutes later the attendent just handed me my keys and walked away...a total joke. The room,...bathroom had hair on the sink and tub. The ventilation system (not the ac) was loud and could not be turned off...I am not the type that needs total silence to sleep but I was counting the days to get the he'll outta here. I was 5 rooms away from the elevator and the noise in the hall of just the elevator was annoying. I asked to change rooms and was met with attitude and a "check back later, we have no rooms left". I just smiled and went to work. You need to take an elevator to get to the registration. Then after registration you need to walk to a different set of elevators across the hotel to get to your room. A design genius put this hotel together clearly. My lesson! All Hiltons are not the same. I will be back on business in Miami soon and am damn sure I'm not staying here. Don't make the same mistake I did.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Miami Hilton for a conference he was attending. Not a terrible place, but I have to say that I've stayed in nicer places that are less expensive. For me, it's the little details that make a hotel worth the money, and the Hilton just doesn't have the attention to detail that a hotel of its caliber should. First, the toilet paper holder is 2.5 ft. away from the toilet - I kid you not. You almost fall off of the toilet trying to get it. Second, my husband and I are both businesspeople, and to get wireless internet in our room, we were EACH charged $9.99 a day, even though their materials all say "wireless internet in your room for only $9.99 a day." What they should say is per computer. Maybe other hotels do this, too, but I haven't experienced it. I'm sleeping in the bed with my husband. Will I be charged extra for that? Third, the entire hotel is a little run down. I'd suggest Hilton put a few dollars into a rehab. Soon. Last, the food is mediocre at best and overpriced as all hotel food is. Breakfast was cold, room service was OK. As I'm writing this review, we've been without water - the entire hotel - for more than 3 hours. Now, I don't expect Hilton to be able to control emergencies like this, but I mention it only as another point of frustration with this place. In a city like Miami, I'm sure there are better places to stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My wife and our 2 kids stayed at the hotel after our cruise trip and one of the good, amoung others, is how close is the hotel from the miami port....it's just like 10 minutes! When we finally got to the lobby (because it's a little bit tricky) it was full of people checking in, but everything ran just perfect thanks to the professionalism and friendly attitude of the front desk agents. We got an upgrade when checked in to a better view room, bay/city view which was gorgeous, specially at night! The kids wanted to go the pool, so went there and had some really good sandwiches and the pool was clean and not so many people at all. The executive lounge is in the 16th floor (also a great view!) and there we met Luis who was very friendly and polite, always smiling and as it was our first time in miami he kindly answer ALL of our questions. We also wanted to go out for dinner(the snacks in the lounge weren't enough for the kids)so he recommended a very good restaurant near the bay area and he even called there and made us a reservation so we didn't have to wait for the line. Everytime we ran into someone they always saluted us. I thinks the location it's not the best for young people or a group of friends because there not much to do, but for just one night when traveling for business or with family it's a great place. I would go and would stay again without any doubts.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">One or two issues during our stay included :- Housekeeping - at least 2 days out of the 5 our room was not made up and we had to chase housekeeping. Don't really need this on holiday especially when you have been out really early say on an excursion and you return late afternoon/early evening to find room not cleaned or replenished. Excursions booked via hotel consierge could only be paid for with cash. As previous review on Hilton Bentley this seems to be a policy throughout the Miami area. Other travellers we spoke to experienced the same. Cannot even charge to room account. Bar service at busy times was a little haphazard - incorrect orders although they did make amends for errors. Pool area although at roof level and could be quite a haven staff appeared once again overwhelmed at busy times - could not keep on top of towel demand and allowed guests to bring bottles/glasses into the pool area. One issue with the executive lounge access - hotel literature stated the lounge should have been open from 6.00 am - this was not the case and when we arrived on one occasion to grab breakfast before leaving for the day we were told to "try later lounge not opening yet staff had not arrived". We felt that an establishment of this nature in this location and carrying the Hilton brand should have made staff available to man the lounge at the times stated. That said we enjoyed our time Downtown and the location of the hotel is good especially for one/two night cruise passengers.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Pre-Cruise Five Rooms excellent stay.”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel and the staff were great. The renovations that I have been reading about appear to be just about complete. The rooms were GREAT! All five of them. Updated, clean, and very comfortable beds. One of the rooms air conditioning did not work and the front desk gave a rebate for that room which was nice. After working 15 years in the hotel business I know that perfection isnt always possible thus I appreciate it when hotel staff goes the extra mile. For example, I was told by the front desk that I needed to go down to the transportation office in order to book the shuttle to the cruise terminal. When I got downstairs to the motor lobby there was no one at the transportation office. The bell captain noticed I looked confused and asked me what I needed. I told him I needed a shuttle to the cruise terminal for 12 people for 11AM the next morning. He told me that no one was at the transportation office but he took my room number and told me he would have a shuttle for me at the time requested. Just based on prior experience I thought that the next morning we would be scrambling for cabs so I got downstairs a little early. The Bell Captain recognixed me as I got off the elevator, got all of our luggage together and got us oon our way in our shuttle. I the hotel business sometimes the HOSPITALITY piece is forgotten. Not so at the Hilton Miami Downtown. The service was the best!! Also the fitmess center was really excellent. As was the resturant. We had lunch one day and breakfast another</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was a bit worried from the reviews about the Hilton. After staying there, I think some of these people that complain either are used to staying at the Ritz-Carlton or just too damn picky. We got there on Thursday night and didn't have to stand in any lines to check in. The front desk guy was nice enough to give us a room facing the bay after we requested it although what they had available was on the 4th floor. The room had two huge windows with a nice view and it was nice and cleanly decorated. The buffet breakfast (whcich was part of the room rate) was very good I must say, although it was the same every day, but we didn't mind). We were able to grab some bottles of water and fruit on our way out for the day. Another positive was the free internet service in the lobby (they had 3 computers you could use as well as wireless if you had a laptop) We were also able to avoid paying the $28 parking fee by parking across the street at a meter and then making sure we moved our car in the morning. Everything was pretty close and accessible from the hotel (Bayside, South Beach, Coconut Grove etc.) Of course the downside was that the elevators were slow, depending on what time of the day it was ..but the way people complain on here, you would think it was the end of the world. It really was not that bad if you had 2-3 minutes of patience. Overall, I would stay there again because the other hotels were a little more expensive (Doubletree, Marriot) and you would have to pay even more to include breakfast.</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Nice but not convenient to anything!”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I won't restate what has been said in earlier reviews. This is a stay overnight for a cruise hotel. I am on business and an $8 cab ride to downtown. The hotel is not convenient to anything or anyplace. The hotel sorely lacks business services...no FedEx supplies and no one that even understands enough about business needs to ask about supplies. The one issue i must stress is do not--I repeat--do not take the overhead train cars to or from the hotel area after 6pm. Regardless of what you are told it is not safe for anyone. If you don't know the system you will go around in circles and the cars are invested with local hoodlums and drunks. There is no police presence...ever! Last night i took it back from Bayside and the car was filled with drunk teens that were looking for a fight. They don't get off they just ride in circles and look for trouble. There were two young girls on board that were terrified...I told them to get off the tram with me--they did and I put them in a cab to their hotel. I have been travelling to Miami for years and it just gets worse every year. The downtown is a ghost town except for a couple of hotels and Bayside. Do not wander off the main strip! One other note..the restaurant in the hotel is nice but the waiters are drenched in cologne so that is all you smell and taste. I complained to the "manager" and she told me that it was "their culture". Huh? So, if you are staying one night and then heading to the cruise terminal it is fine...anything more than that look at a more upscale place in a better area of town.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was here for one night with my family before we board a cruise ship across the bay. I was hhonors gold member so my room was upgraded to a bayview on high floor with access to lounge. Nothing to complain. The room is a big corner room with a balcony as big as the room itself :P floor to ceiling window provide great view and bright natrual light. As I was only there for one night I didn't utility all the services the hotel had to offer. Just used the lounge for snack in the early evening and breakfast the next morning. The lady at the nice enough to give my daughter an OJ even though it wasn't normally offered for snacks and only for breakfast. Of course, as in all other downtown hotels, parking is over-priced and I believe self-parking is almost as expensive as valet so I went with valet parking with unlimited ins and outs. There was one little bump in my stay, my room is a connecting room with the other side also occupied. The neighbor was a bit loud in the music playing but it goes with the connecting room so I can't really complain too much. Then I smelled cigarette smoke leaking through the connecting door. The smell gets stronger and stronger and I have a preganent wife and a small child so I called front desk and confirmed the hotel is a 100% smoke-free hotel and told them about the smoke. The manager was quick to investigate with security staff. Minutes later, the manager is back at my door and told me they have resolved the issue with my next door neighbor and asked me if wanted to switch room. It was late in the night so I thanked him and said I can just open the big sliding door to the balcony to air out the room. Overall, it was a very nice stay with excellent services.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 2.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Despite some negative comments that we read on this site we still decided to give the Hilton a chance because the location was perfect for our trip. I must say we were extremely disappointed with our stay there. The renovations were the least of our worries. The room was nice. We had a Jr. Suite with the Bay view. The room was very spacious and nicely put together. HOUSEKEEPING: Never understood that there were 4 people in the room (room can hold 5) and choose to only put towels for 3 each day we were day (4 days) despite many calls to the front desk. They also did an extremely lousy job in cleaning the room. They would leave dirty glasses and leave new ones and they did not change the sheets. VALET: I must say the only friendly people at this hotel were the actually valet driversâ€¦those in the Valet booth were extremely rude and will forget to give your keys to a driver to get your car (happened to several guests) RENOVATIONS: Drilling started at 7am right outside our window. We made a complainant and were told we could have a free breakfast. When we went to retrieve the breakfast we were told that we couldnâ€™t get it and were accused of lying about getting a free breakfast. FRONT DESK: Members of the front desk staff were extremely rude and condescending!! Messages are not sent to the manager but rather put to the side. We finally spoke to one front desk manager who compensated us for one nights stay because of our troubles. We were pleased until the day of check out when we dealt with an â€œassistant front desk managerâ€� who gave us trouble with our reimbursement. Long story short itâ€™s a good thing I spent more time out of the hotel than in because my stay at the Downtown Miami Hilton could have ruined my entire vacation.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A group of three of us stayed at this motel during October 9th thru October 13th. My opinion is that this motel was extremely unorganized during this time. Upon arrival at the motel my party was told that we couldn't be checked into a room despite paying our trip in advance because they were having issues receiving payment from the vendor. We had our payment receipts and confirmations in hand and had also called in advance to confirm before arriving. We have to stand around for about two hours before being checked in. Upon checking in the room they assigned us was the wrong type. We had to go back downstairs to be assigned another room. When were assigned a new room the keys didn't work so we had to go back to have them activated. The room we finally received was very nice. We stayed in 724 which was a one bedroom suite. It was very spacious and well kept. On the upside the manager bought us dinner and drinks at the restaurant for our inconvenience at check-in and he was very apologetic and nice. The food at the restaurant was excellent and the service was great. For the most part the staff was very professional and on top of their job. There was a male bartender that in my opinion was very rude, unprofessional and obviously doesnâ€™t like his job, but that was my only negative encounter. We didn't rent a car upon arrival, but met a really nice cab driver who took us everywhere we wanted to go for the whole time we were there. This was an expensive option, but it was convenient since neither of us in the party was familiar with Miami. One of the downsides to this motel is the location. There is no food or entertainment around. There is a Checkers and a Burger king across the street. Overall the stay at this Hotel was satisfactory.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here Saturday night before the ING Miami Marathon/ Half Marathon. The entrance is funky if you arrive by car and expect to park in the garage. You drive up to what seems to be the 3-4 floor and there is a nice entrance. But the lobby is on the 7th floor, and the signage to direct guests was lacking. We finally got to the lobby and due to the many marathon guests, it was busy. I waited in the Hilton Honors line, which was shorter than the other line. After about 5 minutes, I was helped. Front desk staffer was very nice, saw that I was a Hilton Honors Gold member and quickly informed me of the complimentary welcome reception and breakfast at the executive lounge. He also noted that I requested a room by an ice machine and replied that he was sorry but they did not have any rooms left. He then upgraded me to a one-bedroom suite. When we got up there we realized it was actually two separate rooms with a connecting door, one with a dining and sitting area, bathroom, and a gorgeous view of downtown Miami. The other room was a regular guest room which was a good size and had a comfortable bed. And yes, we were now near an ice machine. The upgrade was very much appreciated. We did not make the breakfast because of the race timing, but the welcome reception was very nice. The executive lounge also had a nice view and offered hot and cold appetizers, water and soft drinks, along with wine and beer for a reasonable price. Very nice feature. I used to live right next to this hotel and was very impressed with the service and the accommodations. This hotel can often be had for a deal and would be a great value. Location is walkable to the Arsht Center, American Airlines Arena, and Bayside, but you would need a taxi/car for anything else.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel was convenient to and from Miami airport via SuperShuttle ($16 to and from here) and to cruise ship at nearby port. I came a day before the departure of my cruise and thank goodness because my bag did not make the flight, even though I'd checked in 2 hours before the flight. As the hours wore on, I became increasingly agitated with United Airlines which could not confirm with certainty the location of my bag or when it would be delivered. I called often and continued to get unsatisfactory answers. However, finally, just before the last shuttle departure to the port, a very nice bellman at the hotel let me look around the storage room and lo and behold there was my bag (I had been previously assured that it could not be at the hotel). It could have been there 10 minutes or 10 hours, who knows--a bellman had accepted delivery and never reported it to anyone. I was so happy to have the bag and reported back to the chief concierge, Yasser, what had happened so maybe someone else wouldn't have this same mix up. He escorted me to the shuttle, heard me out, talked to the bellmen and was extremely kind. When I returned to the hotel after my cruise, I learned that I had been upgraded to a suite--yay! So even though there was a mix up with my bag which caused me some frustration and sleeplessness, the Hilton more than made up for it. This hotel deals with lots of "cruisers" and the location is so convenient next to the port --I could see my ship from my hotel window. The views of the skyline and the port are terrific. The service overall is excellent. Good amenities without a lot of nickel-and-diming, eg, free high-speed Internet with 5 or 6 terminals and connected printers. Nearby Bin 18 is a wonderful restaurant, and was recommended by the concierge (David, who was also very helpful and nice).</p></li>
