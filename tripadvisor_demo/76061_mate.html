<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just stayed at the Crown Plaza in July. Good location and great service and walking Distance to shopping and place to eat. I have stayed at many Crown Plaza Hotels but this was not near as nice as the tCrown Plaza hotels I have been too. Room was clean and beds good and a great big flatscreen TV which we loved! Pool was ok and food was ok . If I went back I would stay somewhere else!</p></li>

The rooms could use some updating but are clean. We have stayed on the executive floor which comes with breakfast. The breakfast is great and I would recommend this option. We visit family in the neighborhood and the access is great for us with easy in and out of the parking garage.</p></li>

Priority club rooms were excellent and the hotel is pretty close to Rodeo Drive and selection of restaurants (I would recommend Mulberry Street Pizzeria north of the hotel).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I just stayed here for three nights, and found it to be a great hotel. Everything in the room worked, fantastic bed, 9th floor room was very quiet. All the staff were more than helpful and always friendly. The food in Martys Bistro was great ( try the steaks!). Easy walking to good food, and to Rodeo Drive. The motto of the hotel is "The Place To Meet", and i met some great people, from all over the world, over a couple of beers in the bar. I will definately stay here again and will recommend it to family and friends.</p></li>

Riley Woods at the front desk was very helpful always as well as Deming and Santos who served us breakfast and the Restaurant manager Dennis Kudos to him. he came every day to make sure we were suitably served. The hotel was in need of a renovation we expected more for such a high price of services. Thank you!</p></li>

It is about 15 minute walk to Rodeo Drive which is fine and there are shops along the way you can look at. There are nearby restaurants to chose from a very good Thai one about 5 minute walk from the hotel. We have stayed here previously and will continue to because it is very good value, love a swimming pool and the bar area is good.</p></li>

I did have a very limited time to do research by myself on where to go and what to see, so I used help from hotel concierge. From the very beginning, Tatiana comes across as a very professional and courteous person. Tatiana is extremely friendly and helpful. She made me perfect plan for all my everyday activities. She always expressed her personal ideas on which options may be better, it was done tastefully, and I did not feel pressured to choose "her option".

From the time we arrived to the time we left we never ran into one staff member that wasn't happy to be there. It started with the general manager who showed us the way to our room. We decided to eat dinner the first night at the hotel. Our waiter, Miguel Valadez was so good we decided to have dinner there a second night. The morning breakfast crew was awesome as well, Julie Vargalui and Maria Gialvez. My husband loved the service and loved that they recognized him throughout the trip</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is the second time that i stay at Crowne Plaza Beverly Hills. The 1st time was 5 years ago. At that time, i really enjoyed the hotel. Now, i've just returned from Los Angeles and i can assure you that Crowne Plaza Beverly Hills remains a really good choice. The room is very clean and confortable. The bathroom is perfect and, in addition to this, i found very sweet the gifts that they offer to guests: a relaxation CD and lavender essence. In addition to this, you can find at lobby free hot coffee/tea in the morning and lemonade in the evening. Great place to stay and relax.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was the worst hotel in a 5 city trip! My husband and I were shocked at the poor level of service here. There seemed to be no manager there to make sure the staff had its act together. The 'business centre' was 2 ancient computers with terribly slow internet speed. Plus the rooms were really old and not renovated. The carpet looked dirty and little things like no soapdish in the bathroom and an empty tissue box just added to our misery. I truly felt like switching hotels but didn't as our rooms were prepaid and I didnt' want to go through the hassle. SIncere advice - don't pick this place!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Whilst the hotel was adequate, we did not have a car and it was so far south in B. Hills that it did not show up on our map of B.Hills! Not sure why an earlier comment said close to Rodeo drive etc, we did not find any nice places within walking distance (we will walk up to a mile) and found a rough area with a man sleeping on the street just round the corner from the hotel. We stayed there to go to Universal Studios which meant we managed to enjoy our holiday but not the hotel. The room was OK but nothing special and the restaurant was OK but very limited especially for snacks and light meals.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This place is walkable (though a big walk) to most of the big Beverley Hills attractions. Nothing really wrong with the place, though we had a pretty average experience. We booked a non smoking room with 2 double beds for the four of us Our room reeked of smoke and the beds were only king singles. They changed our room to a non smoker with no apologies. They recoded Room key tags so that they didn't work. Quickly fixed, though again no apology. We had only towels and glasses etc for two, although we had booked and paid for 4. Again they fixed it, no comment. Red stains on sheets also a little off-putting.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed for two nights, and was on the 10th floor. Received a welcome basket from Priority Club including fresh fruit, cheese, crackers, and Grey Goose vodka, which was much appreciated. And the room was spacious and comfortable. Downsides were the common areas of the hotel: elevators to pool and in parking garage are very worn out and need to be refurbished; same for the stairwells, hallways, and gym. The lobby and pool are the only places that look fresh and clean. Also, note that the internet is heavily filtered. The hotel's location is very good; you can eat on the cheap (Chipotle, Cold Stone, etc.) or try something a little nicer right down the street.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed with my wife at the hotel for 3 nights in June this year. We generally liked the hotel, subject to a few comments. It is comfortable but a bit dated and I agree with comments of the previous review about the noisy air-conditioning. In June the nights were cool so we switched it off and opened the window so it was not a big issue. The breakfast menu was limited, unless you like your cereal sugar coated (I don't). It is a fair walk to the shops on Rodeo Drive and Beverly Road, but that was fine with us as we like to walk (although I gather that is a bit of rarity in LA). There are some good restaurants nearby. We liked South Beverly Grill on 122 S Beverly Dr (10 mins walk).</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was here for two nights in June: my second stay at the Crowne Plaza. I found it to be very comfortable both stays, and since I often have business nearby will undoubtably stay again. Check in went well, and the desk staff was very helpful. My rooms both times were as requested, and were large, with nice views, lots of light, very comfortable beds, a lounger and an ottoman, and well-apppointed bathrooms, wireless that worked well, quiet.....no complaints, though I agree with those that say that the breakfast is so-so here. However, it is walking distance from several other restaurants. The location is quite convienent for west side activities. A good value for what you get and for Beverly Hills; recommended.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I enjoyed my one night stay at the crowne plaza, room was lovely and clean, bed was nice and comfortable and they staff were very helpful and as I am a young female traveler who at the time was traveling on my own I felt very safe at the crowne plaza. I ordered room service and it was delicious just what I needed after 24 hours of traveling in several planes to arrive in the USA. Only thing was during the night I was awoken by banging on the roof above me and at 4am it sounded like a helicopter had taken off in my room it was the heater/cooler system boosting up or something. but the free Internet was excellent and it allowed me to stay in contact with my family definitely a plus! And also the free hot apple cider was delicious!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here the last night of a 35 day holiday in the USA. We decided that as it was our last night and we were only staying one night so we would not spend much on the room. Well you certainly get what you pay for. Rooms were very tired, lifts were very slow and the location is at the very edge of Beverly Hills. Staff were friendly and helpful. We did not use any of the facilities as we checked in and out within 24 hours. The room booked was a standard king bed room. We were traveling with our two children (8 year old and 1 year old). Cot supplied at not added cost and as the bed was a king bed we let the 8 year old sleep with us because it was just one night. If you are looking for quality rooms and good location don't book here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were looking for something close to Pauley Pavillion, and being everything near Pasadena is booked for Rose Bowl and Parade we were lucky to find this hotel. We were put on the club level with access to club room which in the morning served a great breakfast. We had great views from the 12th floor and the service was excellent. We felt very welcome there by the staff and they were very busy booking in all the TCU football fans. It was quiet and comfortable and they called the room to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. You are about 15 minute walk from Rodeo drive but a safe walk. The pool area and spa looked kept up and had people in it and the fitness room was very nice even though very small. We defineately would stay again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recently visited 6 locations in California and stayed in 5 beautiful hotels. The 6th Hotel the Crowne Plaza on South Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills was absolutely awful. The staff were cold and unfriendly, the decor was straight out of the 1970s and the stale smell from the same era. The bedroom was small and the bathroom more like a small closet. There was no safe in the bedroom and the AC unit sounded like a jet engine there was no way you could sleep with it on. There were people buying gold and silver in a bedroom at the end of the corridor which added to the sleazy feel of the place. There was a charge of $25 per day to use the car park. If you are considering going to Beverly Hills please give this hotel a miss you will not be nissing anything.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was staying at this hotel and had a "slight issue" on a previous visit. Walking in I was immediately taken away by how hospitable, welcoming, friendly Chantel was. I may be spelling her name wrong but you can't miss her, perfect hair and smile to match. She made my friend and I immediate at ease and did everything she could to make sure we had the most perfect weekend in years. I cannot thank her enough and the rest of the hotel staff for doing a SUPERB job. It is rare that I find such excellent service from anyone ( I am in the private event industry). It was better than walking into the Waldorf Astoria in NYC or the Carlton Hotel during the Cannes film festival. Thanks again to the whole Hotel Staff for doing a phenomenal job last weekend on the 13th!</p></li>

I chose it based on location and reviews from this site and was a little nervous because I booked not only my family but another family also. We were all soooo happy here. We signed up as priority club members and received not only the discounted parking but also the free breakfast which was wonderful. My kids loved it. The beds were really comfortable and the room was nice and spacious. Location was good and pretty central for our touristy things we did. I would definitely return here. The hotel staff was also so nice and the concierge was able to book both our families Warner Brothers tours from the hotel AFTER I was told by Warner Brothers they were sold out! Great hotel!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here August 2011 the hotel was very clean the pool area was very nice we had a very nice room over looking beverly drive. The location was perfect for getting around as other reviews have said the hotel rooms do need upgrading the bathrooms really need upgrading as are quite old, but are kept very clean. We used the chauffeur service which was at the side of the hotel they where excellant we went on a 7 hour tour with Augie he knew all the perfect location and also loads of knowlegde on California and George the manager was very helpful to. All in all the Crown plaza is a nice hotel staff where helpful and the beds are very comfortable as everybody says I would stay here again. Paradise cove in Malibu is totally awesome, Ruth steak house is awesome just on Beverly drive best steak ever.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel well positioned for Beverly hills, near to rodeo drive and not too far from the star's homes area. For everything else there was a drive involved, although this would be the same for anywhere you stayed in LA. The room was nice and we were upgraded due to being on our honeymoon, the staff were also very helpful and friendly, apart from the bar staff who were fairly useless. We had breakfast here one morning which was average, would suggest going just round the corner to Factors. We also parked at this hotel which was 25 dollars per day, there was notarially another nearby choice for parking. We did get free wifi in the room. If you're looking to do a star homes tour, try segwow who run Segway tours, it was great fun and also a lot cheaper than some of the Segway companies (89 dollars)</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a very average hotel. Very small bathroom. The hotel is called the Crown Plaza, Beverly Hills, but it's actually in the city limits of Los Angeles, just across the border from Beverly Hills. If you want a clean, safe, relatively inexpensive place to lay your head, this hotel will do the trick. You must have a car to get around. No public transportion nearby. Close to Hollywood and the sites. You cannot have a roll away in your room if there's already two beds in the room. They will only allow a roll away if you have a room with a king bed. This is important if you have your family and usually get a double with a roll away. For an extra $5, you can upgrade your breakfast from the free Priority Club breakfast to the buffet. It's worth the $5 to upgrade unless you only eat fruit and toast for breakfast.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was okay. The room was fine. Food was below-average quality and choices on the menu were narrow and humdrum. This matters. The neighborhood offers few alternatives for eating, and all require driving, knowing what you're looking for, and parking when you get there. I stayed for 4 nights, 3 on business and one extra night. Beverly Hills is a place I was doing business, so that's why I stayed there. I found out that 90210 is not my style. (By the way, this hotel is technically in Century City, just over the line from Beverly Hills.) L.A. has a lot to recommend it in culture and scenery, and I found little of that in this part of town, although my upper-floor room did offer a city view that was nice. The exercise room was cramped and creekity -- substandard, especially for a hotel in this price class.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After arriving at this hotel having previously stayed there before, we were greeted by the friendly warm staff. When we got into the room, it was clean, well presented and exactly as I had remembered from a previous stay. Sadly, after arriving, we were advised that a family member had taken ill and had only days to live. We told the staff who arranged a car for us to get back to LA International airport, fully refunded our stay and couldn't help us enough at this traumatic time. It was wonderful to see such EXCELLENT customer service. Overall I rate this hotel so highly as it is really well located, is clean and is well maintained. It has great facilities and the staff cannot be faulted, they are wonderful. If you need a well priced place, close to all ammenities then this is one I recommend. Well done Crowne Plaza Beverly Hills, you've done well!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Generally the room and facility were nice. Unfortunately too many negatives occurred during our stay, turning what could have been a nice stay into an unpleasant one. First, a rude valet attendant demanded our daughter move her car from a registration parking space while we were registering; he said he needed the space, even though she explained we were registering. Throughout our stay, the entry system did not work and we had to make multiple attempts with our card keys to try to enter our room, wasting 10-15 minutes of our time. We called the front desk both days and technicians were sent. On the second day, the tech made some repairs and the system appeared to work, but I could not re-enter our room the next morning. On the second morning, there was no hot water due to a problem with the boilers. The room and amenities were nice. The food in Marty's Bistro was good.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is located about 1-1.5 miles from Rodeo Drive in a quiet neighbor hood. There is not much to do around the hotel at night. This is a safe area. You can walk to Rodeo Drive but given the amount of parking in that area, I would probably drive next time. I was not sure what to expect from a Crowne Plaza so I was pleasantly surprised when I found a good clean lobby and a very clean room. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The continental breakfast was part of the package and gave us a good start in the morning. The shower was OK, as I was competing with someone else for hot water as my shower was hot and cold. There can be some traffic on busy Pico Street. We were on the 11th floor and slept the nights without problem. Overall, it is a good hotel. I would recommend this to others especially families who want a good nights sleep after a long day of sight seeing.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed here for three nights at the end of July. The name of this hotel suggests grandeur and luxury, forget it! It is a nice hotel, 3 star by European standards. Speedy check in, average room, spotlessly clean. The bar downstairs is a bit depressing, very dark and gloomy. This is where food is served too so we weren't tempted to stay there to eat. Breakfast is served in the restaurant but we didn't eat there either. The hotel concierge, we were dealing with Tatianya, is really well informed and very, very helpful. There is a bus outside the door which brings you to a stop for the hop-on-hop-off or too the Farmer's Market/The Grove shopping plaza. Los Angeles is such a sprawling city that taxis are expensive so you need to access public transport if possible and this hotel is well located for that. Would recommend this hotel because of it's location rather than because of hotel facilities.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good: The rooms were quiet, clean, and spacious. The staff was friendly and helpful. The beds were very comfy. This hotel is located on a residential street, half a block up from an arterial (Pico) so it seemed neighborhoody but was conveniently located to several good places to eat. The neighborhood is obviously Jewish, with quite a mix of Israeli restaurants and more Brooklyn feeling delis. Bad: The bathrooms are small and our shower drained slowly. There was only one "put this sign on your bed if you don't want clean sheets" sign in our room; we put it on one bed and hand wrote a note to housekeeping to please change the other bed, but neither bed was changed. A minor thing. Also, I booked with a conference rate and it was a bit of a hassle to make the booking. Ugly: Each evening and morning there was a least one staff member taking a smoking break right in front of the lobby doors! You couldn't come and go without being poisoned.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After a month traveling around the USA we loved the homely feel of this hotel. Our first impressions were very positive. We were welcomed on arrival and checked into a nice room on the 8th floor. The room was clean and had a nice view over Beverly Drive. The service was excellent. The concierge was spot on with restaurant reservations and tours. The hotel is about 20 minutes walk to Rodeo Drive and has an excellent big blue bus service to Santa Monica available at the door. Be aware that things are not close together in LA. It is a 20 minute drive to Hollywood and a 45 minute drive to Warner Brothers at Burbank. There are excellent restaurants within walking distance and a supermarket close by. There is also a self service laundry close by. The hotel restaurant is good and there is a nice pool. The Crowne Plaza Beverly Hills is a great midrange hotel that works well. The GM and his team have their act together. We will certainly return</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Spent Friday and Saturday night with my wife while visiting family that lives close by. Friendly staff at check-in, I had mentioned the higher the floor the better and he accomodated us. We had booked on Priceline which can sometimes get you a cold shoulder but that wasn't the case here at all. The lobby was nice, self park was very conveniently located and at 17.00 was reasonable for the area. The rooms were clean and beds were comfortable, but there was just an outdated feel for the space. Bathrooms were small. Location is good for what I needed it to be. If you're going to LA you need to decide where your best location will be because 9 times out of 10 you're going to be driving somewhere during your stay so central location will be your own decision. This neighborhood is nice. All in all a pleasurable stay, it just seemd a little bit lacking for the money. I guess the good thing is you can count on a soild stay with no bad surprises.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The moment we checked in I had a very good feeling about the hotel. All the hotel stuff were very friendly and were trying to help you with minute details. You will immediately feel that they are really trying to provide the best service that they can. I told the hotel manager that we would checked out the following morning at around 8 AM (as we bought tickets for LA city tour) and that we would like to keep our luggage in the hotel until evening 8 PM. Angad not only readily agreed to it but also told us that he would make a room available for us so that we can get fresh and change. This was a pleasant surprise to us that any hotel would allow us to use their hotel room (after checking out) to get fresh. We came back at 8PM and he offered a room without any additional charge just to get fresh. The hotel rooms are quite big and super clean. They have a 42" LCD TV, free wireless connection. I would definitely come back to this hotel in the future</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We won this holiday on the radio, when we arrived at LAX we were met by a shuttle service approx transfer time was 1 hour due to traffic and other drop off's. Check in was very straight forward they asked us if we would like to leave a credit card imprint or not, there was no pressure to do so. The room was a decent size with 2 queen sized beds and a large bright bathroom with shower and bath. The room also had a CD player and a large television and coffee maker. The ice machine was just down the hallway. The location of the hotel was a little out of the way and without a car it would have been a struggle getting about. I can highly recommend the car hire company under the hotels parking lot. Breakfast was excellent and plentiful. Overall for location and facilities this hotel was a little overpriced but what the heck it cost us nothing ! I would stay here again as it made an ideal base for a fantastic holiday and will be in our memories forever.</p></li>

One of the many great things about this hotel, which we believe is one of the main advantages, is the staff. From the gentleman on the front desk to the gentleman on the door, from Deming in the Bar/Breakfast room who was spot on with his smile and input, to Jesus C in the Bar/Breakfast Room who always helpful; many thanks to Daryl (your management should send you to each and every restaurant you recommend, so that you can recommend first hand), Jose, Chantelle, Luis and Kenny.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is not at all a sophiscated hotel (as claimed) - Its a 3 star Hotel. This is an OK place to stay, adequate for 2/3 nights with clean comfortable rooms -somewhere above the level of a ++motel. The Breakfasts are pricey, not well cooked or presented and certainly not worth the money - Denny's Diners are not worrying about this place. The hotel does have a few professionally well trained staff but the majority are far less experienced - They are, however, always very helpful - but most of them have Spanish as their first language. Is it me or doesn't LA actually have a Centre - the nearest we got to seeing one in the evening was the Farmers Market (there aren't any Farmers and it isn't a Market). It does have a lot of shops that stay open late and unbelievably for America lots of restaurants quite full even after 8.00 pm (decandance or what!)- reassuringly, they still didn't understand why we ordered a 2nd drink.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed there 3 days out of a weeks stay in the area, Nice hotel, small rooms but the noise from people working in the hall ways was horrible, not 8 to 5 during the day but 2-3 in the AM. They have all Mexican workers doing the work who not only work all hours of the day and night but they also sleep in the hall ways and the linen closets. I called several times to speak to the hotel manager and was told but the front desK that he was looking into it but never seen anyone take any action. People where so pissed over the noise they where checking out 4 am. As I did at 5 am on the third day of our stay because of the fighting in the hallways in the middle of the night.The mother company of Crown Plaza gave us $500 for our trouble and picked up our other hotels tab. The hotel itself is run %100 by Mexicans and they harbor people not only in the stairways but the parking garage for cheap labor on the hotels refurbishing. STAY AWAY AT ALL COST !!!!!!!!!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My boyfriend and I stayed here for three nights. This hotel was ok. The outside and lobby area were well kept and quite modern but the rooms felt very dated in comparison with the other hotels we stayed in during our trip. The room was clean and spacious with two double beds and a massive widescreen TV but the bathroom was tiny and very 70s looking. The hotel is also very far from the main places that we wanted to visit. For example, it took us 50 mins by bus to get to the Walk of Fame and 40 mins on the bus to get to Santa Monica. Also there are very few places to go around the hotel although check out Brooklyn Pizza on Pico Bld - very good pizzas and friendly staff. Also Factor's Deli is good for breakfast as the hotel breakfast is extremely overpriced. The man in the gas station across the street was very friendly too - go here for snacks as the hotel's shop is overpriced. All in all - a very average hotel - certainly not what I expected of Beverly Hills.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After a long flight the Crowne Plaza was a welcome relief, beautiful lobby, helpful staff, a huge room with nice city views and the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. We got a Priority Club upgrade, which included a nice breakfast and a sleep pack. Please ignore people who say you can't walk anywhere. We walked for about 25 minutes without problems to Rodeo Drive, even though it was after 6pm and dark, had a fab browse around Saks, Barneys and some of the boutique shops that were still open and then stuffed ourselves silly at a Mexican restaurant about five minutes' walk from the hotel. The next morning we hopped in a limousine arranged by the hotel for a three hour tour of Hollywood Hills, the Chinese Theatre, a few famous peoples' houses and so on. The same limo then took us to the airport for our flight back to London. Doing this saved us quite a lot of money and was much more convenient. Is it the lap of luxury? No. Was it a comfortable stay, most definitely.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived at this hotel in the small hours of the morning and were given a room on the 4th floor. When we tried to get into the room the lock was on the door so my husband went down to reception to find out what was going on. We were told that sometimes the locks do catch, but that we would be given an upgrade to an executive room on the 12th floor. Room was large and had a king size bed. Bathroom not very big but adequate with plenty of towels, hairdrier and cosmetics. On the bed was a gauze bag with earplugs, sleep mask and lavender linen spray. We had breakfast in the dining room and both the buffet and the ala carte menu were good, large servings and well cooked and presented. The staff were very attentive and friendly. Also ate dinner there one night and thoroughly enjoyed it. Reception staff were very helpful when I needed to find a book shop, even providing me with a map so I knew exactly where I was and how far the book shop would be. I would recommend this hotel.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We recently stayed at the crowne plaza Beverley hills for 5 nights and were very happy with our stay there. Don't always believe the bad reviews it was not like the reviews I read before we booked. The staff were so helpful and friendly and should be commended on that! It is no trouble for them to even tell you the buses to catch... Close to rodeo dr a very short walk in fact. Buses run from around the corner to all the major sites to see. The rooms were great too. Bed huge and comfortable. Yes the bathrooms may be a bit outdated but seriously who spends that much time in there? Even the cleaning staff greeted you daily! The gym is also great with fantastic equipment. My only advice would be to double check you get nonsmoking at the desk before you go to your room because even though we'd booked this ours was not and we ended up with smoking and I thought too late to change once unpacked?? I'm an avid nonsmoker so we had to air the room out daily! But overall a great place to stay!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Crown Plaza Beverly Hills for 4 nights and the only thing I can say is that it was just ok. When booking the room, I asked for an early check-in, if possible (at 12:30 PM, instead of the regular 3:00 PM). Arriving there, my room wasnâ€™t ready and they didnâ€™t make too much effort to find me another one, so ok, I went out to have lunch and, returning after 3:00 PM the room was available and fine. Next day, I went down to have breakfast and they told me that I had booked a room with continental breakfast. So, if I wanted to have the hot dishes (full breakfast) I would have to pay extra USD 5. Ok again, USD 5 is not much, but I think it was ridiculous that they booked a room with continental breakfast, if they had full breakfast available. Ok, I could have paid the extra 5 bucks, but why didnâ€™t they include it in the room rate? I found it very constraining that waiter had to check what I had for breakfast in order to issue the bill. For this kind of details, I guess it was just ok.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We arrived from Australia, and after a long flight and a reasonable trip from the airport all we were looking for was a comfy bed, in a nice area for the 3 days of our stay. The beds were exactly that, had a great sleep. Found our floor to be quiet, and the hotel was overall, clean. It was a seemingly safe area and was within walking distance to shopping etc. However, after placing some items at the office in which we were told would be safe until we collected them (due to the items being too large for safety deposit boxes), on the evening before we were to leave it took staff a few hours to locate our items (which were found in the lost property room) and we discovered that a $200 passport hard drive, had been stolen. The staff member that returned the bag was adamant that it was given back as it had been handed in at the beginning of our stay. Was not happy with how the situation was handled. Lesson learnt.. Unfortunately this ruined the "nice" stay we were having and consequently wouldnt go back.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the hotel for two nights in May 2005. The service was really very good all around. The bellhops and concierge were exceptionally helpful in arranging sight-seeing tours for us. The location is very convenient as others have said. But we were disappointed in our room. For the the Crown Plaza brand and price we were paying (which was not as inexpensive as some of the rates IÂ´ve seen on this review board) we expected more. The carpet was worn out looking, the furniture and decor were "holiday inn" basic, the bathroom looked like it really needed an overhaul, the shower curtain was dingy and poorly hung, the towels didnÂ´t look very clean and were rough and worn out, and our air conditioning unit had seen better days. I think the hotel rooms should be renovated to maintain integrity with its brand. And it wouldnÂ´t hurt to increase the temperature on the laundry setting and use some fabric softener. I may stay there again, but not if I can get a room around the corner at the Avalon.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Only arrived yesterday here at this hotel - all pre-booked before leaving Australia through a travel agent. After being in Anaheim for the past couple of days since arriving from Aussie, and having a hotel there that saw us having to carry all bags up 2 flights of stairs (no assistance offered, we were expecting that perhaps this would be our lot for the weeks to come. Not so at this hotel. From the time we arrived, the staff have been fantastic and just the friendliest that you could hope for when you are so far away from all that you know. From Lorraine at the front desk, to Louis in the lovely bar/restaurant and the friendly cheery doormen,and the concierge staff, it has so far been a pleasant experience. Nothing seems to be too much trouble for them. They even confirmed our tours for us. The rooms are clean and well appointed. Bed is comfortable, although the air con clicking on and off all night takes a bit of getting used to. These guys have got it right when it comes to "Happy staff makes for happy guests".</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Good things in this hotel: good location, helpful staff and comfy bed. Free wifi. Not-so-good things: the noise from the hallway is loud!! wakes me up whenever anyone speaks outside. Avoid adjoining rooms as there is also a noise problem here. Had one to begin with and asked to change after I could hear ever word of the next door neighbour's conversation, and they weren't even speaking loudly. Food is not so good and overpriced (go elsewhere). Had forgotten my phone charger and when I phoned the concierge for one they didn't have any. Now, this happened to me before and at any other halfway decent hotel I have stayed in (particularly ones that cater to business) they always have extras. To me, this is not great. Overall verdict: if you are on a budget, and are not going to spend much time in your hotel room, this place is okay. It is quite basic. However, if you are looking for something a little more special, I would pass. Am only staying here because someone else is paying - if I had my own choice I would stay somewhere else.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This property excels in it's customer service, we arrived at the hotel at 8 am after our flight from Australia, we were allowed to check in immediately, no need to store our bags until 3pm check in time. The service from Dennis at front desk was fantastic, he offered us 2 drink vouchers for the bar straight away and said if there was anything else we need feel free to ask, our bags were also taken to our room promptly. The rooms themselves are a little old but very comfortable with a very nice bed and nice big plasma tv. The bathrooms were alittle small but more than adequate. We dined at the restaurant, what a fantastic meal and all at a reasonable price, but even better the service was exceptional, We needed advice as to the sights of Los Angeles, then we met Tatiana the concierge, i have never dealt with a more friendly, helpful and informative concierge ever, she is a true superstar and made our trip worthwhile, she is a assett to the hotel. Overall brilliant service with a smile and will definately be returning in the future.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">After staying in a budget hotel in San Francisco and then a busy non special hotel in Las Vegas i thought the Crowne Plaza was probably the nicest hotel i stayed at. Firstly i would recommend becoming a Priorty Member. I was pleased with our room, we walked in and it was v clean, view was nice and the beds were amazing so comfy and i love lots of pillows and cushions. I got my best night's sleep. Bathroom was v clean, bit small but the only thing i disliked and was surprised at was the shower was not powerful enough. If my stay was longer i would have asked maintenance to check it out. Nice extras such as a CD/pack with lavender mist. Breakfast was fine selection and it was free which you cannot complain. Not many tables to sit at, you have to be early and i found alot of business people conducting their meetings a bit off putting could they not find somewhere else to talk shop? Overall its not bad, the front desk were helpful, efficient, polite and the concierge who helped book our tour. As we have no car this was a little frustrating getting around the confusing public transport!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We had a short stay at the Crowne Plaza and found it to be a pleasant hotel and good value for money. It had comfortable beds, plenty of towels and all the usual amenities. The CD player was a bonus. The in-room coffee was awful. The only thing we missed was a refrigerator in the room. The location is excellent. You can walk to a variety of restaurants, shops, and a supermarket, though all the distances are rather long. A bus to downtown via the restaurant area stops outside and various other bus lines are not too far away. There is even a bus from Beverly Hills to the airport, but we did not use it. Presumably if you were on a tight budget you could (buses $1.25). The staff were friendly and efficient, with one exception: we tried to book a tour, but instead of telling us that it was not available, the concierge first tried to get us to do it by limo, and then rather aggressively started to sign us up for a different tour. Also, another concierge was very reluctant to get us a taxi and wanted us to take the hotel's car ($40). We insisted on a taxi, and it turned out to be cheaper ($28).</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 7 nights. 2 adults and 2 children aged 13, 10 and 2 in a King Suite. , This features a kitchenette, lounge room, large walk in robe, seperate vanity area and seperate king bed room. The suite has two TVs, microwave, and free internet.The two older children slept comfortably on the fold out sofa in the lounge room. The room is not overly flash in its decor but its very comfortable,clean and spacious. Its a good walk to Rodeo Drive, about half hour, but you would need transport everywhere else which the taxis right at the front of the motel are great to use. Be wary of tours. Best to use the limousine tour you can get through the concierge to take you on stars homes tours etc. The ones on the strip seem a little dubious. The reason we ended up absolutely loving this motel even though it was not within walking distance of the main attractions is due to the absolutely amazing restaurant staff at the breakfast buffet. They are the most attentive and genuinely friendly and caring people. They absolutely made our day start in a great way. Breakfast was delicious and an excellent price too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I can say I truly enjoyed the hotel. Upon checkin there is a beautiful lobby, and vallet service is efficient and friendly (only a few more dollars per night!) I would recommend doing the whole vallet thing because the parking garage is a bit of a pain. We probably used the vallet service 3 or more times per day of course coming in and out to see all the different area attractions. The rooms are just average (used to be a Holiday Inn) although the beds are luxury! First good night sleep I'd had in awhile! No fan in the bathroom, no mini-fridge or wetbar, no balcony, although there are beautiful views of the Beverly Hills downtown area. I wouldn't recommend walking to Rodeo drive. You'll need a car in L.A. There's NO complimentary breakfast (you have to be a priority member.) The business center came to a convenience although there is a a charge to use it. The pool was too cold in October I don't think it's heated but we got drinks from the bar and enjoyed the whirlpool jacuzzi! This is a good place to stay for the cost I think we paid $100 per night. I would recommend it more for business than pleasure.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We didn't mind sitting in the lobby playing cards till our room was ready, because we had arrived an hour before check-in. We were very pleased with the quality of the bed and linens, the cleanliness of the room, and the space. Loved seeing the sunrise reflected on the glass buildings across the street, as well as the lovely sunsets from the 9th floor. We applied for a Priority Club membership as soon as we had made our reservations so as to take advantage of the free breakfast and reduced price in parking. Well worth it. The breakfast was ample and in a lovely setting. The staff was of mixed quality. The bellman was very knowledgeable and helpful. The concierge was fine. For the location we felt we found a great value. The price was advertised on a travelzoo newsletter, which was what directed us to investigate. The "deal" was only for the weekend. We called the hotel directly to see what they would charge for the next night, a Monday. They matched the weekend price so we booked directly with the hotel. We would stay there again and are considering their Tournament of Roses package for next New Year's.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel room clean with great views of the city and could just make out the Hollywood sign. Rodeo Drive only 15-20 mins walk away or catch the local bus from outside the hotel. Using the bus to get to Rodeo Drive we caught other buses to Manns Chinese Theatre; Universal Studios and Santa Monica. Each bus ride is only $1.50 whether you are on the bus 2 or 3 stops or 30 stops and are regular and easy to use making getting around the city very economical. Although we didnot eat at the hotel and used it as a base to do what we wanted we couldnot fault the hotel whilst we were staying there. There were plenty of restaurants within 10 mins along the walk to Rodeo Drive. - most of which were reasonable in price and varied choice. We had read other peoples negative reviews on trip advisor but were pleasantly surprised how good it was. The staff were friendly and helpful and the hotel room had everything we needed except a room safe - which would have been nice but not essential. We would certainly stay in the hotel again if we were visiting the Hollywood area, although LA is so big everything is a long way from everywhere else. We would recommend this hotel to other travellers as our stay was without fault.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">What a disappointing hotel. It is living off its brand name and perceived location but fails in most aspects. First the rooms. We had interconnecting rooms which should have been a King and twin Queens, but were a pair of twins. One coffee maker didn't work, I had to make running repairs to two aspects of one bathroom including getting my hand into the toilet cistern. The rooms are dated in terms of decor, fixtures and fittings and require a full renovation to compete with the other hotels in the LA area at a similar price. Offering free WiFi does not make it any better. The hotel reception staff are surly. The concierges/valet parkers/bellboys are all on the make, trying to suggest expensive options when all you want is a taxi to the airport. Service is poor. Only one room was made up and when we asked for the other room to be made up 'within the hour' two hours later it still had not been. The location is not great for Beverly Hills. It is a long walk from Rodeo Drive and only Jews seeking accommodation in the heart of a Jewish area will be satisfied with the location. Overall, an unhappy experience made worse by our far more positive experiences at other hotels of a similar price in LA and San Francisco.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a nice hotel, just south of Beverly Hills proper. Built in 1974, it shows its age, with small bathrooms and limited space in and around the bedrooms. With a nice sitting area, bar / lounge and a prefunctory restaurant, it's a perfect location for a good nights sleep and over 40 restaurants within an easy walk. The staff is attentive and alert. Demi in the bar area always keeps people laughing, and Carmen at the front desk is a dreamboat with a winsome smile. Norberto, the bellman is prompt and knows the locations in Los Angeles, to find the best foods and nightlife. The Concierge is rarely stumped by the most obscure questions, and seems overqualified for this property. He can make it happen ! Management is always there to see to your requests, and the area is quiet at night, and the views are spectacular. Request an even numbered room, at least above 6 floors, and you'll enjoy a sunrise view of the Los Angeles skyline, all the way to Chavez Ravine. If you prefer a lower floor, opt for a west view( odd numbers ), of Century City and Beverly Hills to your north. Sleep Advantage Program has lavendar sprays and sleep CD's in every room. You'll get a good nights sleep, at a great price, close to everything.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at this hotel for three nights based on reviews from tripadvisor. After arriving on a 13 hour flight, we just wanted to check in and sleep. We were told our room would be ready in half an hour and they would let us know when it was ready. We waited patiently in the foyer.... two hours later I asked what was happening and was told "Oh, sorry, I forget to let you know - your room was ready over an hour ago". Exhausted and frustrated we finally made it to bed. The room was nice - spacious and clean. But, the walls were paper thin and we were kept awake at 1am with television and converstation in the next room. We could hear word for word what they were saying. I am a priority club member and was given the free breakfast which was very good. On the last day the concierge arranged for a town car to take us to the airport. Five minutes after booking, he called our room to confirm that it was indeed booked. When the town car never showed up, we asked the bellman about it, who asked somebody else who said "oh yeah.... he cancelled". Five minutes later we were told that it was never booked at all. We were left to find our own way to the aiport. The location is in the middle of nowhere. I would not stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our first stop after an extremely long 16 hour flight. We had a prepaid voucher for the room for 4 nights, which clearly stated that we were a honeymoon couple. I had lost my voice and wasnt feeling very well, so didnt get to chat to the reception as much as i normally would. We didnt get upgraded to a high floor, or the quiet floor, and when we arrived in the room we had 2 double beds, really?? We were so tired though, we didnt even think about complaining or trying to get moved. Room was quite spacious, and the big TV was great. Air conditioning as mentioned by a few people is SO loud, and quite annoying through the night. And we thought it was weird there was no fan in the bathroom too, was very humid in there! Room service was average, and we didnt try the restaurants in the hotel. We went to the Beverly Drive restaurants further up 2 of the nights, which were both lovely. Quite expensive, but our food was good so we werent fussed. I really think you need a car when going to Beverly Hills however, as nothing is super close, even the restaurants. Would not stay here again, though there was nothing wrong with the hotel/rooms, it just didnt meet my expectations of the opulent Beverly Hills nor the price point that we had paid for the average room.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We have just returned from a pleasant five days at the Crowne Plaza. Check in was fine and the receptionist explained the local area, bus routes etc. The 7th floor room was comfortable with a view over the pool, the decor was in an older style and probably in need of a bit of upgrading, although the very large HD television was wonderful. Weather was incredibly good and it was nice for the children to chill out in the pool after a busy day. In the exactly how far is Rodeo Drive debate, I made it a good 15 to 20 minutes to Rodeo Drive Proper , although it is a very pleasant walk it can get a bit hot. The bus service to Santa Monica works very well only $1 per person on the Big Blue bus and about a half an hour ride. There are also good bus connections to the Grove and Farmers Market with the 14 bus and the 217 to Hollywood. Be warned the service interval on the 14 occassionally gets a bit long. We arranged a private car transfer to Universal Studios through Tatiana on the concierge desk, which worked out very well. I agree that eating in the immediate vicinity of the hotel is a bit limited and you have to walk up towards Beverly, which with tired children in the evening does get a bit far. We ate in the hotel one night, which was fine although the menu is a bit limited. All in all a good base for a first visit to the Beverly Hills area and we had a comfortable stay.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 4.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I visit LA 2 or 3 times each year. The Crowne Plaza isn't our first choice hotel, mainly because it is more of a business hotel and we prefer a destination hotel which this one clearly isn't. However, when we do stay here we are always pleased with the property, cleanliness, service and value for money. For out of town visitors wondering just how close this hotel is to Beverly Hills, you will not be dissappointed. Beverly Drive runs parallel to Rodeo drive and if you walk about a half mile, you will be in the main shopping and restaurant area of Beverly Hills. The parking is plentiful (although the headroom is a little low for extra large SUVS with roof racks). The club floor breakfasts are great if you can get an upgrade and the staff are discrete and the free WIFI is handy. Some of the rooms have a not too exciting view but if you ask, the front desk will likely give you a high floor facing in the right direction if they can. The hotel is on the 'crew hotels' list for a bunch of major airlines so there are often flight crew wandering around in the lobby. The pool is fine but is in the front of the hotel adjacent to the registration parking area. This isn't really a problem but adds to the feeling that this is a business hotel where they have installed a pool so they can say they have one. Anyway, if you are looking for a good value hotel in Beverly Hills where you don't want to stand on ceremony or star spot, then the Crowne Plaza is for you.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Pros- Staff were nice enough and the concierge gave us good advice most of the time (but don't always go for their private car recommendations-Taxi's are more convenient and cheaper, especially if you want flexibility on the return trips home) Cons- The location sucks! As first time visitors to LA, we wanted to do the usual tourist things. But apart from the Sunset Strip and Santa Monica Pier, everything you would want to do is located near Hollywood Blvd. Since public transport is so poor in LA, getting around cost a fortune. - Cleaning; The room never seemed to receive a thorough clean, it was more like a 5 min job (which is often the hotel management's fault, not the time-pressed cleaner's). Therefore, we often returned to hairs in the shower and an unvacuumed floor. - The heater exploded at one stage, so we had to call the maintenance man in (sparks and all). It seemed like he was waiting for a tip (I don't think we should pay any extra because the hotel's facilities are in poor shape)! - On one day, (a first for us after years of frequent travel), the housekeeping actually forgot to clean our room, despite three reminder phone calls. However, we did receive a free breakfast for our troubles. - The restaurant automatically charges an 18 percent tip. We should have the discretion to tip according to the quality of the service (which wasn't terrific on the night we were there). Not a terrible hotel, but everywhere else we stayed in the US was far superior.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just before our family of 6 (4 Adults, 2 Children) departed for US I read reviews on trip advisor regarding the Crown Plaza B/Hills, I was disappointed and very worried about our choice of hotel. We decided there was no time to change at this late stage and we would just have to see for ourselves. From the minute we arrived to the minute we left, I couldnâ€™t fault the hotel in anyway. Within in 4 min walk of the front door there is the "Famous Deli" which serves any type of food you can imagine and is very reasonably priced. There is also a little supermarket, launderette, pizza rest, Chinese rest and service station. Within 10min walk there is a large pharmacy and supermarket, family restaurant and lots more. 5min in a bus and there is the "Westside Mall" which has most major shops with a food hall and cinema. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Santos in particular was great. We organised transport through the hotel with "George", he was very flexible, helpful with good service. There are buses are going past the door every 15-20min and they were easy to use. We requested interconnecting rooms which were we given and this worked really well. The rooms are not huge but were clean. The beds were double but were super comfortable with good pillows. It was difficult to get onto computers sometimes. The General Manager was friendly and helpful and provided some good tourist tips. We would definitely stay at this hotel again and we thought it was good value for money.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 5 nights with our 2 year old son on a trip to LA. I can usually find something okay to say about a hotel, but this hotel was pretty bad. Firstly the hotel needs some major updating. The towels are old and stained, the shower curtain had what can only be described as a 'former guest's snot' on it, and the room had a grubby feel about it. On the second night our toilet overflowed. They sent someone to clean up the mess with a towel, and we had argue that they disinfect the floor. I found the staff to be quite rude in general. On one occassion we were almost bowled over by a staff member trying to get into the lift in front of us, leaving us to wait for the next one. To top it all off, on the last night there was an extremely loud Jewish band playing somewhere in the hotel. I'm not one to complain about a bit of noise, but this was beyond ridiculous. When we complained to the front desk they didn't really seem to care at all and did nothing about the noise. For some reason this hotel was full of Aussies like us. Not sure why but was nice all the same. One of the only good things about this hotel was the pool size and area. The location was reasonable but not that close to Rodeo Drive if you want to walk there. There is a Ralphs grocery store just a block away for some drinks and snacks. Parking is $22 a day on top of what is an already overpriced hotel for what you get. I stayed at Mr C just up the road which was modern, clean, and had fabulous service. I would recommend staying there instead of this cesspit!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Avoid This Hotel...”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 1.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">There is nothing "elegant" about this hotel, as described on most booking sites. Arrived late in the afternoon, very tired from our flight, only to be told our room was not ready. During the "wait" for our room, I lost my prescription sunglasses. Finally received a room key, only to find the room very small, not fresh, and the bathroom extremely SMALL. About an hour later we realized we had an adjoining room with a paper-thin door between the rooms and we could literally hear everything being said in the next room. We complained and asked for a non-adjoining room on a quieter floor and were moved. This seemed better until I listened to the gentleman next door take a pee and flush! Hotel is in dire need of a make-over and the price is way too high for what you get. Staff put on a good smile, but then just avoid your issues. Such as my sunglasses... I was told they were "attempting" to contact housekeeping but no one was answering. What elegant hotel doesn't have constant contact with their staff??? Free internet did not work most of the time. We gave up and used our air-card. Parking was $22 per day and there is no indoor entry from the garage to the hotel. And, of course, it was raining most of the days of our stay... Food was very expensive and service poor. My husband was served a very pricey dry piece of chicken and tasteless mashed potatoes that had to be returned to the chef. By the time the next plate arrived, I was just about finish with dinner. And to make things worse, this was our ANNIVERSARY! We even told the waiter it was our special day and no perks were offered. They never found my designer, prescription sunglasses... It's sad when you are glad to leave and go home! DG Dallas, Texas</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for 3 nights on business and it was easily the worst experience at a hotel I have ever had. You would think with the Crowne Plaza name and Beverly Hills location, it would be great, but don't let the name fool you. The first night I stayed on the 4th floor and it was a disaster - close to the elevators (mistake #1), the A/C unit worked, but the smell coming out of the vents was absolutely hideous and I had to sleep in a 75 degree room with the A/C off. While doing some work, I noticed a random, previously unknown to me insect crawling up the wall. It was pretty large and left a nice mark on the wall, after crushing it...good times. The room itself is slightly larger than a broom closet, with the bathroom apparently being an afterthought...a very large person could literally not walk through this doorway, without turning sideways - not an issue for me, but keep it in mind if it applies to you. To top it all off, the "free Internet access" was painfully slow. They provide you with the cheapest cat5 / ethernet cable I have ever seen, so my biggest tip to the business traveler is: bring your own network cable! They do offer wireless, but I got a whopping 1 bar (i.e. very low) signal strength on my laptop, so it was useless. I changed rooms after the first night and moved up to floor 5, which was much better, but the overall experience could not be undone...not to mention the fact that the room rate was $249 / night, which is absurd for the subpar quality of this hotel. My last visit to the Century City area had me staying at the InterContinental on Ave of the Stars. This is a phenomenal hotel, that I could not more highly recommend. Look for my review of this on TripAdvisor as well and do yourself a huge favor by staying here instead!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Have stayed here for years”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 5.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was a travel writer for 20 years so I am somewhat demanding about getting value for my money. My husband and I used to stayed at the Hyatt in Century City for some years, till it was sold to the Intercontinental chain. We then started staying at the Crown Plaza as all my family lives nearby. The location at the south end of Beverly Drive, just before Pico Blvd., may be out of walking distance to the main shopping and dining for some, but everything is just up the street. If you're driving into Los Angeles, ingore the conventional directions, and take the I-10 (Santa Monica Freeway) and exit at Overland, then east on Pico to the Hotel. From the I-5 (San Diego Freeway) exit at Santa Monica Blvd, then south to reach Pico. (I was born and raised in West LA) This is not the hotel for those who are looking for the luxury of a Ritz Carlton or similar. Having said this, If you spend any time in your room when traveling, you won't go wrong with a suite here, for the price of a single room elsewhere. The dining room is adequate, as is the bar and lobby. For seeing celebrities hang out at the bar of the Four Seasons. The staff is fantastic, from those who take your car, to the front desk staff and housekeeping. Two years ago Easter Sunday, my father and my father-in-law died within 2 hours of each other, mine in LA the other in Las Vegas. The hotel went out of there way to accomodate all our needs as we traveled back and forth between Los Angeles and Las Vegas for a month. TIP get a Priority Club membership. Even if you are not staying on the club floor, you'll be given a key to access the Club room and great free breakfast and free computer / internet access. If you find you like the hotel, make reservations online, then with your confirmation number call the hotel directly and ask for your favorite room. They have always accomodated us.</p></li>
