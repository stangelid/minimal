Check in time is a little inconvenient if you arrive early (4pm) , but you can leave your baggage there and go out visit Seattle Downtown. Breakfast is not included but there is a starbucks that you can enter just from inside the hotel. Great business center, open 24hrs, to use free internet or print.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I booked this hotel for a special occassion. I did it on a hotel booking website as a gift to someone. When they arrived they were treated so rudely I couldn't believe it. As a frequent business traveler I have never had such a poor experience. The rudeness went right up the line to the general manager. My travel service had to step in and save the day. They blamed me for everything. I was so dissappointed.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel was literally steps away from Key Arena. The staff were gracious and accommodating from the moment we arrived. Extremely clean rooms, great views from the roof top garden, comfy beds, and best of all, great area in Queen Anne neighborhood. It was so nice to just walk from our concert at Key Arena and into our cozy room. Great restaurants aplenty also within walking distance. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for a sunny weekend in Seattle and found the hotel to be everything we needed. It is on a street with a ton of great restaurants and bars, there is a Starbucks in the lobby for convenient breakfast, and it's easy to get to most of Seattle from here. We parked on the street which was a hassle but cheaper than paying $15 per day at the hotel. Our king room was spacious and clean and the staff were very nice.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a good location, and is clean, and modern. Plenty of restaurant options within walking distance, and cabs are readily available to take you anywhere you want to go. Walking distance to the Space Needle and Mono Rail. The front desk clerks were all very friendly, outgoing, and helpful. We went to the capital hill area quite a bit and it was about an $8 - $10 cab ride each way. I also love having a refrigerator in my room when I travel.</p></li>

The location was great for getting to the Space Needle, and even walking into downtown Seattle took about half an hour. I would definately recommend this hotel.</p></li>

Very nice staff and they let us check-in on arrival at 2:00 PM. Roof top terrace is not fancy, but superb view of Sound, Space Needle and downtown skyline. Only three blocks over to waterfront and then couple blocks down to SAM's Olympic Sculpture Garden and then a few more blocks down to the Aquarium and Pike Place. Space Needle also only a short walk away.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">First time staying in this hotel, we were very pleasantly surprised! This is how hotels should be! Good value for money. It was such a good price we were afraid to book it - but we were very happy and will be back again! Keep up the good work Mediterranean Inn. I would recommend this place but I don't want to give away the secret! Also, it's a bit out of downtown, thought it would be closer to walk. It wasn't a bad walk but taking the Monorail right at Key Arena was easy and fast.</p></li>

It's located in Queen Anne, with easy access to Safeway, the space needle, diverse local dining, and bus stops. Even 24-hour fitness is just a block away! The room was clean and relatively quiet. Service was great for the most part. However, some hotel attendants seemed aloof. Also, there is no wi-fi in room, although you can pay $5 a day for internet connection (DSL).

It is right on the bus line and within easy walking distance to the Seattle Center (Space Needle, monorail station). We also walked to Pike Place Market and Pioneer Square, but it was about a 40 minutes walk. The room was clean and roomy. The lobby was vary nice and the staff was friendly and helpful. A Starbucks is attached directly to the lobby. They even had Starbucks coffee in the room. I enthusiastically recommend the Mediterranean.</p></li>

It's in a good spot 20 minute walk from hotel down to Qwest Field to watch the Seattle Seahawks play. 5 Minute walk to the Space Needle. Safeway just next door to get your bits and pieces. Rooms are fine and bright. What else are you looking for in a hotel? It had a comfy bed nice shower/bath, fridge, microwave. It was clean and you got loads of towels. Plus free internet access in the lobby. Staff very friendly. I will be back at this hotel on my next trip.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Even though I live in Seattle, I frequently stay in the Mediterranean Inn when I have an ELKS function since it is only 2 blocks away. The staff have been great to us Elks, even offering us discounts for groups. I highly reccomend this hotel to everyone especially if you are traveling to/from the cruise ships. I know that parking is always an issue in Seattle, but now there is a sign posted in front of the hotel. There is a parking lot (pay) behind the hotel and you might be better off to pay for an hour instead of getting a ticket.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our room didn't have air-conditioning, just a ceiling fan, and a portable rotary fan. Facing the small courtyard, there is not really a breeze helping with the stuffiness. The room and bathroom were clean. The kitchenette is great for people who don't mind going around the corner to buy groceries at the supermarket, especially since the room comes without breakfast. The rooftop view is fantastic. Nothing beats a coffee from Starbucks (shares the building with the hotel), and then relaxing in a lounge chair on the rooftop to watch the sunset.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotels are expensive in Seattle, so the price and relative location of this hotel make it attractive. The rooms are pretty spartan. The 1st floor Starbucks is a plus, even in Seattle where great coffee is everywhere. There is a great grocery and several fun eateries nearby. And don't forget to go up to the roof for some nice views come sunset. We had a room right on Queen Anne Ave, so it sometimes was noisy at night. And it is a little bit of a walk to the bus stop. The bottom line is that I plan to stay there again next time I visit that section of Seattle.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed here for two nights. The room was nice and bigger than I expected. There is a Starbucks connected to the lobby which made it easy to grab a hot chocolate in the morning. There was a good sushi restaurant right across the street and a few other restaurants very close. We were able to walk to the Space Needle in 10 minutes or less and also walked to Pike Place and the Seattle Aquarium one day (long walk but definately feasible if you're up for it). We would stay here again and think the price is right- the only thing I missed was a hot tub!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">It looks like a chain, feels like a chain... but it isn't! The Mediterranean Inn was a perfectly fine place to stay in Seattle. Great location, being a very short walk to Seattle Center, and a mile or so to Belltown and downtown. We got a pretty decent deal on Hotels.com, a little over $100 a night. Didn't really care about the Starbucks in the lobby, although it made the lobby smell nice. Down the street from Peso's, which serves an amazing breakfast. The staff we dealt with were very friendly, and the roof deck was awesome -- made up for the lackluster third-floor view.</p></li>

The room was small, but nice with a decent view of the Sound and the Space Needle. It's located in walking friendly lower Queen Anne with many good restaurants nearby and I cinema on the next block. Add the Starbucks on the ground floor and you can't ask for more for the money! Highly recommend if you don't need to be right downtown.</p></li>

It is only 4 blocks from the Seattle City Center with the EMP, Space Needle, Monorail, et al. From the rooftop deck, you can view the Puget Sound on one side, and a panorama of the Seattle skyline on the other. The staff members are very friendly and knowledgeable about the city. The Inn is surrounded by a great variety of eating places, and there is a Safeway tucked-away on the same block. Additionally, the price was far better than nearly all of the other choices in this relatively expensive city.</p></li>

We liked the hotel and were pleased with our choice. The location is quite good, it is reasonably close (max. 10 Minutes walk) to the Monorail station, which needs another 2 minutes to go to the city centre. A bus stop is on the same block. The rooms were very clean, modern, well-equipped and quite big. Computer terminals and a business centre are available. There was no breakfast, but a Starbucks in the same building and about 5 Restaurants within 100 meters. We can especially recommend Sam's Sushi.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">For $99 bucks a night you can't expect a whole lot, but this hotel is pretty nice for the money. It is right by a bus stop that will take you into downtown/pike place market...but the downside is that it is right outside of the bus FREE RIDE ZONE so you will have to pay to ride. It is a short walk to the Space Needle, and there are a handful of good restaurants just north of the hotel.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is my 2nd time to visit Seattle, by staying at the Meditterranean Inn, I got to enjoy Seattle to the fullest. Great value for the price, wonderful view from the roof deck, a great place to enjoy your coffee, which you can buy at starbucks near the hotel lobby. I was able to enjoy the wonderful places to eat in the vicinity of the inn. Walking distance to the space needle and it's surrounding areas. From the space needle, downtown is easily accessible by monorail. An alternative transportation would be by bike, compliments of the inn, I think I got a package deal for my stay. Staff was courteous and helpful.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I really liked this hotel. Room was very comfortable with a cool window seat with a bit of a view and convenient parking under the hotel with elevators for $15. It is located in great neighborhood, near Seattle Center and the Space Needle within an interesting walk to downtown and Pikes Market but with buses nearby. The great thing about the area is it has lots of local people and their restaurants, coffee shops and bars so you are not just stuck with tourists and traveling businessmen. Try The Crow, great neighborhood Bistro nice bar their signature dish is the chicken but the fish was great too (823 5th Ave N).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I selected this hotel because of the reviews here - and once again I was not disppointed. Thanks. Everything was just as advertised. Other than some room to room noise, it was a perfect stay. The hotel is located in the Queen Anne district which is very nice. The front desk staff was very polite (and I am from the South!) and very helpful when asking for directions, but routes, etc. The views from the rooptop deck were awesome! If you stay here, make sure you go up there with your camera. Bed was comfortable, room was very clean (pretty new), and they even let me check out a few hours late. NO complaints - highly recommend.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is in a great location close to the Seattle Centre and some great restaurants. Staff were a little standoffish, and there is no parking if you are staying for more than one night. We were lucky and were staying Saturday to Monday and Sunday parking is free on the streets, so we only had to pay a few dollars to park for Saturday night. The room was clean enough, bathrooms are very large. Only issue was the internet, very poor, and you had to PAY for it. If I'm paying $10 per day for internet, I expect it to be good. Starbucks downstairs, very good idea. Nothing like a hot chocolate after a day walking in the rain.</p></li>

There's a little kitchen with coffeemaker, microwave and fridge. Also present a smoothing iron and ironing board. There were complimentary coffee pads, popcorn and bottles of water. There's no restaurant in the hotel but there's an in house Starbucks. We had breakfast in nice restaurant nearby: Toulouse Petit Kitchen and Lounge: great food and coffee. Just opposite the road is a big Safeway supermarket. Nearby Seattle Center with Space Needle, monorail etc. Don't forget to go to the rooftop: great views and you can smoke there.</p></li>

Close to Seattle Center and the Monorail to downtown. Actually, downtown is a nice walk for most people. The hotel had free access to the internet and two computer terminals with printers available. Nothing fancy here, but affordable and good (safe) location. Less than $7 taxi ride from cruise ship to hotel. We jumped on the monorail, walked around the downtown, and walked back to the hotel. Enjoyed a night at the Jazz Alley (walking distance) and a train ride the next morning to Vancouver ($9 taxi ride to the train terminal).</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A good hotel and location, particularly excellent for Seattle Center. Monorail not running at the moment but if it was, the location would be very good for Downtown too (we got a bus but it took more time). Room was fine if a little dark but the kitchen facility was a nice touch. Very good value for money - Seattle hotels tend to be quite expensive. Awesome view from the roof! Worth going up there at dusk with a cup of coffee (free in the rooms). Free internet access very useful. Generally clean and well maintained with some good restaurants/cafes around. Recommend Dicks hamburger bar across the road for ice cream with hot fudge topping! A good stay.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I saved ten dollars a night by booking through the hotel's site instead of Expedia. If you have a car -- or are willing to take the frequent buses that stop just a block away -- this is a nice place to stay while exploring Seattle (but not exploring it for the first time -- you will not be in the main, downtown area). The kitchenette with microwave is great for saving money (Safeway is a half block away and a fancy gourmet store is two blocks further). This lower Queen Anne neighborhood also has some nice coffee shops and restaurants. Best bet -- if you are attending a show at the Key Arena, this location can not be beat. You are just steps from the arena.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed just one night and the room was clean and comfortable. We walked just a few blocks and had a good selection of restaurants and the view from the roof deck at night is pretty stunning. However, I very much resented the $8 surcharge that covers internet access, in-room coffee, etc that are included in the price of other motels/hotels. It definitely felt like a rip-off since these are standard just about anywhere else you go. I was traveling with my elderly mother, so close walking access to restaurants and feeling safe were high priorities on this trip, but I'm not so sure I'd come back again due to the surcharge if traveling with my husband or friends.</p></li>

This hotel has been updated on the inside. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. It offers a gym and great internet service. This area has many nice restaurants in walking distance.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed two nights at the Mediterranean Inn but it is now my go-to accommodation in Seattle. The rooms and common areas were clean, functional and comfortable and the staff friendly, helpful and fun to talk to. The roof-top terrace has a great view and this hotel even rents bikes, complete with helmets! The mini-kitchen in the room is a great plus when on the road, the neighborhood is full of little restaurants and it is walking distance from Seattle Center, downtown, Pike Place Market and the waterfront. A huge advantage are the windows that open, meaning you don't rely on artificial ventilation. That clinched the deal for me on paper, but the experience means that I will definitely go back.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed for 3 nights at the end of September, had a great stay. Room was large and clean, may be a bit warm in the summer without A/C but wasn't an issue for our stay. The view from the top deck is great. The best thing about this hotel is the location - it is an under 5 minute walk to the Space Needle and from there the monorail/walk to downtown, or there is a bus stop opposite the hotel with regular buses that go across town. The neighbourhood felt safe and friendly and really close to lots of independent restaurants and bars. Make sure you walk up the hill (it is a bit of a step climb!) into Queen Anne proper for the best views and a beautiful neighbourhood. I would definitely stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great place to spend time with your loved one. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and if you rent a car they have a under ground garage. The hotel is located in the hub of Seattle's Queen Ann area with easy access to down town using the mono-rail system and the must visit Pike's Place market. Within easy walking distance of the Space Needle and some great eateries like Thai food located on Mercer and 1st Ave rated as one of the top fifty in the United States, and Peco's a short one block from the hotel. Order the Dungeness crab omelet and a 'El Diablo Mary at Peco's. Enjoy your stay, and by the way this is the first time I have taken the time to write a review. Frank and Debra Gallant</p></li>

Fortunately, after browsing for several hours, I found the Mediterranean and oh, how GLAD I am that I did. I can't say enough about the service every step of the way, from start to finish. Well kept property for the price, perfect location (close to the Needle, on three bus lines, 24 hour Safeway across the street, the list goes on and on), nice amenities and beautiful sunrise and sunset views from the rooftop deck.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We spent a day/night in Seattle. Ended up booking with this hotel because of price and location. About 10-15 minute walking distance to the Monorail. We also felt pretty safe walking back from the Monorail at around 8 or 9pm. It has a gated parking garage under the building, but you only get access after you check in. It is conveniently located across from a major grocery store (Safeway... I think). And we also found a Thai restaurant just down the street called Phuket that we absolutely loved!! The room itself was pretty standard, with no AC but a ceiling fan. During our stay in September, we left the window slightly open and was fine throughout the night. Overall we were pretty satisfied with our stay here.</p></li>

I was really impressed with this hotel. The staff was really courteous and helpful. When I arrived from a long flight, the receptionist didn't bat an eye when I asked if I could microwave some food I had brought with me on the plane because I was famished. Another staff member printed out the bus schedule when I needed to go downtown. The room itself was great. The bed was comfortable and the heating system was good. I loved the rooftop view. The only drawbacks were a high surcharge for Wifi ($5/day are you kidding?!) but the Business Center with multiple computers and printers were helpful.</p></li>

When my parents arrived the day before we got there both elevators were broken and they had to stay in the lobby until they were fixed. Hours later, they got to their room. The only good thing about this hotel was the location. It was located very close to the space needle. there was one positive out of all of the trip. Their customer service was terrible also.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I researched extensively for hotels in the Seattle area that were in a convenient and safe location and had the best value. I settled for this hotel and I wasn't disappointed. Hotel is more of a boutique style, with clean rooms, facilities, and a nice lobby. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful and guided me to places I wanted to go to. Hotel is located a walking distance from the Key Arena and Space Needle, from where you can catch the monorail to downtown cheaply. There is also a grocery store called SafeWay across the hotel, a fast food burger place, banks, many restaurants (Chinese, Indian, Thai, Mexican, etc), pharmacies, and other conveniences. If you want to see some great views of the Seattle skyline and bay, head up to the roof top. Amazing views! I'll be staying here again on my next visit to Seattle.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Mediterranean while attending a wedding over a long weekend earlier this month. While it's a bit of a drive from the airport, the location made it convenient to all the areas of Seattle we wanted to see- the Public Market, the docks, the Space Needle, etc. The neighborhood was safe and had a lot of different restaurants/coffee shops available. Our room was average size and the queen bed was fine. We didn't have air conditioning- but with the window open (ours faced an alley) or the fan on, the room was a good temp and we couldn't hear anything from the street.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I chose the Mediterranean Inn as a start to our Pacific Northwest trip. We needed a hotel in Seattle in a good location with a decent rate. Thatâ€™s what we got with the Mediterranean Inn. Its not the downtown location that most people look for but its convenient. The monorail to downtown is three blocks away. The Key Arena and the Space Needle are also three blocks located in the Seattle Center complex. It is a safe area to walk. One block over is a Safeway grocery store. What tops it is the Starbucks in the lobby. Check the web site for a better rate. Be aware there is a fee for parking. There is a lot next door that has overnight parking. I didnâ€™t know this until check out. Look into it before the hotel charges you. We were very satisfied with the choice. After the review of other Trip Advisor members, they were too.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">When I selected this hotel, I chose it based on reviews. The hotel was great for people wanting a great location at a great price. It is located about 500m from Seattle Center and the walk there can be beautiful. Also within longer walking distance to Pike Place Market and the foreshore. For people without a car, this is the place to stay. The rooms were adequate, the only problem we had was that the shower was made for people with a disability, which meant that the water leaked on the bathroom floor easily and made it very slippery at times. The fitness centre was good, and there is a cinema and supermarket next door. I also like the very simplistic, yet homely, feel to the place. The staff were great and there is a Starbucks right out the front for people who love their coffee. I definitely made a great choice to stay here.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was expecting more. The room was on the first floor, very small. They swear the bed is a queen but it looks full size to me - and the sheets smelled funny. We backed to the alley and there was a lot of noise. Everytime the person above me flushes I can hear it very clearly. I didn't find the staff particularly friendly. I asked for extra pillows (they give you two of the flattest pillows you've ever seen). They told me it would take 15 minutes. They came by almost an hour later - of course, by this time I was almost asleep and didn't want to get out of bed, get dressed, etc... They kept knocking - then called. You think they might get the clue if its 45 minutes past time you said you would be here that I might be trying to sleep. It is convenient to Queen Anne and there is free internet, but I don't think I'd stay here again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was not the best choice on our trip through the northwest. The hotel had some pros but unfortunately, too many cons. Pros: close to downtown, easy access to the space needle and Alaskan Way, roof top deck, comfortable beds Cons: my reservation had been cancelled but they had one room left - not sure who cancelled it. The room was tiny - 2 double beds - both against the wall with small walk way in between. No air conditioning, so opened windows - looked right into an apartment in next building and their unit system hummed LOUDLY and blew warm air into our room. They provided a fan but had to take it apart and clean the blades before using. The grey blades became navy blue! Tough to sleep as it was very warm in our room - 22 celcius the day we were there. charged extra for parking and for internet so our "great deal" wasn't so great.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was our 7th or 8th stay at the hotel, which we'd previously enjoyed. But now there's a fee, called a "surcharge" when you check out - it includes paying for 2 tea bags, popcorn, roof access, exercise room, business center, bicycle use, and other items, whether you've used them or not. One of the front desk clerks got quite heated with an elderly couple, forcefully telling them the "surcharge is mandatory!" - they called it the "exit charge." Our bill also had an energy surcharge added, and they "upgraded" to a higher cost room than they had confirmed for us when we made our reservation online. We asked them to call a cab for us one night, which they had done before, but they called a limo service to take us to a restaurant, for 3 times the cost of a cab. We would not reserve with them or their sister hotels again - we would never recommend them.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here on a recommendation from Alpine Ascents Int'l. They were very accommodating for my stay before and after my climb of Mt Rainier. The staff was so nice, I thought it was strange they were that nice and helpful (I live in the D.C. area- you don't get helpful service like that here). The rooftop deck had great views of the space needle and puget sound. I thought the location was great - good neighborhood restaurants and cafes, as well as a couple of grocery stores. The area was much more relaxed than staying in the downtown area. My room did have A/C or at least a vent fan with a cooling setting, but I didn't need it becuase just opening the windows and getting a nice breeze from the sound was enough. The room was very quiet also - I wasn't bothered by the TV in the next room or hearing doors slam at all hours. I really enjoyed my stay. Very comfortable.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Our flight arrived early and we took a bus from the airport to the hotel. Approx. 40 minutes. The Hotel had our resurvation and stored our bags until the room was ready at 3:00p.m. We walked uphill to the north several blocks turned left and came upon a beutiful lookout over the ciry and the bay. It was a warm and sunny autumn day and we spent over and hour enjoying the view and walking through into the upland housing area. It was the perfect way to start our 5 days in Seattle. The Hotel staff were extra helpful throughout our stay. The rooms were clean. I would definitely stay there again but not in the summer as there is no air conditioning. Great restaurants within the surrounding 2 block. For lunch the metropolitan grocery strore has some great soup and sand. The transit system in Seattle works really well. We found Seattle to be one of the friendliest places we have ever been.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Great location and great customer service. I only had brief interactions with the hotel employees because each time I needed something they took care of it quickly and painlessly! The room was as expected smallish and clean. We didn't have a view but we didn't expect one for the low price we paid. Parking was a little pricey but I suppose if I wanted to save some money I could have utilized the street parking but I don't like to search for a spot so I paid extra, seems fair. The heater worked well which was important with the freezing temps outside. We enjoyed the HBO since we don't have it at home. My only complaint is the WiFi was useless. It was too slow to work on our devices. It took nearly 25mins (usually takes about 3mins) to do our web check-in because it was so slow. They probably shouldn't advertise that WiFi is available when it works so poorly or not at all some of the time.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I decided at the last minute to go to emerald city comic con, this hotel had the best rates for two nights. The room was small but nice. The staff was friendly and the room was clean. My 2nd night there was some loud people outside in the courtyard and woke everyone up and the staff took care of it immediately. The room had a sink, fridge and cupboards and that was nice. Its in a great area, with a safeway across the street and a metropolitan market a block away. There is also a Dicks that has cheap burgers and Kidd Valley down the block. I saw a few more restaurants including The Melting Pot. Seattle Center is a block away and Starbucks is downstairs. You cant beat the price or the location of this hotel. If you need to go into downtown seattle the monorail is within walking distance. Also go to the rooftop for a wonderful view. The hotel is on queen anne which has some beautiful historic houses.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My son moved to the Lower Queen Anne section of Seattle last year. I've visited twice and stayed at the Mediterranean both times. An early arrival from the airport left us with time to kill before our check-in. The staff was very accomodatiing and let us store our bags until our room was ready. The rooms were comfortable and I would recommend a room facing the courtyard for light sleepers. It was great having a Starbucks right off the hotel lobby too. The hotel location is wonderful, within acouple blocks of the Seattle Center, the Space Needle and the monorail which makes for an easy trip into downtown. Belltown and many good eateries are within walking distance too. We had a definite favorite, Toulouse Petit, which had amazing breakfasts!. Don't miss the view from the hotel deck! One morning I had the pleasure of sipping my Starbucks while watching the sunrise present a fantastic view of Mt. Rainier.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed at this inn last week with my husband. It is in a nice area that has many small restaurants in tree-lined area, and is stone's throw away from downtown. Hotel is clean and has courteous staff. Fully stocked workout room with bottle water. Room has microwave and fridge (perfect for storing my Pike Place cheese purchase!). Parking was $15, with in-and-out privileges. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, but we had lattes and scrambled eggs at the Metropolitan Market, two blocks away, which is almost identical to Whole Foods supermarket. You can buy a hot breakfast there in the morning, or choose things from a large salad bar and hot meal section in the evening for dinner. Going downtown is very easy, no need to drive, as the Monorail is a ten minute walk from the Inn. The Monorail ride is less than a minute from there to downtown -- so easy! Will stay again at this hotel in March when we attend a concert and can't wait.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The hotel is located within an hour or less walking distance to all of the big tourist sites (Space Needle, Pike Place). The room was close to a busy street, so I wore earplugs. I could not hear the other neighbors, the hotel was clean, and the overall, this was a nice comfortable hotel to call home for 5 days. Many of the services at the hotel include additional fees (including a few bucks for electricity use, $15 for parking, and other fees that you should research before staying here). Our Expedia price was $65/night online, but with all the additional costs, it came to about $90-$100/night. Of course, with any hotel you want to see if you are paying extra, but be extra cautious with this hotel if you're on a strict budget and really look at all that you have to pay for before going. The area felt relatively safe. Other than the fees, we found this place to be welcoming, especially after a beautiful rainy walk back from downtown.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Just got back from Seattle and we stayed here for 4 nights. I rate this place highly because it is cheap, clean, all of the rooms have kitchenettes and it is in a great location. My wife and I stayed here with our baby and this place was great for us. The room was big enough for a travel crib. (Room 411) It was quiet. And best of all there are two grocery stores very close to the hotel to buy food from and avoid overpriced, crowded restaurants. (no fun with a baby) The Metropolitan Store has tons of great food that is ready to eat. Safeway is kind of a dump. The hotel is also less than a block away from the bus stop that will take you right to Pike Market and Pioneer Square. Let's face it, this isn't the Four Seasons. If you want that you have to pay for it. If you want to extend your stay by spending less on hotels, food, parking your car, and getting around....stay here. ps: the roof top view is almost as good as the Space Needle.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Some things about this hotel were great, other things were not... Location: If you are planning on only spending a few days in Seattle location is perfect, right next to the Space Needle, Experience Music Project etc. However, it is a bit of a walk away from Pike Place Markets and the city centre (~20mins). If you're spending more time in Seattle might be worth trying to stay a little more central. Rooms: The rooms themselves were simple, a little dated but other than that were fine. What I did not like was most appliances had something wrong with them. Several buttons on the remote control would not work (power and channel buttons), alarm clock was broken, light globe for the desk lamp had blown and the toilet would not flush. The toilet was rectified immediately but the others we had to chase up to get fixed. Amenities: 5/5 for this one. Had a fitness centre, business centre (free to access) and a laundromat all within the complex.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Stayed just a couple nights this past weekend and we got a great deal on a hotel with a great location and room. It is located in lower Queen Anne which has several little shops and restaurants/bars/cinema in the area, or you can take a short walk uphill to Upper Queen Anne where you'll find the markets and more cute shops and restaurants. Also what is great is that you can walk from the hotel to the Seattle Center which has the Space Needle, The Monorail to get into town ($1.50 each way), The Experience Music Project ans Science Center, The Key Area (where the Seattle Sonics play basketball), and an amusement park. You could also walk to downtown Seattle or Belltown in 15-20 minutes. The hotel room is roomy enough with a kitchenette. Quiet also, free internet service, a small workout room, and a VCR in the room (with BlockBuster across the street). Also, Starbucks is located right off the lobby for those coffee fixes. We'd stay here again!</p></li>

The hotel is also a block away from a great Safeway's Supermarket and a number of food outlets. The room was clean, with a firm bed and one chair near a desk. This is great if you were single but as a couple, one of us had to enjoy a meal sitting on the bed. The microwave, fridge and coffee / tea maker were appreciated as no breakfast was available. Free coffee and tea sachets were provided. There were however no plates or bowls so eating-in was difficult. To travel downtown, take either the mono-rail or bus. The bus on First Ave was very convenient and cheap. We used the free bus service in town to see the various places of interets. Tip: Buy food and drinks at the Safeways supermarket and save yourself a packet. They had lovely hot dishes and salads and you were allowed to use their cafe section to eat your pre paid food, purchased in the supermarket.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were looking for a hotel near the city center that wouldn't break the bank, yet keep us close to the attractions of the downtown area. The Med fits the bill for those who don't mind a bit of a walk - though the walk itself is through nice downtown areas with plenty of shops and restaraunts. If you don't feel like making the mile or so trek back after a night on the town, a cab ride from Pike's Market area is less than $10 (and worth it if it is raining). The staff was friendly, and there is a Starbucks inside the main level. While you won't get wireless internet in the rooms, there are two terminals located in the lobby, and a business center with three more computers and printers on the main floor as well. The workout room was unimpressive, but if you are hard-core you will probably prefer to run along the waterfront anyway. All and all a good choice for younger travelers or those who don't mind a quick cab ride to save some coin on the hotel room price.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This hotel is such a cutie. It's located in the quiet residential Queen Anne Ave area and is within a walking distance to Seattle Centre and the waterfront. It's got the most amazing rooftop, from where you can see the city and the Seattle tower anytime of the day or night. The night views are quite spectacular, as well as sunsets and sunrises. So, if you stay there you must check out the rooftop. The rooms are decorated in the Mediterranean style and the bed is extremely comfortable. The service at the front desk is also great. Everyone we talked to was very positive and helpful. I heard that some rooms can be quiet noisy. So, if you are after peace and quiet ask for a room facing the courtyard instead of the street. Sure, you won't get any views but you are guaranteed to get the best night sleep. There is free internet in the lobby, but we were really surprised that this hotel doesn't offer free Wi-Fi in rooms. If it did I would give it even higher rating.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Hotel was in walking distance of the Space Needle, EMP and you can take a bus to anywhere else you want to go downtown. Easy Street Records and Mercer Book store a must. Affordable good food within a couple of blocks and nice roof top view. Mecca Cafe and Floyd's Place good local bars. Glad Starbucks was attached to the hotel, even though there was Starbucks coffee in the room. The room itself was very small. I reserved a queen bed via Expedia but only a full bed in the room. No big deal, except the one window looked out to the other side of the hotel. I at least thought my room would have a view of the street or something. Nope - you look out your window into someone else's room. Standard toiletries could use updating. Beds were standard - no frills with comfort or style. Walls and doors to rooms are very thin. You can hear every door shut down the hall. There are two elevators but both are very slow. We ended up taking the stairs to the 5th floor more often than the elevator.</p></li>

The room was well lit, decorated and equip with everything we needed for our stay and more, the free Starbucks coffee was a lovely Seattle touch and the microwave and refrigeration facilities we requested were very useful, although somewhat unnecessary as Seattleâ€™s fresh flavours shouldnâ€™t be missed for a microwave mealâ€¦ no matter how tight your travel budget. The location is fantastic, everything we wanted to see was commutable by foot or public transport (very near the monorail). As a side issue Iâ€™d also seriously recommend visitors buy the Seattle frommers guide for the walking tours of the city and surrounding neighbourhoods, theyâ€™re fantastically informative and funâ€¦ and with a landmark like that space needle as a reference point you need not worry about getting lost :) Enjoy this beautiful city and hotel I wish to visit again very soon.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">A nice hotel very convenient to the sights and in a great neighborhood with a lot of interesting restaurants just a block or two away. Had a comfortable room with a handy fridge and big flat screen TV. A not so nice view of the building next door from our room but the view from the rooftop patio was superb. You would think a rooftop patio would be easy to find but there is no signage directing you to the correct stairwell. You might want to call the hotel directly to find the best rate. They beat any rate I found on the web and even better then their own website. Only problem I had was with one of the front desk guys. At check in when I told him we were checking in and gave him my last name his response was, "credit card and picture ID". That's it. Not a welcome to our Inn, not a thank you Mr ____ for chosing us, just a quick "credit card and picture ID". Do these people know how many choices we have in hotels? Front desk personal need a refesher in customer service. In spite of that guy i would still stay again.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I was impressed by the quality of this hotel. The rooms were nicely remodeled and were very comfortable. The rooftop deck is fantastic and provides wonderful views of the downtown, waterfront and harbor. Sunsets and night are gorgeous. We walked to most waterfront and Seattle Center attractions, but we figured it was about 2 miles from the hotel to the south end of the waterfront attractions. It was very comfortable for us as active people, but otherwise might be a bit far. Downsides to the hotel are difficult first entry. There is no parking or pull out of any kind, so you kind of wander the local one-way streets until you can find a place to park so you can register. Then the parking beneath the hotel is great for small cars, but at $15 per day is a little pricey. A wonderful choice of restaurants are in very close walking distance. The staff accomodated all of our needs but were a little bit cold. Overall we thought the Mediterranean Inn was a wonderful value in the super hip neighborhood of Queen Ann, Seattle.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stopped here for 2 nights during a 2-week road trip. The hotel was easy enough to find (once you find the right exit off the I5)! It's very easy walking distance to Seattle Centre, Key Arena, Music Museum and the monorail. It is quite far away from the market area, but the monorail is close and it will get you to the market area quite efficiently. Check-in was smooth enough and the front desk staff were well versed in the surrounding area and the tourist destinations. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. Our room looked onto/into the neighbouring building and there was a loud exhaust in the alley below. Thankfully it shut off by the time we went to bed, then it was very quiet with zero street noise. The only on site eating establishment is the obligatory Seattle Starbucks. If you want a nightcap, best to bring your own! The hotel charges this mandatory service fee which allows you access to a bike rental, in room popcorn, bottled water and some other amenities that I don't recall. Parking is $15 per day. We'd stay again.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Thanks TripAdvisor for all the reviews, you did not disappoint! My Wife and I stayed at the Mediterranean Inn last weekend and absolutely enjoyed our 3 night stay. The staff was very friendly, courteous and helpful. Our room was very clean, the bathroom was decent in size, the bed was very comfortable, the mini fridge and microwave were very handy and the complimentary popcorn and bottled waters were great little perks (which were replenished daily) We had an amazing view of the Space Needle to our left and the Sound to the right! The view from the rooftop was absolutely breath-taking a must see! Very close to Downtown Centre. The Space Needle, Science Centre, EMP and Key Arena are a few minutes walk away! A variety of restaurants within walking distance as well. Close enough but still far enough away from the noise of the downtown core! We willl definately stay at The Mediterranean any time we visit Seattle and will recommend it to our family and friends!!!! When in Seattle check out the Mediterranean Inn you will not be disappointed!</p></li>

<li><b>Title:</b> “Basic hotel in great Seattle Center/Queen Anne location”</li>
<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I recommend my visitors stay in this hotel when they visit me in Seattle because it is cheap and in a great location near the Space Needle and waterfront. It is definitely basic/no frills, so if you're looking for something really nice, I wouldn't recommend it. But if you don't plan to spend a lot of time in the room this place is perfect. The rooms and bathroom are very large and very clean, but the beds are a little hard and the bedspreads are thin and nothing special. The common areas are nice and clean and the receptionists always friendly and helpful. The great thing about this place is that it is literally in the shadow of the Space Needle and a few blocks from the Olympic Sculpture Park. It is about a mile from downtown shopping and Pike's Place Market. It is located in Queen Anne, which is a very cute neighborhood area just north of downtown. I would highly recommend Peso's Mexican Kitchen for a late night drink or dinner, and they have amazing breakfast (best in town). You should also visit the top of Queen Anne and browse the shops there.</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here one night on our way back home, as it was near our son. The rooms were amazingly good and clean, I liked the ambience of the hotel and the location would be superb for exploring the city center on foot, which we were not doing on this trip. I had no issue with $15/day for the parking and the views from the deck were photo-worthy. OMG on the views from the rooftop deck at sunset. I only have two significant negatives about this place. First, the kids at the front desk have absolutely no customer service skills or respect for customers, particularly those not their own age. They are dismissive and unhelpful. Second, we stayed on a very hot night- the rooms have no A/C, meaning you leave the windows open. The noise and lights from Queen Anne Ave kept us from sleeping (It is noisy and there is no way around it), so make sure if you are sensitive to that you don't get a room with the windows opening to Queen Anne Ave. Would I stay there again, yes, with reservations - they just need to fire the kids at the front desk and don't get a room facing Queen Anne Ave.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This was a fantastic hotel for so many reasons. When I first arrived the room had an odd smell, so the staff pleasantly changed me to another room without question. The room was clean and everything was in excellent condition. You can also access the rooftop which is a great way to eat dinner and watch the sunset. The hotel also has an excellent business centre (use is free!) with high spec computers with colour laser printer, cd burners, internet access etc. There is also a coin operated laundary and gym! Local calls are also free. Located only about 2 blocks from Seattle Centre it was ideal and in a great neighbourhood (better than downtown!). And don't worry about catching the bus downtown, just walk 5 minutes and get the monorail! It is fabulous and really quick. Tip: Ask for a room not on the first or second floor. The first floor is road level and second floor (the rooms on the inner court yeard side) face directly into a court yard which makes is pretty public. If you are going to Seattle and don't mind staying out of downtown (only just!) stay at the Med. It is fantastic.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed at the Mediterranean Inn for three nights. Our room was on the sixth floor, it had a great view of Elliot Bay and downtown. Yes, our room had air conditioning, though weather was great and we did not use it. Nice touches to the room included bottled waters in the refrigerator, and a pack of microwave popcorn. The business center and lobby have free internet access, which came in quite handy to check in for our flights prior to going to the airport. They also have a nice laundry area, fitness room and the rooftop deck which offers a great view! If you are hungry there are many restaurants nearby, grocery and drugstore if you forget something-open 24 hours. Also a short walk to Seattle Center, the Monorail is open, $4.00 roundtrip ride to downtown. Waterfront area is a little longer, but you can catch the free route 99 bus at Pier 70 which makes many stops along the waterfront and Pioneer Square/Chinatown. You can walk a few long blocks from Pioneer Square area to take in a tour of Safeco Field or Qwest Field on non-game days. We really enjoyed our stay at the Mediterranean Inn and would stay here again!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 5 nights at the end of June. Double room was spacious and the kitchenette was a big bonus with fridge and micowave. Decor was not new, but was really clean. Free internet in the lobby was a big bonus, and the hotel has an internal door linking thru to the next door Starbucks which is handy for breakfast. Staff all pleasant and helpful. Great location for Seattle Centre, Space Needle, Key Arena etc. Handful of nice bars and restaurants close to the hotel, and generally a nice neighbourhood - try 5 Spot at the top of Queen Ann for a great meal if you can manage the walk up the very steep hill! Supermarket and 24 hour drugstore also 1 block away. At least 20 to 25 minute walk from downtown - this is ok in good weather, but worth being aware of. The monorail goes from Seattle Centre to downtown, and should be an excellent way of easily and cheaply getting downtown - but it was undergoing repairs for the whole of our stay and was out of action so beware! Taxi to the edge of downtown only about $7-8 + tip. Overall, if you are happy to stay slightly out of downtown then this is a good affordable choice.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed at the Mediterranean Inn for 4 nights in early December. The hotel met all of my needs and was an excellent value. Location is excellent if you want to be in Lower Queen Anne, and just a short walk from Seattle Center (Space Needle, Experience Music Project, etc). Within 1-2 blocks there were excellent coffeeshops, a variety of food options, a great independent record store, a post office and bank/atm. Buses downtown are also easily accessible, and it's even walkable on a nice day. The room was nice enough - not overly large, but fine for me. Flat-screen TV, desk, fairly comfortable bed, large bathroom. Internet access cost $5/day or $15/week (i think) and wireless was weak, but they also provided an ethernet cord. Kitchenette had a mini-fridge, microwave and sink which was useful. Front desk staff was friendly and accommodating - they helped call cabs, stored our bags in a locked room before our late-night flight, etc. Overall no complaints - nothing over the top, but got the job done and was a pleasant stay. If you're looking to stay in Lower Queen Anne I can't imagine a better option that the Mediterranean Inn.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were planning to spend 4 days in Seattle and pre-booked this hotel hrough Expedia. We booked a room with a kitchenette and when we arrived we disordered the following things: - We received a room with a window to the inner yard. When we asked to switch, we were told that reservations made with Expedia are not treated the same and we can't switch to a room with a window to the front. When we spoke to Expedia, we were told that they are not aware of such treatment and it's not a part of their agreement with the hotel. I can't tell who is to blame here, but the bottom line is: if you choose to stay in this hotel - make the reservation directly. - Kitchenette: The kitchenette included a sink, a mini fridge and a microwave. It did not include any kitchenware such as glasses, plates, knifes and forks and didn't include any kind of stove. How will you eat your microwaved dinner? - with some plastic plates you'll buy yourself I guess... - The internet was not free (this is common in large cities) and costs and additional $5 a day. There is not wifi internet and you have to use a cable. Overall, we don't think that the $130 rate provides good value.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Best kept secret in Seattle! What a pleasant surprise, I was looking for something on a budget that had a great location near to city center, with a secure parking garage, a business center, gym and located in a safe area. Bingo! It's no frills, but very comfortable and charming with a European flare. The rooms were well equipped with kitchenettes, coffee maker, fridge with complementary bottled water, microwave w/ popcorn. House keeping did a great job. Staff was helpful, the business center was the best I've seen-complementary (several HP computers with internet access, printers, fax, copiers- no waiting.There's a great roof top deck with a panorama view of Elliott Bay and down town Seattle- one of the only hotels in Seattle to have one. Great location! The Mediterranean Inn is just a short 5-10 minute walk to Seattle Center (Space Needle, monorail, museums etc.) It's in a cute part of town with an abundance of cafe's, bistros and shopping nearby, plus there's a Starbucks adjacent to the hotel lobby. I booked with Travelocity for $70. per night, which was quite a bit less than booking with the hotel directly. Great value! I'll be back and recommend to others.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great hotel and offers terrific value for money. It is in a lovely location and is a safe neighbourhood. We found the staff to be extremely friendly and helpful throughout our stay in the city. I loved the room. It was clean, spacious and comfortable. Our room overlooked the inner courtyard which didn't bother us at all for 2 reasons. 1.) There is no noise when you are trying to sleep. 2.) The view from the rooftop terrace is magnificant so that's where you go for the great view, not looking out your window! There is a starbucks attached to the hotel which was great. We enjoyed buying our breakfast there and then taking it up to the rooftop to eat it there and relax and enjoy the view. Be sure to walk up the hill to get to Kerry Park on Queen Anne Hill - stunning views there too. In the reception area there is a couple of computers with internet access which are free to use for guests. There is no in room safe however there are safety deposit boxes to use at reception. Some great places to eat round about the hotel. Easy to get downtown with buses right outside the hotel, or walk to the space needle to get on the monorail or even just walk the whole way. Next time I'm in Seattle this is where I'll be staying!</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Okay, we kind of liked it but mainly for its location. We stayed for a long weekend and returned for another five days after we got back from Bellingham. The first stay had us on a warm evening in a third floor room with windows open right on the main drag and it is a heck of a noisy avenue with trucks and cars roaring by and coming off the stop light right outside the window. Reminded me of living in Manhattan on East 72nd. The return five days we insisted on a back room somewhere off the street and that is when things were much nicer and they accomodated us.

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">While I had a lovely, comfortable room, and the hotel staff was great, I have a major complaint that has made me decide to caution others to think twice before choosing to stay anywhere in this area. I parked directly in front of the hotel door, while "checking-in". I was not in the hotel lobby for more than 5 minutes as everything was prepared and ready for my arrival. Upon returning to my car, I had already received a parking ticket. Apparently, you must pay to park while checking in. I still have no idea who I was to pay, how much or where I was to pay. There are no signs. I think this is un-fair to guests. I understood upon arrival that I would have to pay to park in the hotel garage and was prepared to do so. I was not aware that I would be required to pay for the privilege of checking in. I paid the parking ticket within 2 weeks, but then received a letter from the City of Seattle that I had not paid on time. I sent a copy of my canceled check and assumed the matter was closed. Now, 6 months later, I received notice that I not only owe the ticket, (paid) but late fees and collection costs for an additional $45.00. I am furious and feel quite victimized by the city of Seattle. I therefore, cannot recommend this hotel. Stay at your own risk. I have suggested to the hotel, that they place signage letting guests know what to expect. There was none when I arrived.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">The Mediterranean Inn was cute, quaint and small. The rooms were smaller than your average hotels but considering that it was an Inn made it more quaint. It is in the Queen Anne neighborhood and wasn't VERY close to downtown but close enough. You could walk there if you please, it's about a good 1.2 miles. PROS: Good neighborhood, lots of good eats - Dick's is very close by. They have very good ice creams! There is a Safeway around the corner so you can get all your essentials you need. There are also something like CVS and another supermarket. There are a row of restaurants near the hotel, namely a place called 5 Spot up the road. It is a HELL of a walk, so you may need to take the bus bc it is uphill. They serve breakfast and is very nice :) Seattle Space Needle is walking distance. CONS: Not very close to Downtown, you would have to take public transportation. BUT, they are very close to the bus stop and almost every bus goes downtown so thats a plus. Bus fare is $1.75 and you get like 4 hrs or so to transfer and things. Its VERY convenient! =D Most buses downtown are FREE as well so go crazy haha Hotel also has a small kitchenette. Microwave, sink, cups, popcorn, starbucks coffee, and water bottles :) No AC in the hotel. However, being that it's Seattle, you don't really need the AC on most of the time. The weather is very cool, and if you leave your windows open, you will feel the coldness in the air.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We stayed here for 6 nights in Nov 07. First night was a bit rough, we had asked for a room with a view of the Space needle, which is exactly what we got. It was a nice room on the sixth (top) floor, room 632. However, the hotel has a bathroom extraction system that is always on, as opposed to having a system that has a fan on a timer in each individual room. Unfortunately the motor/unit for this entire system appears to be directly above this room, mounted on the roof. As a result we found it almost impossible to sleep! This issue was resolved the next day with a transfer to another room on the fifth floor on the other side of the hotel, sadly minus the view of the needle but they did give us a discount for the inconvienience, problem solved! The hotel is lovely, nice and clean, very helpful staff and we would certainly stay here again as well as recommend it to others! The real benefit of this hotel is the fantastic location!!! There are plenty of shops/supermarkets for any of your food/beer requirements (each room has its own little kitchenette/bar!) and tons of places to eat, drink, breakfast etc etc. The hotel is also directly next to the Seattle Centre (Key Arena, Space Needle, museum's, theatre etc) and also on a main bus route to get directly into downtown Seattle if you don't fancy the walk. Good choice of hotel!! Good choice of city to stay in, Seattle was a great, safe place to vacation in, lots to do!!</p></li>

<li><b>Rating:</b> 3.0</li>
<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We found their price reasonable compared to many others in Seattle during the time we were travelling. We found cheaper prices for their rooms on a travel site than on their own site - I called and received an additional discount by booking directly over the phone. Their price does not include a resort fee of around $8/day at the time of this posting. The rooms were adequate - partially upgraded with granite counters, but older comforters and a shower so weak it was like a garden gnome spitting on you (the sole reason why I have rated this hotel as average). The rooftop deck was worth it all, with beautiful views. A Starbucks is connected to the hotel (great for morning coffee on the rooftop deck) and there are many good restaurants and bars within walking distance. There is a grocery store about 1 block away and rooms come with refrigerators and coffee makers. Taxi's are reasonable into downtown and Pike Place, if you don't want to walk the roughly 2.5 miles or so. The space needle is walking distance as well, maybe 1 mile. The area is in transition, so there are some vagrants on the streets, which were not a clean as I imagined Seattle - though this is no reflection on the hotel. Staff was friendly. Free internet in the lobby and free printing as well (because you already paid the resort fee). A small workout room is available and I believe they have parking, though I do not know if that is for an additional charge.</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Whether you are a tourist or a local, this hotel is a great find. The location couldn't be better for exploring the Queen Anne neighborhood, attending an event at Seattle Center or Key Arena, or experiencing Seattle itself. The hotel itself is small and prices are very reasonable (book with the hotel directly, as they will meet or beat what's listed on hotels.com or other booking sites). We paid $109 per night for a king room on the top floor, which is very reasonable for downtown Seattle. The hotel also offers weekly and monthly rates for those needing extended stays. The hotel is decorated simply, is extremely clean, and very festive for the holidays. Parking is an extra $15/day (unlimited in and out privileges) in a secure underground garage. The rooms have a kitchenette with a microwave, 'fridge, and a sink. The beds are comfy, even if the decorating scheme is not very earth-shattering. The bathrooms are neat, clean and have a shower/tub combo and adequate counter/sink space. The hotel is on several major bus routes to both the top of Queen Anne and to the center of downtown. Plus, there are several grocery stores (Safeway and Metropolitan Market), pubs, restaurants, and shops in the immediate vicinity. The front desk personnel were always friendly and willing to provide information, bus schedules, etc. I would highly recommend this hotel for those new to Seattle or those who just want an inexpensive weekend break in the city.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">Having grown up in Seattle, whenever I return each summer, I'm eager to maximize my love for the city. I don't want to spend a huge amount of time in my room, but I want it to provide a good frame for the place I am in. It's hard for chain hotels to provide this local frame. The Mediterranean Inn does this, largely because of its understated charm and its location. The room was super clean, and our king size bed was comfortable. Our room on the 9th floor had air-conditioning, which wasn't necessary, but it was nice to have the room temp perfectly regulated throughout the night. No complimentary breakfast here, or even a dining room. There is a very nice, large Starbucks with plenty of seating for breakfast, in the lobby of the hotel, and there are plenty of restaurants within a block of the hotel. You can use the hotels free bikes if you so desire (it'll take you 15 minutes or less to cycle to Pike Place Market), and they have a terrific workout room (or so my wife tells me). Parking is expensive ($15 a day), but we found street parking down on 2nd and Republican (a couple blocks away), which is free from 6pm-9am, and cheap two hour metered parking is plentiful after that. Some great restaurants are within a block (Toulouse Petite, Pesos, Pagliaci Pizza, Roti Indian, and Dick's!). Don't forget to take a glass of wine up to the rooftop to take in the view of the Emerald City. In short, this hotel provides a good frame for enjoying beautiful Seattle.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">This is a great, well-equipped place for a business or leisure visit, with a remarkable rate (about $70) found through web travel sites. The Queene Anne location is super convenient to activities in all key areas: downtown (Pike Place and financial district just a few minutes drive), Seattle Center and cool local neighborhood restaurant scene (walking distance), Lake Union airport for seaplane tours (less than 10 minutes), just across bridge from Bellevue (easy freeway access avoiding downtown traffic.) Much better price and nicer atmosphere than a downtown hotel without sacrificing anything. The hotel was clean, fresh, spacious, well maintained in every regard. The staff was welcoming and eager to help at all times. Particularly notable touches: - room has half size refrigerator, microwave, coffee machine, and grocery store is right across the street, as well as a dozen restaurants within 2 blocks - flat screen TV also has DVD/CD player - good bedding, lots of pillow choices - parking is secure wtih mesh garage door ($15/day), easy elevator access to rooms; - using internet in room is just $5/day - can use either WiFi or they will lend you an ethernet cord - 2 free terminals in lobby and FREE printing of boarding passes etc. - roomy FREE use of office center with another 3 terminals, free printing - Starbucks is adjacent to lobby and that has free WiFi too - free 24 hour exercise facility - room had all other amenities: iron/board, toiletries, hairdryer, etc. This was a great find, no complaints at all.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">We were looking for a place to stay in Seattle that wouldn't break the bank but was centrally located (and not a hole in the wall). I happened to stumble upon a very competitive rate for this hotel through my credit card travel provider. Overall, I'd say the hotel was fairly nice. The rooms have a mini-kitchen in them (microwave, bar-fridge, coffee maker) and they provide you with free Starbucks packages (to make in the provided coffee maker) and microwavable popcorn. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was quite nice as well. The hotel's location is also quite good. There are quite a few restaurants nearby (including a Thai place that was incredible - and apparently ranked as one of the top-100 in the United States). It is a short walk to the Seattle Center, where you'll find the Space Needle, science center, Sci-fi / music museum, and the monorail to the city-center. Overall, very convenient location, which allowed us to leave our car in the parkade and simply walk (or monorail) to most destinations. There is also a Safeway right across the street which is nice for picking up breakfast/lunch food. The only downsides were: 1) Pricey parking - this appears to be typical of most inner-city Seattle hotels, but still can't say I was thrilled with the somewhat expensive daily parking rate 2) Not all rooms have A/C - I paid extra money to "upgrade" to a room with an air conditioner (which was somewhat noisy, but kept the room cool). While I would recommend getting a room with A/C in the summer, it's not great that you have to pay extra for it.</p></li>

<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">My husband and I stayed at the Mediterranean Inn in mid-May for 4 nights for an anniversary. We were very pleased with it. After reading all the reviews, we knew what to expect - nothing fancy, but clean, safe and in a great location. We were there during that heat wave, and temps were reaching the 80s, but we were out most of the day seeing the sights, so had no need to the A/C. Our room only had a ceiling fan, which was sufficient enough while we were sleeping. The only thing was when we slept with the windows open for some air circuation, we could hear our neighbors across the courtyard chatting. Nothing very loud at all and I just put in some ear plugs. Perhaps if we had gotten a room facing the other way, we would have been faced with street noise too. The front desk staff was helpful, one guy told us to get breakfast at the Mecca Cafe right down the street in Queen Anne - yum! We also liked how the business center offered free printing - great for planning out bus trips and printing out routes. We did plenting of busing and walking during our trip to Seattle. The hotel is conveniently located along major buslines going downtown and also lines to Ballard, Green lake, etc. Loved that it is walking distance to the Seattle center - we walked there every day. The bathroom looked like it had new fixtures and was very clean. I didn't mind that it was basic, cleanliness is the most important thing to me; no mold or anything to be found in the bathroom. We loved having the kitchennette w/ fridge and microwave and coffeepot. Nice to have Starbucks downstairs and Safeway across the street as well. Nice little hotel!</p></li>

<li><b>Review Text:</b></br>
<p style="border:3px; padding:5px; border-style:solid;">I stayed here for 4 nights and I loved this little hotel. The room was clean and there was a kitchenette. The staff was very helpful, they kept our luggage for us because we got there way before the check in time. They put tags on our luggage and placed them in the back room. There were 2 computers w/ internet on the lobby, a gym and not to mention the starbucks downstairs. The bus stops are a block away which takes you to Downtown Seattle and Pioneer Square for $1.25 and it runs late. Downtown Seattle also has a ride free zone so you can pretty much go around Downtown Seattle for free and you don't have to worry about parking. There are a couple of good places to eat and shop near the hotel - check out Pagliacci's (awesome salad) and Underdawg Records (awesome music collection & the owner was very friendly and helpful). The Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP, Pacific Science Center, Children's Museum) is about 2 blocks away. There's a Safeway and a 24 hour neighborhood grocery store around the corner. Do not miss the rooftop deck - it has an awesome view of Downtown Seattle, Queen Anne Hill, Elliot Bay & the Space Needle. You can also walk if you're comfortable walking about a mile or more. We walked from the Bellmont District to our hotel and it was not that bad. To get to and from the airport, call the hotel for a car service (Mr. Maru $35.00) - if you take a cab, it will cost you the same, if not more. The car was roomy and clean, and he avoided the traffic by going on the side streets - imagine if you're taking a cab and how much this would have cost you. The driver was very friendly and very professional. If you must take a cab - take the yellow or orange cabs. I will definitely stay here again and will recommend this hotel to anyone.</p></li>
