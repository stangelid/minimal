I'm a PhD student at the [Institute for Language, Computation and Cognition](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/), [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/), working under the supervision of Prof. [Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/).

My research focuses on neural models for document representation with applications on sentiment analysis, summarization and information retrieval.

Before my PhD, I obtained an MSc in Artificial Intelligence with distinction from the University of Edinburgh. My MSc Thesis was supervised by Prof. [Victor Lavrenko](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/vlavrenk/). Previously, I acquired my undergraduate degree on Informatics and Telecommunucations from the National and Kapodestrian University of Athens.
